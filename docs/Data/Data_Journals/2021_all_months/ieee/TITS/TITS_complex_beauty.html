  abstract     = {This article addresses the speed-distance trajectory tracking control problem for railway trains to facilitate the effectuation of automation train operation (ATO). By proposing a new virtual parameter learning-based approach, we develop an adaptive control that exhibits twofold new features with comparison to the existing literatures: i) , while the nonlinear operational resistance and railway line gradient profile are unknown, the proposed control not only bears a quite computationally inexpensive simplicity in structure but also achieves accurate tracking control with respect to the speed-distance trajectory benefiting by the virtual parameter learning approach and requiring no function approximators with linearized structure, for example, common utilization of neural or fuzzy approximations, to cope with the uncertain dynamic nonlinearities in real-time, and ii) , by introducing a nonlinear error transformation, the protection enveloping problem, which is generally introduced by the onboard automatic train protection and wayside subsystems, operating independently from the ATO subsystem in practice, are considered explicitly to the control design for ATO for the first time. By invoking Lyapunov stability theorem, the resulting closed-loop system is guaranteed to be globally stable with rigorously analysis and proof. Meanwhile, in order to verify and validate the effectiveness and advantages of theoretical findings, experimental and comparative results, by applying the designed controller to the whole Beijing railway Yizhuang line, are shown.},

  abstract     = {Significant development of ride-sharing services presents a plethora of opportunities to transform urban mobility by providing personalized and convenient transportation while ensuring the efficiency of large-scale ride pooling. However, a core problem for such services is route planning for each driver to fulfill the dynamically arriving requests while satisfying given constraints. Current models are mostly limited to static routes with only two rides per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics) (Alonso-Mora et al. , 2017), at least in the initial allocation while not ascertaining that opposite-direction rides are not grouped together. In this paper, we present a dynamic, demand aware, and pricing-based vehicle-passenger matching and route planning framework that (1) dynamically generates optimal routes for each vehicle based on online demand, pricing associated with each ride, vehicle capacities and locations. This matching algorithm starts greedily and optimizes over time using an insertion operation, (2) involves drivers in the decision-making process by allowing them to propose a different price based on the expected reward for a particular ride as well as the destination locations for future rides, which is influenced by supply-and-demand computed by the Deep Q-network. (3) allows customers to accept or reject rides based on their set of preferences with respect to pricing and delay windows, vehicle type and carpooling preferences. These (1-3) in tandem with each other enforce grouping rides with the most route-intersections together. (4) Based on demand prediction, our approach re-balances idle vehicles by dispatching them to the areas of anticipated high demand using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our framework is validated using millions of trips extracted from the New York City Taxi public dataset; however, we consider different vehicle types and designed customer utility functions to validate the setup and study different settings. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in real-time and large scale settings.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous ships are promoted as the future of the maritime transport industry aiming to overcome conventional vessels in terms of performance, safety and environmental impact. Yet their tangled cyber-physical-social interactions and new emerging properties induce questions regarding their liability and trustworthiness. Digital simulations and sea trials are launched to assure the safety requirements and social expectations are met a priori. This paper presents the design of realistic testbed scenarios from huge historical data through a high-performance computational method to recommend a complete set of navigation scenarios for autonomy tests. The developed approach integrates traffic big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) with high-resolution digital maps, vessel information registry, and digital nautical charts. All historical vessel-to-ground and vessel-to-vessel interactions are efficiently analyzed through a hierarchical method for collision and grounding conflicts assessment with a 15-minutes prediction horizon. Relative risk is evaluated accurately over full periods of predicted close-quarters situations subject to physical limits and sea-room availability for evasive maneuverers under COLREG rules and traffic separation schemes. Spatial dependencies among multiple conflicts define risky momentary traffic situations modelled through directed graph representation of nested interactions. Their temporal dependencies describe navigation scenarios through dynamic co-behaviors between multiple participating vessels over a period of time. Finally, we analyze negative/positive actions that increase/decrease the complexity. The presented algorithms are computationally very efficient, they scale to several (country*year)s where millions of scenarios are extracted, classified, and scored by their relative risk, complexity, and likelihood for firm post-test conclusions.},

Within the framework, we focus on characterizing the variation in system dynamics with a time-varying vector autoregressive model. We impose a low-rank tensor structure to model the collection of time-varying system matrices. As the temporal factor matrix captures the principal patterns/signatures across all time-varying system matrices, it is a useful tool to diagnose abnormal generative mechanisms and unexpected temporal patterns. We demonstrate the proposed tensor learning framework’s effectiveness by experimenting with a synthetic data set and real-world spatiotemporal traffic speed data set.

Graph-based neural networks have been widely used in traffic flow prediction problems. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) captures spatial features according to established connections but ignores the high-order relationships between stations and the travel patterns of passengers. In this paper, we utilize a novel representation to tackle this issue - hypergraph. A dynamic spatio-temporal hypergraph neural network to forecast passenger flow is proposed. In the prediction framework, the primary hypergraph is constructed from metro system topology and then extended with advanced hyperedges discovered from pedestrian travel patterns of multiple time spans. Furthermore, hypergraph convolution and spatio-temporal blocks are proposed to extract spatial and temporal features to achieve node-level prediction. Experiments on historical datasets of Beijing and Hangzhou validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and superior performance of prediction accuracy is achieved compared with the state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Extensibility is an important optimization objective for the E/E architecture of automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPS), while little attention has paid to the extensibility-aware design of in-vehicle network. To address this problem, this paper formulates a trade-off problem that balances the bandwidth utilization and the extensibility from the initial design of CAN FD. We firstly propose a new extensibility model and the related evaluation metric, and then two optimization algorithms, namely, the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach and the simulated annealing (SA) based heuristic approach, are proposed to resolve the trade-off problem for mid-sized and industry sized signal sets, respectively. The experiment results show the efficiency of the proposed extensibility metric and the optimization algorithms. By comparing with state-of-the-art algorithm, the MILP reduces the increase range of the bandwidth utilization of the extended signal set by 18.17% to 57.64% averagely, and 49.22% to 89.40% maximally, with only 0.06% to 0.79% bandwidth utilization overhead; the SA approach can reduces the increase range of the bandwidth utilization of the extended signal set by 12.71% to 58.33% averagely, and 40.08% to 89.40% maximally, with only 0.06% to 0.8% bandwidth utilization overhead.},

  abstract     = {A novel distributed cooperative formation control method inspired by the aggregate behaviors of fish groups is proposed for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) formation. Firstly, a hierarchical control architecture is established for formation keeping with fuel consumption (FC) optimization simultaneously. The top layer is to generate a leader with the optimal performance based on the nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) technique. A fish swarm optimization (FSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the nonlinear MPC problem by imitating the predation behaviors of the fish swarm. The middle layer is a decentralized intelligent cruise control (ICC) for follower vehicles to track their leader imitated the behaviors of fish swarm, and some design criteria are presented based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The under layer is to achieve a satisfying performance for the hybrid powertrain systems of followers. Finally, the bio-inspired method applied for PHEV formation is verified with a satisfying robustness, fuel economy, car-following and also real-time processing performances. According to the results, the PHEV formation using the proposed method represents a better car-following performance compared with the normal adaptive cruise control (ACC) method and a 21.26% improvement of FC compared with the rule-based energy management strategy (EMS). The computational burden is also reduced by the bio-inspired method.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to leverage the advances of connected automated vehicle (CAV) technology to design an eco-driving and platooning system that can improve both fuel and operational efficiency of vehicles on the freeways. The proposed algorithm optimizes CAVs’ trajectories with three objectives, including travel time minimization, fuel consumption minimization, and traffic safety improvement, following a two-stage control logic. The first stage, designed for CAV trajectory planning, is carried out with two optimization models. The first model functions to predict the freeway traffic states in the near future and accordingly optimize CAVs’ desired speed profile to minimize total freeway travel time. Notably, the interactions between CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) are described in the embedded traffic flow model and the optimization can fully account for CAVs’ impact to HVs’ speeds. Then grounded on the obtained speed profile, the second eco-driving model would further update it so as to platoon CAVs and minimize their fuel consumption. The second stage, for real-time control purpose, is developed to ensure the operational safety of CAVs. Particularly, based on the speed profile from the first stage, real-time adaptions would be placed on CAVs to dynamically adjust speeds, in response to local driving conditions. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, this study selects a freeway segment of I-15 in Salt Lake City as the study site. The extensive numerical simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both mitigating freeway congestion and reducing vehicles’ fuel consumption.},

This paper presents an “indirect shared control” framework for steer-by-wire vehicles, which allows the control authority to be continuously shared between the driver and automation through an weighted-input-summation method. A “best-response” driver steering model based on model predictive control (MPC) for indirect shared control is proposed. Unlike any conventional driver model for manual driving, this model assumes that drivers can learn and incorporate the controller strategy into their internal model for predictive path following. The analytic solution to the driver model is provided to enable off-line simulations. A driving-simulator experiment was conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the indirect shared control system in a highway lane-keeping task. The result showed that the proposed indirect shared control method was effective to improve the subjects’ lane-keeping performance and reduce steering control effort. The proposed driver steering model was also validated by the experiment data, which produced a smaller prediction error than the conventional MPC driver model.},

Electric Bicycles can offer an alternative to traditional modes of transport and support an environmentally friendly way to navigate an urban environment, with the benefit of encouraging physical exercise. There are still several issues that constrain a large-scale acceptance of Electric Bicycles, including the need for personalised controller strategies and the energy efficiencies. Current strategies do not include any analysis of rider’s capabilities, physiological factors or pedalling techniques. The research outlined in this paper involved 30 participants that volunteered to take part in an Incremental Sub-Maximal Ramp Test with the aim of understanding and quantifying pedalling characteristics and demonstrating that a better motor controller strategy tailored towards individual requirements is possible. Gender and Cycling Experience were the most prominent factors that differentiate the capabilities of the population. Three novel controller techniques (i.e. Fixed Percentage , Torque Filling and Real-Time Power mapping ) are analysed and presented as innovative methods for next generation personalised controller strategies for Electric Bicycles.},

  abstract     = {Routing delivery vehicles to serve customers in dynamic and uncertain environments like dense city centers is a challenging task that requires robustness and flexibility. Most existing approaches to routing problems produce solutions offline in the form of plans, which only apply to the situation they have been optimized for. Instead, we propose to learn a policy that provides decision rules to build the routes from online measurements of the environment state, including the customers configuration itself. Doing so, we can generalize from past experiences and quickly provide decision rules for new instances of the problem without re-optimizing any parameters of our policy. The difficulty with this approach comes from the complexity to represent this state. In this paper, we introduce a sequential multi-agent decision-making model to formalize the description and the temporal evolution of a Dynamic and Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem. We propose a variation of Deep Neural Network using Attention Mechanisms to learn generalizable representation of the state and output online decision rules adapted to dynamic and stochastic information. Using artificially-generated data, we show promising results in these dynamic and stochastic environments, while staying competitive in deterministic ones compared to offline classical heuristics.},

The effectiveness of the proposed technique is analysed in two case studies on real road topographies.

  abstract     = {The low-speed high automation (LSHA) is foreseen as a development path for new types of mobility, improving road safety and addressing transit problems in urban infrastructures. As these automation approaches are still in the development phase, methods to improve their design and validation are required. The use of vehicle simulation models allows reducing significantly the time deployment on real test tracks, which would not consider all the scenarios or complexity related to automated driving features. However, to ensure safety and accuracy while evaluating the proper operation of LSHA features, adequate validation methodologies are mandatory. In this study a two-step validation methodology is proposed: Firstly, an open-loop test set attempts to tune the required vehicle simulation models using experimental data considering also the dynamics of the actuation devices required for vehicle automation. Secondly, a closed-loop test strives to validate the selected automated driving functionality based on test plans, also improving the vehicle dynamics response. To illustrate the methodology, a study case is proposed using an automated Renault Twizy. In the first step, the brake pedal and steering wheel actuators’ behavior is modeled, as well as its longitudinal dynamics and turning capacity. Then, in a second step, an LSHA functionality for Traffic Jam Assist based on a Model Predictive Control approach is evaluated and validated. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable not only to tune vehicle simulation models for automated driving development purposes but also to validate LSHA functionalities.},

  abstract     = {Uncoordinated charging of a rapidly growing number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the uncertainty associated with renewable energy resources may constitute a critical issue for the electric mobility (E-Mobility) in the transportation system especially during peak hours. To overcome this dire scenario, we introduce a stochastic game to study the complex interactions between the power grid and charging stations. In this context, existing studies have not taken into account the dynamics of customers’ preference on charging parameters. In reality, however, the choice of the charging parameters may vary over time, as the customers may change their charging preferences. We model this behavior of customers with another stochastic game. Moreover, we define a quality of service (QoS) index to reflect how the charging process influences customers’ choices on charging parameters. We also develop an online algorithm to reach the Nash equilibria for both stochastic games. Then, we utilize real data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms. The results reveal that the electricity cost with the proposed method can result in a saving of about 20% compared to the benchmark method, while also yielding a higher QoS in terms of charging and waiting time. Our results can be employed as guidelines for charging service providers to make efficient decisions under uncertainty relative to power generation of renewable energy.},

  abstract     = {Emerging automotive applications such as in-vehicle Augmented Reality (AR) and fully automated parking require a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle’s three-dimensional surrounding represented as an object-level environmental model. In this model, not only 3D poses (positions and orientations) and 3D sizes of detected objects are registered, but 3D shapes (geometries) need to be reconstructed precisely. A combination of 3D object detection and 3D surface reconstruction techniques, referred to as object-level 3D reconstruction , is fundamental to building such environmental models. However, the possibilities to incorporate object-level 3D reconstruction in a car have not been sufficiently explored either in academic research or in the industry. This primarily stems from the cost and resource constraints associated with the automotive domain. In this paper, we address these constraints by proposing implementations of in-vehicle object-level 3D reconstruction in two specific use cases: (i) augmented reality and (ii) automated parking. For augmented reality, we propose a cost-efficient solution called monocular 3D Shaping that requires only a single frame from a monocular camera as input. For automated parking, we propose a resource-efficient alternative that generates more precise 3D reconstruction results by taking advantage of additional 3D sensors (such as Lidars). The crux of our proposed approaches lies in the use of a Latent Shape Space , where various 3D shapes are represented using only two parameters. As a result, highly complex 3D shapes can now be transmitted using a low- to medium-bandwidth in-vehicle communication infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.},

  abstract     = {Gap selection and dynamic speed profiles of interacting vehicles at on-ramps affect the safety and efficiency of highway merging sections. This paper puts forward a hierarchical control approach for Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to achieve efficient and safe merging operations. A tactical layer controller employs a second-order car-following model with a cooperative merging mode to represent a cooperative merging process and generates an optimal vehicle merging sequence and time instants when on-ramp CAVs start to adapt their speeds and positions to prepare merging into the target gaps respectively. An operational layer controller is designed based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). It uses a third-order vehicle dynamics model and optimizes desired accelerations for CAVs and the time instants when the on-ramp CAVs initiate the lane-changing executions respectively. Both the tactical layer controller and operational layer controller derive their control commands by minimizing an objective function for different time horizons. The objective function penalizes deviations of CAVs’ inter-vehicle gaps to their desired values, relative speeds to their direct predecessors, and actual or desired accelerations, subject to constraints on velocities, actual or desired accelerations, and inter-vehicle gaps. The performance of the proposed hierarchical control framework and a benchmark on-ramp merging method using a first-in-first-out rule to determine the merging sequence is demonstrated under 135 scenarios with different initial conditions, desired time gap settings, and numbers of on-ramp vehicles. The experimental results show the superiority of the hierarchical control approach.},

Existing solutions often rely on vision-based methods or 3D LiDAR-based methods. These methods are either too expensive in both sensor pricing (3D LiDAR) and computation (camera and 3D LiDAR) or less robust in resisting harsh environment changes (camera). In this work, we revisit the LiDAR based approaches for vehicle detection with a less expensive 2D LiDAR by utilizing modern deep learning approaches. We aim at filling in the gap as few previous works conclude an efficient and robust vehicle detection solution in a deep learning way in 2D. To this end, we propose a learning based method with the input of pseudo-images, named Cascade Pyramid Region Proposal Convolution Neural Network (Cascade Pyramid RCNN), and a hybrid learning method with the input of sparse points, named Hybrid Resnet Lite. Experiments are conducted with our newly 2D LiDAR vehicle dataset recorded in complex traffic environments. Results demonstrate that the Cascade Pyramid RCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while the proposed Hybrid Resnet Lite provides superior performance of the speed and lightweight model by hybridizing learning based and non-learning based modules. As few previous works conclude an efficient and robust vehicle detection solution with 2D LiDAR, our research fills in this gap and illustrates that even with limited sensing source from a 2D LiDAR, detecting obstacles like vehicles efficiently and robustly is still achievable.},

  abstract     = {Since fish-eye cameras are popular in the intelligent transportation systems, accurate pedestrian detection in fish-eye images becomes more and more critical in low-speed scenarios. Usually, big data based training is the key for detectors to handle the distortion problem in fish-eye images. Especially, hard examples are more important for detectors. They have more complex features and are hard to recognize. In conventional methods, fish-eye images are collected and labeled manually. These methods are expensive and labor-intense. More importantly, these methods are still hard to collect abundant hard examples since they are rare in reality. This work proposes the Distortion Generation Network, which generates generous fish-eye images automatically using only small samples. Moreover, the Adversarial Distortion Generation Network is proposed to mine hard examples via adversarial training. These hard examples benefit detectors to be more robust to seriously distorted objects in fish-eye images. Experiments with the ETH, the KITTI, the GM-ATCI and real fish-eye datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods in pedestrian detection in fish-eye images.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposed an improved incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) which combines flexible re-linearization threshold with error learning model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of navigation for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The flexible threshold of the proposed method, which can avoid periodic re-linearization of iSAM, is controlled by adaptive threshold. Through the use of flexible re-linearization, the proposed method can reduce the running time and carry out re-linearization timely. Simultaneously, for the first time, the proposed method takes advantages of the fast training time of hidden-layer neural networks and Gaussian Process Regression which is more suitable for non-linearity to get error learning model for iSAM. The proposed method can achieve better accuracy with only a rough model and can be easily transplanted to other systems without cumbersome calculations of the precise model. Our algorithm has been demonstrated by a range of simulated and real datasets, especially in practical application it outperforms current available iSAM algorithms in efficiency and accuracy. The RMSE of proposed method increases by 21.7% and efficiency also has been improved by 56% than iSAM2 in practical application for AUV.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of travel time is an essential feature to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The non-linearity of traffic states, however, makes this prediction a challenging task. Here we propose to use dynamic linear models (DLMs) to approximate the non-linear traffic states. Unlike a static linear regression model, the DLMs assume that their parameters are changing across time. We design a DLM with model parameters defined at each time unit to describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of time-series traffic data. Based on our DLM and its model parameters analytically trained using historical data, we suggest an optimal linear predictor in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense. We compare our prediction accuracy of travel time for freeways in California (I210-E and I5-S) under highly congested traffic conditions with those of other methods: the instantaneous travel time, k-nearest neighbor, support vector regression, and artificial neural network. We show significant improvements in the accuracy, especially for short-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {Map-matching based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a promising method for accurate self-localization and recently has gained a wider focus due to the availability of high definition (HD) maps and price-down of LiDARs. In this method, the input scan of the LiDAR is matched to the prebuilt map to get a centimeter-level accuracy position of the vehicle. However, in some places of the map, due to the lack of features, the presence of the repetitive features, the layout of the features, and other factors, the map-matching error might exceed the required bound for autonomous driving. In our previous work, four criteria for evaluation of the features of the map was introduced and it is shown that by examining the corresponding factors for each criterion, the map-matching error can be modeled. In this work, one of the map criteria called local similarity is further investigated and in order to quantify the fulfillment of this criterion, three new factors, namely pfh_similarity , pfh_entropy , and battacharya_similarity are introduced. In addition to this, a framework for pre-estimation of the map-matching error considering these four criteria based on random forest regression is proposed. To evaluate the accuracy of the framework, experiments were conducted for 3.6 km in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Experimental results show that using the proposed framework, in 64.1% of the cases, the localization error can be estimated with less than 2.5cm of the estimation error.},

  abstract     = {Traffic is very important to route planning and people’s daily lives. Traffic prediction is still very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors including dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies and external factors (e.g., road types and nearby points of interest) in the road network. Dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies simultaneously contain spatial and temporal dependencies. Existing models for predicting traffic of links only consider the spatial dependencies from the perspective of links or the whole road network by ignoring the spatial dependencies among regions. To this end, this paper proposes a new Spatio-Temporal Neural Network (STNN) with the encoder-decoder architecture to improve the accuracy of traffic predictions by additionally taking into account the region-based spatial dependencies and external factors. Specifically, STNN learns dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic time series via an encoder in the perspective of the road network, with two spatial models, i.e., region-based spatial model and link-based spatial attention model in the perspectives of regions and links, respectively. Further, STNN decodes the output from the encoder via a decoder with a temporal attention model for recording long-term dependencies and fuses external factors in the road network, to improve network-wide traffic predictions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of STNN on three real-world traffic datasets, which shows that STNN is significantly better than the state-of-the-art models.},

First, the CNN network is applied for vehicle detection and tracking and extracting attribute recognition. Particularly, attributes including vehicle color, type, make, and Re-ID feature are extracted to derive a similarity matrix between upstream and downstream vehicles. However, solely using these features could not achieve satisfaction matching accuracy. Our testing only shows a moderate accurate of around 72.3%. To further improve the Re-ID rate, this paper integrates visual information with the well-known IDM car-following mode. In our framework, IDM is first used to estimate the arrival time window for each upstream vehicle; and then with this time window derive a filter matrix which set the similarity as 0 for the matching vehicles outside the time window. Combining similarity matrix and filter matrix, the new developed Re-ID framework improves the matching rate to 95.7%. Furthermore, the proposed framework can even help identify vehicles that may have changed lanes, overtaken vehicles or driven on a sideroad. Such information is certainly valuable for future research on performance measure, traffic control, and congestion mitigation. Considering the significance of the trajectory data to nowadays traffic control and management and popularity of today’s surveillance cameras, this research certainly will contribute to the improvement of arterial traffic performance measure and efficient control.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of automation in transportation, the need to improve the operation efficiency of container terminals has increased. The most important determinant of container-handling efficiency is the productivity of equipment, such as quay cranes, automated lifting vehicles, storage yards, and yard cranes. Most previous studies have sought to optimize equipment assignments and scheduling independently and have considered only a loading or an unloading process. As loading and unloading processes occur simultaneously and the equipment operations are highly interrelated, it is important to direct the operations in an integrated manner that reflects the characteristics of automated container terminals. This paper presents a new mixed-integer programming model for analyzing the integrated problem of assigning resources and scheduling, which also considers the limited quantity of critical equipment. To solve the integrated optimization model, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed. Since the critical equipment, such as yard cranes, are limited, and thus, restricting the efficiency of terminals, a sharing policy is proposed to improve the GA to shorten the operation time of both the loading and unloading processes. Experiments show that the improved GA proposed in this paper can obtain the optimal/near-optimal solutions in short CPU times, therefore it is efficient in solving the integrated equipment assignment and scheduling problem. The results obtained from the sharing policy are superior to those obtained from a non-sharing approach.},

All the five constraints are incorporated into a Hough transform (HT) based unified framework to select lane candidates. Nearly 99% of the false alarm candidates in HT space can be removed. Moreover, a dynamic programming strategy is proposed to find the most rational solutions among the remaining candidates. This strategy can effectively deal with combination complexity and interferences introduced by multi-lane detection. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset and other collected data demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a deep cascaded neural network for predicting multiple motion commands which can be trained in an end-to-end manner for autonomous driving. The proposed deep cascaded neural network consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and three long short-term memory (LSTM) units, fed with images from a front-facing camera installed at the vehicle. As the outputs, the proposed model can predict thee motion planning commands simultaneously including steering angle, acceleration, and brake to enable the autonomous driving. In order to balance errors among different motion commands and improve prediction accuracy, we propose a new network training algorithm, where three independent loss functions are designed to separately update the weights in the three LSTMs connected to three motion commands. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the data from a driving simulator and compare our method with the state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed motion planning model achieves better accuracy performance than other models.},

In this paper, we focus on the estimation of traffic noise, and present an approach to provide quiet routing services, taking into account the estimated noise levels of roads. By combining Volunteered Geographic Information, official socio-economic data, and open-access GPS trajectory data, we develop a set of traffic related variables, and apply machine learning methods to perform traffic volume estimations. Given the estimated traffic information, an existing traffic noise model is then employed to derive the noise polluted areas. For generation of quiet routes, a new routing algorithm is proposed based on the Dijkstra algorithm. It minimizes the exposure of pedestrians to traffic noise pollution while taking into account the route distance constraint. We apply our quiet routing approach to the city of Heidelberg (Germany). The application results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in the generation of quiet routes customized to pedestrian preferences.},

We define the resilience of the UAV traffic system as the long-run stability of the traffic queues and the optimal throughput strategy under uncertainties. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the stabilities of the traffic queues in the three basic traffic components. Both conditions can be easily verified in practice.

In our proposed vision-based pipeline, we adopt recent state-of-the-art object detectors and transfer-learning to detect vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists from monocular videos. By weakly calibrating the camera, we demonstrate a novel application of the image-to-world homography which gives our monocular vision system the efficacy of counting vehicles by lane and estimating vehicle length and speed in real-world units. Our pipeline also includes a module which combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with projective geometry information to classify vehicles. We have tested it on videos captured at several sites with different traffic flow conditions and compared the results with the data collected by piezoelectric sensors. Our experimental results show that the proposed pipeline can process 60 frames per second for pre-recorded videos and yield high-quality metadata for further traffic analysis.},

A guidance graph method is proposed based on a combination of the shortest path algorithm and the proposed limited penetrable MAKLINK graph (LPMG) to determine the sets of guidance demand points and potential sign locations. The memory duration of pedestrians is measured in a cognitive experiment to determine the expected distance between guidance points. To reasonably estimate the coverage of guidance signs, a multifeature fusion-based interaction (MFI) model is proposed. Then, a binary linear programming formulation of a location-allocation model is proposed based on the MFI model. The proposed model can suggest the optimal orientations of signs in addition to their optimal number and locations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through a real-world case study. The case study shows that the proposed model can produce a much more economical and pedestrian-friendly location-allocation plan than previous methods. A sensitivity analysis shows that the number of signs is a piecewise decreasing function with respect to the letter height and the expected distance between guidance points.},

  abstract     = {In April 2016, Amazon won a patent for a flying warehouse that deploys unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deliver parcels to customers. In this system, the airborne fulfillment center (AFC) remains or moves at a high altitude, and UAVs are deployed from the AFC to deliver orders to customers. Smaller airships, also known as shuttles, may be used to replenish the AFC with inventory, UAVs, fuel, supplies, and staff. Amazon’s AFC delivery system is a novel and challenging system that can convert same-day deliveries into 10 min deliveries and provide a wide range of UAV delivery services for Amazon Prime members. However, to operate the AFC delivery system efficiently, a quantitative operation methodology needs to be developed, which considers the related regulations and consumable replenishment. In this study, mixed-integer linear programming is developed to derive optimal operation schedules for AFC, shuttles, and UAVs simultaneously. The proposed model can be used in real time to address system changes and derive new operation schedules. The effects of system components are analyzed via a numerical experiment to provide managerial guidelines for the implementation of the AFC delivery system. Furthermore, cooperation between the new AFC delivery system and the existing stationary UAV delivery service was investigated. The results demonstrate the possibility of complementary cooperation between the two systems.},

We assume a generalized fading channel model, known as cascaded Rayleigh (also called &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; *Rayleigh), which involves the product of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; independent Rayleigh random variables. This channel model provides a realistic description of IVC, in contrast to the conventional Rayleigh fading assumption, which is more suitable for cellular networks. Unlike existing works, which mainly consider double-Rayleigh fading channels (i.e, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n=2$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ); our system model considers the general cascading order &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , for which we derive an approximate analytic solution for the outage probability under the considered scenario. Also, in this study we propose a machine learning-based power allocation scheme to improve the link reliability in IVC. The analytical and simulation results show that both selective decode-and-forward (S-DF) and amplify-and-forward (S-AF) relaying schemes have the same diversity order in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. In addition, our results indicate that machine learning algorithms can play a central role in selecting the best relay and allocation of transmission power.},

  abstract     = {Due to the sensitivity of the information exchanged in Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication, generating secret keys is critical to secure these communications. As nature is open access, distributed keys are more vulnerable to attacks in the vehicular environment. Physical layer key generation methods using wireless channel characteristics show promise in preventing such attacks, generating keys independently, and removing the need for distribution. In this paper, we present a novel key generation approach in a real vehicular environment based on Channel State Information (CSI), including a new algorithm for key bit extraction. We implemented our algorithm using USRP B210 Software-Defined Radios (SDR) and the industry-standard V2X communication protocol: IEEE 802.11p. The proposed key generation protocol uses the CSI values of each sub-carrier as a source of randomness, from which bits are extracted using a new QAM demodulator quantizer (QAM-Dem-Quan). We compared our technique to state-of-the-art Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based approaches, and show that our method achieves better performance. Moreover, we reached a min-entropy of approximately 70% for the generated keys and a key generation rate of less than &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$150~\mu \text{s}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; /key for key lengths ranging from 16 to 128 bits.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have a large potential to improve traffic safety but also pose some critical challenges. While AVs may help reduce crashes caused by human error, they still may experience failures of technologies and sensing, as well as decision-making errors in a mixed traffic environment. A disengagement refers to an AV transitioning control from autonomous systems to the trained test driver. The safety critical nature of disengagements makes it imperative to analyze disengagements and crashes together. This study analyzes both crashes and disengagements from real-world AV driving in California to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between disengagements and crashes in a mixed traffic environment. A nested logit model was calibrated using three different outcomes: (1) disengagement with a crash, (2) disengagement with no crash, and (3) no disengagement with a crash. Furthermore, endogenous switching regime models were also calibrated to draw distinctions between the relation of disengagements and crashes while accounting for endogeneity effects. The results show that factors related to AV systems (such as software failures) and other roadway participants increase the propensity of a disengagement without a crash. Furthermore, AVs were observed to disengage less often as the technology matured over time. Marginal effects revealed an 8% decrease. The results thus suggest that disengagements are a part of AVs’ safe performance and disengagement alerts may need to be triggered in order to avoid certain failures with current technology.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limitation of data collection techniques and privacy issues, the problem of missing spatial origin-destination flows frequently occurs. Data imputation provides great support for the acquisition of complete flow data, which enables us to better understand regional connections and mobility patterns. However, existing models or approaches neglect the network structure of spatial flows, thus resulting in inappropriate estimates and a low performance. The development of graph neural networks offers a powerful tool to deal with graph-structured data. In this article, we proposed a spatial interaction graph convolutional network model, which combines graph convolution and a mapping function to predict flow data from the perspective of network learning. This model utilizes geographical unit embedding in local spatial networks to improve prediction accuracy. A negative sampling technique is adopted to reduce misestimation. Experiments on Beijing taxi trip data verified the usefulness of our model in spatial flow prediction. We also demonstrated that a biased training sample had a negative impact on the model’s performance. More attributes of geographical units, a more proper negative sampling rate and a larger training set can increase the prediction accuracy of flow data.},

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-scale residual network (MSRN) which can achieve remarkable dehazing effect on railway monitoring images. The method optimizes the image dehazing algorithm in three aspects: network structure, loss function and hazy dataset. Firstly, inspired by the residual network, the paper presents a method of fusing multi-scale feature information based on the residual network, which can extract more effective information at different scales. Secondly, a combined loss function is designed to achieve better convergent results by balancing training time, training calculations, and precision. Thirdly, the paper synthesizes an outdoor dataset specifically for railway scenarios, which relies on real depth maps and various outdoor images. Extensive experimental results on both full reference image quality assessment and no reference image quality assessment of image restoration demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows higher performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, the haze of railway monitoring images is removed under hazy weather, and the detection algorithm achieved higher detection accuracy on the images after dehazing. The proposed network structure, loss function, and hazy dataset are discussed and analyzed in detail to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This paper analyzes the controllability of mixed traffic systems and designs a system-level optimal control strategy. Using the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) criterion, we prove for the first time that a ring-road mixed traffic system with one CAV and multiple heterogeneous human-driven vehicles is not completely controllable, but is stabilizable under a very mild condition. Then, we formulate the design of a system-level control strategy for the CAV as a structured optimal control problem, where the CAV’s communication ability is explicitly considered. Finally, we derive an upper bound for reachable traffic velocity via controlling the CAV. Extensive numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our analytical results and the proposed control strategy. Our results validate the possibility of utilizing CAVs as mobile actuators to smooth traffic flow actively.},

In this paper, a multi-stage intelligent method is proposed for predicting the dynamic changes and propagation of train delays using random vector functional-link networks (RVFLNs) with improved transfer learning and ensemble learning. First, to improve the prediction performance of the single RVFLNs model, a novel improved Stacking ensemble learning RVFLNs (SRN) regression algorithm is proposed for prediction modeling of the delay changes. Then, to ensure the classification accuracy of unlabeled and class-imbalanced train data, an improved transfer learning RVFLNs (ITRN) classifier is proposed to decide whether the initial delay will lead to associated delays, with the aid of the improved SMOTE algorithm for processing imbalanced data. If associated delays are identified by the ITRN classifier, the proposed SRN algorithm will be further to predict the subsequent associated delays. By iterating the classification and prediction procedures, the propagation range and chain of train delays can be obtained. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are verified by using two experiments against actual train graph data from different railway lines.},

An adaptive saturation compensation system that makes no assumption, as in existing works where nonlinear functions are used to describe the unsaturated region of ANAS as known and strictly monotonous, is developed to attenuate the adverse effects of ANAS. For the saturation-free and ANAS cases, two adaptive fault-tolerant pseudo-PID-SMC schemes with no chattering, a simple structure, and inexpensive computation are developed to guarantee the exponential convergence of all signals in the closed-loop systems.

  abstract     = {While Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) can potentially improve driver safety and traffic mangement efficiency (e.g. through timely sharing of traffic status among vehicles), security and privacy are two ongoing issues that need to be addressed. Hence, security solutions such as conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) protocols have been proposed. However, CPPA protocols are generally far from being ready for deployment in VANETs, for example due key/certificate management limitations in PKI-based protocols or intractable private key updating in ID-based protocols. Although serveral blockchain-based CPPA (BCPPA) protocols have been proposed to mitigiate these challenges, there still exist some intractabilities such as revoking private key, or frequent interactions, or requiring an idea hardware. Thus, in this paper, we are motivated to propose a novel BCPPA protocol without these existing issues. Specifically, we present a PKI-based solution (using a typical digital signature protocol, such as ECDSA) based on Ethereum (a public blockchain), which is designed to facilitate secure communication in VANETs. In other words, we combine the blockchain technology and a key derivation algorithm to realize an effective certificate management. This reduces the need for participating vehicles to store a large number of private keys. To reduce the verification time cost, our BCPPA suppotrs replacing ECDSA with modified ECDSA for batch verification or directly adopting other PKI-based signatures with batch verification. In addition to introducing the concrete design, we also present the security requirements that our BCPPA protocol can satisfy. We then implement BCPPA in the Ethereum test network (i.e. Rinkeby ) and provide simulations using VanetMobiSim and NS-2 to show its feasibility (i.e. milliseconds).},

  abstract     = {Machine vision based vehicle counting and traffic flow estimation are challenging problems especially for dense traffic scenarios. Previous line of interest (LOI) counting methods rarely focus on dense scenarios and their performance largely relies on the accuracy of tracking. Avoiding the use of complex tracking methods, an LOI counting framework is proposed to address the bi-directional LOI counting problem in dense scenarios. There are three main contributions. Firstly, instead of treating the LOI vehicle counting problem as a combination of detecting and tracking of individual vehicles, the bi-directional traffic flow is taken as a whole and a novel spatio-temporal counting feature (STCF) is proposed for extracting bi-directional traffic flow features in dense traffic scenarios. Secondly, without relying on a multi-target tracking process for tracking and counting each vehicle, a counting network is proposed, called the counting Long Short-Term Memory (cLSTM) network, to do analysis of the bi-directional STCF features and vehicle counting in successive video frames. Lastly, an estimation model is designed for estimating traffic flow parameters including speed, volume and density. Experiments performed on the UA-DETRAC dataset and the captured videos show that the proposed vehicle counting method outperforms the tested representative LOI counting methods in both accuracy and speed, and that the proposed framework can efficiently estimate traffic flow parameters including speed, volume and density in real time.},

  abstract     = {With the development of location-based services and smart terminals, skyline query technique has been used widely in intelligent transportation systems. In skyline queries, the areas and keywords queried by users have a great impact on the quality of the query results and users may only be interested in the closer results of the skyline query. However, current approaches for the continuous skyline query limit the area of the skyline query to a specific area in the road network, which leads to that many useful query results cannot be retrieved. To this end, an innovative continuous skyline query approach in city range is proposed in this paper, where a multi-scale area divisions of the urban road network are provided to find the optimize query scale and area. In our approach, first, the dominant area of each intersection node in the road network is established based on the Voronoi. Then, all Points of Interest ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$POI\text{s}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) are divided into the dominant area of each intersection node. After that, the intersection node aggregation algorithm ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$INAA$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ), link remolding algorithm ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$LMA$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) and link fitting algorithm ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$LFA$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) are proposed to reduce the number of intersection nodes in the road network, so as to increase the dominant area of the remaining intersection nodes and the number of POIs in these nodes. Finally, a better query scale by considering the efficiency and quality of the query is given through the studies.},

  abstract     = {The special events such as games, concerts, state fairs, etc. attract a large amount of population, which requires proper planning of transit services to meet the induced demand. Previous studies have proposed methods for estimating an average daily weekday demand, which have an inherent disadvantage in estimating the demand for a special event. We solve an idealized version of this problem i.e., we decompose a special event affected demand matrix into a regular and an outlier matrix. We start with detecting the special events in large scale transit data using the Mahalanobis distance, an outlier detection method for high dimensional data. Then, a special event demand is evaluated using state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction technique known as robust principal component analysis (RPCA), which is formulated as a convex optimization program. We show the application of the proposed method using Automatic Passenger Count (APC) data from Twin Cities, MN, USA. The methods are general and can be applied to any type of data related to the flow of passengers available with respect to time. Of practical interest, the methods are scalable to large-scale transit systems.},

  abstract     = {Driving in a human-like manner is important for an autonomous vehicle to be a smart and predictable traffic participant. To achieve this goal, parameters of the motion planning module should be carefully tuned, which needs great effort and expert knowledge. In this study, a method of learning cost parameters of a motion planner from naturalistic driving data is proposed. The learning is achieved by encouraging the selected trajectory to approximate the human driving trajectory under the same traffic situation. The employed motion planner follows a widely accepted methodology that first samples candidate trajectories in the trajectory space, then select the one with minimal cost as the planned trajectory. Moreover, in addition to traditional factors such as comfort, efficiency and safety, the cost function is proposed to incorporate incentive of behavior decision like a human driver, so that both lane change decision and motion planning are coupled into one framework. Two types of lane incentive cost — heuristic and learning based — are proposed and implemented. To verify the validity of the proposed method, a data set is developed by using the naturalistic trajectory data of human drivers collected on the motorways in Beijing, containing samples of lane changes to the left and right lanes, and car followings. Experiments are conducted with respect to both lane change decision and motion planning, and promising results are achieved.},

  abstract     = {In order to efficiently balance the current and future air traffic demands with the system capacity, a proper Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) approach is required. The current focus of ATFM is generally on optimally utilizing the available airspace and airport capacities, while maintaining the required safety separation between aircraft. Yet, only a minor focus is given to the inherent uncertainty in the Air Transportation System (ATS), especially to its adverse effect on safety and day-to-day operations. To this end, we propose an ATFM framework scrutinizing the stochastic nature of ATS through a chance-constraint-based probabilistic approach. Moreover, anticipating the high volumes in air traffic in the future, we propose to split the model into two stages, in which the first stage scrutinizes the behavior of a set of flights as a flow, while the second stage transforms them into individual flight plans, enhancing scalability. The two models are formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem at stages I and II, respectively. The NP-hard nature of the overall problem is minimized by transforming the problem into a Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) finding problem.},

  abstract     = {Object tracking is a challenging task in computer vision based intelligent transportation systems. Recently, Siamese based object tracking methods have attracted significant attention due to their highly efficient performance. These tracking methods usually train a Siamese network to match the initial target patch of the first frame with candidates in a new frame. In these methods, the offline training of the deep neural network and the online instance searching are effectively combined. However, these methods usually do not include template update or object re-identification, which easily results in the drift problem. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time object tracking method to overcome the above problems by effectively combining a multi-stream Siamese network and a region-based convolutional neural network. Specifically, a novel multi-stream Siamese network is proposed to search the target and update the instance template in a new frame. In addition, a faster region-based convolutional neural network detector is used to perform object re-identification in order to improve the tracking performance by making full use of the object category information. These two networks are tightly coupled to ensure that the proposed tracking method has high efficiency and strong discriminative capability. Experimental results on several object tracking benchmarks show that our tracking method can effectively track vehicles and pedestrians in video sequences by exploiting the object category information. The proposed tracking method achieves real-time operations and outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Communication-based Train Control (CBTC) systems are the burgeoning directions for developing future train control systems. With the adoption of wireless communication and network techniques, train control systems are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Notably, the jamming attacks, aiming at the handoff process that is the weakest part of train ground communication systems, will cause long disruption of communication. It will have a severe impact on train control operation efficiency. Current research regarding industry control system security is hard to model the impact of the jamming attacks on the train control system quantitatively, and current countermeasure schemes against jamming attacks are not designed for the operating mechanism of train control systems. This paper first builds the train control security state transition probability model under jamming attacks. A cross-layer defense scheme is then proposed from the aspect of the physical layer, the cyber layer and the management layer. In the physical layer, this paper designs a model prediction control algorithm to track dynamic target signals, in the hopes of eventually tracking the dynamic target quickly and smoothly. In the cyber layer, a multi-stage and zero-sum stochastic game model is built for the channel selection for the attack and the defense, whereby the channel selection randomized policy will be obtained. In the management layer, a dynamic train travel speed profile generation algorithm is proposed to mitigate the jamming attacks’ impact on train control systems. Extensive simulation results are shown that jamming attack impact on CBTC can be mitigated effectively with our proposed cross-layer defense scheme.},

Two solutions respectively for rectification of the measuring points deviation and optimization of the inverse filter parameters are presented. The former, based on the horizontal spacing constraint, detects the exact measuring point from a true rail profile which is reconstructed and rectified by the triple-line SLV. The latter, based on the minimum cumulative recovery error, defines the optimized numbers of frequency sampling and filter order, together with a splicing wavelength. Employing these optimized parameters, our CCM yields the overall amplitude-frequency response being nearly one whether for longwave corrugation or for shortwave corrugation. Both of the proposed solutions aim at enhancing the ordinary CCM in terms of the validity for rail corrugation measurement. Experimental assessments verify the availability and repeatability of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {The increasing aviation activities pose a challenge to ensure a safe and orderly flight. Trajectory prediction is one of the most important forecasting tasks in Air Traffic Management. Accurate prediction is reasonable for safe and orderly flight tasks in civil aviation monitoring. Points of interests play an important role in most land traffic prediction algorithms due to their abilities in positioning and marking. Compared with land traffic, the sparse way-points and shared airways make it difficult for flight trajectory prediction. A constrained Long Short-Term Memory network for flight trajectory prediction is proposed in this paper. According to the dynamic characteristics of the aircraft, we propose three kinds of constraints to climbing, cruising, and descending/approaching phases, in particular, they are Top of climb, Way-points, and Runway direction, correspondingly. Our model is able to keep long-term dependencies with dynamic physical constraints. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise and Linear Least Squares are used in data segmentation and preprocessing. Sliding windows help maintain the continuity of trajectory. Four-dimensional spatial-temporal trajectory set consisting of spatial position and timestamps is used to prove the efficiency of our approach. Multiple ADS-B ground stations contribute to our experimental dataset. The widely used Long Short-Term Memory network, Markov Model, weighted Markov Model, Support Vector Machine, and Kalman Filter are used for comparison. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that our model outperforms the above-mentioned state-of-the-art models, and lays a good foundation for decision-making in different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design a driver behavior monitoring and warning (DBMW) framework to detect dangerous driving for enhancing road safety through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The designed DBMW framework applies onboard image sensors and wearable devices to detect the deviation degree of vehicles and trace the head motion of drivers, respectively. According to our review of relevant research, DBMW is the first framework for driver behavior monitoring and warning that provides the following features: 1) DBMW can keep recognizing the located lane lines and estimating the power spectral density of lane deviation for a vehicle through image sensors, 2) DBMW can keep monitoring driver behaviors and measuring the anomaly level of a driver through wearable devices, and 3) DBMW can instantly send the warning messages of potential dangerous driving to neighboring vehicles and nearby pedestrians through IoV communications as necessary, which makes vehicles and pedestrians be aware of the existence of surrounding dangerous drivers in advance to keep alerting and avoid potential accidents/collisions. In particular, the prototype consisting of an Android-based sensing unit and an Arduino-based wearable device is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of DBMW. Experimental results show that DBMW outperforms existing methods and can significantly improve the detection accuracy and false alarm rates of dangerous driving behaviors.},

  abstract     = {High-speed train (HST) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), as typical scenes of 5G communication, have attracted extensive attention from academia and industry in recent years. Aiming at the channel characteristics of frequency-selective fading, fast time-varying and time-domain non-stationary in high mobility scenarios, a nonlinear Kalman filter-based high-speed channel estimation algorithm for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is proposed. We adopt basis expansion model (BEM) to eliminate the inter-subcarrier interference (ICI) caused by the fast time-varying characteristics. For the non-stationary characteristics of high mobility channel, a channel interpolation algorithm based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) is introduced to jointly estimate the channel impulse response (CIR) and time correlation coefficients. However, the EKF channel estimation uses structure of decision feedback to construct the observation matrix, which would lead to error propagation. This paper analyzes the generation of error propagation through theoretical derivation. Furthermore, for the error propagation of EKF, we introduce unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm to perform Gaussian approximation of non-Gaussian observing system, and eliminate the influence by Kalman filter (KF). Simulation results demonstrate that the channel estimation accuracy of BEM-UKF is further improved compared with BEM-EKF, and the influence of pilot distance (PD) is smaller, which further improves the robustness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Different variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) have been studied for decades. State-of-the-art methods based on local search have been developed for VRPs, while still facing problems of slow running time and poor solution quality in the case of large problem size. To overcome these problems, we first propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, which is composed of an actor, an adaptive critic and a routing simulator. The actor, based on the attention mechanism, is designed to generate routing strategies. The adaptive critic is devised to change the network structure adaptively, in order to accelerate the convergence rate and improve the solution quality during training. The routing simulator is developed to provide graph information and reward with the actor and adaptive cirtic. Then, we combine this DRL model with a local search method to further improve the solution quality. The output of the DRL model can serve as the initial solution for the following local search method, from where the final solution of the VRP is obtained. Tested on three datasets with customer points of 20, 50 and 100 respectively, experimental results demonstrate that the DRL model alone finds better solutions compared to construction algorithms and previous DRL approaches, while enabling a 5- to 40-fold speedup. We also observe that combining the DRL model with various local search methods yields excellent solutions at a superior generation speed, comparing to that of other initial solutions.},

For this, two important problems are addressed: traffic condition assessment from audio data, and analysis of audio under uncontrolled environments. By modeling the traffic parameters and the sound generation from passing vehicles and using the produced audio as a source of data for learning the traffic audio patterns, we provide a solution that copes with the time, the cost and the constraints inherent to the activity of traffic monitoring. External noise sources were introduced to produce more realistic acoustic scenes and to verify the robustness of the methods presented. Audio-based monitoring becomes a simple and low-cost option, comparing to other methods based on detector loops, or GPS, and as good as camera-based solutions, without some of the common problems of image-based monitoring, such as occlusions and light conditions. The approach is evaluated with data from audio analysis of traffic registered in locations around the city of São Jose dos Campos, Brazil, and audio files from places around the world, downloaded from YouTube. Its validation shows the feasibility of traffic automatic audio monitoring as well as using machine learning algorithms to recognize audio patterns under noisy environments.},

  abstract     = {Bus services play a crucial role in urban transit. It is significant to achieve the fine-grained service-level passenger flow prediction (SPFP), namely to predict the total number of passengers for each service of each bus line passing through each station during the next short-term interval. However, it faces great challenges due to complex factors including inter-station and inter-line spatial dependencies, intra-station and inter-service temporal dependencies, and internal/external influences. To address these challenges, we propose a multitask deep-learning (MDL) approach, called MDL-SPFP , to jointly predict the arriving bus service flow, line-level on-board passenger flow and line-level boarding/alighting passenger flow by leveraging well-designed deep neural networks called ARM . The MDL framework can mutually reinforce the prediction of each type of flow, and finally integrate the outputs to achieve the fine-grained service-level prediction. The ARM network combines three modules, Attention mechanism, Residual block and Multi-scale convolution, to well capture various complex non-linear spatio-temporal dependencies and influence factors. Extensive experiments based on a large-scale realistic bus operation dataset are conducted to confirm that our MDL-SPFP approach outperforms 10 state-of-the-art baselines, and improves 22.39% accuracy than the best baseline.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial component in intelligent transportation systems, traffic flow prediction has recently attracted widespread research interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the increasing availability of massive traffic mobility data. Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse factors (such as temporal rules and spatial dependencies) to infer the evolution trend of traffic flow. To address this problem, we propose a unified neural network called Attentive Traffic Flow Machine (ATFM), which can effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of traffic flow with an attention mechanism. In particular, our ATFM is composed of two progressive Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM [1] ) units connected with a convolutional layer. Specifically, the first ConvLSTM unit takes normal traffic flow features as input and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into the connected convolutional layer for spatial attention map inference. The second ConvLSTM unit aims at learning the dynamic spatial-temporal representations from the attentionally weighted traffic flow features. Further, we develop two deep learning frameworks based on ATFM to predict citywide short-term/long-term traffic flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential and periodic data as well as other external influences. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for traffic flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of our method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger pickup/dropoff demands in traffic prediction and show its superior performance.

Second, to describe the congestion states of roads, the cloud model theory is introduced to characterize the congestion features of road sections. After that, a state vulnerability identification method based on congestion cloud charts is constructed.

The AutoML enables end-to-end machine learning from vehicle movement and sensing data to detailed risk levels and corresponding behaviour characteristics, which integrates three main components of: unsupervised risk identification by surrogate risk indicators and big data clustering, feature learning based on XGBoost, and model auto-tuning by Bayesian optimisation. Then, the functions and performance of AutoML are evaluated based on NGSIM data, with assumptions of various sensing configurations or data acquisition conditions. AutoML achieves satisfactory results of behaviour-based risk prediction, which has a predictive power of 91.7% overall accuracy for four risk levels, and about 95% accuracy for safe-risk distinction. Bayesian optimisation guides the self-learning of AutoML to get the optimised feature subsets and hyperparameter values. The identification of key features not only produces better performance with fewer computation costs, but also provides data-driven insights about AV design, such as sensor configurations and sensor data mining, from risk decision-making perspectives. The application potentials of AutoML in AVs are discussed.},

  abstract     = {By observing their environment as well as other traffic participants, humans are enabled to drive road vehicles safely. Vehicle passengers, however, perceive a notable difference between non-experienced and experienced drivers. In particular, they may get the impression that the latter ones anticipate what will happen in the next few moments and consider these foresights in their driving behavior. To make the driving style of automated vehicles comparable to the one of human drivers with respect to comfort and perceived safety, the aforementioned anticipation skills need to become a built-in feature of self-driving vehicles. This article provides a systematic comparison of methods and strategies to generate this intention for self-driving cars using machine learning techniques. To implement and test these algorithms we use a large data set collected over more than 30 000 km of highway driving and containing approximately 40 000 real-world driving situations. We further show that it is possible to classify driving maneuvers upcoming within the next 5 s with an Area Under the ROC Curve ( AUC ) above 0.92 for all defined maneuver classes. This enables us to predict the lateral position with a prediction horizon of 5 s with a median lateral error of less than 0.21 m.},

Recent studies on Low-rank and Sparse Separation (LSS) achieved good performance when compared to traditional background subtraction techniques in segregating the foreground from a complex background. However, the issue of maintaining this type of a separation via an updating mechanism is not well addressed by the majority of LSS approaches. The study presents a tensor based singular value decomposition approach for background/foreground separation. The approach is uniquely designed to deal with most challenges related to a maritime environment such as sea dynamics, boat wakes, variety of foreground objects, and camera jitter. Furthermore, the proposed approach operates incrementally via updating the separation components as opposed to reperforming the decomposition on the entire video sequence when a set of frames arrives. Additionally, a forgetting mechanism is employed in the proposed approach to efficiently handle challenges such as Stationary Foreground Objects (SFOs) and ghost effects. The performance of the proposed method with several state-of-the-art LSS and Non-LSS techniques on videos with complex maritime scenarios are evaluated. The results exhibit better performance over most of the tested challenges and also demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to perform the separation in less computational time.},

Optimal performance can be achieved by formulating and solving mixed Boolean linear programming (MBLP) optimization problems for various performance metrics, including network throughput and connectivity. Fairness among network nodes (vehicles) is addressed by considering formulations that maximizes the worst-case network node performance. Solving the optimization problem comes at the cost of significant computational complexity for large networks and requires that (slow) channel state information is gathered at a central point. To address these issues, a clustering method is proposed to partition the optimization problem into a set of smaller problems, which reduces the overall computational complexity, and a decentralized algorithm that does not need channel state information is provided.},

  abstract     = {Road network conditions and road quality are directly linked with the performance of an entire infrastructure system. As sensor monitoring of road deteriorations has rapidly increased, road infrastructure performance can now be assessed using multiple measures. However, more effective and accurate quantitative analysis methods are increasingly required. This research explores road infrastructure performance using road deterioration network data in the Mid West Gascoyne region, Australia. A spatial heterogeneity-based segmentation (SHS) model is developed for redefining road segments across the network in terms of sensor monitoring data, and for both project-level and network-level infrastructure systems management. To evaluate the model effectiveness and accuracy, an evaluation system is proposed from four aspects: segment number, homogeneity within segments, heterogeneity among segments, and segment morphology. The SHS model is compared with two widely used road network segmentation methods. The results show that the SHS model can use fewer segments to ensure higher homogeneity within segments and heterogeneity among segments across the network. Meanwhile, the segment lengths are more uniformly distributed as compared with results from other methods. The developed model and findings from this research can significantly improve the utilization of sensor monitoring network data and support multi-scale infrastructure systems management.},

In the MP-ET-PDA filter, we assume that multipath detections and clutter are possible in the extended target tracking problem, which are prevalent in practical systems but barely addressed in the literature. Further, a clustering-aided MP-ET-PDA algorithm with a reduced computational complexity that makes use of the Variational Bayesian (VB) technique, called MP-ET-PDA-VB, is presented to provide near real-time processing capability in ETT problems with an uncertain multipath environment. In addition to using a constant velocity motion model, a new terrain-constrained motion model is presented for scenarios where terrain-following is required by motion-constrained autonomous vehicles. The posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB), which quantifies the best possible accuracy in realistic ETT problems with multipath detections and measurement-origin uncertainty, is derived as the benchmark for performance evaluation. Simulations results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed algorithms.},

The work mainly contains: 1) An annotated image dataset which contains car, coach, truck, and wheel is established for training Mask R-CNN; 2) The method for identifying the number of axles based on MaskIoU is proposed; 3) The 3D bounding box is generated based on the high-quality vehicle segmentation, which is more accurate than that generated by background subtraction methods; 4) For calculating the vehicle speed and length, the reference points on the road plane are determined by the lane with dashed line and one vanishing point to calculate the homography matrix; 5) In order to keep the obtained vehicle information reliability, the results identified from multi-frames are obtained by means of the tracking method SORT for processing. The proposed system is verified in different scenes. The average recognition accuracies of the vehicle types and number of axles are more than 97% and 88% in three testing videos. The speed errors of more than 90% vehicles are less than 4%. And the ratios of both missing and repetition in vehicle counting are low in general.},

The vehicle state with respect to the road, which is called the lateral offset, jumps in camera vision sensors when the vehicle changes lanes. Thus, we solve this state jump problem by translating the state estimation problem into a new domain called the cylinder domain. We propose a linear parameter varying (LPV) observer to estimate the vehicle states by considering the lane width variation during a lane change. The lane information is estimated by the proposed LPV observer in the cylinder domain; thus, the estimated lane information does not jump. Consequently, the lane estimation performance can be improved during the transient response when the lateral position of the autonomous vehicle crosses over between the original and target lanes in the event of a lane change. The proposed algorithm is validated with real vehicle driving data obtained using a camera vision sensor.},

Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV. This is done methodically by developing a security-by-design framework for AV from the first principles. Subsequently, the technical challenges for AV security are identified.},

  abstract     = {Short-term passenger flow forecasting is an essential component in urban rail transit operation. Emerging deep learning models provide good insight into improving prediction precision. Therefore, we propose a deep learning architecture combining the residual network (ResNet), graph convolutional network (GCN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) (called “ResLSTM”) to forecast short-term passenger flow in urban rail transit on a network scale. First, improved methodologies of the ResNet, GCN, and attention LSTM models are presented. Then, the model architecture is proposed, wherein ResNet is used to capture deep abstract spatial correlations between subway stations, GCN is applied to extract network topology information, and attention LSTM is used to extract temporal correlations. The model architecture includes four branches for inflow, outflow, graph-network topology, as well as weather conditions and air quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that air-quality indicators have been taken into account, and their influences on prediction precision quantified. Finally, ResLSTM is applied to the Beijing subway using three time granularities (10, 15, and 30 min) to conduct short-term passenger flow forecasting. A comparison of the prediction performance of ResLSTM with those of many state-of-the-art models illustrates the advantages and robustness of ResLSTM. Moreover, a comparison of the prediction precisions obtained for time granularities of 10, 15, and 30 min indicates that prediction precision increases with increasing time granularity. This study can provide subway operators with insight into short-term passenger flow forecasting by leveraging deep learning models.},

Seven distinct vehicle models from two different vehicle makes are analyzed using data collected from more than 1,200 miles of driving in car-following experiments with ACC engaged by the follower vehicle. The resulting dataset is used to identify the parameters of a linear second order delay differential equation model that approximates the behavior of the black box ACC systems. The string stability of the data-fitted model associated with each vehicle is assessed, and the main finding is that all seven vehicle models have string unstable ACC systems. For one commonly available vehicle model that offers ACC as a standard feature on all trim levels, we validate the string stability finding with a multi-vehicle homogeneousplatoon experiment in which all vehicles are the same year, make, and model. In this test, an initial disturbance of 6 mph is amplified to a 25 mph disturbance, at which point the last vehicle in the platoon is observed to disengage the ACC. The data collected in the driving experiments is made available, representing the largest publicly available comparative driving dataset on ACC equipped vehicles.},

In this paper, we propose an emotion-based crowd simulation model integrating physical strength consumption. Inspired by the theory of “the devoted actor,” the movements of each individual in our model are determined by modeling the influence of physical strength consumption and the emotion of panic. In particular, human physical strength consumption is computed using a physics-based numerical method. Inspired by the James-Lange theory, panic levels are estimated by means of an enhanced emotional contagion model that leverages the inherent relationship between physical strength consumption and panic. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first method integrating physical strength consumption into an emotion-based crowd simulation model by exploiting the relationship between physical strength consumption and emotion. We highlight the performance on different scenarios and compare the resulting behaviors with real-world video sequences. Our approach can reliably predict changes in physical strength consumption and panic levels of individuals in an emergency situation.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing car license plates in natural scene images is an important yet still challenging task in realistic applications. Many existing approaches perform well for license plates collected under constrained conditions, e.g ., shooting in frontal and horizontal view-angles and under good lighting conditions. However, their performance drops significantly in an unconstrained environment that features rotation, distortion, occlusion, blurring, shading or extreme dark or bright conditions. In this work, we propose a robust framework for license plate recognition in the wild. It is composed of a tailored CycleGAN model for license plate image generation and an elaborate designed image-to-sequence network for plate recognition. On one hand, the CycleGAN based plate generation engine alleviates the exhausting human annotation work. Massive amount of training data can be obtained with a more balanced character distribution and various shooting conditions, which helps to boost the recognition accuracy to a large extent. On the other hand, the 2D attentional based license plate recognizer with an Xception-based CNN encoder is capable of recognizing license plates with different patterns under various scenarios accurately and robustly. Without using any heuristics rule or post-processing, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets, which demonstrates the generality and robustness of our framework. Moreover, we released a new license plate dataset, named “CLPD”, with 1200 images from all 31 provinces in mainland China.

As these new technologies emerge, they also have the potential to render many of today’s most common transportation control methods irrelevant. In this paper, concepts of connected and autonomous are applied to coordinate and synchronize the arrival and departure of vehicles at intersections; effectively ending the need for traffic signals. Under a set of “autonomous rules of operation”, vehicles can be kept in near-continuous motion while also maintaining safe separation, creating a system of “virtual traffic signal” (VTS). Assessments of these rules shows that delay and stopping reductions of more than 50 to 97 percent will be possible over actuated control and fixed time signal control – and without the risk of collisions. Not will these rules reduce congestion, travel time, and prevent crashes; they will also lower fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.},

The problem is mathematically under-determined, and the quality of the solution can be enhanced by restricting the upper level search space with information from other sources. This paper presents a methodology that assimilates sub-path flows in the upper level objective function. The contributions of the study are two-fold: first, it proposes the idea of “structural comparison of sub-path flows” to relax the requirement of “known” penetration rate of vehicles’ trajectories; second, it proposes an innovative upper level formulation where the structural difference between the observed and assigned sub-path flows is integrated with the traditional deviations between the observed and assigned link flows. The sub-path flows can be estimated from advanced data sources such as Bluetooth MAC scanner. The proposed methodology is tested using simulation on a realistic network from Brisbane, Australia and results indicate its practical relevance for situations when the penetration rate of Bluetooth trajectories is generally unknown. The proposed method has a better ability to maintain structural consistency and showed considerable improvements in the quality of OD estimates as compared to the traditional traffic counts-based approach.},

  abstract     = {Both road users and road administrators are keen to know traffic flow of fine-grained vehicle type. Successful prediction on the traffic flow of heavy, medium and small vehicle could contribute to the improvement of travel safety and efficiency. However, the classification on vehicle type is always not accurate enough using in practice. It could cost a lot to identify from the additional video cameras to cover the full-length of large-scale freeway with high-resolution to capture vehicles clearly. In this paper, empirical data are cleaned, normalized, compensated, filled, decoded and filtered with help of the fusion of vehicle detector data, remote microwave sensors data and toll collection data. The traffic flows of fine-grained heavy, medium and small vehicles are successfully reconstructed. Improved deep belief network (DBN) are then proposed to forecast traffic flow of different types of vehicles in 30-, 60- and 120-minutes time interval. Random-selected road segments on a ring way around a city are trained with data accumulated three months and predict data in the next month. According to prediction error analysis, the proposed method performs better in estimation and forecasting, with respect to the existing methods, especially for longer time prediction and heavy vehicle prediction. It would benefit traffic control to prevent freeway congestion escalation, protect the traffic infrastructure via heavy vehicle control, reduce the road risk, prompt quick emergency response and eventually contributes to more applications for intelligent transportation system (ITS).},

  abstract     = {Accurate short-time traffic flow prediction has gained gradually increasing importance for traffic plan and management with the deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, the existing approaches for short-term traffic flow prediction are unable to efficiently capture the complex nonlinearity of traffic flow, which provide unsatisfactory prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model which uses hybrid and multiple-layer architectures to automatically extract inherent features of traffic flow data. Firstly, built on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we develop an attention-based Conv-LSTM module to extract the spatial and short-term temporal features. The attention mechanism is properly designed to distinguish the importance of flow sequences at different times by automatically assigning different weights. Secondly, to further explore long-term temporal features, we propose a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) module to extract daily and weekly periodic features so as to capture variance tendency of the traffic flow from both previous and posterior directions. Finally, extensive experimental results are presented to show that the proposed model combining the attention Conv-LSTM and Bi-LSTM achieves better prediction performance compared with other existing approaches.},

However, in existing methods, anchors are generally predefined empirically, degrading robustness to complex scenarios with various sizes and orientation variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention Anchor Mechanism (AAM), especially targeting at predicting appropriate anchors for each pixel. To be concrete, we regard a series of predefined anchors as basic anchors and utilize an attention model to predict weights corresponding to basic anchors. Consequently, the weighted sum of basic anchors in each pixel can obtain a predicted anchor. In this way, the gap between the predicted anchors and the corresponding ground truth boxes could be narrowed, making the network easier to regress. For facilitating the design of basic anchors, we adopt a dimension-decomposition mechanism to predict width, height, and angle of anchors, respectively. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

To overcome these limitations, we present a method for jointly estimating disparity and confidence from stereo image pairs through deep networks. We accomplish this through a minmax optimization to learn the generative cost aggregation networks and discriminative confidence estimation networks in an adversarial manner. Concretely, the generative cost aggregation networks are trained to accurately generate disparities at both confident and unconfident pixels from an input matching cost that are indistinguishable by the discriminative confidence estimation networks, while the discriminative confidence estimation networks are trained to distinguish the confident and unconfident disparities. In addition, to fully exploit complementary information of matching cost, disparity, and color image in confidence estimation, we present a dynamic fusion module.

Real driving, virtual driving and computer simulation experiments were conducted to collect human-vehicle-environment dynamic data in two-lane roads.

  abstract     = {Semantic scene labeling plays a very important role in intelligent transportation tasks, such as autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance. Recently, thanks to the advances of deep learning, significant improvements have been achieved for this pixel-wise labeling task. Although effective, current methods lack of explicitly modeling the boundary of objects, resulting in inaccurate labeling results. Meanwhile, traditional level set based methods perform better to capture the evolution of boundaries. However, they are sensitive to the model initialization. To address these issues, in this work we propose a novel deep learning framework, named deep nested level set (DNLS) for boundary-aware semantic scene labeling. Different from previous works, our proposed framework explicitly takes deep learned features and object boundary information into account. More specifically, our proposed framework first predicts semantic probability maps and boundary locations of objects using a bifurcated fully convolutional network (BFCN). Then, these probability maps are seamlessly integrated into a nested level set function for accurate scene labeling. As a result, our approach can automatically initialize the nested level set function, and the whole framework can be trained in an end-to-end manner, providing a new solution for accurate semantic scene parsing. Extensive experiments on public CamVid and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework produces high-quality predictions with clear object boundaries and spatial consistency.},

In our previous study, the magnetic guidance approach based on magnetic dipole model and non-linear optimization algorithm was proposed, which has high positioning accuracy and could estimate the yaw angle of AGV directly. However, the localization accuracy of the magnetic guidance approach will deteriorate if the magnetic nails (MNs) buried in the ground have installation errors or the magnetic moments between the MNs are inconsistent.

  abstract     = {In emergencies close to a T-shaped street junction (TSJ), pedestrian overcrowding and trampling are typical unstable situations triggered by external disturbances, potentially leading to serious casualties during crowd movement. It is significant to analyze the pedestrian flow stability to achieve safe and efficient crowd evacuation. To analyze the stability of crowd flow, this study uses the two-dimensional Aw-Rascle dynamic-flow model to build the pedestrian merging dynamics at a TSJ area. Then the principle of the Lyapunov stability criterion in modern control theory is employed to analyze the stability of the pedestrian crowd. A novel stability criterion for an asymmetric pedestrian merging layout at a TSJ is then proposed. When the crowd acceleration in the local area exceeds the critical acceleration, the crowd will evolve to an unstable state. To validate this criterion, numerical simulations of a case study of a crowd stampede with serious casualties (1703 victims reported) occurring at a TSJ area in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, during the Hajj in 2015 is implemented. To build stable acceleration regimes, this paper tunes the key parameters of the number of pedestrians, width ratio of main street to branch street, and pedestrian drop-off location along the street 223, and discusses the stable ranges of acceleration to satisfy the pedestrian stability criterion. This criterion and the experimental results can supply new information to control pedestrian flow and keep it stable.},

  abstract     = {Smooth handling of pedestrian interactions is a key requirement for Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Such systems call for early and accurate prediction of a pedestrian’s crossing/not-crossing behaviour in front of the vehicle. Existing approaches to pedestrian behaviour prediction make use of pedestrian motion, his/her location in a scene and static context variables such as traffic lights, zebra crossings etc. We stress on the necessity of early prediction for smooth operation of such systems. We introduce the influence of vehicle interactions on pedestrian intention for this purpose. In this paper, we show a discernible advance in prediction time aided by the inclusion of such vehicle interaction context. We apply our methods to two different datasets, one in-house collected - NTU dataset and another public real-life benchmark - JAAD dataset. We also propose a generalization of the Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (LDCRF), called Factored LDCRF (FLDCRF), for improved sequence prediction performance. FLDCRF outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks across the datasets over identical time-series features. While the existing best system predicts pedestrian stopping behaviour with 70% accuracy 0.38 seconds before the actual events, our system achieves such accuracy at least 0.9 seconds on an average before the actual events across datasets.},

We then extend our idea to consider a rectangular grid and also real-life road networks where some of the links may be absent. We present a traffic distribution algorithm that would minimize the average time of all vehicles to reach the given destination point. Simulation of our algorithm using SUMO on the grid-structured road map of Manhattan borough in New York city and also on a part of non-grid road map of city of Carbondale, IL USA shows a much shorter average travel time compared to the existing popular algorithms based on dynamic traffic assignments (DTA). The proposed technique is also robust in the sense that even with 20% deviation from optimal assignment of traffic distribution at cross-points, we get significantly better results compared to the existing traffic distribution policies. We then propose a congestion control technique based on detouring of vehicles and show how variable link delay as a function of the volume of traffic flow through a link can be incorporated in our traffic distribution policy.

  abstract     = {The airline crew rostering problem (CRP) is significant for balancing the workload of crew and for improving the satisfaction rate of crew’s preferences, which is related to the fairness and satisfaction of crew. However, most existing work considers only one objective on fairness or satisfaction. In this study, we propose a new practical model for CRP that takes both fairness and satisfaction into account simultaneously. To solve the multi-objective CRP efficiently, we develop an ant colony system (ACS) algorithm based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) framework, termed multi-objective ACS (MOACS). The main contributions of MOACS lie in three aspects. Firstly, two ant colonies are utilized to optimize fairness and satisfaction objectives, respectively. Secondly, a new hybrid complementary heuristic strategy with three kinds of heuristic information schemes is proposed to avoid ant colonies focusing only on their own objectives. Ant colonies randomly choose one of the three schemes to help explore the Pareto front (PF) sufficiently. Thirdly, a local search strategy with two types of local search respectively for fairness and satisfaction is designed to further approach the global PF. The MOACS is applied to seven real-world monthly CRPs with different sizes from a major North-American airline. Experimental results show that MOACS generally outperforms the greedy algorithm and some other popular multi-objective optimization algorithms, especially on large-scale instances.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses the application of coalitional model predictive control (MPC) to freeways traffic networks, where the goal is reducing the time spent by the drivers through a dynamic setting of variable speed limits (VSL) and ramp metering. The prediction model METANET is used to represent the traffic flows evolution. The system behavior and objective function lead to a non-convex and non-linear optimization problem, which can only be solved in a centralized fashion for small networks. The underlying motivation of this paper is the continued advance of clustering methods in the control of large-scale and spatially distributed systems. The global freeway system is partitioned into a set of coupled sub-stretches, which in turn are assigned to the different agents involved in the control problem. These local controllers can dynamically assemble into coalitions to take coordinated measures. In this work, a top-down approach is considered: the bottom layer consists of the set of controllers that compute the VSL and ramp-metering across time; and the supervisory layer changes periodically the information exchange structure to promote coalitions of those controllers that bring greater performance to the global system. In this way, a balance is sought between optimality and efficiency. Finally, the coalitional approach is simulated on a stretch of traffic freeway where cooperation with adjacent sub-stretches is allowed.},

This study expands the traditional headway-based, bus holding models to cater for the planned arrival times of electric buses at the respective charging points. To this end, this study models - for the first time - the bus holding problem for electric buses considering the scheduled charging times in the objective function. Additionally, it introduces an analytic solution that can return an optimal holding decision in real-time. Our approach is tested using realistic data from bus line 15 in Amsterdam demonstrating a significant reduction of charging delays with only a marginal increase of the average passenger waiting times when compared to existing holding strategies. Its closed-form expression is suitable for real-time holding control and can be applied to obtain a reliable solution or perform stochastic optimization in the case of travel time uncertainty.},

The signal controllers collect vehicle data through vehicle to infrastructure communications and find optimal signal timing parameters and vehicle speeds to maximize network throughput while harmonizing speeds. Connected and automated vehicles receive these dynamically assigned speeds, accept them, and implement them. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear program and accounts for the trade-offs between maximizing the network throughput and minimizing speed variations in the network to improve the network operational performance and at the same time smoothen the traffic flow by harmonizing the speed and reducing the number of stops at signalized intersections. A distributed optimization scheme is developed to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed program, and effective coordination ensures near-optimality of the solutions. The case study results show that the proposed algorithm works in real-time and provides near-optimal solutions with a maximum optimality gap of 5.4%. The proposed algorithm is implemented in Vissim. The results show that coordinated signal timing and speed optimization improved network performance in comparison with cases that either signal timing parameters or average speed of vehicles are optimized. The coordinated approach reduced the travel time, average delay, average number of stops, and average delay at stops by 1.9%, 5.3%, 28.5%, and 5.4%, respectively compared to the case that only signal timing parameters are optimized.},

  abstract     = {For efficient communication among vehicles or infrastructure, an effective routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems is profoundly required. Because of high mobility and recurrent topology deviations of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANets), finding a linked route with adequate delay is an important challenge with many limits and hitches. To overcome this, an efficient multimetric routing protocol is proposed here for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed protocol considers five metrics - Link Capacity, Connectivity, Euclidean Distance, Relative Velocity and End-to-End Delay. The aim of the proposed method is maximizing the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) while minimizing the delay of the network. It tries to identify the path that has minimum delay, distance and relative velocity with maximum bandwidth and V2V connectivity. For this, the protocol adopts Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) to optimize the five metrics and calculate the fitness value. Then the fitness value is used to find out the optimal path using a novel path finding algorithm for efficient data delivery to the target destination. Extensive simulation outcomes disclose that the proposed strategy shows an improvement of 6% in PDR, 11% in end-to-end delay and 2% improvement in hop-count as compared to the recent similar method.},

  abstract     = {In the context of pro-active traffic management, real-time crash risk evaluation is one of the most critical components. Signalized intersections are well-known high-risk locations because of the variety of traffic movements, modes, and their interactions. Unlike access-controlled freeways, the traffic flow at signalized intersections presents cyclical characteristics, which are temporally separated by traffic signals. Therefore, the data preparation for real-time crash risk prediction at signalized intersections should be based on the signal cycle rather than a predefined fixed time interval (e.g., 5 minutes). In this research, the corresponding signal cycles where crashes occurred were verified based on high-resolution event-based data (i.e., Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM)). Six types of real-time cycle-level factors were considered, including traffic volume, signal timing, headway and occupancy, traffic variation between upstream and downstream detectors, shockwave characteristics, and weather. Two undersampling strategies, matched case-control and random undersampling, were utilized to develop conditional logistic and binary logistic models, respectively. Model results indicate that the random undersampling performs better than the matched case-control method. It was found that higher cycle volume, overall average flow ratio across lanes, arrivals on yellow ratio, traffic volatility across approach sections, as well as longer cycle length and lower green ratio could significantly increase the odds of crash occurrence at signalized intersections. Moreover, longer maximum queue length, bigger shockwave, and higher absolute queuing shockwave speed tend to increase the odds of crash occurrence.},

Revolving around the 3D point clouds generated from LiDARs, plentiful algorithms have been developed for object detection/tracking, environmental mapping, or localization. However, a LiDAR’s ranging performance suffers under adverse weather (e.g. fog, rain, snow etc.), which impedes full autonomous driving in all weather conditions. This article focuses on analyzing the performance of a typical time-of-flight (ToF) LiDAR under fog environment. By controlling the fog density within CEREMA Adverse Weather Facility, the relations between the ranging performance and fogs are both qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. Furthermore, based on the collected data, a machine learning based model is trained to predict the minimum fog visibility that allows successful ranging for this type of LiDAR. The revealed experimental results and methods are helpful for ToF LiDAR specifications from automotive industry.},

  abstract     = {Charging infrastructure deployment is to seek the proper plan of settling charging stations and charging piles under multiple constraints, such as recharging demand, cruising range, etc., and it has been asserted as an NP-Complete problem. In this paper, we propose a multicriteria-oriented approach of efficiently deploying charging infrastructure to cope with the problem. We firstly formulate five realistic charging objective functions that exhibit a significant diminishing returns effect, i.e., submodularity, and then exploit the submodularity of these objectives to design the acceleration algorithms for Charging Station PLacement (CSPL) with the provable performance guarantees. The corresponding algorithms are respectively named Lazy Greedy with Direct Gain (LGDG) and Lazy Greedy with Effective Gain (LGEG), and they scale well to the road networks of arbitrary size. Relying on the inference that the linear combination of submodular functions is still a submodular function, we treat CSPL as a multicriteria optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by the proposed algorithms. Moreover, we employ Erlang-Loss system to gain an optimal Charging Pile ASsignment (CPAS), which is capable of reducing the gap between the growing complexity of charging demands and the constrained supply of charging resources in considering the correlation between the primary human activities and the charging process. The experimental evaluation with real data sets shows that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach reveals better effectiveness and efficiency, and it offers a potent solution to the planning of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles with large-scale datasets in reality.},

To address uncertain EV availability, we use regression models trained on historical data to predict departures. More sophisticated regression models show higher prediction accuracy. We improve a smart charging heuristic by incorporating these predictions. Simulations show accurate predictions improve EV prioritization and thus fair share.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have provided promising opportunities to solve problems in urban traffic. With the help of IoT technologies, online data from road segments are captured by monitoring devices, while real-time data from vehicles are collected through preinstalled sensors. Based on these data, a CPS model is constructed to depict real-time status and dynamic behavior of road segments and vehicles. An online learning data-driven model is developed to extract prior knowledge and enhance collaboration between road segments and vehicles by combining short-term traffic forecasting and real-time routing optimization. A case study based on Xi’an city is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the travel time with reasonable computation time, without much compromising the travel distance and fuel consumption. This work potentially strengthens the transparency and intelligence of urban traffic systems.},

First, the adaptive cruise control (ACC) problem is formulated as a linear quadratic optimal control, and an optimal control law containing the longitudinal acceleration of the target vehicle is derived. Then, a certain number of individual car-following styles are predefined on the basis of the proposed optimal cruise controller. Thereafter, a car-following style learning algorithm is proposed to quantify the closeness of the predefined individual car-following style to the specific driver, and a proper style is thus determined for the specific driver by using this learning algorithm. On the basis of the learned car-following style, the proposed optimal cruise controller can adapt itself to individual car-following style. Finally, the proposed self-learning optimal cruise controller is evaluated through simulation and experimental tests. Results show that the control behavior of the proposed self-learning optimal controller is closer to that of the human driver than that of a factory-installed ACC.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates a dynamic flow model for crowd evacuation at T-shaped street junctions (TSJs) from a macroscopic view. The Aw-Rascle traffic flow model is modified by constructing an impact matrix in the street intersection area to practically describe the crowd convergence mechanism at a TSJ. For coherence, this modified model is proved to be anisotropic, similar to the original Aw-Rascle traffic flow model. To describe real scenarios with higher crowd density and lower speeds during organized pilgrimages, the initial Gaussian distribution of the crowd is improved to a higher-order smoothing function. To validate the modified Aw-Rascle traffic flow model, we reconstruct the drastic stampede that occurred at the TSJ of streets 204 and 223 during the 2015 Mecca pilgrimage. Further, the main environmental parameters that potentially lead to a stampede are discussed with numerical simulations. A valuable suggestion is that the street width ratio should be extended from 1.1 to 1.4 to prevent stampedes, matching the expansion engineering of street 204 reported by BBC News. An interesting phenomenon is that the closer the bus unloading location on street 223 is to the TSJ center, the lower the maximum crowd density and the safer the pedestrians will be. With this modified Aw-Rascle flow model at TSJs, this paper provides strategic and technical suggestions for future crowd flow control to reduce the risk of crowd stampedes.},

The widespread use of cars prompts the search for new technologies and systems to ensure road safety, such as driving assistance systems, driver monitoring devices and driver training programs. For a number of these systems, driving maneuver recognition is a core function indispensable for correct operation. This paper addresses the problem of driving maneuver detection using smartphone sensors, especially accelerometers and gyroscopes. A framework based on a number of deep learning methods for maneuver classification and clustering was introduced. We studied 13 types of maneuvers. Three classifiers, each achieving good performance for recognizing the considered set of events, were selected, and their combination into an optimal set of classifiers was investigated. Our approach was tested on a real-world dataset, and achieved a good detection rate for 7 maneuvers with a balanced accuracy of 0.90 and an average F1 score of 0.71, which outperforms the other state-of-the-art recognition systems.},

However, the weak point of all these systems is their need for comprehensive and reliable data. For traffic data acquisition, two sources are currently available: 1) floating vehicles and 2) remote traffic microwave sensors (RTMS). The former consists of the use of mobile probe vehicles as mobile sensors, and the latter consists of a set of fixed point detectors installed in the roads. First, the structure of a three-layer BP neural network is designed to achieve the fusion of the floating car data (FCD) and the fixed detector data (FDD) efficiently. Second, in order to improve the accuracy of traffic speed estimation, a multi-source data fusion model that combines information from floating vehicles and microwave sensors, and that, by using GA-PSO-BP neural network is proposed. The proposed model has combined GA and PSO ingeniously. The hybrid model can not only overcome the difficulties of the traditional fusion model of its estimation inaccuracy, but also compensate the insufficiency of the traditional BP algorithm. Finally, this system has been tested and implemented on actual roads, and the simulation results show the accuracy of data has reached 98%.},

Deceleration, engine speed and corner turn test scenarios were performed on concrete paved test track while lane changing tests were conducted on a commercial asphalt highway. Despite the majority of studies relying on image, vehicle data and additional sensor fusion, here only the data streams received from vehicle CAN Bus system were used to train the proposed network architectures. After parsing the data into meaningful characteristic parameters, different LSTM and CNN architectures were trained by varying the number of layers, neurons and epoch number.

In the encoder-decoder model, we propose an hard attention mechanism based on learning similar patterns to enhance neuronal memory and reduce the accumulation of error propagation.

The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Inspired by recent work on low rank representation (LRR) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), we propose a Low Rank Dynamic Mode Decomposition (LRDMD) model which solves the aforementioned problems simultaneously. LRDMD predicts traffic flow by using a state transition matrix which characterizes the relationship between temporally neighboring fragments of traffic flow with low rank regularization. We conduct experiments of traffic flow prediction of different time intervals using loop coil detector data of Qingdao, and the results show that LRDMD outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Real-time video defogging has a huge demand in intelligent transportation, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), long-range surveillance, autonomous aerial vehicles and endoscopic surgery. Most of these applications are constrained by stringent frame rate, power and memory budget. Till date, the methods devised for such requirements are very rare. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient method and very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture for resource-constrained embedded system targeting real-time video defogging. The method and architecture are co-designed to achieve high throughput while consuming less resources and power. The architecture is divided into four parts namely, atmospheric light estimation unit, airlight adjustment unit, transmission estimation unit, and pixel restoration unit. The atmospheric light estimation unit employs a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$3\times 3$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; tile based approach that eliminates the requirement of large buffer memory for &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$15\times 15$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; support size. The transmission is estimated using dark channel prior and gradient threshold based Gaussian filtering approach. In order to overcome flickering artifacts, an adaptive airlight updating scheme is employed. From the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, it is observed that the proposed method outperforms the existing hardware approaches. Furthermore, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations of the architecture achieve a high throughput of 200 MPixels/s and 600 MPixels/s, respectively. The ASIC implementation dissipates 9.03 mW power at 200MHz. Moreover, the proposed design does not require any external memory such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), thus making it suitable for on-chip processing that can be closely integrated with an image sensor.},

We investigate the impact of different spatial partitioning techniques on the prediction performance of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, in the context of taxi demand-supply forecasting. We consider two tessellation schemes: (i) the variable-sized Voronoi tessellation, and (ii) the fixed-sized Geohash tessellation. While the widely employed ConvLSTM (Convolutional LSTM) method can model fixed-sized Geohash partitions, the standard convolutional filters cannot be applied on variable-sized Voronoi partitions. To explore the impact of the Voronoi strategy, we propose the use of a GraphLSTM (Graph-based LSTM) model, by representing the Voronoi spatial partitions as nodes on an arbitrarily structured graph. The GraphLSTM model offers competitive performance against the ConvLSTM model, at a lower computational complexity, across three real-world large-scale taxi demand-supply data sets, with different performance metrics. To ensure superior performance across diverse settings, a HEDGE based ensemble learning algorithm is applied over the ConvLSTM and the GraphLSTM networks.},

  abstract     = {Nonholonomic constraint (NHC) and odometer speed have been proven to significantly improve the navigation accuracy of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-aided inertial navigation system (INS) for land vehicular applications. Exploiting the full potential of the NHC and odometer aids requires the inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounting angles, i.e., angular misalignment with respect to the host vehicle, to be precisely known. We address the accurate estimation of the IMU mounting angles through an aided dead reckoning (DR) approach. In this method, DR using the GNSS/INS integrated attitude and distance traveled is fused with the GNSS/INS integrated position through a straightforward Kalman filter. Simulation and field tests are carried out to validate the proposed algorithm for different grade IMUs, including typical navigation-grade, tactical-grade and low-cost IMUs. The results demonstrate that the pitch and heading mounting angles can be estimated with a comparable accuracy with the GNSS/INS attitude solution, for example, 0.001° accuracy can be achieved for a navigation-grade GNSS/INS integrated system. The roll mounting angle can not be estimated due to lack of observability in this approach, and the heading mounting angle estimation may be influenced by the GNSS/INS heading accuracy drift to some extent for the low-cost IMUs.},

  abstract     = {As a critical component of traffic safety, violation detection and treatment can effectively reduce illegal driving so as to ensure the safety of our lives. In this system, both road-constrained target tracking and identification are involved, which are coupled. This is a constrained joint tracking and identification (CJTI) problem, and good solutions require addressing the two problems jointly. The recently proposed joint decision and estimation (JDE) framework and the conditional JDE (CJDE) approach have been proved to be superior for such problems involving coupled decision (identification) and estimation (tracking). Inspired by this, for CJTI of ground targets, this paper proposes a novel constrained CJDE approach. First, a hybrid CJTI system incorporating target dynamics, class characteristics and road constraints is formulated. Based on this, we propose a constrained CJDE risk converting a constrained tracking cost and a constrained identification risk into one framework. An optimal constrained CJDE solution containing an estimator and a decider is derived. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed constrained CJDE method. They show that by fully utilizing the constraint information and the coupling between tracking and identification, the constrained CJDE approach outperforms traditional two-step methods in joint performance.},

  abstract     = {Accelerating the performance of optimization algorithms is crucial for many day-to-day applications. Mobility-on-demand is one such application that is transforming urban mobility by offering reliable and convenient on-demand door-to-door transportation at any time. Dial-a-ride problem (DARP) is an underlying optimization problem in the operational planning of mobility-on-demand systems. The primary objective of DARP is to design routes and schedules to serve passenger transportation requests with high-level user comfort. DARP often arises in dynamic real-world scenarios, where rapid route planning is essential. The traditional CPU-based algorithms are generally too slow to be useful in practice. Since customers expect quick response for their mobility requests, there has been a growing interest in fast solution methods. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a GPU-based solution methodology for the dial-a-ride problem to produce good solutions in a short time. Specifically, we develop a GPU framework to accelerate time-critical neighborhood exploration of local search operations under the guidance of metaheuristics such as tabu search and variable neighborhood search. Besides, we propose device-oriented optimization strategies to enhance the utilization of a current-generation GPU architecture (Tesla P100). We report speedup achieved by our GPU approach when compared to its classical CPU counterpart, and the effect of each device optimization strategy on computational speedup. Results are based on standard test instances from the literature. Ultimately, the proposed GPU methodology generates better solutions in a short time when compared to the existing sequential approaches.},

At the outer level, the signal settings in the periphery of the congested region are optimized to meter the number of vehicles entering the congested region; while at the inner level, traffic flow distribution within the congested region is adjusted to improve the traffic efficiency. MFAC scheme is applied in both outer level and inner level to derive the detailed signal settings in the congested region and in the periphery of the congested region.

In order to speed up the package delivery process without increasing the delivery cost, a promising system has been proposed, which leverages the crowdsourced taxis. Many efforts have been done on this novel system in recent literature. However, a fundamental problem still remains open, i.e., measuring the maximum capacity of taxi-based logistics at the urban scale. In this paper, we first propose an accurate and efficient measurement mechanism to tackle this problem in the Non-stop package delivery method. The basic idea is to construct a spatial-temporal graph according to the passenger demands and calculate the maximum urban capacity by combining the results of several carefully designed max-flow problems. Then, we expand our measurement mechanism to be used in other taxi-based package delivery methods after a few adaptations, including the One-hop method and the Stop-and-wait method. At last, we evaluate our measurement mechanism and compare the maximum urban capacity of various package delivery methods with a real-world dataset from an online taxi-taking platform.},

While benefiting from convenience, users may suffer privacy leak risk, due to publishing sensitive information, i.e., locations, to servers. Previous studies have proposed a number of methods for protecting LBS. Through providing provable privacy protection, Private Information Retrieval (PIR) becomes well-known for its high effectiveness in protecting privacy. However, the PIR-protected LBS must cautiously handle the consequent transmission/computation cost and service error brought by adopting PIR, as both of them impact user experience. Then an important question arises: Can the user experience of PIR-protected LBS be greatly improved? We answer it by presenting a novel interface from PIR to LBS, gaining benefits from road networks. The proposed interface is comprised of two road partition methods fully considering POI’s distribution along roads, and two response-calculating methods to satisfy users’ requirements on driving distance. Since Vehicular Location Based Services contain adequate road network knowledge, we accomplish our work on them. The experimental results on a real dataset validate that our interface can improve PIR-protected LBS greatly in user experience while protecting privacy.},

If a vessel experiences disruption occurrences either at ports of call or in sea, the liner shipping company is required to decide on the schedule recovery action to execute in order to recover the resulting delays. This study formulates a novel mathematical model for the vessel schedule recovery problem (VSRP) in liner shipping. The objective aims to minimize the total profit loss, suffered by the liner shipping company due to disruption occurrences at a given liner shipping route. A total of four recovery strategies are considered in the model, which include: (1) vessel sailing speed adjustment; (2) vessel handling rate adjustment; (3) port skipping without container diversion; and (4) port skipping with container diversion. The proposed mathematical formulation for the nonlinear VSRP model is solved to the global optimality using BARON. A set of computational experiments are further performed for the Middle East/Pakistan/India-West Mediterranean (WM3) route, which is served by the OOCL liner shipping company, for various scenarios of disruption occurrences in sea and at ports. The results from the performed analyses demonstrate potential benefits for liner shipping companies from using the proposed methodology for various realistic scenarios of disruptions.},

By estimating the global rate at which nearby smartphones send PRs, Wi-Fi sensors can estimate crowd counts. The core contribution of this paper is a computationally tractable method that forecasts crowd counts up to thirty minutes in the future, with forecasts becoming available as soon as two hours of data are available. The forecasting method relies on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Contributions also include two methods that compute prediction intervals associated with the forecasts, one of which is based upon generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. Recent real-world data from Winter Wonders 2018/2019 (an event that took place in Brussels, Belgium) notably demonstrate that the proposed forecasting method outperforms its immediate variations as well as baseline models (i.e., random walk models).},

  abstract     = {Ground plane context is an essential semantic information in on-road pedestrian detection task. Due to viewpoint geometry constraints, pedestrians only appear in certain regions of the image, which is close to the horizon area of the ground plane. As a result, the lacking to ground plane context information may cause pedestrian detection system suffering from severe false alarm (i.e. high false positive (FP) rate). For Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), high FP rate not only distracts the driver, but also causes frequent unexpected braking to damage the vehicle’s hardware. In this paper, a novel pedestrian detection method called ground plane context aggregation network (GPCAnet) is proposed, which integrates ground plane context information into deep learning based detector to drastically reduce the FP rate. The proposed GPCAnet consists of two modules: i) a ground area predication (GAP) branch is appended on top of convolutional feature map of the backbone network, in parallel with existing branches, for region proposal, classification and bounding box regression; ii) based on GAP, a ground-region proposal network (GRPN) is designed to filter FP cases in order to reduce computations. To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed GPCAnet, experiments on day and night on-road pedestrian detection are performed on both visible and far infrared pedestrian detection datasets, e.g. Caltech and SCUT. Experimental results show that GPCAnet achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods, while drastically reducing FP rate in pedestrian detection.},

  abstract     = {Short-term traffic forecasting is important for the development of an intelligent traffic management system. Critical to the performance of the traffic prediction model utilized in such a system is accurate representation of the spatiotemporal traffic characteristics. This can be achieved by integrating spatiotemporal traffic information or the dynamic traffic characteristics in the modeling process. The currently employed spatiotemporal k-nearest neighbor (STKNN) model is based on the spatial heterogeneity and adaptive spatiotemporal parameters of the traffic to improve the prediction accuracy. However, the non-stationary characteristics of the traffic cannot be fully represented by simply modeling the entire time range or all the time partitions based on experience. We therefore developed a dynamic STKNN model (D-STKNN) for short-term traffic forecasting based on the non-stationary spatiotemporal pattern of the road traffic. The different traffic patterns along the road are first automatically determined using an affinity propagation clustering algorithm. The Warped K-Means algorithm is then used to automatically partition the time periods for each traffic pattern. Finally, the D-STKNN model is developed based on the three-dimensional spatiotemporal tensor data models for the different road segments with different traffic patterns during different time periods. The D-STKNN model was verified through extensive experiments performed using actual vehicular speed datasets collected from city roads in Beijing, China, and expressways in California, U.S.A. The proposed model outperforms existing seven baselines in different time periods under different traffic patterns. The results confirmed the imperative of considering the non-stationary spatiotemporal traffic pattern in developing a model for short-term traffic prediction.},

In this paper, we start with a cooperative routing problem, which aims to minimize the chance of road network breakdown. To address this problem, we propose a subgradient method, which can be naturally implemented as a semi-centralized pricing approach. Particularly, each road link adopts the pricing scheme to calculate and adjust the local toll regularly, while the vehicles update their routes to minimize the toll costs by exploiting the global toll information. To prevent the potential oscillation brought by the subgradient method, we introduce a heavy-ball method to further improve the performance of the pricing approach. We then test both the basic and improved pricing approaches in a real road network, and simultaneously compare them with several baselines. The experimental results demonstrate that, our approaches significantly outperform others, by comprehensively evaluating them in terms of various metrics including average travel time and travel distance, winners and losers, potential congestion occurrence, last arrival time, toll costs and average traffic flows, with two different O-D profiles.},

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EV) impact urban networks both when driving (e.g., noise and pollution reduction) and charging. For the electrical grid, the flexibility of EV charging makes it a significant actor in “Demand Response” mechanisms. Therefore, there is a need to design incentive mechanisms to foster customer engagement. A congestion game approach is adopted to evaluate the performance of such electrical transportation system with multiple classes of vehicles: EV and Gasoline Vehicles. Both temporal and energy operating costs are considered. The latter is nonseparable as it depends on the global charging need of all EV, which is scheduled in time by a centralized aggregator in function of nonflexible consumption at charging location. Thus, driving and charging decisions are coupled. An adaptation of Beckmann’s method proves the existence of a Wardrop Equilibrium (WE) in the considered nonseparable congestion game; this WE is unique when the charging unit price is an increasing function of the global charging need. A condition on the nonflexible load is given to guarantee the monotonicity of this function. This condition is tested on real consumption data in France and in Texas, USA. Optimal tolls are used to control this electrical transportation system and then computed in order to minimize an environmental cost on a simple network topology.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the behavior of an energy consumption model for electric vehicles in presence of input uncertainty, that is under heterogeneous driving behaviors and traffic conditions, or at varied performances of technology and operating scenarios. In fact, these sources of uncertainty are often neglected in customary applications, i.e. the model is evaluated only around nominal conditions, thus inhibiting the model’s ability to capture the intrinsic variability of energy consumptions observed in real driving. Therefore, a general framework to perform global and regionalized sensitivity analysis on energy consumption models is here formulated and applied to identify which model inputs contribute the most to the variance of simulated energy consumption and recovery, and which input values lead to average or extreme model outputs. Results proved that driving behaviors and traffic flow dynamics have the greatest impact on simulated consumption and show strong interaction effects with the parameters of the regenerative braking strategy with respect to the recovered energy. While the vehicle weight and the auxiliary systems have an increasing impact at lower speeds, the technology performances and the vehicle characteristics were proved to be non-influential at all. Ultimately, the model was validated against its ability to reproduce the variability of consumptions observed in field experiments. Results show a tendency to over-estimating average consumption and underestimating average recovery, i.e. the model predictions are conservative. In addition, evidence shows that there are un-modeled details of the regenerative braking strategy to be further investigated via future experimental analyses.},

  abstract     = {Changing lanes is a commonly-used technique for drivers to either overtake slow-moving cars or enter/exit highway ramps. Optional lane changes may save drivers travel time but increase the risk of collision with others. Drivers make such decisions based on experience and emotion rather than analysis, and thus may fail to select the best solution while in a dynamic state of flux. Unlike human drivers, autonomous vehicles can systematically analyze their surroundings and make real-time decisions accordingly. This paper develops a game theory-based lane-changing model by comparing two types of optimization methods. To realize our expectations, we need to first investigate the payoff function of drivers in discretionary lane-changing maneuvers and then quantify it in an equation of costs that trades-off safety and time-saving. After the evaluation for each alternative strategy combination, the results show that there exists a social gap in the discretionary lane-changing game. To deal with that problem, we provide some suggestions for future policy as well as autonomous vehicle controller designs, offering solutions to reduce the impact of disturbances and crashes caused by inappropriate lane changes, and also, inspire further research about more complex cases.},

The relevant components and required technologies of the CPS concept in intelligent transportation systems are introduced firstly. Under this framework, each CAV is considered as an independent CPS. In the safe driving of vehicles, historical data is used to build vehicle behavior prediction models and dynamic driving system models. At the same time, a new range strategy considering the probability of merging behavior is proposed and applied to the CAV’s safe cruise control.

Although cameras mounted on a vehicle are calibrated in the manufacturing process, their orientation angles are subject to tilting because of continuing vibration and external impact. To solve the problem, this paper presents an online calibration algorithm for camera orientation estimation using motion vectors and three-dimensional geometry. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: i) driving direction estimation by calculating an intersection of motion vectors, ii) camera orientation estimation based on 3-line random sample consensus (RANSAC) using the estimated intersection, and iii) final orientation decision using extended Kalman filter from the result of each frame. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm stably estimates camera orientation angles from motion vectors and lines under the parallelism and orthogonality assumptions.},

  abstract     = {There have been explosive developments in automatic driving in recent years. Several kinds of self-driving vehicles have been introduced, but drivers are generally required to stay alert and put their hands on the steering wheel during automatic driving, which means the vehicle is in a state of human-machine cooperative control. Hence personalization is needed to reduce conflicts between driver and machine. To achieve personalized automatic driving, a combined hierarchy learning framework (CHLF) based on gated recurrent units (GRU) and safety field is developed in this paper. Learning-based methods are gaining attention in the development of automatic vehicles. However, automatic driving based on neural networks is risky due to poor interpretability. To overcome this limitation, we divided the network into three layers according to function to achieve a hierarchy. We combine data- and mechanism-oriented methods to make the CHLF reliable and stable. Lane-changing (LC) driving data collected from real-vehicle field experiments are used to train the CHLF, which learns from the data to capture human driver behavior in LC. To verify the performance of the CHLF, a group of driver-in-the-loop experiments is conducted based on a driving simulation test bench. The results show that the CHLF can reduce driver steering output torque compared to the conventional method, which means there is less conflict between driver and machine during automatic LC, and the driver is more relaxed.},

An ensemble clustering method is proposed to abstract the common OD pairs by fully considering link-based information, and the nonnegative tensor factorization model is adopted to effectively extract and visualize quantitatively the mobility patterns of OD pairs. This is attained by using multi-layered analysis such as of traffic demand, traffic accessibility and traffic congestion to enable different visual and quantitative mobility patterns. In the case study of Beijing, these patterns were analyzed and discussed by temporal and spatial factors. The results of the various patterns show explicitly when and where to provide remedies to traffic problems, by time and space. This is analogue, to some extent, to detecting and treating black spots of road accidents.

In this new method, an improved DQN structure was developed as a decision-making network to reduce the complexity of the control law for the path following of a three-degree of freedom USV model. An exploring function was proposed based on the adaptive gradient descent to extract the training knowledge for the DQN from the empirical data. In addition, a new reward function was designed to evaluate the output decisions of the DQN, and hence, to reinforce the decision-making network in controlling the USV path following. Numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The analysis results demonstrate that the proposed SCDRL converges more smoothly than the traditional deep Q learning while the path following error of the SCDRL is comparable to existing methods.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown excellent performance for vision-based lane detection. However, maintaining the performance of the trained models under new test scenarios still remains challenging due to the dataset bias between the training and test datasets; In lane detection processes, the dataset bias can be categorized into lane position bias and lane pattern bias, with the former one particularly influences the lane detection performance. To tackle this dataset bias, this article proposes a unified viewpoint transformation (UVT) method that transforms the camera viewpoints of different datasets into a common virtual world coordinate system, such that the mismatched lane position distributions can be effectively aligned. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets including the Caltech [1] , Tusimple [2] , and KITTI [3] dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the UVT algorithm in improving the lane detection performance on the test datasets. Moreover, by incorporating the UVT into other techniques that tackling the dataset bias, the lane position and pattern differences are disentangled and separately minimized. As a result, the performance gap between the training data and the test scenarios can be bridged. Specifically, the model trained on the KITTI dataset have achieved high performance in the Tusimple and the Caltech dataset (F1-score: 84.8 and 87.1%). With the proposed algorithm, a lane detection model trained on one dataset can be effectively applied to datasets with different camera settings in vastly different localities, and achieve better generalization ability compared to the state of the art methods.},

  abstract     = {Achieving the high accuracy of blind roads and crosswalks recognition is important for blind guiding equipment to help blind people sense the surrounding environment. A lightweight semantic segmentation network is proposed to quickly and accurately segment blind roads and crosswalks in a complex road environment. Specifically, a lightweight network with depthwise separable convolution as a component is used as a basic module to reduce the number of parameters of the model and increase the speed of semantic segmentation. In order to ensure the segmentation accuracy of the network, we use a densely connected atrous spatial pyramid pooling module to extract feature information of different angles and context feature modules to enhance the effectiveness of different levels of feature information fusion. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we collect and produce a data set from a real environment, which contains two objects of blind roads and crosswalks 1 . Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to some state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed approach greatly improves the segmentation speed, while achieving better or similar accuracy, which shows that the proposed approach provides a better basis for the application of devices for guiding the blind. 1https://github.com/qweawq/Blind-road-and-crosswalk-dataset},

  abstract     = {The recent development in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication opens a new opportunity to improve the positioning performance of the road users. We explore the benefit of connecting the raw data of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) from the agents. In urban areas, GNSS positioning is highly degraded due to signal blockage and reflection. 3D building model can play a major role in mitigating the GNSS multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) effects. To combine the benefits of 3D models and V2X, we propose a novel 3D mapping aided (3DMA) GNSS-based collaborative positioning method that makes use of the available surrounding GNSS receivers’ measurements. By complementarily integrating the ray-tracing based 3DMA GNSS and the double difference technique, the random errors (such as multipath and NLOS) are mitigated while eliminating the systematic errors (such as atmospheric delay and satellite clock/orbit biases) between road user. To improve the accuracy and robustness of the collaborative algorithm, factor graph optimization (FGO) is employed to optimize the positioning solutions among agents. Multiple low-cost GNSS receivers are used to collect both static and dynamic data in Hong Kong and to evaluate the proposed algorithm by post-processing. We reduce the GNSS positioning error from over 30 meters to less than 10 meters for road users in a deep urban canyon.},

  abstract     = {The leader-following consensus method is studied in the connected vehicle systems (CVSs) with the constant time delay. Based on the neighboring vehicle information, the distributed control protocols are designed for the second-order CVSs with the time delay. The necessary and sufficient conditions of internal stability are derived, in which the relationship between the controller parameters and eigenvalues of the Laplician matrix of the network topology is revealed in absence of time delays. Based on such conditions, the sufficient conditions of internal stability are derived and the resulting thresholds of the controller gains are obtained, which are independent of general network topologies. For the CVSs in the presence of the time delay, the necessary and sufficient conditions of internal stability are also derived and the explicit time-delay upper boundary is also given. The two main results are applied to PLF topology and achieve the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions of internal stability in both the absence and presence of time-delays cases. Considering influence of perturbations, the conditions of the string stability are further derived under the PLF topology, which can ensure perturbations are not amplified downstream, besides guaranteeing stability of the CVSs. Considering time delays and perturbations simultaneously, furthermore, the conditions of both internal stability and string stability are obtained for the PLF topology. Such conditions only depend on the controller parameters and the network weights. So it is convenient to tune the threshold of the controller parameters and determine the time-delay boundary. Simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results.},

Many advantages arise from grouping vehicles in platoons with a small inter-vehicle distance, such as energy savings, congestion reduction, and safety improvements. However, due to the diversity of involved stakeholders, numerous objectives have to be balanced to leverage the full potential of platooning. Furthermore, these objectives also depend on various factors that influence their optimization. The vast majority of existent literature only targets a subset of related objectives and underlying factors. This paper provides an overview which categorizes objectives and influencing factors.

  abstract     = {Since the early 20 th century, inventors have conceptualized “plane cars” and other urban aerial transportation. Emerging innovations in electrification, automation, and other technologies are enabling new opportunities for on-demand air mobility, business models, and aircraft design. Urban air mobility (UAM) envisions a safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation system for passenger mobility, goods delivery, and emergency services within or traversing metropolitan areas. This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) “flying car” concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment; community acceptance; and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts. UAM also could be limited by infrastructure and airspace management needs, as well as business model constraints. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on sustainability, social and economic impacts, airspace integration, and other topics.},

  abstract     = {Considering post-disaster scenarios for intelligent traffic management and damage assessment where communication infrastructure may not be available, we advocate a swarm-of-drones mesh communication architecture that can sustain in-network connectivity among drones. The connectivity sustenance requirement stems from the fact that drones may move to various locations in response to service requests but they still need to cooperate for data collection and transmissions. To address this need, we propose a fully distributed connectivity maintenance heuristic which enables the swarm to quickly adapt its formation in response to the service requests. To select the moving drone(s) that would bring minimal overhead in terms of time and moving distance, the connected dominating set (CDS) concept from graph theory is utilized. Specifically, a variation of CDS, namely E-CDS, is introduced to address the needs of 3-D mobile swarm-of-drones. We then show that E-CDS is NP-Complete and propose a new distributed heuristic to solve it. Once the E-CDS is determined in advance, drones not part of this E-CDS set are picked for movement tasks. When the movement is to cause any disconnection with the rest of the swarm, other drones are also relocated to restore the connectivity. The proposed heuristics are implemented in ns-3 network simulator as part of the existing IEEE 802.11s mesh standard and the effectiveness is tested in terms of providing undisturbed services under different conditions. The results indicate that the proposed distributed heuristic almost matches the performance of a centralized solution and suits perfectly the needs of post-disaster traffic management.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the feasibility of sending drones to deliver goods from a depot to a customer by solving what we call the Mission-Feasibility Problem (MFP). Due to payload constraints, the drone can serve only one customer at a time. To this end, we propose a novel framework based on time-dependent cost graphs to properly model the MFP and tackle the delivery dynamics. When the drone moves in the delivery area, the global wind may change thereby affecting the drone&#39;s energy consumption, which in turn can increase or decrease. This issue is addressed by designing three algorithms, namely: (i) compute the route of minimum energy once, at the beginning of the mission, (ii) dynamically reconsider the most convenient trip towards the destination, and (iii) dynamically select only the best local choice. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data. The changes in the drone&#39;s energy consumption are reflected by changes in the cost of the edges of the graphs. The algorithms receive the new costs every time the drone flies over a new vertex, and they have no full knowledge in advance of the weights. We compare them in terms of the percentage of missions that are completed with success (the drone delivers the goods and comes back to the depot), with delivered (the drone delivers the goods but cannot come back to the depot), and with failure (the drone neither delivers the goods nor comes back to the depot).},

To justify public investment, UAM must serve urban mobility by carrying a significant portion of urban traffic. We develop a traffic demand analysis method to estimate the maximum number of people that can benefit from UAM, for a given use case, in a metropolitan region. We apply our method to about three hundred thousand cross-bay commute trips in the San Francisco Bay Area. We estimate the commuter demand shift to UAM under two criteria of flexibility to travel time savings and three criteria of vertiport transfer times. Our results indicate that even for commuters with high value of time, and long transfer times at vertiports, almost forty-five percent of demand would benefit from UAM when the roads are highly congested. Even when the roads are mostly free, about three percent of the demand can benefit from UAM with the right combination of commuter flexibility and transfer times. Finally, our method also produces the number, location and distribution of demand over vertiports that can support value proposition, policy-making and technology research for UAM.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) collaborate with humans to operate in diverse, safety-critical applications. However, assurance technologies need to be integrated into the design process in order to guarantee safe behavior, thereby enabling UAS operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). In this paper, formal methods are integrated with learning-enabled systems representations. The generation and representation of knowledge are captured via monadic second-order logic rules in the cognitive architecture Soar. These rules are translated into timed automata, and a proof of correctness for the translation is provided so that safety and liveness properties can be checked in the formal verification environment Uppaal. This approach is agnostic to the learning mechanism used to generate the learned rules (e.g., chunking, etc.). An example of a fault-tolerant, learning-enabled UAS deciding which of four contingency procedures to execute under a lost link scenario while overflying an urban area is used to illustrate the approach.},

  abstract     = {Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a subset of advanced air mobility, is a concept that envisions safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation for passenger mobility, cargo delivery, and emergency management within or traversing a metropolitan area. In recent years, several companies have designed and tested enabling elements of this concept, including; prototypes of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, operational concepts, and market studies to understand potential business models. While UAM may be enabled by the convergence of several factors, a number of barriers such as weather could present challenges to scaling operations. This research discusses the potential weather and public acceptance challenges for operations in adverse conditions. This article presents a comprehensive seasonal and diurnal climatology analysis using historical observations across anticipated operational altitudes (surface- 5000 ft AGL) at ten metropolitan areas across the United States for the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). Public perceptions of weather-related societal barriers were evaluated through a five-city general population survey (n = 1,702) where respondents were asked about their views regarding flying in a small aircraft in a variety of adverse weather conditions using a six statement 5-point Likert scale. The results of the climatology analysis found weather most favorable in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with much less favorable conditions in Denver, New York City, and Washington D.C. In the future, equipping automated vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems, and VTOLs with meteorological sensors coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence could enhance predictive capabilities that reduce flight cancellations and delays for travelers.},

When many drones gravitate toward the limited landing spots simultaneously, congestion management becomes a challenge. This paper characterizes the fleet landing problem using mixed integer programming techniques and proposes a series of computational enhancements to reduce the solution time from hours to seconds. The solution algorithms are implemented in a software prototype for traffic management, and are thoroughly validated via extensive numerical examples and field simulations. For a fleet of 18 drones navigating at the same altitude layer within a 4-square kilometer area, all routing and trajectory computations can be completed in less than 5 seconds, and the entire fleet is able to complete landing at three pre-planned landing spots within about 3 minutes. Therefore, the models and algorithms are suitable for practical use.},

We also incorporate different contextual information such as energy and age of information (AoI) constraints to ensure the data freshness at the ground BS. Second, we propose an agile deep reinforcement learning with experience replay model to solve the formulated problem concerning the contextual constraints for the UAV-BS navigation. Moreover, the proposed approach is well-suited for solving the problem, since the state space of the problem is extremely large and finding the best trajectory policy with useful contextual features is too complex for the UAV-BSs. By applying the proposed trained model, an effective real-time trajectory policy for the UAV-BSs captures the observable network states over time.

PL is a navigation integrity parameter that guarantees the probability of position error exceeding a certain value to be bounded by a target integrity risk. For unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is desirable to achieve as tight PLs as possible. This paper characterizes terrestrial cellular SOPs’ measurement errors from extensive UAV flight campaigns, collected over the past few years in different environments and from different providers, transmitting at different frequencies and bandwidths. Next, the reduction in PLs due to fusing terrestrial SOPs with a traditional GNSS-based navigation system is analyzed. It is demonstrated that incorporating terrestrial SOP measurements is more effective in reducing the PLs over adding GNSS measurements. Experimental results are presented for a UAV traversing a trajectory of 823 m, during which the VPL of the GPS-based and GNSS-based navigation systems were reduced by 56.9% and 58.8%, respectively, upon incorporating SOPs; while the HPL of the GPS-based and GNSS-based navigation systems were reduced by 82.4% and 74.6%, respectively, upon incorporating SOPs.},

  abstract     = {The use of electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to provide efficient, high-speed, on-demand air transportation within a metropolitan area is a topic of increasing interest, which is expected to bring fundamental changes to the city infrastructures and daily commutes. NASA, Uber, and Airbus have been exploring this exciting concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), which has the potential to provide meaningful door-to-door trip time savings compared with automobiles. However, the ability to manage many of these eVTOL aircraft safely in a congested urban area presents a challenge unprecedented in air traffic management. In order to enable safe and efficient autonomous on-demand free flight operations in UAM, a computational guidance algorithm with collision avoidance capability is designed and analyzed. The approach proposed in this paper is to formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve it using an online algorithm Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For illustration, a high-density free flight airspace simulator is created to test the proposed algorithm’s performance. Numerical experiment results show that this proposed algorithm has fewer conflicts and near mid-air collisions than Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision avoidance strategy.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) generally use Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements to estimate their state (position and orientation) for outdoor navigation. However, in urban environments, GNSS pseudorange measurements contain biases due to multipath effects and signal blockages by nearby buildings. For safe navigation in such environments, it is beneficial to predict the state uncertainty while accounting for the effect of measurement biases. Reachability analysis is a commonly used tool to predict the state uncertainty of a system. However, existing works do not account for the effect of measurement biases on state estimation, which consequently affects the predicted state uncertainty. Additionally, majority of the existing literature focuses on linear systems, whereas the dynamics of widely used practical systems are better captured by non-linear models. Thus, in this paper we present a non-linear stochastic reachability analysis to predict bounds on the state uncertainty while accounting for measurement biases. We derive the analysis for a fixed-wing UAS navigating using ranging measurements. In order to evaluate our predicted bounds for GNSS-based navigation, we simulate a 3D urban environment and the pseudorange biases due to multipath effects. We validate the predicted bounds for multiple trajectories in the simulated environment. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our predicted bounds towards ensuring safe UAS navigation in a shared airspace.},

  abstract     = {As the demand for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operations increases, UAS Traffic Flow Management (UTFM) initiatives are needed to mitigate congestion, and to ensure safety and efficiency. Congestion mitigation can be achieved by assigning airborne delays (through speed changes or path stretches) or ground delays (holds relative to the desired takeoff times) to aircraft. While the assignment of such delays may increase system efficiency, individual aircraft operators may be unfairly impacted. Dynamic traffic demand, variability in aircraft operator preferences, and differences in the market share of operators complicate the issue of fairness in UTFM. Our work considers the fairness of delay assignment in the context of UTFM. To this end, we formulate the UTFM problem with fairness and show through computational experiments that significant improvements in fairness can be attained at little cost to system efficiency. We demonstrate that when operators are not aligned in how they perceive or value fairness, there is a decrease in the overall fairness of the solution. We find that fairness decreases as the air-ground delay cost ratio increases and that it improves when the operator with dominant market share has a weak preference for the fairness of its allocated delays. Finally, we implemented UTFM in a rolling-horizon setting with dynamic traffic demand, and find that efficiency is adversely impacted. However, the impact on fairness is varied and depends on the metric used.},

  abstract     = {Task scheduling of multiple UAVs has become a highly active area of research in recent years. Previous research has generally solved the problem in a whole manner, which makes it hard to efficiently generate high-quality task scheduling schemes due to prohibitive computational complexity. By contrast, the paper constructs a novel divide and conquer framework for multi-UAV task scheduling (DCF), which partitions the original multi-UAV scheduling problem into multiple scheduling sub-problems for all the UAVs. To be specific, DCF includes two phases: one is the task allocation phase which produces multiple scheduling sub-problems and the other is the single UAV scheduling phase which generates the scheduling scheme with sequential tasks for each single UAV considering constraints involving UAV capabilities and task demands. Two phases are iteratively performed until the predefined stopping criteria are met. In the task allocation phase, we propose a tabu-list-based simulated annealing (SATL) algorithm to realize task allocation among multiple UAVs. After obtaining the task allocation scheme, a satisfactory scheduling scheme of each single UAV is generated by variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm. Extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency of DCF and the proposed SATL-VND algorithm.},

This article quantifies the impact of two conflict detection and resolution approaches - pure speed control and pure direction control - on airspace productivity. We focus on small UAS traffic for goods movement in low altitude (under 400 feet) airspace. We compute three types of metrics, namely throughput, travel time extension and energy consumption, from simulations of unmanned traffic over a representative square area. As the inflow rates are increased, the corresponding outflow rates (throughput), travel time extensions and energy consumption for each type of control are measured. A representative power consumption model is developed for aircraft with both kinds of control. Without compromising safety, both direction control and speed control are equally good, unless the UAS are designed to be highly efficient while hovering. If the UAS have a hover power consumption that is equal to or less than one and a half times the minimum power consumption, speed control increases airspace productivity more than direction control.},

All existing RMMs in the literature assume independent movements of mobile agents, which does not hold for unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). In particular, UASs must maintain a safe separation distance to avoid collision. In this paper, we propose a new modeling framework of random mobility models equipped with physical sense-and-avoid protocols to capture the flexible, variable, and uncertain movement patterns of UASs subject to separation safety constraints. For the random direction (RD) RMM equipped with a commonly used sense-and-avoid (S&amp;A) protocol, named sense-and-stop (S&amp;S), we provide its statistical properties including stationary location distribution and stationary inter-vehicle distance distribution, using the Markov analysis. This study provides knowledge on the impact of S&amp;A protocols to critical UAS networking statistics. In addition, we define collision probabilities and airspace capacity concepts for UASs based on the inter-vehicle distance distribution, and derive their closed-form expressions. This analytical framework mathematically bridges local autonomy with global airspace capacity, and allows the impact analysis of local autonomy configurations for effective UAS airspace capacity management.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a new control method for path tracking of autonomous ground vehicles. We exploit the fuzzy model-based control framework to deal with the time-varying feature of the vehicle speed and the highly uncertain behaviors of the tire-road forces involved in the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. To avoid using costly vehicle sensors for feedback control while favoring the simplest control structure for real-time implementation, a new fuzzy static output feedback (SOF) scheme is proposed. In particular, though the robust set-invariance property and Lyapunov-based arguments, the physical constraints on the steering input saturation and the vehicle state can be taken into account in the control design to improve the driving safety and comfort. The theoretical development relies on the use of fuzzy Lyapunov functions and the non-parallel distributed compensation control concept to reduce the design conservatism. Exploiting some specific convexification techniques, the control design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities with a single line search, which are efficiently solved via semidefinite programming techniques. The proposed fuzzy path tracking controller is evaluated through various dynamic driving tests conducted with high-fidelity CarSim/Matlab co-simulations. Moreover, to emphasize the advantages of the new fuzzy SOF controller, a performance comparison with the CarSim driver model is also performed.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicle (EV) power demands come from its acceleration/braking as well as consumptions of the components. The power delivered to meet any demand is limited to the available power of the battery. This makes the battery state of available power (SoAP) a critical variable for battery management purposes. This article presents a novel approach for long-term SoAP prediction by supervising the working conditions for prediction of future load. Firstly, a battery equivalent circuit model (ECM) coupled with a thermal model is established to accurately capture the battery dynamics. The battery model is then connected to an EV model in order to interpret the working conditions to battery power demand. By supervising the historical usage conditions, a long-term load prediction mechanism is designed based on wavelet analysis and Markov models. This facilitates the separation of low and high frequency load demands and addresses future uncertainties. Finally, the SoAP prediction is put forward along with a sensitivity analysis with respect to battery model and load prediction mechanism parameters. It is demonstrated that compared to the existing approaches for load and SoAP prediction, the developed method is more practical and accurate. Co-simulations via MATLAB and AMESim as well as experiments on a set of commercially available Lithium-ion (Li-ion) cylindrical cells under real-world drive cycles prove the given concept and validate the performance of the method.},

  abstract     = {With the increased interest in intelligent transportation, the need for fault-tolerant systems has also increased. In this paper, we propose a piecewise stator-housing module (PSM) and construct a lumped-parameter thermal network (LPTN) that can be used in a fault-tolerant system based on the PSM. The proposed LPTN model considers not only radial and axial heat transfer but also tangential heat transfer; therefore, even if only one of the two circuits is running on a fault-tolerant motor (dual winding motor), the coil temperature can be estimated. To verify the proposed model, three winding-type motors are tested with varying current values during normal and fault operations, and the test and analysis results are in good agreement. Additionally, the usefulness of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing the temperatures of both the conventional and proposed LPTNs in the event of a brake system fault during braking operation in a virtual traffic jam simulation. This simulation demonstrates that temperature estimation of the motor is important for motor design because the brake operation time is dependent on the motor temperature. Furthermore, the system performance or size can be determined by accurately predicting the temperature, even in the event of a fault in the brake system, where the fault-tolerant motor is used, thus keeping the driver safe. The proposed LPTN can be used in brake systems and in other systems that utilize fault-tolerant dual winding motors.},

  abstract     = {In unit-capacity mobility-on-demand systems, the vehicles transport only one travel party at a time, whereas in ride-sharing mobility-on-demand systems, a vehicle may transport different travel parties at the same time, e.g., if paths are partially overlapping. One potential benefit of ride sharing is increased system efficiency. However, it is not clear what the trade-offs are between the efficiency gains and the reduction in quality of service. To quantify those trade-offs, an open-source simulation environment is introduced, which is capable of evaluating a large class of operational policies for ride-sharing mobility-on-demand systems. The impact of ride sharing on efficiency and service level is assessed for several benchmark operational policies from the literature and for different transportation scenarios: first a dense urban scenario, then a line-shaped, rural one. Based on the results of these case studies, we find that the efficiency gains in ride sharing are relatively small and potentially hard to justify against quality of service concerns such as reduced convenience, loss of privacy, and higher total travel and drive times. Furthermore, in the assessed scenarios, the relatively low occupancy of the vehicles suggests that smaller vehicles with 4–6 seats, able to handle occasional ride sharing, may be preferable to larger and more expensive vehicles such as minibuses.},

  abstract     = {In the future, vehicles will be equipped with increasingly advanced interactive intelligent electronic devices, which will induce drivers to conduct secondary tasks, thereby leading to distractions. Therefore, the detection and early warning of driver distraction are essential for improving driving safety and pose an important challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Previous studies used traditional machine learning and deep learning transfer models, which have the disadvantages of complicated and time-consuming manual feature engineering, strong subjectivity, and weak generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained detection method for driver distraction based on neural architecture search. First, we design an automatic construction algorithm for deep convolutional neural networks based on neural architecture search, which automatically searches for the optimal deep convolutional neural network architecture without human involvement. In addition, we fuse driver-related multisource perception information, use an automatically constructed deep convolutional neural network to extract high-dimensional mapping features, and implement fine-grained detection of various types of driver distraction states. The results on a large-scale multimodal driver distraction dataset demonstrate that our method can efficiently search an optimal deep convolutional neural network, which can quickly converge, and can accurately detect the considered types of driver distraction states, the average detection accuracy reaches 99.7796%; moreover, it has satisfactory robustness.},

A novel onsite line structured-light vision sensor calibration method independent of target reference feature points and which utilizes a multi-tooth free-moving target is proposed. The intersection points are determined as feature points by using a laser irradiated on the target, and the feature points in the target coordinate system are established on the basis of cross-ratio invariant. Then, the 3D coordinates of feature points in the camera coordinate system are calculated by combining the intrinsic parameters. Meanwhile, the method based on the uncertainty model is used to optimize the location deviation of the feature points after compensation, and the equation of the laser plane is finally obtained. High-accuracy calibration of outdoor line structured-light vision sensor can be achieved when moving freely even without the removal of the optical filter and the use of any auxiliary equipment. The measurement accuracy of our method is equivalent to that of other methods using planar target in ideal imaging conditions. In addition, our method can be applied to online wheel-size measurement system and can meet the calibration and measurement requirements in complex onsite railway environment.},

  abstract     = {Input-output cumulative count curves are a powerful tool to forecast freeway travel times in the very short term, as they rely on the predictive information given by the vehicles&#39; accumulation in the target section. Therefore, they could represent a very appealing method to feed real-time traffic information systems. However, traffic detectors&#39; count drift implies very poor accuracy in the estimation of the vehicles&#39; accumulation, leading to completely unreliable travel time predictions. A drift correction method is necessary. In contrast, several technologies allow accurate direct travel time measurements, like automatic vehicle identification (AVI) or vehicle tracking systems. In all cases, direct travel time measurements are obtained once the vehicle has crossed the target section. This means that the information is representative of the near past traffic conditions, while the objective of real-time information systems is to transmit information about traffic conditions in the near future. In this context, the present paper aims to fuse the information provided by input-output diagrams, obtained from loop detectors, with AVI direct travel time measurements. This fusion allows exploiting the accuracy of the direct measurements to correct the count drift in loop detectors. Then, corrected input-output curves can be used to obtain reliable short-term predictions of travel times. The proposed data fusion method has been applied to a test site in the AP7 freeway near Barcelona, obtaining significantly better results than with the common practices of simply disseminating direct measurements or using spot-speed methods.},

In this paper, we present the first attempt to systematically evaluate CAV proving grounds and contribute to a generative sample-based approach to assessing the representation of traffic scenarios in proving grounds. Leveraging typical use cases extracted from naturalistic driving events, we establish a strong link between proving ground testing results of CAVs and their anticipated public street performance. We present benchmark results of our approach on three world-class CAV testing facilities: Mcity, Almono (Uber ATG), and Kcity. We successfully show the overall evaluation of these proving grounds in terms of their capability to accommodate real-world traffic scenarios. We believe that when the effectiveness of a testing ground itself is validated, the testing results would grant more confidence for CAV public deployment.},

Firstly, this paper analyzes the literature content in the field of intelligent vehicles by including the literature number, literature productive countries, research organization, co-authorship of main research groups and the journals from which the articles are mainly sourced. Then, co-citation analysis is used to obtain five major research directions in the field of intelligent vehicles, which include “system framework”, “internet of vehicles”, “intersection control algorithms”, “influence on traffic flow”, and “policies and barriers”, respectively. The keyword co-occurrence analysis is applied to identify four dominant clusters: “planning and control system”, “autonomous vehicle questionnaire”, “sensor and vision”, and “connected vehicles”. Finally, we divide burst keywords into three phases according to the publication date to show more clearly the change of research focus and direction over time.},

The MTDPCD problem allows a tractor to carry multiple trailers and a tractor can leave the customer while the container is being packed / unpacked. This mode has been applied in real life and shown its great potential to improve transportation efficiency but not been reported in literature. We model the MTDPCD problem based on node decomposition as a nonlinear program and then linearize it. A backtracking adaptive threshold accepting algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. A named 3-vector procedure is designed to calculate the number of trailers and to check feasibility of solutions. A decoding algorithm including three stages is presented to adjust starting times of trucks given sequences of drayage orders. Experiments based on randomly generated instances validate the aforementioned methodology and indicate that pulling 2 trailers can save about 30% of operating costs than pulling 1 trailer.},

This unit in turn computes a coupling feedback which is shared with the vehicles. The control system is integrated in an automated test-system to cope with the high test requirements and short development cycles of highly automated systems. Evaluations conducted with the test-system show the functionality of the proposed distributed control method for multi-vehicle coordination.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work presenting an observer-based platoon controller that combines the advantages of high traffic capacity and a minimum number of communication links. To achieve a high traffic flow, a constant-spacing policy is used. However, for that policy, to make platoon string stable, the leader information must be broadcast to all the vehicles. Therefore, we propose a control law in which the predecessor position information is acquired by a sensor-based link while a communication-based link is used to obtain the leader information. Then, an observer is designed and integrated into the control law such that the velocity information of the predecessor can be estimated without the need to communicate with the preceding vehicle. For navigation in urban environments, we present a third order platoon model represented in the curvilinear coordinates. Conditions for asymptotic stability and string stability are given considering the vehicle actuator dynamics and the induced network/sensor time delay. Finally, we provide both simulation and real-time results to validate our approach feasibility and to corroborate our theoretical findings.},

The approach is applied to estimate traffic flow for an actual road network comprising 5,495 road segments using the traffic flow records of only 68 road segments (1.2% of the total). Five-fold cross validation is employed to verify the estimated traffic flow, and the data requirements for implementing the proposed method are analyzed.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new integrated observer for estimating the vehicle center of gravity (CG) height in real time. It can assist the vehicle in monitoring the real-time rollover risk and improving the performance of vehicle safety control systems. The proposed integrated observer consists of three parts: a linearized recursive least square (LRLS) algorithm on vehicle longitudinal motion, an adaptation law on vehicle lateral motion, and observer synthesis. First, the LRLS algorithm performs estimation of vehicle mass and CG height during longitudinal braking and exploits the characteristic that normalized longitudinal tire stiffness is the same in the front and rear axles. Second, the adaptation law, accompanied by a roll angle observer, estimates CG height on the vehicle lateral motion based on Lyapunov stability analysis. It includes the following contributions: verification of robustness to the vehicle mass estimation error and prevention of integration drift. Finally, in the observer synthesis, the final estimation of CG height combining the above two results is derived. The overall estimation algorithm has high practicality due to the following features. 1) CG height can be obtained on both longitudinal and lateral motions of the vehicle. This point leads to a fast convergence rate in CG height estimation. 2) The fact that it does not cause any computational burden issues in real-time implementation is also a great advantage in terms of practicality. 3) It utilizes only readily available sensors. An experimental study with various driving scenarios evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in real-car application.},

  abstract     = {Transportation Network Companies employ dynamic pricing methods at periods of peak travel to incentivise driver participation and balance supply and demand for rides. Surge pricing multipliers are commonly used and are applied following demand and estimates of customer and driver trip valuations. Combinatorial double auctions have been identified as a suitable alternative, as they can achieve maximum social welfare in the allocation by relying on customers and drivers stating their valuations. A shortcoming of current models, however, is that they fail to account for the effects of trip detours that take place in shared trips and their impact on the accuracy of pricing estimates. To resolve this, we formulate a new shared-ride assignment and pricing algorithm using combinatorial double auctions. We demonstrate that this model is reduced to a maximum weighted independent set model, which is known to be APX-hard. A fast local search heuristic is also presented, which is capable of producing results that lie within 10% of the exact approach for practical implementations. Our proposed algorithm could be used as a fast and reliable assignment and pricing mechanism of ride-sharing requests to vehicles during peak travel times.},

  abstract     = {Recently, with the active development of automated driving systems (ADSs) corresponding to SAE automated driving level 2, the comfort of ADSs has gained significant attention. In our previous research, it was proposed that the comfort of ADSs is affected by their maneuvers and the degree of information sharing between ADS and drivers. However, even if the drivers are well-informed of the recognized traffic environment and ADS-controlled trajectory, the comfort and trust of drivers in ADSs could be insufficient. This is because each driver has distinct preferred trajectories. Although some researchers have proposed ADSs that learn driver preferences, the maneuvers presented by these systems are not easily modified, because of off-line learning. In addition, a few quantitative investigations on the subjective evaluation of comfort have been conducted. This study proposes an on-demand learning collision avoidance ADS that learns the preferred maneuvers of drivers through driver intervention. In our system, the drivers teach their preferred trajectory to the system only if they are unsatisfied with the maneuver presented by the system. The system updates the parameters and shows the learned maneuver at the next avoidance. To realize the proposed system, we applied modified risk potential functions and gain-tuning method, as well as a cost function and learning method for gradual and stable maneuver learning. Driving simulator experiments demonstrated stable trajectory learning and smooth intervention. Furthermore, the drivers were satisfied with the learned maneuvers of the ADS, and their comfort and trust in the ADS improved when using the proposed ADS.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory following of autonomous vehicle is a challenging task because of the multiple constraints imposed on the plant. Therefore, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is becoming prevail in vehicle motion control as it can explicitly handle system constraints. However, MPC, grounded in real-time iterative optimization, entails a considerable computational burden for current electronic control units. To mitigate the MPC execution load, a popular strategy is to linearize the original (nonlinear) system around the current working point and then design a Linear Time-Varying MPC (LTVMPC). Nevertheless, the successive linearization introduces extra modeling errors, which may impair the control performance. Indeed, if the plant model satisfies the `differential flatness&#39; condition, it can be exactly linearized to the Brunovsky&#39;s canonical form. In contrast to the LTV model, this newly appeared linear form reserves all the nonlinear features of the native plant model. Based on this equivalent linear system, a Flatness Model Predictive Controller (FMPC) can be formulated. FMPC on the one hand, improves the control performance over an LTVMPC because it avoids extra modeling errors from the local linearization. On the other hand, it entails a much lighter computational load versus a nonlinear MPC thanks to its linear nature. Real-time simulations conducted on a hardware-in-the-loop system indicate the advantages of the proposed FMPC in autonomous vehicle trajectory following.},

Previous works have demonstrated the ability of back-pressure methods to maximize network throughput and guarantee network stability. However, most of these methods are implemented adaptively. At present, fixed phase sequences are still widely used in traffic signal control systems. Herein, we propose a new back-pressure-based signal optimization method that combines fixed phase sequences with spatial model predictive control. First, a spatial prediction model for traffic flow was constructed to analyze the movement of vehicles between a central intersection and four peripheral intersections. Then, a multi-objective optimization model of traffic signal timing was developed with the purpose to reduce the risk of spillover and to balance the distribution of vehicles across the whole network. Next, a method based on the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution principle was used to achieve the Pareto frontier and the optimal solution. Finally, traffic simulations were performed in Paramics to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results of the simulations suggest the performance of the proposed method surpasses fixed-time control and cycle-based back-pressure schemes under oversaturated conditions.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of the traffic state can help to address the issue of traffic congestion, providing guiding advices for people&#39;s travel and traffic regulation. In this paper, we propose a novel short-term traffic flow prediction approach based on empirical mode decomposition and combination model fusion. First, we explore the amplitude-frequency characteristics of short-term traffic flow series, and use empirical mode decomposition to decompose traffic flow to several components with different frequency. Second, based on the results of self-similarity analysis of each component, improved extreme learning machine, seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average and auto regressive moving average are selected to predict different components. Meanwhile, an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the weight coefficient of the combination model. Third, the prediction results of each prediction model are multiplied by their respective weight coefficient to get the final prediction results. We evaluate our prediction approach by doing thorough experiment on a real traffic data set. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed approach has superior performance than state-of-the-art prediction methods or models in short-term traffic flow prediction.},

In the last years, as smartphone ownership has become widespread, such an assessment has been increasingly relying on the measurements taken from the inertial sensors on board of the smartphone itself. This work stands in this context, and it aims to design a 4-dimensional driving-style assessment for insurance purposes. The main contribution is adding, to more common proxies of risky-driving, the dimension of smartphone usage, the detection of which is performed through an appropriate processing of smartphone-based inertial sensors, thus not relying on privacy-sensitive monitoring of phone usage behavior. Physics-based, fine-grained dynamic features are used to classify the overall riskiness of the driving-style, thus providing a comprehensive insight into the most discriminating features. The study is based on experimental data, collected over more than five thousands kilometers of varied car trips.},

  abstract     = {Serious roadside pollution in congested urban areas is an ongoing problem in many densely populated cities. While the current control measures on traffic pollution have reduced particulate matter, new solutions by emerging vehicular technologies can help protect citizens from exhaust-gas emissions. The electric vehicle (EV) is a promising solution to alleviate traffic-induced pollution in urban areas. However, traffic flow will be mixed with fuel vehicles (FVs) and EVs before the FV would be phased out. In this paper, traffic management by road pricing is introduced to reduce the tailpipe emission of the protected area by imposing environmental capacity constraints for network traffic mixed with EVs and FVs. Second-best toll pricing schemes are formulated as side constrained user equilibrium problems for both fixed demand and elastic demand cases. Both the tailpipe emission of FVs and the energy consumption of EVs are assumed to depend nonlinearly on network traffic conditions. Although the EVs do not contribute to the tailpipe emission, all vehicles contribute to congestion externality that induces more emission of FVs. Therefore, both types of vehicles are charged, but the toll on FVs is significantly higher than that on EVs. A new projected dynamics based algorithm is introduced to solve the toll from the Lagrange multiplier associated with the environmental constraint apart from the equilibrium flow. Numerical examples are conducted to evaluate the equilibrium cost and toll, and to analyze the impacts of EV penetration rate on the pricing scheme.},

However, the vast majority of previous works only utilize the color or textural information of images, without considering the depth information, which is beneficial for semantic reasoning. In this paper, we take advantages of the mutual benefit and strong correlation between depth information and semantic information in scene parsing by introducing the Built-in Depth-Semantic Coupled Encoding (BDSCE) module, which adaptively fuses RGB and depth features, and selectively highlights the depth-discriminative features. The proposed BDSCE module is compatible with existing CNN based methods, and can greatly improve scene parsing performance, particularly in those categories that have clear depth distinction and might be misclassified with RGB-only features. Furthermore, we also extend our proposed module to other urban scene semantic reasoning tasks such as vehicle detection and road segmentation, which are implemented by effectively learning and exploiting the encoded depth-semantics and transferring the learned representations with fine-tuning. The extensive experiments on the popular datasets Cityscapes and KITTI demonstrate that our method performs quite well and can significantly improve the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of autonomous driving in recent years presents many challenges for scene understanding. As an essential step towards scene understanding, semantic segmentation has received increased attention in the past few years. Although deep learning based approaches have achieved great success in improving the segmentation accuracy, most of them suffer from an inefficiency problem and can hardly be applied to real-time applications. In this paper, we analyze the computational cost of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and find that the inefficiency of CNNs is mainly caused by their wide structure rather than deep structure. In addition, the success of pruning based model compression methods proves that there are many redundant channels in CNNs. Thus, we design a narrow while deep backbone network to improve the efficiency of semantic segmentation. By casting our network to fully convolutional network (FCN32) segmentation architecture, the basic structure of most segmentation methods, we achieve 61.5% mIoU on Cityscapes validation dataset with only 4.2G floating-point operations (FLOPs) on 1024×2048 inputs, which already outperforms one of the earliest real-time deep learning based segmentation methods: ENet (58.3% mIoU, 3.8G FLOPs on 640×360 inputs). By further refining the output resolution of our network to the 1/8 of the input resolution with a simple encoder-decoder structure, we achieve 65.3% mIoU on Cityscapes test set with 14.0G FLOPs and 39.9 frames per second (FPS) on Titan X card.

The proposed system is able to enforce a target time gap between platoon members and is formulated in the space domain instead of the time domain which is adopted by most optimal control-based CACC systems in the past. By having this change, its robustness against communication failure is greatly improved and thus minimum safety headway buffer is reduced which leads to better mobility. In addition, third-order vehicle dynamics are modeled into the proposed control in order to improve control precision when implemented in the field. Local stability and string stability are theoretically proven. The proposed system is evaluated by simulation. Results reveal that the proposed CACC system outperforms the state-of-the-art H ∞ synthesis-based controller and linear feedback-based controller. The benefit of fuel consumption reduction ranges from 0.35% to 16.11%, while the benefit of CO 2 emission ranges from 0.48% to 12.40%. Furthermore, the proposed CACC improves local stability from 11.03% to 25.90%, and string stability by up to 23.82%. The computation speed of the proposed method is 1.26 ms (with prediction horizon as 1.5 s and resolution as 0.1 s) on a regular laptop which indicates the proposed system&#39;s potential to be applied in real-time.},

In this study, we focus on applying auto-machine learning for hyperparameter tuning to learn traffic datasets at the main regions of highway systems. Particularly, deep learning models have been recently introduced as emergent methods for traffic prediction. However, training deep learning models requires expensive works (e.g., time-consuming and human expertise), especially in terms of determining the configurations of hyperparameters in the models. In this regard, this paper introduces an automated framework for hyperparameter tuning to learn traffic datasets at an ecosystem in terms of reducing time-consuming tasks. Specifically, we first propose the HyperNet framework, using advanced data science techniques (e.g., Bayesian optimization and meta-learning) for the automated hyperparameter search process. Then, a deep learning model with the long short term memory network based on the HyperNet framework has presented for learning the temporal variation of traffic datasets at main regions of highway traffic systems. Regarding the experiment, we take data from the Korean highway system into account as a case study to evaluate the proposed approach. The evaluation indicates promising results of the proposed framework for learning multiple datasets of the traffic highway systems.},

Though many works have been devoted to transportation mode detection, there remains challenge for accurate and robust transportation pattern identification. In this paper, we propose a residual and LSTM recurrent networks-based transportation mode detection algorithm using multiple light-weight sensors integrated in commodity smartphones. Feature representation learning is adopted separately on multiple preprocessed sensor data using deep residual and LSTM network, which can enhance the identification accuracy and support one or more sensors. Residual units are introduced to accelerate the learning speed and enhance the accuracy of transportation mode detection. Furthermore, we also leverage the attention model to learn the significance of different features and different timesteps to enhance the recognition accuracy. Extensive experimental results on three datasets indicate that using our proposed model can achieve the best recognition accuracy for eight transportation modes including being stationary, walking, running, cycling, taking a car, taking a bus, taking a subway and taking a train, which outperforms other benchmark algorithms.},

Planning AV actions in the presence of pedestrians thus requires modelling of their probable future behavior as well as detecting and tracking them. This narrative review article is Part II of a pair, together surveying the current technology stack involved in this process, organising recent research into a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from low-level image detection to high-level psychological models, from the perspective of an AV designer. This self-contained Part II covers the higher levels of this stack, consisting of models of pedestrian behavior, from prediction of individual pedestrians’ likely destinations and paths, to game-theoretic models of interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles. This survey clearly shows that, although there are good models for optimal walking behavior, high-level psychological and social modelling of pedestrian behavior still remains an open research question that requires many conceptual issues to be clarified. Early work has been done on descriptive and qualitative models of behavior, but much work is still needed to translate them into quantitative algorithms for practical AV control.},

In order to effectively compute the required data, we combine V2V communication and vehicle computing to further characterize the coupling reliability of cooperative communications and computation systems. In addition, we propose a virtual queue model that combines queue length and vehicle privacy entropy to optimize partitioning. Finally, considering the amount of processing data and cut-off time of vehicle applications, we establish the optimal partition model of vehicle computing with the goal of maximizing the coupling reliability, and propose the coupling-oriented reliability calculation for vehicle collaboration using dynamic programming methods. Simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional approaches in terms of coupling reliability and completion rate.

  abstract     = {Radio-frequency-energy-powered cognitive radio network (RF-CRN) is being taken seriously in Connected Vehicles, especially in 5G network, which can better address the challenges of energy limitation and spectrum scarcity. However, the energy efficiency (EE) of the RF-CRN wherein multiple secondary users (SUs) share the same channel is rarely presented. In this article, we consider a RF-CRN in which SUs first harvest energy from RF signals originating from a primary network (PN) and then utilize the available energy in the battery to transmit data. Since all SUs can access the authorized spectrum for transmission simultaneously, co-frequency interference (Co-FI) occurs among SUs. Given the quality of service (QoS) requirement, our goal is to achieve the maximum EE of the RF-CRN by jointly optimizing transmission time and power control. To this end, a resource allocation scheme referred to as approximate convex policy for co-frequency interference (CO-ACP) is proposed. Specifically, the EE problem is firstly converted into a convex one by CO-ACP. Then, we utilize Frank-Wolfe (FW) and one-dimensional linear programming to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that a tight lower-bound optimum solution for the non-convex EE maximization can be achieved by CO-ACP. Moreover, the CO-ACP provides meaningful system features, such as the number of SUs, energy harvesting efficiency, and the battery energy state of the SUs under different RF-CRN scenarios, providing a clear reference for future deployment of RF-CRN.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a service handoff scheme, termed as Safe-Passé , for provisioning Safety-as-a-Service (Safe-aaS) to the end-users in a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$5G$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; environment. A Safe-aaS architecture provides customized safety-related decisions to the end-users. Practically, the service region of a Safety Service Provider (SSP) is bounded. On the other hand, the distance for which the end-users request for services may cover the service region of multiple SSPs. As a result, the services provided to the end-users are interrupted due to switching from the service region of one SSP to another. However, none of the existing handoff schemes provide customized safety-related decisions to the end-users. Considering road transportation as the application scenario of Safe-aaS in a 5G-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) environment, we propose a service handoff scheme among the multiple service providers for provisioning safety-related decisions to the end-users. Based on the eminence and profit of a SSP to which the end-users have initially registered for services, we compute the profit of the nearest SSP, who agrees to provide services to that end-user. We map these interactions among the SSPs to a cooperative coalition game, where the SSPs act as players. Extensive simulation-based analysis demonstrates that the ratio of the end-users served to the total number of end-users is improved by 4.19% and 3.65% using Safe-Passé compared to the existing handoff schemes, UCH and VHO.},

To bridge this gap of data analytics, some studies take two factors individually to mine knowledge or information, such as uncertainty and utility as two exemplary factors. However, this approach may cause actual loss of knowledge integrity. In this work, our first result is a knowledge called High Expected Utility Sequential Patterns (HEUSPs) that is both novel and also provides an alternative option for knowledge discovery regarding utility and uncertainty factors by a single threshold in IoCV environments. Furthermore, two PUL-Chain and EUL-Chain structures with six pruning methodologies are respectively developed to maintain information that is necessary and reduce the search space for improving mining performance. Our experimental results show both efficiency and strength of the designed algorithm compared to HUS-Span which is considered to be the current standard in utility-oriented sequential pattern mining.},

  abstract     = {Public transport systems in a metropolitan area experiences several complex issues, like resource scarcity, resource allocation, congestion, resource reliability and so on, due to the dynamic arrivals of heterogeneous commuter and exceptional occurrence of unforeseen events. The progress of these issues may lead to economic losses, under-utilization of transport resources, and commuters’ queuing delay. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic public transport vehicle allocation scheme based on Emergent Intelligence (EI) technique in a metropolitan area. In addition, we demonstrate the EI technique’s capability for solving public transport system problems. To do so, the EI technique maintains historical information, commuters’ arrival rates, resource avaialability, deficit resources and surplus resources of neighbor depots’s agent. In the proposed scheme, the EI technique is utilized to collect, analyze, share and optimally allocate transport resources effectively. The proposed EI technique provides reliable services (allocation and scheduling) by coordinating with a reliable neighborhood depot’s agent. We have build mathematical models for estimation of resources, utilization and reliability parameters. The proposed scheme is exhaustively tested by simulation and analyzed with varying commuters’ arrival rates, number of vehicles, number of requests, and different values of reliability parameters. The proposed scheme’s results (analytical, simulation and comparison) show the reliabiltiy, accuracy and real time deployability.},

This is challenging due to the complex system models and the complex dependency between UE location performance and orientation performance. To achieve the above goal, we will first characterize the closed-form error bounds of the UE location and orientation at each time slot, respectively, in terms of Fisher information. Generally, the VLP error will propagate over time as the vehicular UE moves, and hence the VLP error at the current time slot is affected by the VLP performance at the previous time slot, the UE mobility and the channel quality. Based on the obtained VLP error bounds, we then reveal the impact of prior UE location knowledge, UE mobility and signal-to-noise-ratio on the VLP performance. Furthermore, the time-domain evolution of the VLP error is studied, where the convergence of the time-domain VLP error evolution is established and its closed-form stable state is quantified, which will shed light on the long-term performance of the vehicular VLP system.},

How to arrange waste collection vehicles reasonably and optimize their service routes in real time based on signals sent by intelligent waste bins to meet the daily needs of residents has become an urgent problem. An improved multiobjective model for the split-delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP) is proposed based on the multiple cleaning services for the same collection point in a certain period of time according to the real-time waste volume.

In recent years, real momentum has been building up for designing automated parking models for vehicles. However, in such an autonomous parking design, location privacy and identity privacy issues are always overlapping due to the improper sharing of data. Most existing studies barely investigate and poorly address such privacy issues. Motivated by this, we develop (and evaluate) an experience-driven, secure and privacy-aware framework of parking reservations for automated cars. Our idea of using differential privacy with zero-knowledge proof provides both security and privacy guarantees to users. Furthermore, the performance of the developed model is enhanced by exploiting reinforcement learning approach such that the utility of the system and the parking reservation rate can be maximized. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model.},

The existing content caching schemes, when used in vehicular networks, face two distinct challenges: 1) Vehicles connected to an edge server keep moving, making the content popularity varying and hard to predict. 2) Cached content is easily out-of-date since each connected vehicle stays in the area of an edge server for a short duration. To address these challenges, we propose a Mobility-aware Proactive edge Caching scheme based on Federated learning (MPCF). This new scheme enables multiple vehicles to collaboratively learn a global model for predicting content popularity with the private training data distributed on local vehicles. MPCF also employs a Context-aware Adversarial AutoEncoder to predict the highly dynamic content popularity. Besides, MPCF integrates a mobility-aware cache replacement policy, which allows the network edges to add/evict contents in response to the mobility patterns and preferences of vehicles. MPCF can greatly improve cache performance, effectively protect users&#39; privacy and significantly reduce communication costs. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCF outperforms other baseline caching schemes in terms of the cache hit ratio in vehicular edge networks.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular clouds (VCs) have become a promising research area due to its on-demand solutions, resource pooling, unified services, autonomous cloud formation and transformational management. It makes use of the underutilized resources of vehicles on the parking lot, roadways, driveways and streets, and creates the infrastructure to support various services offered by the cloud service provider (CSP) by deploying virtual machines (VMs). However, these vehicles can leave the coverage/grid of VC due to its mobility and change in the environment. Therefore, the hosted VMs on those vehicles can be transferred to other potential vehicles (i.e., migration) in order to avoid disruption of services. These services can be viewed as user requests (URs) submitted to the CSP by cloud users. Here, the challenging tasks are to map the URs to the VMs (or vehicles) and identify the potential vehicles for migration, and they need immediate attention. In this paper, we propose a smart cloud service management (SCSM) algorithm for VCs and address the above challenges. This algorithm consists of three phases, namely assignment of vehicles to grids, URs to grids and URs to vehicles by considering the mobility pattern of vehicles. The performance of SCSM is assessed using three traffic congestion scenarios and thirty-six instances of four datasets, and compared with round-robin (RR) and deficit weighted RR (DWRR) using seven performance metrics. The comparison results show that SCSM achieves 58% and 57% (33% and 33%) better than RR and DWRR in makespan (number of migrations) and other performance metrics.},

LACC focuses on selecting beneficiary vehicle by assessing its end-to-end service capacity and link stability preference. Different from the conventional greedy approach, routing is aided by a linear integer programming module for smart decisions on neighbor selection. The interrupts in data transmission and forwarding due to non-localized vehicles, congested routing paths and paused transmissions are addressed using LACC as a series of linear optimization. This helps to improve the performance of vehicular communication estimated using delay, message delivery, outage, and beacon messages.},

To meet the strict latency requirements, Software-defined Networking (SDN) provides flexible network control (and possible intelligence) that can act as an enabler for application-oriented service industry. However, the crippling gap between the business needs and the network delivery potential necessitates the underlying network to constantly (and consistently) adapt, protect, and inform across all strands of the service-oriented landscape. Intent-based network has emerged as a recent solution to the cover the above gap by capturing business intent and thereafter activating and assuring it networkwide. Motivated from these facts, in this article, an Intent-based network control framework has been designed over the SDN architecture for data dissemination in the vehicular edge computing ecosystem. In this framework, a tensor-based mechanism is used to reduce the dimensionality of the incoming elephant-like traffic and then classifying the specific-attribute data traffic according to the defined priority requirement of the underlying applications. Here, the network policies are configured using the intent-based controller according to the application requirement and then forwarded to the SDN controller to enable intelligent data dissemination (through an optimal route) at the data plane. Convolution Neural Network is used to train the flow table to allocate the route dynamically for the classified traffic queues. The proposed framework has been evaluated through extensive simulations and the results supports the claims in terms of the quality of service requirements.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the huge expansion of Datacenters (DC) to execute billions of end-user applications in real-time leads to a large amount of energy consumption across the globe. So, the traditional TCP/IP-based networks which are being used for DC inter-connections are facing challenges of managing stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of different applications of the end-users and service providers. Moreover, the existing solutions rely on distributed architecture and do not scale for large scale data centers. The issue of high power consumption at DC arises with the increase in the number of nodes and links in the network. Also, it becomes problematic on the DC whenever the underlying network resources (switches and routers) are not efficiently utilized at the time of peak data traffic resulting in high operational cost of energy utilization. However, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) emerges as one of the leading technologies to address the aforementioned issues using the programmable switches and controllers. Inspired from these facts, in this paper, we have formulated the Energy-Aware Routing (EAR) problem of DCs as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) for which an Energy-Efficient Fast Flow Forwarding (EnFlow) scheme is designed. The EnFlow scheme uses the power-saving mode of the network to solve the EAR problem. It has three modules namely- priority scheduling, routing, and re-routing. The first module works according to the First-in-First-Out Push Out Priority (FIFO-POP) scheduling using the multiple OpenFlow switches. The FIFO-POP is designed to save the energy usage of multiple switches by reducing the average waiting time of incoming packets in the queue buffers. The second module is based upon an efficient flow re-routing for a new node and link adaptation to provide the maximum bandwidth to the wired links. The third module is based upon the meta-heuristic Ant Colony Routing (ACR) to execute the stochastic decision policy on the network controller for computation of the shortest path of the forwarding nodes. The proposed EnFlow scheme is simulated using the data traces of 34 cities of NorthAmerica zone with Omnet++ 5.1 using various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained demonstrated that the proposed EnFlow scheme is 24.55% and 71.15% more energy-efficient in comparison to the RE-FPR and ILP-EAR schemes. Also, it consumes 9.72% and 40.83% lower energy in comparison to the FFHA and EXR schemes respectively.},

  abstract     = {In the 5G-envisioned Internet of vehicles (IoV), a significant volume of data is exchanged through networks between intelligent transport systems (ITS) and clouds or fogs. With the introduction of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), the problems mentioned above are resolved by high-speed flow-based processing of data in network systems. To classify flows of packets in the SDN network, high throughput packet classification systems are needed. Although software packet classifiers are cheaper and more flexible than hardware classifiers, they could only deliver limited performance. A key idea to resolve this problem is parallelizing packet classification on graphical processing units (GPUs). In this paper, we study parallel forms of Tuple Space Search and Pruned Tuple Space Search algorithms for the flow classification suitable for GPUs using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). The key idea behind the offered methodology is to transfer the stream of packets from host memory to the global memory of the CUDA device, then assigning each of them to a classifier thread. To evaluate the proposed method, the GPU-based versions of the algorithms were implemented on two different CUDA devices, and two different CPU-based implementations of the algorithms were used as references. Experimental results showed that GPU computing enhances the performance of Pruned Tuple Space Search remarkably more than Tuple Space Search. Moreover, results evinced the computational efficiency of the proposed method for parallelizing packet classification algorithms.},

Methods: At present, constructing an information network covering three dimensions of sea, land and air is one of the research directions of 6G technology development. Meanwhile, the full coverage of three dimensions of communication requires multiple channels including multiple frequency bands and multiple scenarios, mainly including terahertz, light band, satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle, ocean, high-speed rail, and vehicle-to-vehicle. For different channels, different parameters are analyzed and targeted discussed according to channel characteristics. Also, there are many other problems of wireless communication channel that need to be solved. Here, only the above problems are analyzed in detail. Because of the current development of the Internet of Vehicles, the interconnection of connected vehicles is analyzed, and this scenario is also the most widely common scenario in daily life. Results: For the above-mentioned communication channels, the relevant measurement and modeling results of the 6G channel are shown; besides, the characteristics, time, and space correlation functions are obtained for each channel.

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand to deploy convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on 5G mobile platforms, architecture designs with efficient sparse kernels (SKs) were proposed, which can save more parameters than the standard convolution while maintaining the high accuracy. Despite the great potential, neural network designs with SKs still require a lot of expert knowledge and take ample time. In this paper, we first propose a search scheme that effectively reduces the SK design space based on three aspects: composition, performance, and efficiency. Meanwhile, we completely eliminate the model training from our search scheme. Instead, an easily measurable quantity, the information field, is identified and used to predict the model accuracy in the searching process. Additionally, we provide a detailed efficiency analysis on the final designs found by our scheme. Second, based on the analysis we propose a model transformation scheme to better utilize the SK designs on existing models to either reduce the number of parameters or increase the accuracy. Last, considering the extra programming overhead and the expert knowledge required by the model transformation scheme, we develop a compiler prototype to automate the entire process, given the source code of an existing model. Experimental results show that models composed of the sparse kernel designs searched by our search scheme can beat state-of-the-art networks such as ResNets in terms of the accuracy and the efficiency. Also by using our model transformation scheme we can easily improve the accuracy (the same number of parameters) or the efficiency (the same accuracy) upon existing state-of-the-art models.},

These networks are formed by vehicles that can be connected to one another as well as to the infrastructure, and are subject to constant topology changes, disconnections, and data congestion. Each ITS application could have a different set of communication requirements, such as delay, bandwidth, and packet delivery ratio. Meeting these heterogeneous requirements in the complex dynamic environment of vehicular networks is a challenge. This paper develops a new framework for application-driven vehicular networks using 5G network slicing.

In this work, we propose a Behavior-based Clustering Method (BCM) to analyze the behavioral correlation between vehicles and classify them into different clusters. Based on BCM results coupled with a deep learning model, we further propose a Clustering-learning-based Long-term Predictive Localization (CLPL) algorithm to predict vehicles&#39; future location distribution. In the proposed CLPL algorithm, all the traffic roads are divided into consecutive small segments in order to pinpoint vehicles&#39; precise current locations and to obtain long-term predictions. Extensive simulations, notably involving real dataset, have been carried out to evaluate BCM and CLPL in terms of several performance criteria including matching rates.

Besides, the boom in portable devices has witnessed a huge breakthrough in the data driven vehicular platform. However, sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices are playing the major role as edge nodes in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). Thus, due to high mobility/speed of vehicles and resource-constrained nature of edge nodes more data packets will be lost with high power drain and shorter battery life. Thus, this research significantly contributes in three ways. First, 5G-based self-adaptive green (i.e., energy efficient) algorithm is proposed. Second, a novel 5G-driven reliable algorithm is proposed. Proposed joint energy efficient and reliable approach contains four layers, i.e., application, physical, networks, and medium access control. Third, a novel joint energy efficient and reliable framework is proposed for ITS. Moreover, the energy and reliability in terms of received signal strength (RSSI) and hence packet loss ratio (PLR) optimization is performed under the constraint that all transmitted packets must utilize minimum transmission power with high reliability under particular active time slot. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach (with Cross Layer) significantly obtains the green (55%) and reliable (41%) ITS platform unlike the Baseline (without Cross Layer) for aging society.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the applications related to Internet of connected vehicles (IoCV) have been greatly promoted by the roadside units (RSUs). To improve the transmission efficiency by the RSUs, 5G is introduced to the IoCV scenario for offering sufficient communication bandwidth. Generally, the traditional offloading destinations of the computing tasks in IoCV are the distant cloud servers, which consequently increases the response time of the tasks. Edge servers, placed together with macro base stations (MABSs) in 5G and RSUs, offer alternatives to host the tasks. However, the complicated locations of MABSs and RSUs make it difficult to distinguish the offloading destinations of the computing tasks in IoCV. In view of this, an adaptive computation offloading method, named ACOM, is devised for edge computing in 5G-envisioned IoCV to optimize the task offloading delay and resource utilization of the edge system. More specifically, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is fully leveraged to generate the available solutions. Then, the optimal offloading solution is obtained by utility evaluation. Eventually, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACOM.},

After that, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize MNO&#39;s profits, and develop an intelligent traffic control scheme by investigating DRL, which can improve system profits of the MNO and allocate network resources effectively.

  abstract     = {The ever-growing trend of making the traditional power grids smarter than before has resulted in their gradual evolution to more sophisticated grids, referred to as Smart Grids (SGs) Cyber-Physical Systems with complex networking technologies. The integration of Information and Communication Technologies with power grids fosters seamless data sharing between different SG entities, which supports effective and smart governance in terms of demand response management, frequency support, and voltage stabilization. Nonetheless, this integration opens up several security and privacy concerns, namely, electricity theft, power loss, battery exhaustion, infrastructure mapping, etc. These issues become even more important with the addition of distributed energy sources, e.g. electric vehicles (EVs), battery energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources, into the SGs. We present a framework based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) and BlockChain (BC) to address two challenging issues of EV-aided SG ecosystems, namely, privacy assurance and power security. We leverage the capabilities of SDN to handle the complex interactions between different subsystems of the SG. Furthermore, we also employ BC and smart contracts&#39; properties to secure energy transactions and data communications. We design a secure and efficient mutual authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and BC for privacy preservation during smart energy trading. We also proposed a BC-based smart contract for effective Demand Response Management (DRM) during bidirectional energy transfer between EVs and SG. Finally, we present experimental evaluations to validate the proposed framework&#39;s performance. The results obtained demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. The mutual authentication protocol designed is not only secure against major attack vectors (namely, session key security, message integrity, anonymity, forward secrecy, and so on), but it is also cost-efficient in terms of communication and computational costs. Additionally, the SC designed assures power security and maintains an adequate balance between demand and supply.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining growing interests due to the paramount roles they play, particularly these days, in enabling new services that help modernize our transportation, supply chain, search and rescue, among others. They are capable of positively influencing wireless systems through enabling and fostering emerging technologies such as autonomous driving, vertical industries, virtual reality and so many others. The Internet of Vehicles is a prime sector benefiting from the services offered by future cellular systems in general and UAVs in particular, and this paper considers the problem of content delivery to vehicles on road segments with either overloaded or no available communication infrastructure. Incoming vehicles demand service from a library of contents that is partially cached at the UAV; the content of the library is also assumed to change as new vehicles carrying more popular contents arrive. Each inbound vehicle makes a request and the UAV decides on its best trajectory to provide service while maximizing a certain operational utility. Given the energy limitation at the UAV, we seek an energy efficient solution. Hence, our problem consists of jointly finding caching decisions, UAV trajectory and radio resource allocation which is formulated mathematically as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP). However, owing to uncertainties in the environment (e.g., random arrival of vehicles, their requests for contents and their existing contents), it is often hard and impractical to solve using standard optimization techniques. To this end, we formulate our problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and we resort to tools such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a very promising Reinforcement Learning method, along with a set of crafted algorithms to solve our problem. Finally, we conduct simulation-based experiments to analyze and demonstrate the superiority of our solution approach compared with four counterparts and baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owners, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing, computation, and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design, and shows the efficiency of our matching, thus guaranteeing profit maximization for the model owner amid information asymmetry.},

  abstract     = {Existing task offloading mechanisms are developed on some single and rigid quality of service (QoS) performance metrics, which is widely apart from satisfying the true intent of a user vehicle (UV), thereby resulting in low quality of experience (QoE), large queuing latency, and poor reliability. There is an unprecedented demand for an intent-aware task offloading strategy that provides improved QoE and guarantees reliability. In this paper, we develop a novel task offloading framework for air-ground integrated vehicular edge computing (AGI-VEC), which is called the learning-based Intent-aware Upper Confidence Bound (IUCB) algorithm. IUCB enables a UV to learn the long-term optimal task offloading strategy while satisfying the long-term ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) constraints in a best effort way under information uncertainty. IUCB can achieve three-dimension intent awareness including QoE awareness, URLLC awareness, and trajectory similarity awareness. Simulation results demonstrate that IUCB significantly outperforms existing EMM, sleeping-UCB, and UCB mechanisms in terms of QoE, end-to-end delay, queuing delay, throughput, and times of task offloading failure.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a resource allocation and data gathering scenario of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted wireless powered sensor network is investigated, in which the sensor nodes (SNs) are remotely powered by power beacons (PBs) via radio-frequency wireless power transmission (RF-WPT). A time-block structure with two phases is proposed to accommodate operations in the proposed system. During Phase-I, SNs harvest energy from PBs and periodically send its sensed data to the selected cluster heads (CHs). In Phase-II, an UAV collects the data from CHs to be delivered to the data sink for further processing avoiding the need for long range transmission and multi hop communication to the data sink. Then, a closed-form expression for outage probability of the proposed system over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels is derived. Next, outage probability minimization problem is formulated to obtain optimal time allocation for RF-WPT energy harvesting to improve the system performance. Due to the complexity of the problem, Lagrangian duality method is used to develop an asymptotic optimal solution with less execution complexity avoiding complex brute force/ exhaustive search approach. Furthermore, a heuristic method is presented to further lower the computation complexity. Simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed methods compare to brute force/ exhaustive search approach via analysis, comparison and insights of the system performance results. Finally, the performance superiority of the proposed system is demonstrated with compare to identified baseline WSNs.},

The objective is to enhance the edge capacity of a macro cell by deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations and small cells (SCs) for improving the capacity of indoor users in scenarios such as temporary hotspot regions or during disaster situations where the terrestrial network is either insufficient or out of service. UAVs are energy-constrained devices with a limited flight time, therefore, we formulate a two layer optimization scheme, where we first optimize the power consumption of each tier for enhancing the system energy efficiency (EE) under a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, which is followed by optimizing the average hover time of UAVs. We obtain the solution to these nonlinear constrained optimization problems by first utilizing the Lagrange multipliers method and then implementing a sub-gradient approach for obtaining convergence. The results show that through optimal power allocation, the system EE improves significantly in comparison to when maximum power is allocated to users (ground cellular users or connected vehicles). The hover time optimization results in increased flight time of UAVs thus providing service for longer durations.},

Moreover, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in flying networks extends the connectivity and universality of IoT, and these UAVs with caching and communication capacities can support various services. However, due to the heterogeneity of vehicular networks and flying networks, the communication performance and content distribution between UAVs and IoCVs expose new challenges in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Therefore, in this paper, a novel content distribution mechanism between UAVs and IoCVs is proposed to improve the QoE of vehicle users. Specifically, we first develop a novel content distribution architecture for UAVs and IoCVs in HetNets, where the content is distributed by UAV content providers to IoCVs. Next, we establish an optimization problem of content distribution between UAVs and IoCVs to minimize the transmission delay. In order to stimulate UAVs and IoCVs to join content distribution, the utilities of UAVs and IoCVs are formulated, respectively. Moreover, we design a coalition game between UAVs and IoCVs to determine the optimal strategy of content distribution. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can significantly improve the performance of content distribution compared with the conventional mechanisms.},

In particular, Neural Networks and MultiLayer Perceptrons are the class of networks employed in our approach.

Meantime, new challenges such as security, privacy and efficiency are raised. In this article, a hybrid D2D message authentication (HDMA) scheme is proposed for 5G-enabled VANETs, in which a novel group signature-based algorithm is used for mutual authentication between vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication. In addition, a pre-computed lookup table is adopted to reduce the computation overhead of modular exponentiation operation. Security analysis shows that HDMA is robust to resist various security attacks, and performance analysis also points out that, the authentication overhead of HDMA is more efficient than some traditional schemes with the help of the pre-computed lookup table in V2V and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication.},

  abstract     = {With the advances of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in intelligent transportation systems, collected vehicle data can produce insights on emerging vehicular phenomenon, and further contribute to the further improvement of innovative and efficient vehicular systems. Particularly, by leveraging data collected from vehicle sensors and maintenance models constructed from operation and repair history, predictive maintenance aims to detect the anomalies of vehicles and provide early warnings before the occurrence of failure. However, privacy preservation still remains as one of the top concerns for vehicle owners in predictive maintenance, as the sensory data could potentially violate their location and identity privacy. To address this challenge, in this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and verifiable continuous data collection scheme with the intent of predictive maintenance in vehicular fog, which gathers and organizes the sensor data of each individual vehicle on a sliding window basis. Specifically, our proposed scheme exploits the homomorphic Paillier cryptosystem and truncated &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -geometric technique to protect the content of each individual piece of sensory data. Meanwhile, our proposed scheme also aggregates and authenticates the collected sensory data reports on a time-series sliding window basis, which achieves the continuous observation of the recently collected vehicular sensory data. Detailed security analysis is carried out to demonstrate the security properties of our proposed scheme, including confidentiality, authentication and privacy preservation. In performance evaluations, we also compare our proposed scheme with a traditional scheme, and our scheme shows great improvement in terms of communication and computation overheads. Furthermore, to show the feasibility of our proposed scheme, we also compare and discuss the expected squared error introduced by the differential privacy mechanism.},

In IoV, the network topology changes based on drivers&#39; destination, intent or vehicles&#39; movements and road structure on which the vehicles travel. In IoV, vehicles are assumed to be equipped with computing devices to process data, storage devices to store data and communication devices to communicate with other vehicles or with roadside infrastructure (RSI). It is vital to authenticate data in IoV to make sure that legitimate data is being propagated in IoV. Thus, security stands as a vital factor in IoV. The existing literature contains some limitations for robust security in IoV such as high delay introduced by security algorithms, security without privacy, unreliable security and reduced overall communication efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based Ant Colony Optimization Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (ACO-AODV) routing protocol which avoids suspicious vehicles during message dissemination in IoV. Specifically, our proposed protocol comprises three components: i) certificate authority (CA) which maps vehicle&#39;s publicly available info such as number plates with cryptographic keys using ECC; ii) malicious vehicle (MV) detection algorithm which works based on trust level calculated using status message interactions; and iii) secure optimal path selection in an adaptive manner based on the intent of communications using ACO-AODV that avoids malicious vehicles.

However, when scrutinizing into IoCV, noticeable challenges of location-aware scenario has raised. For IoCV, location is more than just query criteria like in Location-based Services (LBSs) of mobile Internet. It is also the underpinning data of various types of IoCV underlying mechanisms and functions. This difference makes preserving location privacy in IoCV quite different from the traditional privacy scenarios. In this paper, an overall analysis of end-user location privacy in IoCV was performed. To solve the location privacy dilemma, we proposed an intent prediction-based approach named LocJury, which benefits from the emerging concept of Intent-based Networking (IBN). LocJury provides location privacy by learning and estimate the intent of location access and will penalize those malicious location accesses. By simulating the conceptual IBN-based IoCV application scenario, which relies on the location accesses, the performance of LocJury is evaluated under various circumstances. The simulation result verified the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Today&#39;s vehicles are advancing from stand-alone transportation means to vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications enabled devices which are able to exchange data through the transportation communication infrastructure. As the IoT and data remain intrinsically linked together, the fast-changing mobility landscape of intent-based networking for the Internet of connected vehicles comes with a great risk of data security and privacy violations. This paper considers the privacy issues in the distributed edge computing, in which the data is communicated between a number of vehicles in the IoT layer and potentially untrusted edge controllers at the edge of the network. The sensory data communicated by the vehicles contain sensitive information, such as location and speed, which could violate the users&#39; privacy if they are leaked with no perturbation. Recent studies suggest mechanisms for randomizing the stream of data to ensure individuals&#39; privacy. Although the past works on differential privacy provide a strong privacy guarantee, they are limited to applications where communication parties are trusted and/or there is no correlation between the users or the featured of sensory data. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a differentially private data streaming system that adds a correlated noise in the vehicle&#39;s side (IoT layer) rather than the transportation infrastructure. Also, our system is able to ensure a strong privacy level over time. The proposed mechanism is data-adaptive and scales the noise with respect to the data correlation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the utility of the output generated by our method outperforms the recent approaches.},

  abstract     = {With the recent advances in wireless communications, the automotive industry is leading to evolution. To succeed in this emerging era of technology, the Internet of Connected Vehicles (IoCV) has emerged as one of the potential applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). It refers to the dynamic mobile communication systems that communicate between vehicles and public networks to enhance the connectivity between cars via technology. By offering a wide variety of infotainment services, fleet operations, and in-vehicle applications, IoCV has gained the tremendous capacity to provide a safer and sustainable transportation system to the society. According to Gartner Inc., “the connected car is already a reality, and in-vehicle wireless connectivity is expanding rapidly.” As a result, the evolution of cars into the IoT will keep on accelerating the global market which is expected to grow by 270% by 2022. Furthermore, the increasing deployment of sensors and ever-evolving cognitive technology opens up new opportunities for IoCV. Due to these significant developments, connected vehicles are receiving widespread attention from the major automotive giants such as Tesla, BMW, Waymo (Google), Uber, Volvo, and so on. Despite all the opportunities offered by the IoCV, their highly dynamic topology and the increasing number of vehicles pose challenges regarding delivering low-latency vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, field experiments have been performed on ring roadways with human-driven vehicles or with a mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles. While these experiments demonstrate the potential for controlling traffic flows by a small number of autonomous vehicles, the theoretical framework about such a possibility is to a large extent incomplete. Indeed, most work on mixed traffic focused on classical asymptotical stability notions, neglecting that human drivers are prone to the interconnected instability known in the literature as string instability. This work aims to enhance the existing theories to meet the questions raised by the field experiments. It starts from the observation that the standard notion of string stability on a ring roadway is too demanding for a mixed traffic scenario: therefore, a new interconnected stability definition, named weak ring stability, is proposed. This new interconnected stability notion, in combination with classical stability, is able to explain phenomena observed in field experiments and to highlight possibilities and limitations of traffic control via sparse autonomous vehicle. Furthermore, it allows designing AV controllers with improved string stability specifications, at the price of reducing the sparsity of the autonomous vehicles.},

However, the complex and uncontrollable driving road environment as well as the discontinuous lane marking appearance make this task challenging. In this work, a novel deep neural network architecture is presented to detect lane markings in a complex environment by analyzing their structure information. There are two contributions to the network design. Firstly, a semantic-guided channel attention (SGCA) module is developed to select the low-level features of a deep convolutional neural network by taking the high-level features as the guidance. Secondly, a pyramid deformable convolution (PDC) module is formulated to enlarge the receptive fields and to capture the complex structures of lane markings by applying deformable convolutions on multiple feature maps with different scales. Hence, our network can better reduce false detection and enhance lane marking structures simultaneously. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets for lane marking detection show that our method outperforms other methods on all the benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Effective traffic signal control strategies are critical for traffic management in urban traffic networks. Most existing optimization-based urban traffic control approaches update the traffic signal at regular time instants, where the length of the fixed update time interval is determined based on a trade-off between the computational efficiency and the control performance. Since event-triggered control (ETC) allows for more flexible and more efficient control than conventional time-triggered control by triggering the control action by events, and since it can refrain from redundant optimization while retaining a satisfactory behavior, we use an ETC scheme for traffic light control. In addition, based on the geographically distributed feature of traffic networks, a distributed paradigm is adopted to reduce the computational complexity for the optimization. We propose a distributed threshold-based event-triggered control strategy, where the independent triggering of agents leads to an asynchronous update of traffic signals in the system. The triggered agent then solves a mixed-integer linear programming problem and updates its traffic signals. The proposed approach is evaluated under various traffic demands by simulation, and is shown to yield the best trade-off between control performance and computational complexity compared to other control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has been a main-stream computing service for years. Recently, with the rapid development in urbanization, massive video surveillance data are produced at an unprecedented speed. A traditional solution to deal with the big data would require a large amount of computing and storage resources. With the advances in Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, edge computing offers a new solution to the problem by processing all or part of the data locally at the edge of a surveillance system. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using edge computing for smart parking surveillance tasks, specifically, parking occupancy detection using the real-time video feed. The system processing pipeline is carefully designed with the consideration of flexibility, online surveillance, data transmission, detection accuracy, and system reliability. It enables artificial intelligence at the edge by implementing an enhanced single shot multibox detector (SSD). A few more algorithms are developed either locally at the edge of the system or on the centralized data server targeting optimal system efficiency and accuracy. Thorough field tests were conducted in the Angle Lake parking garage for three months. The experimental results are promising that the final detection method achieves over 95% accuracy in real-world scenarios with high efficiency and reliability. The proposed smart parking surveillance system is a critical component of smart cities and can be a solid foundation for future applications in intelligent transportation systems.},

Several drone-based delivery systems have been proposed but they generally have a drawback in delivering customers locating far from warehouses. This paper proposes an alternative system based on a public transportation network. This system has the merit of enlarging the delivery range. As the public transportation network is actually a stochastic time-dependent network, we focus on the reliable drone path planning problem (RDPP). We present a stochastic model to characterize the path traversal time and develop a label setting algorithm to construct the reliable drone path. Furthermore, we consider the limited battery lifetime of the drone to determine whether a path is feasible, and we account this as a constraint in the optimization model. To accommodate the feasibility, the developed label setting algorithm is extended by adding a simple operation. The complexity of the developed algorithm is analyzed and how it works is demonstrated via a case study.},

A new consensus-based control approach with the input saturation and variable time headway (VTH) spacing strategy is proposed. The homogeneous time-varying communication delays are included into the consensus algorithm. By employing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem and the Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem, the global asymptotic stability conditions of the system under fixed topology and switching topology are derived, respectively.

Existing fixed traffic light control systems split the traffic light signal into fixed duration and run in an inefficient way, therefore, it suffers from many weaknesses such as long waiting time, waste of fuel and increase in carbon emission. To tackle these issues and increase efficiency of the traffic light control system, in this work, a Dynamic and Intelligent Traffic Light Control System (DITLCS) is proposed which takes real-time traffic information as the input and dynamically adjusts the traffic light duration. Further, the proposed DITLCS runs in three modes namely Fair Mode (FM), Priority Mode (PM) and Emergency Mode (EM) where all the vehicles are considered with equal priority, vehicles of different categories are given different level of priority and emergency vehicles are given at most priority respectively. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning model is also proposed to switch the traffic lights in different phases (Red, Green and Yellow), and fuzzy inference system selects one mode among three modes i.e., FM, PM and EM according to the traffic information. We have evaluated DITLCS via realistic simulation on Gwalior city map of India using an open-source simulator i.e., Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation results prove the efficiency of DITLCS in comparison to other state of the art algorithms on various performance parameters.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic forecasting is important to enable intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. This problem is challenging due to the complicated spatial, short-term temporal and long-term periodical dependencies. Existing approaches have considered these factors in modeling. Most solutions apply CNN, or its extension Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to model the spatial correlation. However, the convolution operator may not adequately model the non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-based Periodic-Temporal neural Network (APTN), an end-to-end solution for traffic foresting that captures spatial, short-term, and long-term periodical dependencies. APTN first uses an encoder attention mechanism to model both the spatial and periodical dependencies. Our model can capture these dependencies more easily because every node attends to all other nodes in the network, which brings regularization effect to the model and avoids overfitting between nodes. Then, a temporal attention is applied to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. We evaluate our proposed model using real world traffic datasets and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.},

To resolve these issues, in this paper, we present an efficient, privacy-preserving and verifiable sensory data collection and sharing scheme with a permissioned blockchain in vehicular fog. During the data collection phase, by combining the homomorphic 2-DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) cryptosystem and an identity-based signcryption scheme, our proposed scheme achieves the secure and verifiable computation of the average and variance of the collected vehicular sensory data. Meanwhile, to achieve efficient and reliable data sharing, we exploit a permissioned blockchain to maintain an immutable and tamper-proof record of the derived sensory data. Security analysis demonstrates the security properties of the proposed scheme, in terms of location privacy preservation, verifiability and immutability. Performance evaluations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, i.e., improvements in computation and communication efficiency in comparison with a scheme without exploiting blockchain.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the SAPIENT system, a real-time monitoring and control infrastructure for Air Traffic Management. Within the latter, aircrafts constantly measure the state and quality of their datalinks, and report these measurements to a ground entity, tagging them with a time/space reference. The ground entity, then, builds a map of the monitored portion of the sky, and can feed back information to the aircrafts themselves regarding conditions that they would not be able to measure otherwise. This allows optimal vertical handover decisions to be made, increasing service continuity and improving communication performance. We show that the SAPIENT system can be implemented using existing technologies, without the need for expensive hardware. Moreover, we show via simulation that a small, negligible increase in the communication overhead due to SAPIENT reporting brings about considerable benefits.},

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is utilized to provide route guidance information to land and autonomous vehicles. The GNSS-based positioning and navigation (POS/NAV) usually suffer from satellite signal blockage, interference, and multipath in urban areas. Autonomous land vehicles are equipped with cameras, radars, and laser ranging devices. The availability of these systems provides an attractive opportunity to increase the POS/NAV system accuracy. This research focuses on the development of an integrated multi-sensor POS/NAV system capable of offering seamless positioning for autonomous land vehicles. A new multi-sensor POS/NAV module integrating both adaptive cruise control frequency modulated continuous wave (ACC-FMCW) radar (RAD), and magnetometer measurements with the reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) was designed to update the navigation system during GNSS outages. Augmenting RAD/RISS system with the magnetometer measurements produces a robust solution. The designed system is further improved by utilizing fast orthogonal search (FOS) to provide nonlinear error modeling of the residual errors associated with the RAD/RISS positioning solution in order to reduce the error growth overextended and frequent GNSS outages.The proposed systems were evaluated on several real road test trajectories involving different types of land vehicles experiencing different motion dynamics. GNSS outages of up to 10 minutes were intentionally introduced to examine the performance. The results show that the proposed methods have resulted in a significant performance improvement in the positioning accuracy that can reach more than 80% if compared to the present techniques that rely only on integrating the inertial sensor technology with GNSS.},

To fill this gap, a visual analytical system is provided to conduct a group-based and individual-based exploration of mobility correlations of passengers of interest, based on an auto integration of multiple queries. How passengers differ from or correlate with each other are further examined based on their spatiotemporal distributions in trajectories and ODs.

The complicated spatial dependencies of roadway links and the dynamic temporal patterns of traffic states make it particularly challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a new capsule network (CapsNet) to extract the spatial features of traffic networks and utilize a nested LSTM (NLSTM) structure to capture the hierarchical temporal dependencies in traffic sequence data. A framework for network-level traffic forecasting is also proposed by sequentially connecting CapsNet and NLSTM. On the basis of literature review, our study is the first to adopt CapsNet and NLSTM in the field of traffic forecasting. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links shows that the proposed framework with the capability of capturing complicated spatiotemporal traffic patterns outperforms multiple state-of-the-art traffic forecasting baseline models. The superiority and feasibility of CapsNet and NLSTM are also demonstrated, respectively, by visualizing and quantitatively evaluating the experimental results.},

Leveraged by the hierarchical configuration, the proposed flocking control framework can accommodate complicated vehicle dynamics with a self-organizing feature. In the high-level layer, applying a 2-dimensional (2D) flocking theory, the cooperative trajectories (paths and speeds) of multiple CAVs are produced via a distributed control based on shared information. In the low-level layer, the trajectory-tracking and vehicle orientation guidance of each vehicle are achieved by a feedforward and feedback control design. In particular, control allocation is established to take the merits of the over-actuated properties of each vehicle. Demonstrated by the one-way three-lane highway simulation results, five CAVs controlled by the proposed flocking control framework can successfully complete a 2D flocking coordination with velocity alignment, orientation control, collision avoidance, and multi-destination cohesion.},

External disturbances are significant in autonomous vehicles by changing the driving condition. Furthermore, parametric uncertainties related to the physical limits of tires and the change of the vehicle mass may significantly affect the desired performance of autonomous vehicles. The robustness of the proposed controller against the parametric uncertainties and external disturbances is compared with one active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) algorithm, and a linear-quadratic tracking (LQT) method. The obtained results in terms of the maximum error and root mean square error (RMSE), demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm to reach the minimized path-tracking error.},

  abstract     = {Crowd counting is very important in many tasks such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, public security, and urban planning, so it is a very important part of the intelligent transportation system. However, achieving an accurate crowd counting and generating a precise density map are still challenging tasks due to the occlusion, perspective distortion, complex backgrounds, and varying scales. In addition, most of the existing methods focus only on the accuracy of crowd counting without considering the correctness of a density distribution; namely, there are many false negatives and false positives in a generated density map. To address this issue, we propose a novel encoder-decoder Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that fuses the feature maps in both encoding and decoding sub-networks to generate a more reasonable density map and estimate the number of people more accurately. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation method named the Patch Absolute Error (PAE) which is more appropriate to measure the accuracy of a density map. The extensive experiments on several existing public crowd counting datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance than the current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, considering the cross-scene crowd counting in practice, we evaluate our model on some cross-scene datasets. The results show our method has a good performance in cross-scene datasets.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) that are considered as a subset of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) can be applied in the field of transportation especially in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The routing process in these networks is a challenging task due to rapid topology changes, high vehicle mobility and frequent disconnection of links. Therefore, developing an efficient routing protocol that satisfies restriction of delay and minimum overhead is faced with many difficulties and limitations. Also, the detection of malicious vehicles is a significant task in VANETs. To address these issues, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be helpful to cope with these limitations. In this paper, operation of UAVs in ad hoc mode and their cooperation with vehicles in VANETs are studied to help in the process of routing and detection of malicious vehicles. A routing protocol named VRU is proposed that includes two distinct ways of routing of data: (1) delivering packets of data between vehicles with the help of UAVs using a protocol named VRU_vu, and (2) routing packet of data between UAVs using a protocol named VRU_u. The NS-2.35 simulator under Linux Ubuntu 12.04 is utilized in order to appraise the performance of VRU routing components in an urban scenario. Also, VanetMobiSim generator of mobility and MobiSim are used to produce the motions of vehicles and to produce the motions of UAVs, respectively. The performance analysis displays that VRU protocol can improve the packet delivery ratio by 16% and detection ratio by 7% compared to other reviewed routing protocol. Also, VRU protocol decreases end-to-end delay by an average of 13% and overhead by 40%.},

An autonomous ECU responsible for the execution of decision commands to an autonomous vehicle is developed by assimilating the information from the CAN bus. The conventional way of parsing the decision commands is motion planning, which uses a path tracking algorithm to evaluate the decision commands. This study focuses on designing a robust controller using behavioral cloning and motion planning of autonomous vehicle using a deep learning framework. In the first part of this study, we explore the pipeline of parsing decision commands from the path tracking algorithm to the controller and proposed a neural network-based controller ( N 2 C) using behavioral cloning. The proposed network predicts throttle, brake, and torque when trained with the manual driving data acquired from the CAN bus. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the accuracy with the Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID) controller in conjunction with the path tracking algorithm (pure pursuit and model predictive control based path follower). The second part of this study complements N 2 C, in which an end-to-end neural network for predicting the speed and steering angle is proposed with image data as an input. The performance of the proposed frameworks are evaluated in real-time and on the Udacity dataset, showing better metric scores in the former and reliable prediction in the later case when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Street view is the most common scene during driving. Since streets are often full of shops with signboards, scene text recognition over the shop sign images in street views is of great significance and utility to urban scene understanding in ITS. To advance research in this field, (1) we build ShopSign, which is a large-scale scene text dataset of Chinese shop signs in street views. It contains 25,770 natural scene images, and 267,049 text instances. The images in ShopSign were captured in different scenes, from downtown to developing regions, and across 8 provinces and 20 cities in China, using more than 50 different mobile phones. It is very sparse and imbalanced in nature. (2) we carry out a comprehensive empirical study on the performance of state-of-the-art DL based scene text reading algorithms on ShopSign and three other Chinese scene text datasets, which has not been addressed in the literature before. Through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that language has a critical influence on scene text detection. Moreover, by comparing the accuracy of four scene text recognition algorithms, we show that there is a very large room for further improvements in street view text recognition to fit real-world ITS applications.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle taillight detection is essential to analyze and predict driver intention in collision avoidance systems. In this article, we propose an end-to-end framework that locates the rear brake and turn signals from video stream in real-time. The system adopts the fast YOLOv3-tiny as the backbone model and three improvements have been made to increase the detection accuracy on taillight semantics, i.e., additional output layer for multi-scale detection, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module for richer deep features, and focal loss for alleviation of class imbalance and hard sample classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multi-scale features as well as hard examples mining greatly contributes to the turn light detection. The detection accuracy is significantly increased by 7.36%, 32.04% and 21.65% (absolute gain) for brake, left-turn and right-turn signals, respectively. In addition, we construct the taillight detection dataset, with brake and turn signals are specified with bounding boxes, which may help nourishing the development of this realm.},

  abstract     = {With the fast growth in network-connected vehicular devices, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has many advances in terms of size and speed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. As a result, the amount of produced data and computational loads has increased intensely. A solution to handle the vast volume of workload has been traditionally cloud computing such that a substantial delay is encountered in the processing of workload, and this has made a serious challenge in the ITS management and workload distribution. Processing a part of workloads at the edge-systems of the vehicular network can reduce the processing delay while striking energy restrictions by migrating the mission of handling workloads from powerful servers of the cloud to the edge systems with limited computing resources at the same time. Therefore, a fair distribution method is required that can evenly distribute the workloads between the powerful data centers and the light computing systems at the edge of the vehicular network. In this paper, a kind of Genetic Algorithm (GA) is exploited to optimize the power consumption of edge systems and reduce delays in the processing of workloads simultaneously. By considering the battery depreciation, the supporting power supply, and the delay, the proposed method can distribute the workloads more evenly between cloud and fog servers so that the processing delay decreases significantly. Also, in comparison with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm performs significantly better in both using green energy for recharging the fog server batteries and reducing the delay in processing data.},

The Double Deep Q Network (DDQN)-based VSL control strategy is proposed for reducing total time spent (TTS) on freeways. A real merging bottleneck is developed in the simulation and considered for the VSL control as the source scenario. Three types of target scenarios are considered, including the overspeed scenarios, adverse weather scenarios, and diverse capacity drop scenarios. A stable testing demand and a fluctuating testing demand are adopted to evaluate the effects of VSL control. The results show that by updating the neural networks, the transfer learning in the DDQN-based VSL control agent successfully transfers knowledge learned in the source scenario to other target scenarios. With the transfer learning, the entire training process is shortened by 32.3% to 69.8%, while keeping a similar maximum reward level, as compared to the VSL control with full learning from scratch. With the transferred DDQN-based VSL strategy, the TTS is reduced by 26.02% to 67.37% with the stable testing demand and 21.31% to 69.98% with the fluctuating testing demand in various scenarios, respectively. The results also show that when the task similarity between the source scenario and target scenario is relatively low, the transfer learning could lead to local optimum and may not achieve the global optimal control effects.},

  abstract     = {Online performance prediction (or: observation) of deep neural networks (DNNs) in highly automated driving presents an unsolved task until now, as most DNNs are evaluated offline requiring datasets with ground truth labels. In practice, however, DNN performance depends on the used camera type, lighting and weather conditions, and on various other kinds of domain shift. Also, the input to DNN-based perception systems can be perturbed by adversarial attacks requiring means to detect these input perturbations. In this work we propose a method to mitigate these problems by a multi-task learning approach with monocular depth estimation as a secondary task, which enables us to predict the DNN&#39;s performance for various other (primary) tasks by evaluating only the depth estimation task with a physical depth measurement provided, e.g., by a LiDAR sensor. We show the effectiveness of our method for the primary task of semantic segmentation using various training datasets, test datasets, model architectures, and input perturbations. Our method provides an effective way to predict (observe) the performance of DNNs for semantic segmentation even on a single-image basis and is transferable to other primary DNN-based perception tasks in a straightforward manner.},

However, this technique demands to build a radio map before localization, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. This article designs a crowd-sourced based localization system to address the radio map building problem in fingerprinting localization system. In this method, the first initial radio map is constructed from the path-loss RSS model, followed by the update of the fingerprints with crowd-sourcing. Finally, the vehicle location is estimated from the RSS sample by matching it with an updated radio map with a deep learning algorithm. The main advantage of the proposed approach is the calibration-free crowd-sourced fingerprint generation and its applicability in various location-based services in urban infrastructure.},

Recently, mobile vehicles are adopted to perform sensing data collection tasks in the urban city due to their ubiquity and mobility. In this article, we study how mobile vehicles can be optimally selected in order to collect maximum data from the urban environment in a future period of tens of minutes. We formulate the recruitment of vehicles as a maximum data limited budget problem. The application scenario is generalized to a realistic online setting where vehicles are continuously moving in real-time and the data center decides to recruit a set of vehicles immediately. A deep learning-based scheme through mobile vehicles (DLMV) is proposed to collect sensing data in the urban environment. We first propose a deep learning-based offline algorithm to predict vehicle mobility in a future time period. Furthermore, we propose a greedy online algorithm to recruit a subset of vehicles with a limited budget for the NP-Complete problem. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the real mobility dataset in Rome. The results have not only verified the efficiency of our proposed solution but also validated that DLMV can improve the quantity of collected sensing data compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As an effective tool, roadside digital billboard advertising is widely used to attract potential customers (e.g., drivers and passengers passing by the billboards) to obtain commercial profit for the advertiser, i.e., the attracted customers&#39; payment. The commercial profit depends on the number of attracted customers, hence the advertiser needs to adopt an effective advertising strategy to determine the advertisement switching policy for each digital billboard to attract as many potential customers as possible. Whether a customer could be attracted is influenced by numerous factors, such as the probability that the customer could see the billboard and the degree of his/her interests in the advertisement. Besides, cooperation and competition among all digital billboards will also affect the commercial profit. Taking the above factors into consideration, we formulate the dynamic advertising problem to maximize the commercial profit for the advertiser. To address the problem, we first extract potential customers&#39; implicit information by using the vehicular data collected by Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS), such as their vehicular trajectories and their preferences. With this information, we then propose an advertising strategy based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. By using the proposed advertising strategy, the advertiser could determine the advertising policy for each digital billboard and maximize the commercial profit. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have been conducted to verify that our proposed advertising strategy could achieve the superior commercial profit compared with the state-of-the-art strategies.},

Successful Sybil attacks have been launched against real crowdsourced navigation systems, yet defending such critical threats has seldom been studied. In this work, a novel deep generative model based on Bayesian deep learning is devised for Sybil attack identification. The proposed model exploits time-series features to embed trajectories in a latent distribution space, which serves as a basis for identifying ones generated by Sybil attacks. Case studies on three real-world vehicular trajectory datasets reveal that the proposed model improves the performance of state-of-the-art baselines by at least 76.6%.

Firstly, by classifying the statistical features in time-series, we improve the previous long-short-term memory(LSTM) network model and establish a novel long-short-term memory(LSTM) network model that can deal with long-term dependent time-series data so as to accurately fit real-time passenger flow. Secondly, by introducing the lightweight implementation algorithm LightGBM based on the gradient decision boosting tree(GBDT), we build a short-term prediction model, which can reduce operation cost and improve accuracy so that accurate fitting of passenger flow peaks can be achieved. Thirdly, based on K-nearest neighbor algorithm, we select DRS as the dynamic regression device that can find a local optimal fusion method, and establish a LGB-LSTM-DRS local optimal fusion prediction model. Taking the AFC passenger flow data of Chengdudong Station as an example, we predict the short-term passenger flow. Compare with other commonly used models such as LR, RF, and GBDT, it’s proved that the LGB-LSTM-DRS model has the smallest error (MAPE and RMSE) and the best prediction performance.},

Meanwhile, we can now able to collect, store, and analyze a large amount of sharing bike data. How to effectively use these massive data to provide better services is an emerging task. However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies. Then, a convolution neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to predict the future trip destination. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1.},

  abstract     = {Today, with the worldwide offer and rapid increment in multimedia applications on the web, the demands of users to get them accessed are also increasing prominently. The users in vehicular environment too expect efficient multimedia streaming while travelling on the road. However, the high mobility of vehicles as well as the limited transmission range of infrastructure components in IP based network provides low performance by offering high delay and additional network overhead. To provide better Quality of Experience (QoE) with high performance, Information Centric Networking (ICN) is blended with vehicular environment. Caching the content inside network nodes is inherent feature of ICN with various associated benefits such as low content retrieval delay, less network traffic, path reduction and so on. However, challenges still exists for caching the content due to resource constrained network environment (such as limited cache capacity, node battery) as well as for secure delivery of cached data. To solve these challenges and to enhance network performance, we propose a cooperative caching scheme in hierarchical network architecture that jointly considers cache location as well as combined content popularity and predicted future rating score while making caching decision. The proposed approach uses two layer hierarchical architecture where nodes in edge layer are divided into clusters. The proposed scheme uses modified Weighted Clustering Algorithms (WCA) for selection of cluster heads which are then used to decide cache location. A probability matrix is used to compute content caching probability which considers both popularity and predicted future rating of content. The proposed approach dynamically predict the user’s preferences using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) - a machine learning technique which eventually provides prediction of future rating. Based on the selection of both cache location and content to cache, the proposed scheme can effectively cache the content in the network. Further, to deal with the secure delivery of cached content, this work supports legitimate user authorization at edge nodes. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in MATLAB parallel computing toolkit. The results prove significant caching improvement in terms of cache hit, hop reduction and average delay using our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent control of traffic has significant influence on the scheduling efficiency of urban traffic flow. Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency of vehicles at intersections, first, the Back Propagation (BP) neural network is used to propose a vehicle passing model at the intersection, and based on the intelligent traffic control system model, the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) dynamic scheduling algorithm is used to improve the Controller Area Network (CAN) communication network. Finally, the simulation test is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the improved CAN bus communication network. The results show that the neural network model can be used to predict the passage time of vehicles queuing at intersections with an error of less than 10%. The improved CAN bus communication can improve the data transmission rate, and the success rate of data transmission under different load rates is above 95%. In conclusion, the application of artificial intelligence technology in intelligent traffic system can improve the efficiency of vehicle scheduling and the efficiency of communication system. This research is of great significance to improve the communication performance of the transportation system and scheduling efficiency.},

With the rapid development of communication technology, it becomes possible to process large amounts of video data and identify the driver&#39;s emotions in real time. To effectively recognize driver&#39;s emotions, this paper proposes a new deep learning framework called Convolution Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (CBLNN). This method predicts the driver&#39;s emotion based on the geometric features extracted from facial skin information and the heart rate extracted from changes in RGB components. The facial geometry features obtained by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are intermediate variables for the heart rate analysis of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Subsequently, the output of Bi-LSTM is used as input to the CNN module to extract the hear rate features. CBLNN uses Multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling (MFB) to fuse the extracted information and classifies it into five common emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and neutrality. Our emotion recognition method was tested, proving that it can be used to quickly and steadily recognize emotions in real time.},

  abstract     = {With the development of modern Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), reliable and efficient transportation information sharing becomes more and more important. Although there are promising wireless communication schemes such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication standards, information sharing in ITS still faces challenges such as the V2X communication overload when a large number of vehicles suddenly appeared in one area. This flash crowd situation is mainly due to the uncertainty of traffic especially in the urban areas during traffic rush hours and will significantly increase the V2X communication latency. In order to solve such flash crowd issues, we propose a novel system that can accurately predict the traffic flow and density in the urban area that can be used to avoid the V2X communication flash crowd situation. By combining the existing grid-based and graph-based traffic flow prediction methods, we use a Topological Graph Convolutional Network (ToGCN) followed with a Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework to predict future traffic flow and density with temporal correlations. The experimentation on a real-world taxi trajectory traffic data set is performed and the evaluation results prove the effectiveness of our method.},

However, one of the key challenges in CIoV systems is to design a smart agent that can smartly schedule the packet transmission for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) under extreme random and noisy network conditions. We propose a software defined network (SDN) based scheduling algorithm that leverages generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep distributional Q-network (GAN-DDQN) for learning the action-value distribution for intelligent transmission scheduling. A reward-clipping technique is proposed for stabilizing the training of GAN-DDQN against the effect of broadly spanning utility values. The extensive simulation results verify that GAN-Scheduling achieves higher spectral efficiency (SE), service level agreement (SLA), system throughput, transmission packet rate with lower transmission delay, and power consumption compared to the existing reinforcement learning algorithms.},

A typical scenario is massive crowd management of the multi-millions annual Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca where UAVs are widely utilized to conduct crowd monitoring by carrying sensory devices. The safe flight of a UAV is crucial for ensuring the successful execution of missions. With the aim to overcome the disadvantage caused by the ground station intrusion detection, the combination of UAV and airborne LiDAR has been widely studied in the field of UAV obstacle recognition. This article studies the UAV network architecture under a common scenario and proposes an obstacle recognition and intrusion detection algorithm for UAV based on an airborne LiDAR (ALORID). First, the preprocessing of the data obtained by a LiDAR, i.e., the coordinate conversion of LiDAR data in combination with UAV motion parameters, is completed. Then, the LiDAR data graph at the current moment is generated by the image noisy point filtering algorithm. After that, the improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used for image clustering of intrusions to obtain the LiDAR time-domain cumulative graph in a certain detection time. Finally, the motion recognition and location detection of each cluster are completed. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in identifying the moving state of the intrusions.},

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) can mitigate the security threats by detecting abnormal network behaviours. However, existing IDS solutions are limited to detect abnormal network behaviors under local sub-networks rather than the entire VANET. To address this problem, we utilize deep learning with generative adversarial networks and explore distributed SDN to design a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for VANETs, which enables multiple SDN controllers jointly train a global intrusion detection model for the entire network without directly exchanging their sub-network flows. We prove the correctness of our CIDS in both IID (Independent Identically Distribution) and non-IID situations, and also evaluate its performance through both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset. Detailed experimental results validate that our CIDS is efficient and effective in intrusion detection for VANETs.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are vulnerable to security and safety issues that threaten the lives of the people. Unlike manual vehicles, the security of communications and computing components of AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques, thus barring AVs from the effective use in our routine lives. Once manual vehicles are connected to the Internet, called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), it would be exploited by cyber-attacks, like denial of service, sniffing, distributed denial of service, spoofing and replay attacks. In this article, we present a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ITS, in particular, to discover suspicious network activity of In-Vehicles Networks (IVN), vehicles to vehicles (V2V) communications and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I) networks. A Deep Learning architecture-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder algorithm is designed to recognize intrusive events from the central network gateways of AVs. The proposed IDS is evaluated using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the car hacking dataset for in-vehicle communications and the UNSW-NB15 dataset for external network communications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed system achieved over a 99% accuracy for detecting all types of attacks on the car hacking dataset and a 98% accuracy on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, outperforming other eight intrusion detection techniques.},

The approach as presented allows to identify both individual and group outliers and is based on a two phase-based algorithm. The first phase determines the individual trajectory outliers by computing the distance of each point in each trajectory, whereas the second identifies the group trajectory outliers by exploring the individual trajectory outliers using both feature selection and sliding windows strategies. A parallel version of the algorithm is also proposed using a sliding window-based GPU approach to boost the runtime performance. Extensive experiments have been carried out to thoroughly demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology on both synthetic and real trajectory databases. The results show that the GPU approach enables reaching a speed-up of 341 over the sequential algorithm on large synthetic databases. The efficiency of the proposed method to detect both individual and group trajectory outliers on a real-world taxi trajectory database is also demonstrated in comparison with baseline trajectory outlier and group detection algorithms. The results are very promising and show superiority of the proposed method both in reducing computational time and enhancing the quality of returned outliers.

As streaming video is increasing, it becomes infeasible to have human operators sitting in front of hundreds of screens to catch suspicious activities or detect objects of interests in real-time. Actually, with millions of traffic surveillance cameras installed, video retrieval is more vital than ever. To that end, this article proposes a long video event retrieval algorithm based on superframe segmentation. By detecting the motion amplitude of the long video, a large number of redundant frames can be effectively removed from the long video, thereby reducing the number of frames that need to be calculated subsequently. Then, by using a superframe segmentation algorithm based on feature fusion, the remaining long video is divided into several Segments of Interest (SOIs) which include the video events. Finally, the trained semantic model is used to match the answer generated by the text question, and the result with the highest matching value is considered as the video segment corresponding to the question. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed long video event retrieval and description method which significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of semantic description, and significantly reduces the retrieval time.},

However, at present, people’s main concerns are about its privacy and security. Since traditional protocol layers based security mechanisms are not so effective for a distributed system, trust value-based security mechanisms, a type of pervasive security, are appearing as popular and promising techniques. A few statistical non-learning based models for measuring the trust level of a driverless are available in the current literature. These are not so effective because of not being able to capture the extremely distributed, dynamic, and complex nature of the traffic systems. To bridge this research gap, in this paper, for the first time, we propose two deep learning-based models that measure the trustworthiness of a driverless car and its major On-Board Unit (OBU) components. The second model also determines its OBU components that were breached during the driving operation. Results produced using real and simulated traffic data demonstrate that our proposed DNN based deep learning models outperform other machine learning models in assessing the trustworthiness of individual car as well as its OBU components. The average precision of detection accuracies for the car, LiDAR, camera, and radar are 0.99, 0.96, 0.81, and 0.83, respectively, which indicates the potential real-life application of our models in assessing the trust level of a driverless car.},

  abstract     = {A large scale fast-growing data generated in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has become a ponderous burden on the coordination of heterogeneous transportation networks, which makes the traditional cloud-centric storage architecture no longer satisfy new data analytics requirements. Meanwhile, the lack of storage trust between ITS devices and edge servers could lead to security risks in the data storage process. However, a unified data distributed storage architecture for ITS with intelligent management and trustworthiness is absent in the previous works. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed trustworthy storage architecture with reinforcement learning in ITS, which also promotes edge services. We adopt an intelligent storage scheme to store data dynamically with reinforcement learning based on trustworthiness and popularity, which improves resource scheduling and storage space allocation. Besides, trapdoor hashing based identity authentication protocol is proposed to secure transportation network access. Due to the interaction between cooperative devices, our proposed trust evaluation mechanism is provided with extensibility in the various ITS. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed distributed trustworthy storage architecture outperforms the compared ones in terms of trustworthiness and efficiency.},

To solve this problem, a semi-supervised controller based on deep belief network (DBN) algorithm is proposed in the presence of unknown external disturbances. Firstly, the extended state observer (ESO) is designed to ensure fast convergence of observation errors with high enough estimation precision. An output-constrained controller is designed by backstepping method, and the estimated value of ESO is introduced to ensure that the output airgap is constrained within a bounded range. Then, the stability of this method is proved based on the symmetric Barrier Lyapunov function. Subsequently, a semi-supervised controller is presented based on DBN algorithm and the output-constrained controller. The numerical simulation results show that this method can effectively deal with unmeasurable airgap velocity and generalized external disturbances, and guarantee the vertical security with output airgap within a bounded range. Finally, experiments are implemented on a full-scale maglev vehicle and the experimental results demonstrate that the developed deep learning controller can ensure the vertical security.},

  abstract     = {The new developments in mobile edge computing (MEC) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications has positioned 5G and beyond in a strong position to answer the market need towards future emerging intelligent transportation systems and smart city applications. The major attractive features of V2X communication is the inherent ability to adapt to any type of network, device, or data, and to ensure robustness, resilience and reliability of the network, which is challenging to realize. In this work, we propose to drive further these features by proposing a novel robust, resilient and reliable architecture for V2X communication based on harnessing MEC and blockchain technology. A three stage computing service is proposed. Firstly, a hierarchcial computing architecture is deployed spanning over the vehicular network that constitutes cloud computing (CC), edge computing (EC), fog computing (FC) nodes. The resources and data bases can migrate from the high capacity cloud services (furthest away from the individual node of the network) to the edge (medium) and low level fog node, according to computing service requirements. Secondly, the resource allocation filters the data according to its significance, and rank the nodes according to their usability, and selects the network technology according to their physical channel characteristics. Thirdly, we propose a blockchain-based transaction service that ensures reliability. We discussed two use cases for experimental analysis, plug-in electric vehicles in smart grid scenarios, and massive IoT data services for autonomous cars. The results show that car connectivity prediction is accurate 98% of the times, where 92% more data blocks are added using micro-blockchain solution compared to the public blockchain, where it is able to reduce the time to sign and compute the proof-of-work (PoW), and deliver a low-overhead Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This approach can be considered a strong candidate architecture for future V2X, and with more general application for everything-to-everything (X2X) communications.},

Although the drones provide manifold benefits still there are many issues (security, privacy, and data integrity) which must be resolved before the usage of drones in smart cyber-physical systems. So, in this paper, a blockchain-based security mechanism for cyber-physical systems is proposed to ensure secure transfer of information among drones. In this mechanism, the miner node is selected using a deep learning-based approach, i.e., a deep Boltzmann machine, using features like computational resources, the available battery power, and flight time of the drone.

The DLR constraint, particularly in the islanding mode, influences the ampacity of MG feeders, when distribution lines reach their maximum capacity. To overcome any line outage or contingency situation, smart PHEVs are utilized to help improve the grid security. However, using PHEVs can cause higher power losses and feeder overloading issues. To address these concerns, a reconfiguration technique is employed in this paper. A heuristic algorithm, known as the collective decision-based optimization algorithm, is utilized to overcome the non-convexity and nonlinearity of the problem. The unscented transform technique is employed to model DLR uncertainties caused by solar radiation, load demand, and weather temperature, as well as PHEVs&#39; uncertainties caused by varying charging strategies, numbers of PHEVs being charged, charging start time, and charging duration. Moreover, a deep learning gated recurrent unit technique is designed to forecast renewable power output for mitigating the uncertainties in renewable energy components.

In this paper, a Secure and Private-Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (SP-CIDS) is proposed to detect network attacks and to mitigate security concerns. In SP-CIDS, a Distributed Machine Learning (DML) model based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used, which leverages the potential of vehicle-to-vehicle collaboration in the learning process to improve the storage efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of the IDS. However, there are significant data privacy concerns possible in such collaboration, where a CIDS can act as a malicious system that has access to the intermediate stages of the learning process. Additionally, the SP-CIDS system uses Differential Privacy (DP) technique to address the aforementioned data privacy risk associated with the DML-based CIDS. The SP-CIDS system is evaluated with logistic regression, naïve bayes, and ensemble classifiers. Simulation results substantiate that a private ensemble classifier secures the training data with DP and also achieves 96.94% accuracy.},

These cameras generate big multimedia data, and as a result, the ITS faces challenges like data management, redundancy, and privacy breaching in end-to-end communication. To solve these challenges, we propose a framework, called SPEED, based on a multi-level edge computing architecture and machine learning algorithms. In this framework, data captured by end-devices, e.g., smart cameras, is distributed among multiple Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs) to deal with data management issue and minimize packet drop due to buffer overflowing on end-devices and LOEDs. The data is forwarded from LOEDs to Level-Two Edge Devices (LTEDs) in a compressed sensed format. The LTEDs use an online Least-Squares Support-Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) model to determine distribution characteristics and index values of compressed sensed data to preserve its privacy during transmission between LTEDs and High-Level Edge Devices (HLEDs). The HLEDs estimate the redundancy in forwarded data using a deep learning architecture, i.e., a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is used to detect the presence of moving objects in the forwarded data. If a movement is detected, the data is forwarded to cloud servers for further analysis otherwise discarded. Experimental results show that the use of a multi-level edge computing architecture helps in managing the generated data. The machine learning algorithms help in addressing issues like data redundancy and privacy-preserving in end-to-end communication.},

How to select appropriate participants is a key problem in vehicle-based crowdsensing networks. Some traditional methods choose participants based on minimizing distance, which requires participants to submit their current locations. In this case, participants&#39; location privacy is violated, which influences disclosure of participants&#39; sensitive information. Many privacy preserving task allocation mechanisms have been proposed to encourage users to participate in mobile crowdsensing. However, most of them assume that different participants&#39; task completion quality is the same, which is not reasonable in reality. In this paper, we propose an optimal location privacy preserving and service quality guaranteed task allocation in vehicle-based crowdsensing networks. Specifically, we utilize differential privacy to preserve participants&#39; location privacy, where every participant can submit the obfuscated location to the platform instead of the real one. Based on the obfuscated locations, we design an optimal problem to minimize the moving distance and maximize the task completion quality simultaneously. In order to solve this problem, we decompose it into two linear optimization problems. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The safety driving-related content demands of vehicle users increase rapidly, especially with the development of autonomous driving. It is significantly necessary to obtain the safety-related transportation information of an area when vehicles are drove there, whether or not they are controlled by human being. However, vehicular content caching can bring issues in distributed-fashion, such as high response delay and low content response ratio because of the poor traffic condition and the obstructions of buildings. As a consequence, we adopt UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to assist the driving safety-related content caching for vehicles. Besides, since the power energy and the caching storage of UAVs are limited, it is needed to design an optimal caching scheme to guarantee the driving safety-related content demands of vehicle users as well as reduce the energy consumption of UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel deep Q-learning based air-assisted vehicular caching scheme to respond to the driving safety-related content requests of vehicle users. First, a three-layered content response architecture is introduced, where an airship is leveraged to take charge of the scheduling of UAVs to improve the content response. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is built to describe the specific problem of the proposed scheme. Finally, deep Q-learning is applied to solve the multi-objective problem by learning from the history content requests of vehicle users. Extensive experiments have been conducted which show the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of content hit ratio, response delay, being scheduling probability and packet buffering time.},

  abstract     = {It is expected that a mixture of autonomous and manual vehicles will persist as a part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) for many decades. Thus, addressing the safety issues arising from this mix of autonomous and manual vehicles before autonomous vehicles are entirely popularized is crucial. As the ITS system has increased in complexity, autonomous vehicles exhibit problems such as a low intention recognition rate and poor real-time performance when predicting the driving direction; these problems seriously affect the safety and comfort of mixed traffic systems. Therefore, the ability of autonomous vehicles to predict the driving direction in real time according to the surrounding traffic environment must be improved and researchers must work to create a more mature ITS. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based traffic safety solution for a mixture of autonomous and manual vehicles in a 5G-enabled ITS. In this scheme, a driving trajectory dataset and a natural-driving dataset are employed as the network inputs to long-term memory networks in the 5G-enabled ITS: the probability matrix of each intention is calculated by the softmax function. Then, the final intention probability is obtained by fusing the mean rule in the decision layer. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves intention recognition rates of 91.58% and 90.88% for left and right lane changes, respectively, effectively improving both accuracy and real-time intention recognition and improving the lane change problem in a mixed traffic environment.},

  abstract     = {Advances in information and signal processing technologies have a significant impact on autonomous driving (AD), improving driving safety while minimizing the efforts of human drivers with the help of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches have solved several real-world problems of complex nature. However, their strengths in terms of control processes for AD have not been deeply investigated and highlighted yet. This survey highlights the power of DL architectures in terms of reliability and efficient real-time performance and overviews state-of-the-art strategies for safe AD, with their major achievements and limitations. Furthermore, it covers major embodiments of DL along the AD pipeline including measurement, analysis, and execution, with a focus on road, lane, vehicle, pedestrian, drowsiness detection, collision avoidance, and traffic sign detection through sensing and vision-based DL methods. In addition, we discuss on the performance of several reviewed methods by using different evaluation metrics, with critics on their pros and cons. Finally, this survey highlights the current issues of safe DL-based AD with a prospect of recommendations for future research, rounding up a reference material for newcomers and researchers willing to join this vibrant area of Intelligent Transportation Systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel system architecture including a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) or a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and multiple autonomous vehicles is considered in vehicle location systems. The location parameters of autonomous vehicles can be estimated based on the deep unfolding technique, which is a recent advance of deep learning. Traditional vehicle location methods such as the global position system (GPS) can only locate the target vehicles with relatively low accuracy. The super resolution cannot be achieved when two vehicles are too close, which means that the safety incidents exist when autonomous vehicles are deployed in future intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Different from the existing massive MIMO or RIS equipped with a regular array such as uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform circular array (UCA), we exploit a massive MIMO or a RIS equipped with a conformal array extended from traditional regular array. First, the rotation from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system is achieved based on geometric algebra. Second, 2D-DOA estimation of autonomous vehicles is modeled as a novel block sparse recovery problem. Third, the deep network architecture SBLNet is implemented to learn the nonlinear characteristic from the DOAs of autonomous vehicles and the data received by massive MIMOs or RISs. The 2D-DOA and polarization parameters can be estimated based on SBLNet with relatively low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that SBLNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy and successful probability. The SBLNet is also suitable for the practical scenario considering fast moving autonomous vehicles, while, the traditional block sparse recovery methods fail in this complex scenario.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), owing to their characteristics such as seamless and real-time transfer of data, are imperative infrastructural advancements to realize the emerging smart world. The sensor-generated data are, however, vulnerable to anomalies caused due to faults, errors, and/or cyberattacks, which may cause accidents resulting in fatal casualties. To help in avoiding such situations by timely detecting anomalies, this study proposes an anomaly detection method that incorporates a combination of a multi-stage attention mechanism with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely, MSALSTM-CNN. The data streams, in the proposed method, are converted into vectors and then processed for anomaly detection. We also designed a method, namely, weight-adjusted fine-tuned ensemble: WAVED, which works on the principle of average predicted probability of multiple classifiers to detect anomalies in CAVs and benchmark the performance of the MSALSTM-CNN method. The MSALSTM-CNN method effectively enhances the anomaly detection rate in both low and high magnitude cases of anomalous instances in the dataset with the gain of up to 2.54% in F-score for detecting different single anomaly types. The method achieves the gain of up to 3.24% in F-score in the case of detecting mixed anomaly types. The experiment results show that the MSALSTM-CNN method achieves promising performance gain for both single and mixed multi-source anomaly types as compared to the state-of-the-art and benchmark methods.},

Method: the intelligent transportation system is improved by using the deep learning algorithm, and the improved system is simulated, and the data transmission performance, accuracy prediction performance and path change strategy of the system are statistically analyzed. Results: in the analysis of the data transmission performance of the system, the probability of successful propagation is found to be 100%. When the value of λ is 0.01~0.05, it is the closest to the actual result and the data delay is the smallest. In the analysis of the accuracy prediction of the system, it is found that the system of this study has the best accuracy prediction performance with the increase of the number of iterations compared with other models in different categories. After further analyzing the path induction strategy of the system, it is found that the route guidance strategy of this study can effectively restrain the spread of congestion and achieve the effect of timely evacuation of traffic congestion in the face of congested road sections. Conclusion: it is found that the improvement of the intelligent transportation system by using deep learning can significantly reduce the data transmission delay of the system, improve the prediction accuracy, and effectively change the path in the face of congestion to suppress the congestion spread. Although there are some shortcomings in the experiment, it still provides experimental reference for the development of the transportation industry in the later stage.},

  abstract     = {Connected automated driving technologies have shown tremendous improvement in recent years. However, it is still not clear how driving behaviors and energy consumption correlate with each other and to what extent these factors related to connected vehicles can influence the motion prediction performance. The precise recognition of driving behaviors and prediction of the vehicle motion is critical to the driving safety for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Hence, in this study, an energy-aware driving pattern analysis and motion prediction system are proposed for CAVs using a deep learning-based time-series modeling approach. First, energy-aware longitudinal acceleration and deceleration behaviors and lateral lane-change behaviors are statistically analyzed. Then, a sliding standard deviation (SSD) test is applied to evaluate the smoothness of the trajectory and velocity signals considering different energy consumption levels. An energy-aware personalized joint time-series modeling (PJTSM) approach based on a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) cell are proposed for accurate motion (trajectory and velocity) prediction of the leading vehicle. Finally, the differences in the prediction performance regarding different energy consumption levels are compared and discussed. It is shown that due to the higher randomness of the driving behaviors, the prediction accuracy for heavy energy users is the lowest among the three categories, which means it is harder to anticipate the driving behaviors of cars exhibiting heavy energy consumption. The personalized estimation of driving behaviors of CAVs will contribute to safer automated driving and transportation systems.},

To ensure safe and smooth operations in frequent bad weather scenarios, image dehazing is crucial to any vehicular motion and navigation task on road or air. Moreover, the commonly deployed mobile systems are resource constrained in nature. Therefore, it is important to ensure memory, compute and run-time efficiency of dehazing algorithms. In this manuscript we propose ReViewNet, a fast, lightweight and robust dehazing system suitable for autonomous vehicles. The network uses components like spatial feature pooling, quadruple color-cue, multi-look architecture and multi-weighted loss to effectively dehaze images captured by cameras of autonomous vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed model is analyzed by exhaustive quantitative evaluation on five benchmark datasets demonstrating its supremacy over other existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, a component-wise ablation and loss weight ratio analysis demonstrates the contribution of each and every component of the network. We also show the qualitative analysis with special use cases and visual responses on distinctive vehicular vision instances, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed method in numerous hazy weather conditions for autonomous vehicular applications.},

  abstract     = {Running at a fast speed, the high-speed train is prone to be interrupted by the surrounding strong wind. To ensure the safety of the trains, an effective approach is to deploy anemometers alongside the railway, such that the real-time and short-term predicted wind speed can be reported, and be further used by dispatchers to take protective actions in advance. However, in certain situations, the solely predicted wind speed is not informative enough to describe the wind status. It is difficult to tell if a strong wind incident could happen when the predicted wind speed is slightly lower than the strong wind threshold. We take the first attempt to predict the strong wind risk alongside the high-speed railway (HSR). A new model, called Multiple Attention Layer based Multi-Instance Learning (MAL-MIL), is proposed to address this problem. The key idea is to estimate the possibility that the actual wind speed exceeds the threshold conditionally on the predicted wind status. Based on attention mechanisms and long-short term memory network, the model can firstly generate deep representations of the future wind status. Then, though there is a lack of the risk ground truth, the multi-instance learning process facilitates the training procedure so that the relationships between these deep representations and the strong wind incidents could be quantified. Furthermore, considering the practicality of the model, we also design a result justification module to explain the reported risk. The superior performance is finally verified based on a real-world dataset.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection and tracking play an important role in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. Adverse weather conditions such as the presence of heavy snow, fog, rain, dust or sandstorm situations are dangerous restrictions on camera’s function by reducing visibility, affecting driving safety. Indeed, these restrictions impact the performance of detection and tracking algorithms utilized in the traffic surveillance systems and autonomous driving applications. In this article, we start by proposing a visibility enhancement scheme consisting of three stages: illumination enhancement, reflection component enhancement, and linear weighted fusion to improve the performance. Then, we introduce a robust vehicle detection and tracking approach using a multi-scale deep convolution neural network. The conventional Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter based tracker is utilized jointly with hierarchical data associations (HDA), which splits into detection-to-track and track-to-track associations. Herein, the cost matrix of each phase is solved using the Hungarian algorithm to compensate for the lost tracks caused by missed detection. Only detection information (i.e., bounding boxes with detection scores) is used in HDA without visual features information for rapid execution. We have also introduced a novel benchmarking dataset designed for research in applications of autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions called DAWN. It consists of real-world images collected with different types of adverse weather conditions. The proposed method is tested on DAWN, KITTI, and MS-COCO datasets and compared with 21 vehicle detectors. Experimental results have validated effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms state-of-the-art vehicle detection and tracking approaches under adverse weather conditions.},

For example, autonomous vehicles can communicate electronically with one another, make fast decisions and associated actuation, and generally act deterministically. In contrast, manual vehicles cannot communicate electronically, are limited by the capabilities and slow reaction of human drivers, and may show some uncertainty and even irrationality in behavior due to the involvement of humans.

The maturity of communication technologies (Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V)) and the amalgamation of smart grids, electric vehicles (EVs) and energy trading resulted in a storm of research opportunities for green ITS. In addition, the combination of vehicular communication technologies and ITS enable efficient selection of EV charging stations (CS) and scheduling EVs charging requirements in real-time. However, the untrusted centralized nature of energy markets and EV charging infrastructures result in several privacy and security threats to EV user&#39;s private information.

First, a blockchain-based framework is introduced to implement secure charging services and trusted reservation for EVs with the execution of smart contract. Second, we focus on the efficient CS selection and propose a mechanism for EVs to select the CS locally without sharing private information to CS, while fulfilling their service requirements.

  abstract     = {Connected vehicles (CVs) are getting increasing attention in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In terms of the stringent security and anonymity issues, a novel anonymous and decentralized payment platform is demanded. Bitcoin is regarded as a potential solution. But the existing Bitcoin and its various improvements lack a beforehand anti-fraud Bitcoin deposit scheme, which is necessary to prevent potential fraud risks from Bitcoin to CVs. This paper aims to build a novel anti-fraud deposit scheme as a seamless bridge between CV networks and the Bitcoin payment platform. We propose a Bitcoin-to-Connected-Vehicle deposit scheme (Bit2CV) with an outsourcing endorsement in order to build an anti-fraud deposit transaction (dtr). Firstly, Bit2CV leverages a special Bitcoin-opcode-OP_RETURN based method to record the dtr, the CV&#39;s request, and the endorsement together on Blockchain ledger. This method can achieve security features, including non-repudiation, privacy-friendly endorsement, future audit, and anti-fraud. Meanwhile, Bit2CV is fully decentralized without any involvement of centralized authorities and fully compatible with the current Bitcoin network. We conduct the security analysis and also simulations for performance evaluation. In a typical scenario of our simulation, Bit2CV total time cost is less than 477.03 ms, and the size of the endorsement is 1,732 bytes, which is much less and smaller than transaction confirmation time and the average block size, respectively. These designs and results demonstrate that Bit2CV is feasible and practical.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicular communication is fundamental to manage vehicle-to-grid (V2G) interaction, where electric vehicles (EVs) provide energy to balance demand of critical loads (CLs). We propose resource efficiency (RE) to exploit the tradeoff between spectral efficiency (SE) and cost efficiency (CE) of EVs in a V2G communication network. The CE is the data rate of the V2G channel between EVs and base station (BS) over the operating cost of EVs to supply energy to CLs. We consider maximizing the RE in the downlink of a V2G communication network, where EVs are served by a BS and associated with CLs, while satisfying energy demand and charging station constraints. As the proposed RE problem is inherently non-convex and known to be NP-hard, we develop a suboptimal scheme based on a two-phase algorithm. Phase 1 derives optimum EV-CL association using a heuristic approach, while phase 2 finds optimum power allocation using geometric programming. We then derive upper and lower bounds to the optimal RE as a benchmark to study the performance gap of the suboptimal scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed suboptimal scheme is close to the optimal solution, while its complexity is relatively low, making it promising for V2G applications.},

  abstract     = {The staggering growth of the number of vehicles worldwide has become a critical challenge resulting in tragic incidents, environment pollution, congestion, etc. Therefore, one of the promising approaches is to design a smart vehicular system as it is beneficial to drive safely. Present vehicular system lacks data reliability, security, and easy deployment. Motivated by these issues, this paper addresses a drone-enabled intelligent vehicular system, which is secure, easy to deploy and reliable in quality. Nevertheless, an increase in the number of operating drones in the communication networks makes them more vulnerable towards the cyber-attacks, which can completely sabotage the communication infrastructure. To tackle these problems, we propose a blockchain-based registration and authentication system for the entities such as drones, smart vehicles (SVs) and roadside units (RSUs). This paper is mainly focused on the blockchain-based secure system design and the optimal placement of drones to improve the spectral efficiency of the overall network. In particular, we investigate the association of RSUs with the drones by considering multiple communication-related factors such as available bandwidth, maximum number of links a drone can support, and backhaul limitations. We show that the proposed model can easily be overlaid on the current vehicular network reaping benefits of secure and reliable communications.},

With the rapid development of the fifth- generation (5G) network, the features of low delay, high reliability and superior communication efficiency can bring historic opportunities for the development of the EC-IoV system. In the 5G-enabled EC-IoV system, extreme densification of 5G base stations (gNBs) provides rapid and reliable network access and information interaction. However, this densification also brings more complex connectivity to the network, which increases the difficulty of resource migration and scheduling for the edge devices. Thus, it is still a challenge to manage the resources of the edge devices under the premise of reducing the energy and time cost in the system while avoiding the situation of overload or underload to maintain the stability of the system. In this article, a 5G-enabled EC-IoV system framework is proposed to enhance the performance of *the existing EC-IoV system. Specific computation offloading in 5G-enabled EC-IoV system is presented under three different cases. Through the above cases, two communication modes are concluded and the corresponding resource allocation strategy is given in this article. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated and compared with the existing system. Finally, future research directions in this area are considered.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicular networks converged with software-defined networking provides several flow-based surveillance services to mobile applications on vehicular nodes. But, as the scale of such networks grows exponentially, a substantial delay in processing tremendous flows emerges. The delay can be reduced by accelerating the packet classification methods, which are nowadays exploited in software-defined vehicular networks. Fast packet classification lets firewalls to inspect each incoming packet at wire speed. One of the well-known packet classification methods is the KD-tree algorithm. This paper presents an enhanced version of this algorithm that uses the geometric space to display different fields and increases search speed by recursive decomposition of the search space. Also, the enhanced KD-tree is integrated with a leaf-pushing technique, which enhances the performance of KD-tree search during classification. The proposed algorithm is implemented using a bloom filter data structure and a hash table. Experimental results show that the proposed leaf-pushed KD-tree algorithm improves packet classification speed up to 24 times in comparison with the conventional KD-tree. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the classification time in comparison with state-of-the-art tree-based algorithms.},

The combination of Massive MIMO and PNC has shown a significant improvement in the bit error rate (BER) in our previous investigation. The corresponding framework is analysed against a barraging attack from a jammer, where the jamming channel is not known to the base station (BS), and the jammer can use any number of transmit antennas. Over Rayleigh channel, our simulation results reveal that Massive MIMO PNC performs better in the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions to jamming attacks and this is achieved at twice the spectral efficiency.

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) has become an important part of modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, under the influence of malicious mobile vehicles, offloading vehicle tasks to the cloud server is threatened by security attacks. Edge cloud offloading (ECCO) has considered a promising approach to enable latency-sensitive VANET. How to solve the complex computation offloading of vehicles while ensuring the high security of the cloud server is an issue that needs urgent research. In this paper, we studied the safety and offloading of multi-vehicle ECCO system based on cloud blockchain. First, to achieve consensus in the vehicular environment, we propose a distributed hierarchical software-defined VANET (SDVs) framework to establish a security architecture. Secondly, to improve the security of offloading, we propose to use blockchain-based access control, which protects the cloud from illegal offloading actions. Finally, to solve the intensive computing problem of authorized vehicles, we determine task offloading via jointly optimizing offloading decisions, consensus mechanism decisions, allocation of computation resources and channel bandwidth. The optimization method is designed to minimize long-term system of delays, energy consumption, and flow costs for all vehicles. To better resolve the proposed offloading method, we develop a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm via utilizing extended deep Q-networks. We evaluate the performance of our framework on access control and offloading through numerical simulations, which have significant advantages over existing solutions.},

With the integration of blockchain in such networks, information of all granularity levels, from complete blocks to individual transactions, would be accessible to vehicles at any time. Specifically, the blockchain technology is expected to improve the security, immutability, and decentralization of cellular V2X communication through smart contract and distributed ledgers. Although blockchain-based cellular V2X networks hold promise, many challenges need to be addressed to enable the future interoperability and accessibility of such large-scale platforms. One such challenge is the offloading of mining tasks in cellular V2X networks. While transportation authorities may try to balance the network mining load, the vehicles may select the nearest mining clusters to offload a task. This may cause congestion and disproportionate use of vehicular network resources. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic approach for balancing the load at mining clusters while maintaining fairness among offloading vehicles. Keeping in mind the low-latency requirements of vehicles, we consider a finite channel blocklength transmission which is more practical compared to the use of infinite blocklength codes. The simulation results obtained with our proposed offloading framework show improved performance over the conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a cooperative device-to-device (D2D) system with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). We assume that the base station (BS) can simultaneously communicate with all users to satisfy the full information transmission requirement. In order to characterize the impact of the weak channel and different decoding schemes, two novel decoding strategies are introduced: single signal decoding scheme and maximum ratio combining (MRC) decoding scheme, respectively. With the single signal decoding scheme, the users decode the received signals immediately after the receptions from the BS. On the other hand, the MRC decoding scheme jointly decodes the received signals via MRC until the corresponding phase comes and the users jointly decode the received signals by employing MRC. Considering Rayleigh fading channels, the ergodic sum-rate (SR), outage probability and outage capacity of the proposed D2D-NOMA system are analyzed. Moreover, approximate expressions for the ergodic SR are also provided with a negligible performance loss. Numerical results demonstrate that the ergodic SR and outage probability of the proposed D2D-NOMA scheme overwhelm that of the conventional NOMA schemes. Furthermore, it is also revealed that the system performance including the ergodic SR and outage probability are limited by the weak channel for both the single signal decoding scheme and conventional NOMA schemes, but not for the MRC decoding scheme.},

  abstract     = {Quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) is recently proposed to increase the spectral efficiency (SE) of SM, which extends the transmitted symbols into in-phase and quadrature domains. In this paper, we propose a generalized QSM (GQSM) scheme to further increase the SE of QSM by activating more than one transmit antenna in in-phase or quadrature domain. A low-complexity detection scheme for GQSM is provided to mitigate the detection burden of the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detection method. An upper bounded bit error rate is analyzed to discover the system performance of GQSM. Moreover, by collaborating with the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, we investigate the practical application of GQSM to cooperative vehicular networks and propose the cooperative GQSM with OMA (C-OMA-GQSM) and cooperative GQSM with NOMA (C-NOMA-GQSM) schemes. Computer simulation results verify the reliability of the proposed low-complexity detection as well as the theoretical analysis, and show that GQSM outperforms QSM in the entire SNR region. The superior BER performance of the proposed C-NOMA-GQSM scheme make it a promising modulation candidate for next generation vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {As a key enabler in the green transport system, the popularity of Electric Vehicles (EV) has attracted attention from academia and industrial communities. However, the driving range of EVs is inevitably affected by the insufficient battery volume, as such EV drivers may experience trip discomfort due to a long battery charging time (under traditional plug-in charging service). One feasible alternative to accelerate the service time to feed electricity is the battery switch technology, by cycling switchable (fully-recharged) batteries at Battery Switch Stations (BSSs) to replace the depleted batteries from incoming EVs. Along with recent advance of vehicle cooperation through emerging Information Communication Technology (ICT), in this paper we propose a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) driven architecture to gear the intelligent battery switch service management for EVs. Here, the decision making on where to switch battery is operated by EVs in a distributed manner. Besides, the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in line with public transportation bus system is applied to operate flexible information exchange between EVs and BSSs. Dedicated MEC functions are positioned for bus system to efficiently disseminate BSSs status and aggregate EVs&#39; reservations, concerning the massive signalling exchange cost. The Global Controller (GC) is positioned as cloud server to gather BSSs (service providers) status and EVs&#39; reservations (clients), and predict the service availability of BSS (e.g., whether/when a battery can be switched). We conduct performance evaluation to show the advantage of MEC system in terms of reduction of communication cost, and BSS service management scheme regarding reduction of service waiting time (e.g., how long to wait for battery switch) and increase of service satisfaction rate (e.g., how many batteries to switch for EVs).},

However, the spectrum availability and data sharing/transferring among vehicles are critical improving services and driving safety metrics where the presence of Malicious Devices (MD) further degrade the network performance. Recently, a blockchain technique in CRN-based IoV has been introduced to prevent data alteration from these MD and allowing the vehicles to track both legal and illegal activities in the network. In this paper, we provide the security to IoV during spectrum sensing and information transmission using CRN by sensing the channels through a decision-making technique known as Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a technique that evokes the trust of its Cognitive Users (CU) by analyzing certain predefined attributes. Further, blockchain is maintained in the network to trace every activity of stored information. The proposed mechanism is validated rigorously against several security metrics using various spectrum sensing and security parameters against a baseline solution in IoV. Extensive simulations suggest that our proposed mechanism is approximately 70% more efficient in terms of malicious nodes identification and DoS threat against the baseline mechanism.},

The hash itself is not generated if an adversary affects the communication among vehicles.

First, a gridding algorithm is introduced to initialize the population, and under the premise of ensuring the randomness of the initial individuals, improving the ergodicity of the population is conducive to improving the quality of the solution; then, an adaptive location-based update strategy of decreasing inertia weights is proposed. this strategy inherits the advantages of linearly decreasing weights, and adaptively adjusts the weights according to the fitness value to further improve the optimization performance. The optimization simulation of 8 classic test functions shows that the IGSA algorithm is an effective algorithm for solving complex optimization problems. Finally, the IGSA algorithm is used to predict the geographic location problem in the vehicle GPS data. The IGSA algorithm is used to optimize the extreme learning method to optimize the hyperparameters and establish a vehicle GPS data prediction model.

Emerging Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies show significant advantages and efficiency for knowledge sharing among intelligent vehicles.

Moreover, conventional AI-based algorithms cannot work properly in distributed vehicular networks. In this paper, a hierarchical blockchain framework and a hierarchical federated learning algorithm are proposed for knowledge sharing, by which vehicles learn environmental data through machine learning methods and share the learning knowledge with each others. The proposed hierarchical blockchain framework is feasible for the large scale vehicular networks. The hierarchical federated learning algorithm is designed to meet the distributed pattern and privacy requirement of IoVs. Knowledge sharing is then modeled as a trading market process to stimulate sharing behaviours, and the trading process is formulated as a multi-leader and multi-player game. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical algorithm can improve the sharing efficiency and learning quality.

Considering that the scenarios of vehicle communications are dynamic due to movements of vehicles, and there are obvious differences in channel characteristics, vehicle speeds, traffic densities between various scenarios, the requirement for real-time scenario identification of vehicular communications is increasingly urgent. Vehicular communication systems can select appropriate channel models and transmission mode by correctly identifying the current scenarios to maintain an effective and reliable operating state. This paper presents a machine-learning-based scenario identification model for intelligent vehicular communications. Channel characteristics extracted from channel measurements in different scenarios form the datasets used to training, then a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is trained, and a scenario identification model is obtained. Furthermore, the model configuration scheme is explored and presented which can make the proposed identification model achieves optimal performance. Subsequently, identification accuracy is verified by using validation data of the corresponding scenarios. The results show that the identification accuracies are all above 98 % in four typical scenarios of urban areas, highways, tunnels, and vehicle obstructions, which indicates that the model proposed in this paper shows good performance in scenario identification for intelligent vehicular communications.},

IOV is an integrated service system that can support the applications for automatic driving, intelligent transport and information services. As the number of incidents on IOV has been on the rise in the past few years, IOV security is becoming increasingly important in the IOV architecture. One of the most notable risks of IOV faces is intelligent terminal security. The vehicle&#39;s intelligent terminal can be used to launch for further attacks on the on-board operating system to penetrate into the internal network of connected vehicle, and consequently threaten the safety of the vehicle. Thus, it is of paramount importance that we protect the security of the intelligent terminal. We propose two intelligent terminal based privacy-preserving multi-modal implicit authentication protocols to protect the security of the intelligent terminal in IOV. The proposed protocols use the password and the vehicle owner&#39;s behavior features as the authentication factors to protect the security of the intelligent terminal. Since the vehicle owner&#39;s behavior features are sensitive and the privacy information of the user must be protected, we also consider the privacy protection of the behavior features. Our protocols do not reveal any information about the vehicle owner&#39;s behavior features to the authentication server and the adversary except the ciphertext size of the feature vector. We analyze the security of our proposed protocol and compare them with other related protocols in terms of computation and communications costs. Our results demonstrate that our proposed protocols yield better security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Content-sharing is one of the major applications of vehicular networks. To fully utilize the spectrum and the connection time, rate-compatible codes are required when sharing content. In this paper, we present a simple and flexible method to construct low-complexity rate-compatible codes for content sharing. We first present a novel construction framework for rate-compatible codes via recursive block Markov superposition transmission (rBMST). In the proposed construction, the shared content is partitioned into equal-length data chunks and transmitted directly, while their replicas are taken as the inputs of a given number of parallel systematic encoders to generate parity-check chunks. These parity-check chunks are then transmitted in parallel in a recursive block Markov superposition transmission manner. The proposed construction is flexible in the sense that codes with arbitrary rates can be obtained by adjusting the number of parallel rBMST encoders and the number of randomly punctured bits. We show that the simplest construction, using repetition to generate the parity-check chunks, leads to high-performance and low-complexity rate-compatible rBMST (RC-rBMST) codes. Specifically, the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis shows that asymptotic thresholds of the repetition-based RC-rBMST (RB-RC-rBMST) codes are within 0.25 dB of the channel capacities for a wide range of coding rates. Numerical results are presented to confirm the advantages of the RB-RC-rBMST codes in performance and complexity. Particularly, the RB-RC-rBMST codes perform as well as BMST-R codes but with much lower computational complexities.},

Several attempts have been made over the years to predict the traffic scenario accurately and consequently avoiding further congestion. Crowdsourcing has come forward as one of the most adopted methods for predicting traffic intensity using live data. However, the privacy concerns and the lack of motivation for the live users to help in the traffic prediction process have rendered existing crowdsourcing models inefficient. Towards this end, we present an advanced blockchain-based secure crowdsourcing model. Not only does our model ensure privacy preservation of the users, but by incorporating a revenue model, it also provides them with an incentive to participate in the traffic prediction process willingly. For accurate and efficient traffic jam probability estimation, our work proposes a neural network-based smart contract to be deployed onto the blockchain network.

  abstract     = {Travel route planning aims to map out a feasible sightseeing itinerary for a traveler covering famous attractions and meeting the tourist&#39;s desire. It is very useful for tourists to plan their travel routes when they want to travel at unfamiliar scenic cities. Existing methods for travel route planning mainly concentrate on a single planning problem for a special task, but is not capable of being applied to other tasks. For example, previous must-visit planning methods cannot be applied to the next-point recommendation, despite these two tasks are closely related to each other in travel route planning. Besides, most of the existing work do not consider the important auxiliary information such as Point of Interests (POI) attributes, user preference, and historical route data in their approaches. In this paper, we propose a flexible Multi-task Deep Travel Route Planning framework named MDTRP to integrate rich auxiliary information for more effective planning. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous network through the relations between users and POIs and employ a heterogeneous network embedding method to learn the features of users and POIs. Then we present an attention-based deep model to integrate the auxiliary information and focus on important visited points for the prediction of next POIs. Finally, a beam search algorithm is introduced to flexibly generate multiple feasible route candidates for three types of planning tasks (next-point recommendation, general route planning, and must-visit planning). We introduce six public datasets to conduct extensive experiments, of which the results demonstrate the flexibility and superiority of the proposed approach in travel route planning.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, the number of vehicles worldwide has increased every year, and this growth is projected to continue unabated. Thus, the congestions, incidents, and environmental pollution which are caused by the increasing number of road vehicles and traffics have resulted in hundreds of millions of losses and become a major challenge to the sustainable development of recent human society. Both academia and industry have already reached a consensus that vehicular communication is a vital element to extend the sensing ability of vehicles for ensuring safety driving. Unfortunately, current vehicular communication cannot meet the security, reliability, and effectiveness and other needs of ITS. The industry needs a more intelligent vehicular communication to support secure and reliable transmission of data. Therefore, the research community has to focus more on enhanced and completely new communication techniques.},

  abstract     = {We are introducing an innovative networking approach to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for their automation and orchestration by redesigning the wireless edge framework. To this end, we propose to expand the Software Defined Networking (SDN) functionality from the edge network to the cars, i.e. equipping our vehicles with mobile base stations having SDN capabilities. By adopting such a novel approach, most of the impending IoV automation and orchestration challenges are ameliorated, which has been extremely difficult and non-trivial to tackle by using standard existing approaches. The three primary challenges identified in this context are a) the scalability of the network of connected autonomous vehicles, b) the desirable security of the IoV data networking, and c) the flexibility of quality of experience (QoE) perceived by the vehicles. To tackle the aforementioned three challenges, we design a policy-driven framework for a secure and efficient IoV networking paradigm and then investigate its performance via analytic modeling. More importantly, from the IoV data networking perspective, we design an intent-based flow offloading scheme to facilitate enhanced and adjustable QoE. Furthermore, we develop a rigorous analysis to quantify the efficiency of the proposed SDN-capable IoV data networking by modeling TCP connections over WiFi. Using mathematics as a tool for reasoning the three key challenges, our feasibility analysis is validated with extensive simulations. Finally, we provide new insights by deriving the stability conditions for the data flow dynamics of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Data of the train communication network(TCN) is becoming more complicated, which results in higher requirements of the data processing unit-the multifunction vehicle bus controller (MVBC) connected within the TCN. Developing an MVBC is challenging because of the integrated hardware-software solutions to support reactions in real time and dynamic environment. Hence, there is an urgent need for a rigorous design framework to facilitate the development of MVBC. In this paper, we propose a design framework TooMVBC to generate executable MVBC code from formal verified computation model. TooMVBC uses formal computation model MVBChart to capture the specification of the MVBC at high level. First, primitive syntax of MVBChart is designed to model MVBC features (e.g. hierarchy structure, data flow of the encoder, the control logic of communication protocol), and semantics of MVBChart is formalized for simulation and verification. Then, semantics-preserving code generation algorithms are designed to generate VHDL code for partitioned hardware implementations and C code for partitioned software implementations from verified MVBChart model. The generated code can be loaded into the proposed flexible MVBC hardware architecture directly. Finally, supporting graphical model editor, simulator, verification translator, partitioning and code generator are implemented and seamlessly integrated into TooMVBC. When we apply TooMVBC to design MVBC with the highest class 5 according to the description of the standard IEC 61375, several critical ambiguousness or bugs in the standard are detected during formal verification of the constructed system model.},

Because of the unique functional requirement of omni-inclusiveness, HEs are expected to monitor patients, allowing for connectivity with vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In the absence of literature on security provisioning frameworks that connect VANETs and HEs, this paper presents a smart zero-knowledge proof and statistical fingerprinting-based trusted secure communication framework for a fog computing environment. A zero-knowledge proof is used for vehicle authentication, and statistical fingerprinting is employed to secure communication between VANETs and HEs. Authenticity verification of the operations is performed at the on-board unit (OBU) fitted in the vehicle based on the service executions at the resident hardware platform. The processor clock cycles are acquired from the service executions in a complete sandboxed environment. The calculated cycles assist in developing the blueprint signature for the particular OBU of the vehicle. Hence, the fingerprint signature helps build trust and plays a key role in authenticating the vehicle&#39;s horizontal movement to everything or to different sections of the HEs. In an environment enabled for fog computing, our novel model can provide efficient remote monitoring.},

When any vehicle or RSU is under attack or control, the entire network may collapse and produce incorrect computing results, which in the worst case, can lead to car accidents. Therefore, building a highly reliable and fault-tolerant software-defined IoV is of high importance. In this paper, we visit the consensus problem in software-defined IoV. Software-defined IoV is built with infrastructures, that is, RSUs. RSUs have a backhaul capacity and a powerful computing capacity.

As a supplement to cloud computing, fog computing can effectively alleviate the bottlenecks of cloud computing bandwidth and computing resources and improve the quality of service (QoS) of the IoV. However, as a distributed system that operates near users, fog computing has a complicated network structure. In the complex and dynamic IoV environment, to effectively manage these computing resources with different attributes and provide high-quality services, it is necessary to design an efficient architecture and a resource allocation algorithm. Therefore, on the basis of fog-cloud computing and software-defined networking (SDN), a novel 5G IoV architecture is designed. In addition, after fully considering the service requirements of the IoV, a model of four objectives is constructed, and a many-objective optimization algorithm is proposed.

  abstract     = {With the benefits of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm, come along unprecedented security challenges. Among many applications of inter-connected systems, vehicular networks and smart cars are examples that are already rolled out. Smart vehicles not only have networks connecting their internal components e.g. via Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, but also are connected to the outside world through road side units and other vehicles. In some cases, the internal and external network packets pass through the same hardware and are merely isolated by software defined rules. Any misconfiguration opens a window for the hackers to intrude into vehicles&#39; internal components e.g. central lock system, Engine Control Unit (ECU), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) or Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. Compromise of any of these can lead to disastrous outcomes. In this paper, we study the security of smart vehicles&#39; adaptive cruise control systems in the presence of covert attacks. We define two covert/stealth attacks in the context of cruise control and propose a novel intrusion detection and compensation method to disclose and respond to such attacks. More precisely, we focus on the covert cyber attacks that compromise the integrity of cruise controller and employ a neural network identifier in the IDS engine to estimate the system output dynamically and compare it against the ACC output. If any anomaly is detected, an embedded substitute controller kicks in and takes over the control. We conducted extensive experiments in MATLAB to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in a simulated environment.},

The software-defined network (SDN) and fog computing could effectively improve the IoV network dynamics, which enables the application to achieve better performance by offloading some tasks to fog node or cloud center. Current computation offloading approaches for IoV and fog computing mostly focus on resource utilization. However, the energy-aware offloading has not been adequately addressed, especially for IoV systems with many battery-powered roadside units (RSU) and electric vehicles (EV). In this paper, we study the offloading problem in SDN and fog computing-based IoV systems. An energy-aware dynamic offloading scheme is proposed to prolong the running time of the IoV system by leveraging available battery power to execute more applications. The remaining battery power is defined as a dynamic weight factor in the execution cost model to adjust the optimization objective. Meanwhile, the dependence between applications is also taken into consideration in the cost model. A heuristic optimization algorithm is designed to solve the optimization problem. We conducted comprehensive experiments and results have shown that the offloading scheme could execute more applications with the available battery power under the constraints of application dependence.},

  abstract     = {The maritime communication network is assembled by emergent network technologies. However, the adverse maritime environment impedes the efficiency of resources allocation in maritime communication network. Here we show a joint sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission scheme in delay-tolerant maritime wireless communication networks based on software defined networking (SDN) to find a better tradeoff between the energy consumption and the delay. Specifically, an energy-limited delay tolerant networking (DTN) node deployed in the ocean receives/transmits data from/to vessels within its communication range. To further save the energy, a long-term energy minimization problem is formulated with sleeping scheduling and opportunistic transmission. After that, a multi-objective minimization problem of energy and delay is first modeled by Lyapunov optimization (LO), which then is solved by convex optimization. Both mathematical analyses and simulation results demonstrate how the maritime communication network allocates satisfactorily with the proposed allocation scheme.},

  abstract     = {Providing mobility services effectively to residents and visitors is a complex socio-technical system task to city public managers. Smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of city transport facilities and sustainable mobility within the urban environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging from a few blocks within a city to a journey across cities. At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered, considering both the users and the businesses&#39; needs. Several cities indicated an interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the “last-mile” mobility services in the last few years. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to perform critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise and pollution. The article analyses the state-of-art on autonomous shuttles by proposing four application scenarios targeting the last-mile delivery of goods, the tourist experiences, and the shared and integrated mobility. Furthermore, we contribute with the proposition of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility. Our research proposed new research challenges for ASaaS, and we discuss social implications and governance challenges that consider user engagement and sustainability. It also recommended extending new research to focus on simulation and machine learning techniques for last-mile mobility planning and explore the journeys tracking certification via artificial intelligence and blockchain-based techniques.},

Traditional traffic flow predictions are generally suffering from the performance degradation by over-fitting and manual intervening, which cannot support large-scale and high-dimensional urban road network data. To address this issue, in this paper, a traffic flow prediction framework for urban road network based on deep learning is proposed. Firstly, the feature engineering is introduced to extract the features from a large volume of traffic dataset, with the anomaly nodes eliminated. Next, the big traffic dataset is compressed through the spectral clustering compression scheme. Finally, we designed a hybrid traffic flow prediction scheme based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE). Experimental results show that our proposed model is superior to other models with an average prediction accuracy approaching 97.7%.},

The spatial crowdsourcing technology has been adopted as an effective data collection and processing method that is the premise of various SDN-IoV applications. However, as huge amounts of data are generated in spatial crowdsourcing services, the data privacy and security has become a key challenge for SDN-IoV. To overcome abovementioned challenge, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Blockchain empowered Spatial Crowdsourcing System (DB-SCS) is proposed. In DB-SCS, we design an improved multi-blockchain structure and a blockchain-based hierarchical task management method, which divide the spatial tasks into different categories according to the privacy requirements and the areas of the task and then decompose different categories of tasks and task receivers into sub-blockchains. While guaranteeing the data privacy, DB-SCS can also enhance the spatial crowdsourcing performance by using the proposed DRL-based management strategy to dynamically select the consensus algorithm, block size, and block generation rule. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the DB-SCS can obtain high throughput, low overhead, and data privacy under various SDN-IoV scenarios.},

  abstract     = {As the growth of vehicles and the acceleration of urbanization, the urban traffic congestion problem becomes a burning issue in our society. Constructing a software defined Internet of things(SD-IoT) with a proper traffic control scheme is a promising solution for this issue. However, existing traffic control schemes do not make the best of the advances of the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning area. Furthermore, existing traffic congestion solutions based on deep reinforcement learning(DRL) only focus on controlling the signal of traffic lights, while ignore controlling vehicles to cooperate traffic lights. So the effect of urban traffic control is not comprehensive enough. In this article, we propose Modified Proximal Policy Optimization (Modified PPO) algorithm. This algorithm is ideally suited as the traffic control scheme of SD-IoT. We adaptively adjust the clip hyperparameter to limit the bound of the distance between the next policy and the current policy. What&#39;s more, based on the collected data of SD-IoT, the proposed algorithm controls traffic lights and vehicles in a global view to advance the performance of urban traffic control. Experimental results under different vehicle numbers show that the proposed method is more competitive and stable than the original algorithm. Our proposed method improves the performance of SD-IoT to relieve traffic congestion.},

To alleviate the QoE (Quality of Experience) degradation of the vehicular users due to the uncertainties (e.g., resource conflicts and communicating interruption), software-defined network (SDN) is involved in the EC-enabled IoV to manage the cooperative operation of distributed edge nodes (ENs). However, the increasing privacy leakage for the IoV service offloading causes the disclosure of the sensitive information, including driving location, personal information of the driver, etc. Moreover, the regulation of SDN is practically insufficient, as the general control is incompetent to maintain balanced operation with the premise of efficient service utility. In view of these challenges, a secure service offloading method, named SOME, is designed to promote IoV service utility and edge utility, meanwhile ensuring privacy security, in SDN-enabled EC. Specifically, an SDN-based framework for IoV service management is developed to address the inherent uncertainty of edge network by SDN controllers. Besides, the locality-sensitive-hash (LSH) is leveraged to realize utility- and privacy-aware service selection. Eventually, comparative experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of SOME.},

The high-speed mobility features of nodes in the vehicular networks changes the network topology frequently, resulting in low routing efficiency, and higher packet loss. In this article, we utilize software-defined networking (SDN) technology to decouple the network control plane from the data forwarding plane, and divide the vehicular networks into three functional layers: data, control, application layers. Based on the proposed network architecture, we propose an adaptive traffic engineering (TE) mechanism to guarantee the V2V continuous traffic in vehicular networks with high-speed mobile vehicles or dynamic network topology. In particular, the proposed TE is based on a proposed active network measurement mechanism under the assistance of the centralized management ability of the SDN technique. The proposed active network measurement approach is a greedy approach where the next hop determination for the measurement packet takes multiple link reliability factors (e.g., the delay, the length, the packet error rate, the neighbors, etc.) into account. Then, we utilize the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to optimize the TE mechanism that can be deployed and executed in the SDN controller. By the proposed TE mechanism, multiple candidate end-to-end paths can be concurrently measured, and the optimal data forwarding path can be adaptively switched. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach performs better than some recent research outcomes, especially in the aspect of performing reliable data forwarding (almost 5% better than the compared objects).},

To better capture such vibrations and then make more accurate predictions, a parallel deep neural network based on dual fusions including feature and decision is proposed, called DFFD-Net. DFFD-NET is composed of two parts, the feature fusion network and the driving data network. The feature fusion model adopts two different operations, deconvolution and linear weighting, to fuse local features and global features, respectively. Deconvolution is applied between the convolutional layers, while linear weighting is operated among the outputs of SPP and LSTM. To further improve the accuracy of the prediction, the decisions generated from both networks are further weighed to get the final decision. Experimentally, DFFD-NET is implemented in the benchmarks BDDV and TORCS, and the results show that the final performance is benefited from both feature fusion and decision fusion. From the comparison, DFFD-NET can get state-of-the-art results on both perplexity and precision by only using the images captured from the front-facing camera as well as a few sensing data.},

For this, a two-stage solution is proposed, which includes functional safety risk assessment and development cost optimization. The first stage develops a new fast risk assessment (FRA) algorithm to assess the functional safety risk, including the joint reliability risk and the real-time risk, of the SDV functionality. The second stage proposes a dual requirement guarantee (DRG) algorithm to optimize the development cost considering reliability and real-time requirements jointly.

  abstract     = {Vehicular computation offloading is a well-received strategy to execute delay-sensitive and/or compute-intensive tasks of legacy vehicles. The response time of vehicular computation offloading can be shortened by using mobile edge computing that offers strong computing power, driving these computation tasks closer to end users. However, the quality of communication is hard to guarantee due to the obstruction of dense buildings or lack of infrastructure in some zones. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), therefore, have become one of the means to establish communication links for the two ends owing to its characteristics of ignoring terrain and flexible deployment. To make a sensible decision of computation offloading, nevertheless vehicles need to gather offloading-related global information, in which Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has shown its advances in data collection and centralized management. In this paper, thus, we propose an SDN-enabled UAV-assisted vehicular computation offloading optimization framework to minimize the system cost of vehicle computing tasks. In our framework, the UAV and the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server can work on behalf of the vehicle users to execute the delay-sensitive and compute-intensive tasks. The UAV, in a meanwhile, can also be deployed as a relay node to assist in forwarding computation tasks to the MEC server. We formulate the offloading decision-making problem as a multi-players computation offloading sequential game, and design the UAV-assisted Vehicular computation Cost Optimization (UVCO) algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can make the offloading decision to minimize the Average System Cost (ASC).},

Navigation service and traffic information flow among the connected vehicles relies on the available resources and infrastructure units. Appropriate sensing and selection of infrastructure units for seamless navigation responses and information flow in the dynamic environment is facilitated using bio-inspired learning in this article. This method named as ant-inspired recurrent learning model (ARLM) introduced in this article is focused to improve the sensing and response rate of the navigation-based services for the vehicles. This model relies on forward and backward ant agents and recurrent learning for maximizing the navigation service response rate of the vehicles. In this model, the training sets are differentiated on the basis of connection probability and learning depreciation to retain the service rate through different learning iterates. The conditional verification for sensing and retaining active link helps to reduce the sensing and response time irrespective of the varying vehicle and request densities. The performance of the proposed model is verified using suitable experimental analysis and the metrics information flow rate, service sensing, sensing time, response rate, and response time are analyzed for assessing ARLM.},

Extensive progress has been made in autonomous and electric cars. Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are increasingly capable of moving without full control of humans, automating some aspects of driving, such as steering or braking. For these reasons, cities are investing in the infrastructure and technology needed to support connected, multi-modal transit networks that include shared electric Autonomous Vehicles (AV). The relationship between traditional public transport and new mobility services is in the spotlight and need to be rethought. This article proposes an agent-based simulation framework that allows for the creation and simulation of mobility scenarios to investigate the impact of new mobility modes on a city daily life. It lets traffic planners explore the cooperative integration of AV using a decentralized control approach. A prototype has been implemented and validated with data of the city of Trento.},

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles, sensors, pedestrians, and roadside units. IoV is aimed at improving road safety, driving comfort, and traffic efficiency. However, IoV is exposed to a range of threats to security and privacy. The presence of dishonest and misbehaving peers in the system is of a major concern, which may put lives in danger. Thus, establishing trust among these probable untrusted vehicles is one of the most significant challenges of such a network. The critical pitfalls of existing and traditional mechanisms are scalability, a single point of failure, maintaining the quality of service, verification, and revocation and dealing with sparsity, consistency, availability, efficiency, robustness, privacy concerns are some of the biggest challenges to be addressed. Blockchain technology, with its great success in applications like cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, is considered as one of the potential candidates to build trust in IoV. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized trust management scheme using smart contracts. Specifically, we introduce the concept of blockchain sharding for reducing the load on the main blockchain and increasing the transaction throughput. Our proposal has two key contributions: blockchain to maintain and update reliable and consistent trust values across the network and incentive scheme to encourage peers to perform well. We also conduct extensive experiments, which demonstrate the implementation feasibility of proposed mechanisms in the real world.},

  abstract     = {The traffic congestion and accidents can be relieved by deploying the software defined internet of vehicles (SDN-IoV). However, the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles is particularly heavy near commercial streets and campuses. In particular scenarios, the SDN-IoV may not ensure the quality of service (QoS) for pedestrians and vehicles. In this paper, we construct a novel system architecture consisting of multiple non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a SDN-IoV. The non-cooperative UAV is equipped with an antenna array to receive the signals from the vehicles and pedestrians of SDN-IoV. In order to locate the positions of vehicles and pedestrians, two source enumeration methods are proposed in a complex SDN-IoV environment with color noise. The projection matrix of the low dimensional signal subspace is constructed by the proposed criterion based on signal subspace projection (SSP). The sequence of the projected difference values of the local covariance matrix is applied to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. The eigenvalues can be grouped to construct different subspaces by the proposed eigen-subspace projection (ESP). By projecting a new covariance matrix into the eigen-subspaces, the variance of values represents the projection difference can be exploited to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results and real system test verify the validity of the two proposed methods by comparing them with the state-of-the-art methods. Both of the methods have excellent estimation performance especially in color noise.},

One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods.},

In IoV environment, effective handling of streaming data has to face various challenges like; traffic monitoring, flow management, re-configuration and security. Software-defined networks (SDN) provides improved flexibility, and centralized control of the network to overcome (almost) the above-mentioned challenges. However, it can lead to an easy target (node or controller) for malicious agents. So, to detect the anomalous behaviour of the nodes in the IoV environment, a hybrid approach using probabilistic data structures is proposed which works in the following phases. In phase I, a traffic monitoring scheme using Count-Min-Sketch is designed to identify the suspicious nodes. In phase II, to detect an anomaly, a Bloom filter-based control scheme is used for signature verification of suspicious nodes. In phase III, a Quotient filter is used for fast and efficient storage of malicious nodes. In phase IV, to detect the super points (malicious hosts that are connected to a large number of destinations), a Hyperloglog counter is used to measure the cardinality of each flow passing through the switches. The proposed scheme has been evaluated in a simulated environment. The results obtained depict that the proposed scheme is faster, accurate, and efficient concerning detection ratio and false-positive ratio.},

Specifically, we design a network model where roadside objects use wireless power from RF signals of electric vehicles for charging and information processing. Moreover, due to the resource-constraint nature of cellular V2X, the power allocation and resource block assignment are performed to efficiently use the resources. The proposed optimization framework shows an improvement in terms of the overall energy efficiency of the network when compared with the baseline technique.

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been widely used in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) for purposes such as the control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and trajectory prediction. However, an efficient and reliable data routing decision scheme is critical for VANETs due to the feature of self-organizing wireless multi-hop communication. Compared with wireless networks, which are unstable and have limited bandwidth, wired networks normally provide longer transmission distances, higher network speeds and greater reliability. To address this problem, this paper proposes a reliable VANET routing decision scheme based on the Manhattan mobility model, which considers the integration of roadside units (RSUs) into wireless and wired modes for data transmission and routing optimization. First, the problems of frequently moving vehicles and network connectivity are analyzed based on road networks and the motion information of vehicle nodes. Second, an improved greedy algorithm for vehicle wireless communication is used for network optimization, and a wired RSU network is also applied. In addition, routing decision analysis is carried out in accordance with the probabilistic model for various transmission ranges by checking the connectivity among vehicles and RSUs. Finally, comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method can support real-time planning and improve network transmission performance compared with other baseline protocol approaches in terms of several metrics, including package delivery ratio, time delay and wireless hops.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high mobility, dynamic nature, and legacy vehicular networks, the seamless connectivity and reliability become a new challenge in software-defined internet of vehicles based intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Thus, effieicnt optimization of the link with proper monitoring of the high speed of vehicles in ITS is very vital to promote the error-free and trustable platform. Key issues related to reliability, connectivity and stability optimization for vehicular networks are addressed. Thus, this study proposes a novel reliable connectivity framework by developing a stable, and scalable link optimization (SSLO) algorithm, state-of-the-art system model. In addition, a Use-case of smart city with stable and reliable connectivity is proposed by examining the importance of vehicular networks. The numerical experimental results are extracted from software defined-Internet of Vehicle (SD-IoV) platform which shows high stability and reliability of the proposed SSLO under different test scenarios, such as vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to anything (V2X). The proposed SSLO and Baseline algorithms are compared in terms of performance metrics e.g. packet loss ratio, transmission power (i.e., stability), average throughput, and average delay transfer. Finally, the validated results reveal that SSLO algorithm optimizes connectivity (95%), energy efficiency (67%), throughput (4Kbps) and delay (3 sec).},

While most existing approaches regress depth values or classify depth labels based on features extracted from limited image area, the resulting depth maps are still perceptually unsatisfying. Neither local context nor low-level semantic information is sufficient to predict depth. Learning based approaches suffer from inherent defects of supervision signals. This paper addresses monocular depth estimation with a general information exchange convolutional neural network. We maintain a high-resolution prediction throughout the network. Meanwhile, both low-resolution features capturing long-range context and fine-grained features describing local context can be refined with information exchange path stage by stage. Mutual channel attention mechanism is applied to emphasize interdependent feature maps and improve the feature representation of specific semantics. The network is trained under the supervision of improved log-cosh and gradient constraints so that the abnormal predictions have less impacts and the estimation can be consistent in high order. The results of ablation studies verify the efficiency of every proposed components.

Here, to estimate the potential in terms of saved lives and reduced degree of injuries in accidents for new, not yet existing systems, a framework has been developed by combining available historic data, in the form of crash databases, and statistical methods with comparative calculations of vehicle behavior using numerical optimization rather than simulation. The framework performs effectively, it gives interesting insights into the relation between more traditional active yaw control and optimal autonomous lane-keeping control, and it clearly demonstrates the potential of saved lives by using autonomous vehicle maneuvers.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in autonomous vehicles. In CACC, vehicles regulate their speed according to a preceding “leader” vehicle in the lane, forming a platoon. In a benign environment, CACC reduces fuel consumption, maximizes road capacity, and ensures traffic safety. However, CACC is vulnerable to various security threats. In this paper, we consider one of the critical threats, where the platoon leader is compromised, and forges acceleration information sent to platoon members. Such attack would lead to traffic instability and potential collisions. First, we propose information sharing in CACC model to allow vehicles and fixed infrastructure to sense and share information about platoon leaders, hence improves the reliability and supports the detection of anomalous behavior. Then, we propose a real-time anomaly detection mechanism that combines statistical learning with the physics laws of kinematics. Specifically, we propose Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate with Sliding Chunks (GESD-SC) approach, which is applied at each vehicle in the platoon to detect anomalies in real-time based on the vehicle&#39;s own speeding decisions. Kinematic model is also utilized to detect unexpected deviations using the leader&#39;s information, communicated directly and observed by the leader&#39;s neighboring vehicle(s) and/or supporting infrastructure. Combining kinematic model with GESD-SC has shown to be effective in detecting falsification attacks in CACC. Furthermore, we analyze the time performance, and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing method in detection accuracy and processing time.},

  abstract     = {The goal of sample-data-based origin-destination (O-D) demand estimation is to aggregate the location data into the traffic network. Inevitably, the scaling rate, which expands the estimated O-D demands to the population level, should be generated. In this paper, a two-stage optimization model is explored for determining the sensor location and stochastic scaling rate. In the first stage, a sensor deployment model identifies the optimal sensor location strategy by minimizing the variability of the scaling rate under a budget constraint. In the second stage, a Bayesian-based scaling rate inference model leverages the prior information and the data that were observed at the identified sensor locations to derive the stochastic scaling rate. The Bayesian-based scaling rate inference model is a bilevel program, which seeks the maximum a posteriori (MAP) scaling rate conditioned by the observed link flows in the upper level and optimizes the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) in the lower level. To reflect the interactive relationships between the sensor location and the stochastic scaling rate inference, an integrating model is built. A sequential identifying sensor location algorithm that avoids matrix inversions was proposed to solve the sensor deployment model, and an iterative solution algorithm was developed to solve the Bayesian-based scaling rate inference model. The results from numerical experiments demonstrate that the sensor deployment model could provide the most reliable scheme of sensor locations, thereby contributing to the reliable estimation of the stochastic scaling rate. The results also demonstrate that both the endogenous information (prior information on the scaling rate) and exogenous factors (link flows) can facilitate a more accurate scaling rate inference.},

However, the simulated lateral trajectories are physically unplausible and inside-lane behavior such as lane-keeping and curve negotiation cannot be modelled. In this work, we integrate lateral vehicle dynamics and yaw motion into a traffic simulation framework, aiming to describe lateral motion and vehicle interactions with more precision. The resulting framework consists of two coupled layers, an upper tactical level that plans maneuvers such as lane-changing; and a lower operational layer with a control module (steering and acceleration control) that operates in a closed loop with the bicycle model of vehicle dynamics. The feedback mechanism between the layers allows for dynamic trajectory re-planning. Unlike the microscopic traffic models, the proposed framework accounts for lateral vehicle dynamics and yaw motion; provides additional variables such as vehicle heading and front wheel steering angle; and is hence termed as submicroscopic. Case study results demonstrate the power of the framework to include lateral maneuvers such as curve negotiation, corrective steering, lane change abortion and fragmented lane changing. The framework was operationalized to model multi-lane traffic flow consisting of human-driven vehicles. At the macroscopic level, the traffic flow simulation can reproduce phenomena such as capacity drop. Thus the framework preserves the properties of the component models and at the same time describe the continuous 2-D planar movement of vehicles.},

Modern cars with advanced infotainment systems often take some cognitive attention away from the road, consequently causing more distraction. Driver behavior analysis can be used to address the driver distraction problem. Three important features of intelligence and cognition are perception, attention and sensory memory. In this work, we use a stacked LSTM network with attention to detect driver distraction using driving data and compare this model with both stacked LSTM and MLP models to show the positive effect of using attention mechanism on the model&#39;s performance. We conducted an experiment with eight driving scenarios and collected a large dataset of driving data. First, an MLP was built to detect driver distraction. Next, we increased the intelligence level of the system by using an LSTM network. Third, we used the attention mechanism increment on the top of the LSTM model to enhance the model performance. We show that these three increments increase intelligence by reducing train and test error. The minimum train and test error of the stacked LSTM were 0.57 and 0.9 that were 0.4 less than the MLP minimum train and test error. Adding attention to the stacked LSTM model decreased the train and test error to 0.69 and 0.75. Results also show diminished the overfitting problem and reduction in computational expenses when adding attention.},

In this paper, novel VBBT using a low-end three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner is proposed. Compared to previous methods, the proposed VBBT has three distinctions: (1) the center of a rectangular vehicle is defined as its position, and the motion model that uses the center of the vehicle as the state is developed; (2) a new measurement model is proposed that models the measured size of the target vehicle as a sample from a uniform distribution; and (3) a Bayesian filter for the proposed motion and measurement model is developed and it is named as the Pareto Kalman filter (PKF). Finally, the proposed method is applied to six scenarios, and its validity is demonstrated through experimentation.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of sensing technologies, massive spatiotemporal data have been acquired from the urban space with respect to different domains, such as transportation and environment. Numerous co-occurrence patterns (e.g., traffic speed &lt; 10km/h, weather = foggy , and air quality = unhealthy ) between the transportation data and other types of data can be obtained with given spatiotemporal constraints (e.g., within 3 kilometers and lasting for 2 hours) from these heterogeneous data sources. Such patterns present valuable implications for many urban applications, such as traffic management, pollution diagnosis, and transportation planning. However, extracting and understanding these patterns is beyond manual capability because of the scale, diversity, and heterogeneity of the data. To address this issue, a novel visual analytics system called CorVizor is proposed to identify and interpret these co-occurrence patterns. CorVizor comprises two major components. The first component is a co-occurrence mining framework involving three steps, namely, spatiotemporal indexing, co-occurring instance generation, and pattern mining. The second component is a visualization technique called CorView that implements a level-of-detail mechanism by integrating tailored visualizations to depict the extracted spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns. The case studies and expert interviews are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of CorVizor.},

  abstract     = {The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle&#39;s behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle&#39;s positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Techniques for using multi-way traffic patterns for traffic prediction is gaining importance. One of the possible techniques for representing the multi-way traffic patterns is tensors. Tensor decomposition is used to generate low-rank approximations of the original tensor that is subsequently used for traffic volume prediction. However, the existing tensor-based approaches do not consider certain important mutual relationships among the locations like temporal traffic reciprocity that can improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we introduce TeDCaN, a “Tensor Decomposition method with Characteristic Network” constraints that generate low rank approximations of the original tensor considering the traffic reciprocity at different pair of locations. Investigations using large traffic datasets from 2 different cities reveal that the prediction accuracy of TeDCaN considerably outperforms several state-of-art baselines for cases when complete traffic data is available as well as situations when a certain fraction of the data is missing - a likely scenario in many real datasets. We discover that TeDCaN achieves around 20% reduction in the RMSE scores as compared to the baselines. TeDCaN is applicable in many operations on such a big traffic network where the existing models would either be inapplicable or hard to perform. As one of the major yields, TeDCaN generates a “reduced dimensional network embedding” that captures the similarity of the nodes considering the traffic volume as well as the reciprocity of traffic between the nodes.},

One problem that has received much attention recently is predicting next locations for an object given previous locations. Several location prediction methods based on embedding learning have been proposed to tackle this issue. They usually focus on check-in trajectories and model sequential locations using an average of the embedding vectors. In this paper, we have proposed a Convolutional Embedding Model (CEM) to predict next locations using traffic trajectory data, via modeling the relative ordering of locations with a one-dimensional convolution. CEM is further augmented by considering constraints posed by road networks in the traffic trajectory data, learning a double-prototype representation for each location to eliminate the incorrect location transitions as well as modeling the combination of factors (such as sequential, personal, and temporal) that affect the human mobility patterns, and thus offers a more accurate prediction than just accounting for sequential patterns. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that CEM is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction plays an important role in ITS (Intelligent Transportation System). This task is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal correlations (e.g., the constraints of road network and the law of dynamic change with time). Existing work tried to solve this problem by exploiting a variety of spatiotemporal models. However, we observe that more semantic pair-wise correlations among possibly distant roads are also critical for traffic flow prediction. To jointly model the spatial, temporal, semantic correlations with various global features in the road network, this paper proposes T-MGCN (Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning framework for traffic flow prediction. First, we identify several kinds of semantic correlations, and encode the non-Euclidean spatial correlations and heterogeneous semantic correlations among roads into multiple graphs. These correlations are then modeled by a multi-graph convolutional network. Second, a recurrent neural network is utilized to learn dynamic patterns of traffic flow to capture the temporal correlations. Third, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatiotemporal correlations with global features. We evaluate T-MGCN on two real-world traffic datasets and observe improvement by approximately 3% to 6% as compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular communication (V2X) technologies are expected to become common in the future, providing better efficiency and safety in transportation. This envisioned large-scale deployment, however, critically depends on addressing some issues. In special, to prevent abuse by drivers, messages exchanged among authorized vehicles must be authenticated. This implies the need of a Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI). Unlike traditional PKIs, though, VPKIs are also expected to preserve the privacy of honest drivers, preventing their vehicles from being easily identified or tracked. One promising VPKI solution, which copes with such requirements and is among the main candidates for standardization in the United States, is the Security Credential Management System (SCMS). In this paper, aiming to enhance and address shortcomings identified in SCMS, we provide two main contributions. First, we describe and fix two birthday attacks against SCMS&#39;s certificate revocation process, thus improving the system&#39;s long-term privacy. Second, we propose a method that simplifies SCMS&#39;s architecture, removing the need for Linkage Authorities (LAs); this approach cuts down deployment costs while reducing the system&#39;s attack surface, in particular against some troublesome forms of replay attacks that are hereby unveiled.},

  abstract     = {Driver sleepiness is a contributing factor in many road fatalities. A long-standing goal in driver state research has therefore been to develop a robust sleepiness detection system. It has been suggested that various heart rate variability (HRV) metrics can be used for driver sleepiness classification. However, since heart rate is modulated not only by sleepiness but also by several other time-varying intra-individual factors such as posture, distress, boredom and relaxation, it is relevant to highlight not only the possibilities but also the difficulties involved in HRV-based driver sleepiness classification. This paper investigates the reliability of HRV as a standalone feature for driver sleepiness detection in a realistic setting. Data from three real-road driving studies were used, including 86 drivers in both alert and sleep-deprived conditions. Subjective ratings based on the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) were used as ground truth when training four binary classifiers ( k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, AdaBoost, and random forest). The best performance was achieved with the random forest classifier with an accuracy of 85%. However, the accuracy dropped to 64% for three-class classification and to 44% for subject-independent, leave-one-participant-out classification. The worst results were obtained in the severely sleepy class. The results show that in realistic driving conditions, subject-independent sleepiness classification based on HRV is poor. The conclusion is that more work is needed to control for the many confounding factors that also influence HRV before it can be used as input to a driver sleepiness detection system.},

The proposed model consists of two modules: 1) a multilayer representation learning module using autoencoder as its building block. The autoencoders are trained with a quasi-automated, non-gradient descent based unsupervised learning algorithm; 2) an ensemble classification module under the AdaBoost framework. The proposed model is completely data driven, does not require additional feature extraction and feature selection process, and can perform in an end-to-end way in which it takes the physiological signal as the input instead of the handcrafted features. Experimental results show that our proposed model can effectively recognize the driving stress with fewer physiological sensors compared with most of state of the art methods.

Generally we can divide pedestrian behavior modeling into two categories, i.e., knowledge-driven and data-driven. The former might bring expert bias, and it sometimes generates unrealistic pedestrian movement due to unnecessary repulsive forces. The latter approach is popular nowadays but most existing neural networks, including fully connected long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, use a 1D vector to model their input and state. The shortcoming is that these works cannot learn spatial information about pedestrians, especially in a dense crowd. To tackle this, we propose to use tensors to represent essential environment features of pedestrians. Accordingly, a convolutional LSTM is designed and deepened to predict spatiotemporal trajectory sequences. As the tensor and convolution can learn better spatiotemporal interactions among pedestrians and environments, experimental results show that the proposed network can estimate more realistic trajectories for a dense crowd in evacuation and counterflow.},

To address the complexity of this issue, this study presents a novel model-free approach for DATMO using 2D LiDAR implemented on autonomous vehicles. The approach has been used to classify moving points in the point cloud using the predicted Static Obstacle Map (SOM) generated via interaction between Geometric Model-Free Approach (GMFA) and SOM, and estimates the state of each moving object via GMFA. The motion of each point represented by the state of moving objects updates the SOM. The interaction between GMFA and SOM estimates the correspondence between consecutive point clouds in real-time. The proposed approach has been evaluated via RT range and labeled dataset. The accuracy of estimation of the yaw angle and the velocity of a moving vehicle has been quantitatively evaluated using the RT-range. The performance is significantly improved compared with the geometric model-based tracking (MBT). The estimation of the yaw angle, which has a significant effect on the cut-in/cut-out intention of the target vehicle, is shown to be remarkably improved.

  abstract     = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance in semantic image segmentation. However, state-of-the-art DCNN-based semantic segmentation methods usually suffer from high computational complexity due to the use of complex network architectures. This greatly limits their applications in the real-world scenarios that require real-time processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time high-performance DCNN-based method for robust semantic segmentation of urban street scenes, which achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, a Lightweight Baseline Network with Atrous convolution and Attention (LBN-AA) is firstly used as our baseline network to efficiently obtain dense feature maps. Then, the Distinctive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DASPP), which exploits the different sizes of pooling operations to encode the rich and distinctive semantic information, is developed to detect objects at multiple scales. Meanwhile, a Spatial detail-Preserving Network (SPN) with shallow convolutional layers is designed to generate high-resolution feature maps preserving the detailed spatial information. Finally, a simple but practical Feature Fusion Network (FFN) is used to effectively combine both deep and shallow features from the semantic branch (DASPP) and the spatial branch (SPN), respectively. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method respectively achieves the accuracy of 73.6% and 68.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) at the inference speeds of 51.0 fps and 39.3 fps on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid test datasets (by only using a single NVIDIA TITAN X card). This demonstrates that the proposed method offers excellent performance at the real-time speed for semantic segmentation of urban street scenes.},

First, we present a model of volunteer assisted vehicular edge computing, in which the cost and utility functions are defined for requesting vehicles and VEC servers, and volunteer vehicles are encouraged to assist the overloaded VEC servers via obtaining rewards from VEC servers. Then, based on Stackelberg game, we analyze the interactions between requesting vehicles and VEC servers, and find the optimal strategies for them. Furthermore, we prove theoretically that the Stackelberg game between requesting vehicles and VEC servers has a unique Stackelberg equilibrium, and propose a fast searching algorithm based on genetic algorithm to find the best pricing strategy for the VEC server. In addition, to maximize the reward of volunteer vehicles, we propose the volunteer task assignment algorithm for optimal mapping between the tasks and volunteer alliances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through a large number of simulations.

By conducting extensive experiments using the KITTI benchmark, which is a commonly used street dataset, we demonstrate that Faster R-CNN ResNet50 obtains the best average precision (AP) (58%) for vehicle and pedestrian detection, with a speed of 8.6 FPS. Faster R-CNN Inception_V2 performs best for detecting cars and detecting pedestrians respectively (74.5% and 47.3%). ResNet101 consumes the highest memory (9907 MB) and has the largest number of parameters (64.42 millions), and Inception_ResNet_V2 is the slowest model (3.05 FPS). SSD MobileNet_V2 is the fastest model (70 FPS), and SSD MobileNet_V1 is the lightest model in terms of memory usage (875 MB), both of which are suitable for applications on mobile and embedded devices.},

Influenced by the short-term noise disturbance in traffic flow information, the WT is employed to improve prediction accuracy by decomposing the time series of traffic flow. The MTN model, which exploits polynomials to approximate the unknown nonlinear function, makes full use of periodicity and temporal feature without transcendental knowledge and mechanism of the system to be predicted. Our proposed W-MTN model is evaluated on the traffic flow information in a certain area of Shenzhen, China. The experimental results indicate that the proposed W-MTN model offers better prediction performance and temporal correlation, as compared with the corresponding models in the known literature. In addition, the proposed model shows good robustness and generalization ability, when considering data from the different days and locations.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has become an increasingly popular tool for traffic monitoring and data collection on highways due to its advantage of low cost, high resolution, good flexibility, and wide spatial coverage. Extracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from aerial videos taken by a UAV flying over target highway segment becomes a critical research task for traffic flow modeling and analysis. This study aims at proposing a novel methodological framework for automatic and accurate vehicle trajectory extraction from aerial videos. The method starts by developing an ensemble detector to detect vehicles in the target region. Then, the kernelized correlation filter is applied to track vehicles fast and accurately. After that, a mapping algorithm is proposed to transform vehicle positions from the Cartesian coordinates in image to the Frenet coordinates to extract raw vehicle trajectories along the roadway curves. The data denoising is then performed using a wavelet transform to eliminate the biased vehicle trajectory positions. Our method is tested on two aerial videos taken on different urban expressway segments in both peak and non-peak hours on weekdays. The extracted vehicle trajectories are compared with manual calibrated data to testify the framework performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully extracts vehicle trajectories with a high accuracy: the measurement error of Mean Squared Deviation is 2.301 m, the Root-mean-square deviation is 0.175 m, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.999. The video and trajectory data in this study are publicly accessible for serving as benchmark at https://seutraffic.com.},

We address the problem of forecasting flight delays of an airport, utilizing the network information as well as the delay patterns of similar airports in the network. The proposed “Clustered Airport Modeling” (CAM) approach builds a representative time-series for each group of airports and fits a common model (e.g., REG-ARIMA) for each, using the network based features as regressors. The models are then applied individually to each airport data for predicting the airport&#39;s flight delays. We also performed a network based analysis of the airports and identified the Betweenness Centrality (BC) score as an effective feature in forecasting the flight delays. The experiments on flight data over seven years using 305 US airports show that CAM provides accurate forecasts of flight delays.},

In these situations, autonomous steering may not be able to respond fast enough to prevent collision or instability.

The proposed controller employs differential braking conservatively when needed, to produce an additional yaw moment, thereby improving a vehicle&#39;s lateral agility and responsiveness without endangering vehicle stability. A longitudinal controller is also designed to track a desired longitudinal velocity. Model predictive control (MPC) method is used for developing a combined path planning and tracking controller with a hierarchical structure that prioritizes (1) collision avoidance, (2) vehicle stability, and (3) path tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated MPC controller is evaluated by simulating an experimentally validated CarSim model to demonstrate the controller&#39;s capability in preventing instability and collisions.},

The non-minimum phase problem in active tilting control is handled by utilizing the predictive feature of the controller. It is shown via the simulation in CarSim that, by adopting the envelope-based control scheme, the control effort to maintain the roll stability of narrow vehicles can be greatly reduced.

The proposed control scheme provides a universal solution for steering control in multiple driving scenarios by accordingly allocating the safety zone to ensure the driving safety therein. A simulator experiment was conducted to test both the fully autonomous and the driver-in-the-loop performance of the proposed control scheme in lane keeping and lane changing. A traditional error-minimizing control algorithm was implemented as a comparison.

The innovations of this scheme include (1) a multilayer pyramid network, with pixel difference matrices (PDMs) as its input and output and feature parameters mapping one PDM to another; (2) an objective function and a corresponding optimization method designed to facilitate the learning of the feature parameters of the proposed multilayer pyramid network; and (3) a multi-codebook-based encoding method that makes best use of the features extracted from PDMs corresponding to different resolutions.

Experiments conducted with a benchmark dataset, XMU, demonstrate that MLPNL outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLR methods.

At the same time, these data also present many challenges, such as missing data and deviations in data collection. Many researchers have reported that inaccurate or incomplete measurements of traffic variables can be corrected based on either traditional traffic flow theory, which ignores the randomness of traffic, or are performed using machine learning methods, which emphasize data quantity, but do not make effective use of domain knowledge. This paper proposes a Traffic Factor State Network framework defined by traffic factors and their links to represent the relationships between traffic factors; this framework includes not only obvious traffic factors like volume and speed, but also hidden traffic factors such as the environmental impact factor, which is a variable used to represent complex road conditions. This variable is used to describe the influence of non-traffic flow parameters such as road condition and environmental factors, and is estimated by the EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm based on historical data. This study used a high-order multivariate Markov model to implement the TFSN, which was then used to establish a stochastic model of speed and related factors. A large amount of historical data was used to calculate and calibrate the strength of the links between the model factors. Finally, a stochastic model of speed prediction was established. The verification results compared with actual cases demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed model.},

New deep neural networks have been developed to model traffic flow, but it is very challenging to predict citywide traffic flow at the road level in fine temporal scale owing to the influence of spatiotemporal dependencies and spatial sparsity. In this study, based on an in-depth analysis of traffic flow patterns, we propose a deep learning based spatiotemporal neural network model to predict citywide traffic flow for each road segment with high accuracy. Firstly, we examine the transformation of road network into its compact 2D image, where road segments correspond to pixels and their topological relationships are maintained in a large extent. Then, an end-to-end deep learning structure is designed to model traffic flow patterns. Specifically, recurrent convolutional network is employed to learn temporal dependencies and densely connected convolutional network is adopted to learn spatial dependencies and handle spatial sparsity. Our model attempts to aggregate the outputs of those hybrid networks using different weights, which is further enhanced by external information such as day of week. Experiments were conducted in Wuhan, China, where taxicab trajectory data were used to train and validate our model. When compared to current state of the art models, our model achieves higher accuracy in both single and multi-step traffic flow prediction tasks.},

Additionally, some existing fatigue detection methods focused on dealing with fatigue features with a temporal slice, ignoring temporal variations in the features. To address these problems, a single RGB-D camera is first used to extract three fatigue features: heart rate, eye openness level, and mouth openness level. More importantly, this paper proposes a novel multimodal fusion recurrent neural network (MFRNN), integrating the three features to improve the accuracy of driver fatigue detection. Specifically, a recurrent neural network (RNN) layer is applied in the MFRNN to obtain the temporal information of the features. Since the heart rate feature is a physiological signal extracted indirectly, it contains more noise and is fuzzier than the other features. To deal with the fuzziness and noise, we combine fuzzy reasoning with RNN to extract the temporal information of the heart rate. To identify the relationship between the features, we develop a new relationship layer containing a two-level RNN, for which the input is the temporal information of the features. Both the simulation and field experiment results show that the proposed method provides better performance than similar methods.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the path-tracking control issue of autonomous vehicles (AVs) when the GPS measurement is temporarily unavailable. In such a case, the vehicle states, location or the curvature of the reference path might be unobtainable, while the camera can be potentially used to detect the path-tracking states. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy-observer-based composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) controller with a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) vehicle lateral dynamic model to guarantee the normal path-tracking maneuver and improve the transient performance. A parallel distributed compensation (PDC)-based CNF control method is developed to realize the control objective with the T-S vehicle model considering the transient performance and actuator saturation.

  abstract     = {In many applications, uncertainty regarding the duration of activities complicates the generation of accurate plans and schedules. Such is the case for the problem considered in this paper - predicting the arrival times of buses at signalized intersections. Direct vehicle-to-infrastructure communication of location, speed and heading information offers unprecedented opportunities for real-time optimization of traffic signal timing plans, but to be useful bus arrival time prediction must reliably account for bus dwell time at near-side bus stops. To address this problem, we propose a novel, Bayesian hierarchical approach for constructing bus dwell time duration distributions from historical data. Unlike traditional statistical learning techniques, the proposed approach relies on minimal data, is inherently adaptive to time varying task duration distribution, and provides a rich description of confidence for decision making, all of which are important in the bus dwell time prediction context. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using historical data provided by a local transit authority on bus dwell times at urban bus stops. Our results show that the dwell time distributions generated by our approach yield significantly more accurate predictions than those generated by both standard regression techniques and a more data intensive deep learning approach.},

In this research, we propose a choice modeling approach embedded in a two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the optimal layout and types of EV supply equipment for a community while considering randomness in demand and drivers&#39; behaviors. Some of the key random data parameters considered in this study are: EV&#39;s dwell time at parking location, battery&#39;s state of charge, distance from home, willingness to walk, drivers&#39; arrival patterns, and traffic on weekdays and weekends. The two-stage model uses the sample average approximation method, which asymptotically converges to an optimal solution. To address the computational challenges for large-scale instances, we propose an outer approximation decomposition algorithm. We conduct extensive computational experiments to quantify the efficacy of the proposed approach. In addition, we present the results and a sensitivity analysis for a case study based on publicly available data sources.},

In this paper, pedestrian path prediction at a time horizon of 2s for autonomous driving is systematically investigated using waiting/crossing decision model (W/CDM) and modified social force model (MSFM), and the possible conflict between pedestrians and straight-going vehicles at an un-signalized crosswalk is focused on. First of all, a W/CDM is efficiently developed to judge pedestrians&#39; waiting/crossing intentions when a straight-going vehicle is approaching. Then the humanoid micro-dynamic MSFM of pedestrians who have been judged to cross is characterized by taking into account the evasion with conflicting pedestrians, the collision avoidance with straight-going vehicles, and the reaction to crosswalk boundary. The influence of pedestrian heterogeneous characteristics is considered for the first time. Moreover, aerial video data of pedestrians and vehicles at an un-signalized crosswalk is collected and analyzed for model calibration. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is proposed to calibrate the non-measurable parameters of the proposed models. Finally, the model validation is conducted with two cases by comparing with the existing methods. The result reveals that the integrated method (W/CDM-MSFM) outperforms the existing methods and accurately predicts the path of pedestrians, which can give us great confidence to use the current method to predict the path of pedestrian for autonomous driving with significant accuracy and highly improve pedestrian safety.},

The most distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that the natural handling characteristics of the production vehicle is exploited to reduce the complexity of the conventional control methods. For safety&#39;s sake, most production vehicles are built to exhibit an understeer handling characteristics to some extent. By monitoring how much the vehicle is biased into the understeer state, the controller attempts to adjust this amount in a way that improves the vehicle cornering performance. With this particular strategy, an innovative controller can be designed without road friction information, which complicates the conventional control methods. In addition, unlike the conventional controllers, the reference yaw rate that is highly dependent on road friction need not be defined due to the proposed control structure. The optimal control problem is formulated in a model predictive control framework to handle the constraints efficiently, and simulations in various test scenarios illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Motion-based simulators are used for a variety of applications, such as research, education, entertainment and training. In fact, motion cues are required to achieve the highest regulatory certifications in training vehicle simulators. Nonetheless, the reproduction of self-motion cues presents technological and economic limitations that are not present in the generation of audiovisual cues. For this reason, the generated motion does not generally match the expected one. Therefore, it is necessary to define means to assess the suitability/fidelity of the generated motion cues. After more than 50 years of motion-based vehicle simulation, no mechanism has been universally accepted as the standard solution for the evaluation of motion cues. This paper reviews the mechanisms for obtaining measures of motion fidelity, focusing on those based on objective methods. Since the design of the Objective Motion Cueing Test in 2006, researchers have shown a renewed interest in identifying objective methods to evaluate motion cueing, as the number of works following this approach in recent years reveals. Objective motion fidelity systems allow also performing automatic tuning of MCA by means of optimization techniques, which addresses one of the other main problems of these algorithms. Nevertheless, a universally accepted objective method to assess perceptual motion fidelity in vehicle simulators has not been proposed yet. For this reason, this review work frames and classifies the existing methods. In addition, the authors propose a series of features that an ideal evaluation method for assessing perceptual motion fidelity should include and provide future research guidelines for this complex topic.},

This paper compares the performance between fast heuristics and exact optimization models. We investigate a core trajectory optimization problem as a building block for numerous trajectory optimization problems, i.e., guiding movements of connected automated vehicles on a one-lane highway when the arrival and departure times and velocity are given. To apply the SH algorithm to this problem, we adapt it to a fast-simplified shooting heuristic (FSSH) model to solve the trajectory smoothing problems with different arrival and departure velocities. An exact trajectory optimization (ETO) model is formulated that takes the vehicle position and velocity as the decision variables, and the fuel consumption and driving comfort as the objective function. The constraints of the model are based on the limits and safety of the vehicle dynamics between consecutive vehicles. We demonstrate the convexity of the ETO objective function, ensuring the solvability of the ETO model at the true optimum using gradient descent algorithms supplied by the MATLAB optimization toolbox. Six groups of numerical experiments using different input parameters and one experiment using real Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data are conducted. ETO can improve the objective values by a few to tens of percentage points. However, FSSH achieves a greater solution efficiency with an average solution time of less than 0.1 s compared to ~450 s for ETO.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of urbanization, the problem of urban traffic congestion has become increasingly prominent. Dynamic route guidance promises to improve the capacity of urban traffic management and mitigate traffic congestion in big cities. In the design of simulation-based experiments for most dynamic route guidance methods, the simulation data is generally estimated from a specific traffic scenario in the real-world. However, highly dynamic traffic in the city implies that traffic scenarios in real systems are diverse. Therefore, if a route guidance method cannot adjust its strategy according to the spatial and temporal characteristics of different traffic scenarios, then it cannot guarantee optimal results under all traffic scenarios. Thus, ideal dynamic route guidance methods should have a highly adaptive learning ability under diverse traffic scenarios so as to have extensive improvement capabilities for different traffic scenarios. In this study, an A* trajectory rejection method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (A*R 2 ) is proposed; the method integrates both system and user perspectives to mitigate traffic congestion and reduce travel time (TT) and travel distance (TD). First, owing to its adaptive learning ability, the A*R 2 can comprehensively analyze the traffic conditions for different traffic scenarios and intelligently evaluate the road congestion index from a system perspective. Then, the A*R 2 determines the routes for all vehicles from user perspective according to the road network congestion index. An extensive set of simulation experiments reveal that, under various traffic scenarios, the A*R 2 can rely on its adaptive learning ability to achieve better traffic efficiency. Moreover, even in cases where many drivers are not fully compliant with the route guidance, the traffic efficiency can still be improved significantly by A*R 2 .},

The proposed system utilizes signal phasing and timing (SPaT) data that are communicated to connected vehicles (CVs) together with real-time vehicle dynamics to compute fuel-optimum trajectories. The proposed algorithm is incorporated in the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation software to conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of various variables, including: system market penetration rates (MPRs), demand levels, phase splits, offsets and traffic signal spacings on the system performance. The analysis shows that at 100% MPR, fuel consumption can be reduced by as high as 13.8%. Moreover, higher MPRs and shorter phase lengths result in larger fuel savings. Optimum demand levels and traffic signal spacings exist that maximize the effectiveness of the algorithm. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the algorithm works less effective when the traffic signal offset is closer to its optimal value. Finally, the study highlights the need for further work to enhance the algorithm to deal with over-saturated traffic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic congestion is a chronic problem faced by many cities in the US and worldwide. It results in inefficient infrastructure use as well as increased vehicle fuel consumption and emission levels. Congestion is intertwined with delay, as road users waste precious hours on the road, which in turn reduces productivity. Researchers have developed, and continue to develop, tools and systems to alleviate this problem. Network perimeter control is one such tool that has been studied extensively. It attempts to control the flow of vehicles entering a protected area to ensure that the congested regime predetermined by the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) is not reached. In this paper, an approach derived from sliding mode control theory is presented. Its main advantages over proportional-integral controllers include (1) minimal tuning, (2) no linearization of the governing equations, (3) no assumptions with regard to the shape of the NFD, and (4) ability to handle various demand profiles without the need to retune the controller. A sliding mode controller was implemented and tested on a congested grid network. The results show that the proposed controller produces network-wide delay savings and disperses congestion effectively.},

  abstract     = {The safety and comfort of drivers have been improved over the decades as a result of our broadened understanding of driver modeling and behavior prediction. Despite these remarkable advances in autonomous and interactive systems, there is a significant lack of approaches that consider the passengers and the vehicle as components of a dynamical vibro-acoustical system. Sound in vehicles is not only informative of the state of the vehicle and the environment, but can also critically affect the driver&#39;s performance, attention, and comfort. This paper aims to investigate the interplay between the perceived sounds of a vehicle and psychoacoustic annoyance (PA) metrics. Our goal is to create an intelligent agent that would act to improve driving pleasantness through acoustic-driven learning. To tackle the problem of choosing the correct actions to reduce the acoustic annoyance, the paper presents a method based on reinforcement learning that learns from the environment, i.e., the vehicle interior. The method actively changes the state inside the vehicle (e.g., closing or opening the window and choosing the cruise speed) in order to minimize acoustic annoyance experienced by the driver. The results of this work, performed using the GTA V simulator, showed that the trained agent successfully learned to take the correct actions to reduce PA metrics. The paper also present to the community a new multi-modal dataset composed of several rides on a real vehicle and an in-depth analysis of the influence of vehicle&#39;s signal on the acoustic annoyance.},

  abstract     = {Recently there have been several proposals for `eco-driving assistance systems&#39;, designed to save fuel or electrical power by encouraging behaviours such as gentle acceleration and coasting to a stop. These systems use optimal control to find driving behaviour that minimises vehicle energy losses. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to account for driver preferences on acceleration, braking, following distances and cornering speed in such eco-driving optimal control problems. This consists of an optimal control model of acceleration and braking behaviour containing several physically-meaningful parameters to describe driver preferences. If used in combination with a model of fuel or energy consumption, this can provide an adjustable trade-off between satisfying those preferences and minimising energy losses. We demonstrate that the model gives comparable performance to existing car-following and cornering models when predicting drivers&#39; speed in these situations by comparison with real-world driving data. Finally, we present an example highway braking scenario for an electric vehicle, illustrating a trade-off between satisfying driver preferences on vehicle speed and acceleration and reducing electrical energy usage by up to 43%.},

The importance of improving driver comfort with adjusting system variables has been revealed through these studies. The present study aims to propose assistance methods for merging, which decreases driver&#39;s workload and difficulty in decision-making. The proposed methods recognize drivers&#39; decision ambiguity using a decision-making model for respective drivers and instruct them on acceleration to decrease the ambiguity. First, we develop a decision-making model to predict where drivers merge based on a logistic function. Furthermore, we propose acoustic assistance methods, which instruct the acceleration and deceleration. The systems continuously calculate the optimal instruction based on driving history from the beginning of the assistance. Driving simulator experiments demonstrated that drivers&#39; workload and decision ambiguity decreased with our proposed methods.},

However, current data tend to be sparse in time and space due to technical constraints or privacy concerns, which fail to provide a complete picture of traffic flow. This study proposes a particle filter (PF) based approach to reconstruct the vehicle trajectory for signalized arterial using sparse probe data. First, the arterial intersection is divided into multiple road cells and the estimation of cell travel time is formulated as a quadratic programming problem. Then, PF is applied to reconstruct the incomplete vehicle trajectory between consecutive updates. Specifically, to calculate and update the weight of initial particles, three measurability criteria are designed for importance sampling considering the structure of signalized arterial and the feature of vehicular updates, i.e., travel time adjustment accuracy, arterial link speed limit and travel time adjustment possibility. Last, NGSIM trajectory data are extracted at intervals to construct the sparse data, which are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that reconstructed trajectories match closely with ground truth both at the single intersection and along the arterial with multiple intersections.},

  abstract     = {Without steering wheel and driver&#39;s seat, the self-driving cars will have new interior outlook and spaces that can be used for enhanced infotainment services. For traveling people, self-driving cars will be new places for engaging in infotainment services. Therefore, self-driving cars should determine themselves the infotainment contents that are likely to entertain their passengers. However, the choice of infotainment contents depends on passengers&#39; features such as age, emotion, and gender. Also, retrieving infotainment contents at data center can hinder infotainment services due to high end-to-end delay. To address these challenges, we propose infotainment caching in self-driving cars, where caching decisions are based on passengers&#39; features obtained using deep learning. First, we proposed deep learning models to predict the contents need to be cached in self-driving cars and close proximity of self-driving cars in multi-access edge computing servers attached to roadside units. Second, we proposed a communication model for retrieving infotainment contents to cache. Third, we proposed a caching model for retrieved contents. Fourth, we proposed a computation model for the cached contents, where cached contents can be served in different formats/qualities based on demands. Finally, we proposed an optimization problem whose goal is to link the proposed models into one optimization problem that minimizes the content downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a block successive majorization-minimization technique is applied. The simulation results show that the accuracy of prediction for the contents that need to be cached is 97.82% and our approach can minimize the delay.},

One-way trips, as well as battery range issues, directly influence the quality and dynamics of such systems. Due to the demand and supply imbalance at stations, the ECs operators are faced with crucial operational challenges to reduce the relocation costs and increase the number of users. An agent-based relocation strategy based on real-time inventory control within the framework of generalized stochastic Petri Nets (PN) and a discrete event simulation has been proposed in this paper. Furthermore, an associated system performance evaluation was also developed. This model further assesses the effects of system characteristics such as the battery charging level availability threshold on the behavior and dynamics of the system. Moreover, the developed model and simulation show the potential of using PN models to predict critical situations, analyze relocation strategy efficiency, and improve system performance. Results from the simulation indicate that the overall relocation trips are reduced by estimating the time to launch the relocation process, as well as the conflicts between agents (controlling the assignment of agents among stations) during the balancing process are efficiently resolved. The proposed model and simulation algorithm have been applied to the BlueSG network in downtown Singapore.},

Despite the proliferation of studies to understand how users resume control in such critical situations, a systematic analysis of the whole response process is necessary. We analyzed the visual-motor response process of distracted users to front and lateral vehicle conflicts. We also investigated the effect of false warnings and expectations. In a driving simulator experiment (high fidelity, fixed-based, within-subject design), 45 participants performed a visual-manual distracting task until an audio warning was issued. The response process was modeled with Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models. The models incorporate the carryover effect (up to the 2nd order), typical side effect of within-subjects experiments. Reaction times were modeled with a shifted-Wald distribution; response choices with a softmax regression. The warning was effective at capturing visual attention and prompting the resumption of control, but it did not directly initiate an intervention. Glance location and the choice and timing of evasive maneuver depended on driving context and on previous experience. Analysis of the whole response process yields more relevant information on the effect of warnings for transition of control than a single measure of intervention time. Furthermore, the carryover effect should not be discounted, because trial randomization can only partially alleviate the problem. We provided results in a format that can be used as a reference for future studies and for computational models of driver behavior.},

  abstract     = {It has been well recognized that weather variations significantly impact cycling experiences of users. However, the weather-cycling dynamic relationship over time is not well studied in the literature. In this paper, in order to bridge this gap, we propose a Dynamic Model Averaging and Dynamic Model Selection (DMA and DMS) to reveal the characteristics of time-varying responses and the associated influencing factors for young people&#39;s shared bike trips. Without loss of generality, dynamic models with unknown observational variances are also proposed. We take New York City as an instance and analyze the drifts of patterns of New York CitiBike trips under six weather factors from various aspects. The results suggest that the bike trips&#39; responses to some weather factors fluctuate dynamically while others maintain at a relatively stable level. It is concluded that a few main influencing factors are adequate to represent the travel patterns. It is observed that dynamic models, with the strength of alleviating multicollinearity, present better forecast performance than classic models. This work can facilitate the decision makers and managers to oversee and optimise travel experience of users in real time.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach for automatic vehicle model recognition and simultaneous estimation of lateral transit position, based on magnetic sensor technology. A set of magnetic sensors is deployed on the road surface and, upon transit of a target vehicle on the equipment, the system records six magnetic signatures relative to different vehicle sections. The recorded signatures are then compared with the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to previously recorded ones, which are relative to known vehicles that have transited at known lateral position; the system then assesses whether the target vehicle&#39;s model matches one of the models already in the database, and estimates its lateral transit position. With the considered experimental set-up, the system is able to discriminate between many different vehicle models and six lateral positions, with a resolution of about 20 cm: the performance of the system is presented by comparing a set of different classifiers. In terms of vehicle model recognition, 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier obtains 0% of misclassification rate, while for lateral position estimation, if an error of one position is tolerated (precision of ± 20 cm), the system is shown to reach 2.4% of misclassification rate.},

  abstract     = {Advanced driver assistance systems should not only make the driving experience safer and more comfortable, it should also have a positive effect on driving behaviors. In this paper, an instructor-like assistance system for collision avoidance is developed and realized on an actual vehicle. The proposed system is activated only if the driver is not operating the vehicle properly when facing a collision risk. The vehicle control is shared by the driver and the assistance system. It is controlled by servomotors. In order to fulfill this requirement, a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is proposed and solved based on safe driving constraints and predictive vehicle states. Vehicle motion is predicted by a combination of a dynamics model and a potential field model that reflects the driver&#39;s risk feeling to an obstacle. Improved driving behavior is verified and evaluated quantitatively based on driving simulator data. By comparing the driving data before and after using the assistance system, it is found that distance is increased and speed is reduced when passing an obstacle. As a result, driving behavior becomes safer for collision avoidance due to the system&#39;s instruction. Furthermore, an experiment with an actual vehicle also demonstrates the practicability of the control system and shows the influence of different safe driving constraints.},

Often, on dense traffic metro lines, human experience-based traffic control strategies do not efficiently stabilize the train dynamics or respond to the passenger travel demand. Our work is based on a mathematical model of the train dynamics permitting closed-form solutions of the traffic phases on the metro line. We first give a complete description of the derived traffic phases of the train dynamics. Second, we focus on the traffic phases where the train frequency is optimal with respect to given parameters, and identify set points which we use for the macroscopic control of the number of running trains. The objective of the control is to derive from the set points of the phase diagram, the optimal number of running trains with regard to possible variations and/or perturbations of the metro line parameters (train run times, train dwell times and the required train frequency). Finally, based on infrastructure parameters, passenger travel demand, and run and dwell times, we simulate a case study on the metro line 13 of Paris (France) demonstrating how the feedback traffic control practically works.},

Initially, normal vectors were extracted for 3D AUs, subsequently, `Quiver/Bump map&#39; were constructed from the normal vectors. The quiver maps were further utilized for training deep neural networks. The findings exhibit that the proposed method outperforms 2D image based classification in terms of validation accuracy, for AU1, AU15 and AU41 detection. A novel method incorporating machine vision for intelligent transportation has been developed and demonstrated for driver&#39;s fatigue detection.

The proposed method introduces a novel variable estimation interval that allows for higher estimation precision, as the updating time interval always contains a fixed number of probe vehicles. The proposed method is evaluated using empirical and simulated data, the former of which were collected along a signalized roadway in downtown Blacksburg, VA. Results indicate that vehicle count estimates produced by the proposed method are accurate. The paper also examines the model&#39;s accuracy when installing a single stationary sensor (e.g., loop detector), producing slight improvements especially when the probe vehicle market penetration rate is low. Finally, the paper investigates the sensitivity of the estimation model to traffic demand levels, showing that the model works better at higher demand levels given that more probe vehicles exist for the same market penetration rate.},

  abstract     = {5G-based millimeter Waves (mmWave) systems have the prospective of enabling &gt; 1Gbps communications in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). ITS relies on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications to share information among vehicles. However, the V2X Communications via existing technologies such as DSRC, 3G, 4G and LTE, are not able to achieve such a high data rate. Although 5G-based mmWave can support ultra-low-delay V2X transmissions, it comes with beam alignment difficulties as well as the routing stability issues due to rapid mobility of vehicles. The dynamic vehicle traffic causes frequent beam misalignment which tends to degrade the quality-of-service (QoS) performance. In this paper, we first propose a 3D-based position detection scheme for beam alignment/selection purpose. Then a group-based routing algorithm is performed to select a secure path for achieving trustworthy data transmissions. The road traffic is automatically segmented to divide the vehicles into different groups, and each group head is selected and members are added. Group members are authenticated by the group head via elliptic curve algorithms. Huffman coding is performed to compress the data and encrypt the binary files. This proposed novel intelligent beam control and secure stable routing scheme have been verified in simulations to demonstrate much better performance than existing schemes.},

While the first two parts are known as the traditional objectives of arc-routing problems, the third part is determined by the parking pattern and service period on each arc. We formulate the problem by using a mixed integer linear model. To solve it, we design a dynamic programming to determine the optimal service beginning time on each edge when a routing sequence is given. We then propose a problem-specific intelligent heuristic search approach involving six neighborhood operators, a priority maintenance mechanism and a perturbation process. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to produce satisfactory solutions of ARPTPC. Additional experiments are also carried out to analyze the effects of operators and parameters on solution quality.},

Specifically, bidirectional interaction is handled by designing bidirectional reference dynamics with proven string stability properties, to which the uncertain heterogeneous platoon should homogenize; engine constraints are handled via a proposed a mechanism that makes such reference dynamics `not too demanding&#39;, by properly saturating their action. The saturation action will allow all vehicles in the platoon to not hit their engine limits, preserving cohesiveness.

Moreover, the robustness of the considered controllers is analyzed for this case study concluding that LB-TFC is quite robust, specially when comparing with MTFC + PI-ALINEA. For the second study (a stretch of the ring-road freeway SE-30 in Seville, Spain), data from 10 different days have been used in order to simulate the performance of the considered controllers using real data for the afternoon peak period. In order to properly deal with a bottleneck with a dynamically changing number of lanes, the equations used for MTFC + PI-ALINEA have been slightly modified for the second case study. For both case studies, LB-TFC provides a robust performance that, in most cases, is close to the optimal one and that improves the reduction in the Total Time Spent (TTS) obtained with MTFC + PI-ALINEA.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Logic-Based Traffic Flow Control algorithm (LB-TFC) for integrated control of Ramp Metering (RM) installations and Variable Speed Limits (VSLs) in order to reduce traffic jams created at bottlenecks. LB-TFC estimates, for each control time step, the number of vehicles that should be held back or released by the control measures (i.e. the VSLs and the RM rates) in order to avoid the capacity drop (maximizing the outflow of the bottleneck). Afterwards, based on the resulting estimated number of vehicles, the VSLs and/or the RM rates are increased or decreased in a pre-specified order. In order to avoid or reduce traffic breakdowns, the proposed controller (LB-TFC) anticipates the future evolution of the bottleneck density by using a feed-forward structure. As a result, the performance of the controller is very efficient and similar to the one obtained with an optimal controller while the implementation of the controller (with an almost instantaneous computation time) and the tuning of the parameters are easy. In the second part of this work, published in a separate paper (`Part 2: Simulation and Comparison&#39;), LB-TFC is simulated, analyzed and compared for two freeways (one synthetic network and one stretch of the ring-road freeway SE-30 in Seville, Spain).},

  abstract     = {Bus bunching is an instability problem where buses operating on high-frequency public transport lines arrive at stops in bunches. This work unveils that bus-following models can be used to design bus-to-bus cooperative control strategies and mitigate bunching. The use of bus-following models avoids the explicit modelling of bus-stops, which would render the resulting problem discrete, with events occurring at arbitrary time intervals. In a follow-the-leader two-bus system, bus-to-bus communication allows the driver of the following bus to observe (from a remote distance) the position and speed of the leading bus operating in the same transport line. The information transmitted from the leader is then used to control the speed of the follower to eliminate bunching. A platoon of buses operating in the same transit line can be then controlled as leader-follower dyads. In this context, we propose practical control laws to regulate speeds, which would lead to bunching cure. A combined state estimation and remote control scheme is developed to capture the effect of disturbances and randomness in passenger arrivals. To investigate the performance of the developed schemes the 9-km 1-California line in San Francisco with about 50 arbitrary spaced bus stops is used. Simulations with empirical passenger data are carried out. Results show bunching avoidance and improvements in terms of schedule reliability of bus services and delays. The proposed control is robust, scalable in terms of transit network size, and thus easy to deploy by transit agencies to improve communication and guidance to drivers, and reduce costs.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is an important problem for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems, which has been studied for more than two decades. In recent years, deep learning methods are emerging to serve as the benchmark tool for traffic flow forecasting due to its superior prediction performance. However, most studies are based on simple deep learning methods that can not capture inter- and intra-day traffic patterns as well as the correlation between contextual factors like the weather and the traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based method for daily traffic flow forecasting where incorporating contextual factors and traffic flow patterns can be critical. First, a particular convolutional neural network (CNN) is deployed to extract inter- and intra- day traffic flow patterns. Then extracted features are fed into long short-term memory (LSTM) units to learn the intra-day temporal evolution of traffic flow. Finally, contextual information of historical days is integrated to enhance the prediction performance. Through a real-data case study, we show that the proposed approach achieves over 90% prediction accuracy which greatly outperforms existing benchmark methods and its forecasting performance is robust under various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Automated vehicles are envisioned to be an integral part of the next generation of transportation systems. Whether it is striving for full autonomy or incorporating more advanced driver assistance systems, high-accuracy vehicle localization is essential for automated vehicles to navigate the transportation network safely. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to increase GPS localization accuracy. The framework does not make rigid assumptions on the GPS device hardware parameters or motion models, nor does it require infrastructure-based reference locations. The proposed reinforcement learning model learns an optimal strategy to make “corrections” on raw GPS observations. The model uses an efficient confidence-based reward mechanism, which is independent of geolocation, thereby enabling the model to be generalized. We incorporate a map matching-based regularization term to reduce the variance of the reward return. The reinforcement learning model is constructed using the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm. A3C provides a parallel training protocol to train the proposed model. The asynchronous reinforcement learning strategy facilitates short training sessions and provides more robust performance. The performance of the proposed model is assessed by comparing it with an extended Kalman filter algorithm as a benchmark model. Our experiments indicate that the proposed reinforcement learning model converges fast, has less prediction variance, and can localize vehicles with 50% less error compared to the benchmark Extended Kalman Filter model.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has become an appealing paradigm to provide services for vehicles and traffic systems. However, high mobility is one of the great challenges to the communication and computation service qualities in VFC. A network model for directional vehicle mobility is proposed in this paper to guarantee the service qualities of vehicles in VFC. In the model, vehicles are configured into three vehicular subnetworks according to their turning directions at the next crossing. For each subnetwork, vehicles communicate with each other via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and with roadside units via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The aim is to minimize the average response time of the tasks originated from vehicles. By carefully choosing neighboring vehicles as task processing helpers, a greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the mentioned optimization problem. Besides, two bipartite matching based algorithms, named BMA 1 and BMA 2 , are proposed by exploiting Kuhn-Munkras approach and minimum-cost maximum-flow approach, respectively. Performance of the proposed model and the offloading algorithms are evaluated on the combined simulation platform by open street map, SUMO and NS-3. Simulation results show that, the proposed model outperforms four existing models in terms of average response time, when the five models have similar number of unsuccessful tasks. Moreover, the proposed BMA 1 and BMA 2 are superior to the existing greedy algorithm in terms of the average response time of tasks, and the proposed greedy algorithm significantly accelerates the generation of offloading decisions in comparison to BMA 1 , BMA 2 and the existing greedy algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Lower levels of automation are designed to work in specific conditions referred to as the Operational Design Domain (ODD). Beyond these conditions, the human driver is expected to take control. A mismatch between a driver&#39;s understanding and expectations of the automated vehicle capabilities and its actual capabilities as prescribed in the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) manual, could affect their safety and trust in automation. The main aim of this study is to develop a method for assessing the ODD of lane keeping system equipped vehicles. The analysis method is composed of an objective driving risk measure based on the Probabilistic Driving Risk Field (PDRF), and a subjective risk measure based on driver behavior, trust and situation awareness. We demonstrate the method applicability using the Automated Lane Keeping system of the Tesla Model S. A field test was conducted with 19 participants on public roads in the Netherlands including situations within and outside the defined ODD by the OEM. Across all test situations, a mismatch was observed between the ODD specified by the OEM and by the driver. Situations outside the ODD (i.e. no-lane markings and on/off-ramp) were often regarded as within the ODD by the participants. Situations inside the ODD (i.e. tunnel and curve) were mostly correctly classified by the participants. This analysis method has the potential to aid OEMs and road operators in defining more clearly the ODD while taking into account the driver&#39;s safety and awareness of the system capabilities.},

This review aims to summarize and analyze those related challenges and data-driven applications. Firstly, we review the data collecting technologies since the late 1990s by classifying the various technologies into two groups: traditional technologies and advanced technologies. A vast body of literature has been developed in this area given the wide range of problems addressed under the transit data label. A summary diagram is proposed to demonstrate the transit data applications and research topics. The data applications are classified into three branches: passenger behavior, operation optimization, and policy application. For each branch, the hot research direction and dimension shown as sub-branches are represented by reviewing the highly cited and the latest literature. As a result, this article discussed the concept and characteristics of transit data and its collection technologies, and further summarized the methodology and potential for each transit data application and suggested a few promising implications for future efforts.},

  abstract     = {Accurate bus passenger flow prediction contributes to informed decisions and full utilization of transit supply. Passenger flow is affected by an extensive range of attributes featuring travel environment, which can be collected through multi-source information. A successful prediction model should not only fully utilize the latent knowledge hidden in multi-source data, but also address the resulting multicollinearity issue. Based on this principle, we propose a novel scaled stacking gradient boosting decision tree (SS-GBDT) model to predict bus passenger flow with multi-source datasets. SS-GBDT includes two modules: the prior feature-generation module and the subsequent GBDT-prediction module. The prior module entails a couple of basic models with similar performance, which generates several enhanced features of multi-source data by stacking process. Particularly, we devise a scaled stacking method by introducing a quasi-attention based mechanism (precision-based scaling and time-based scaling). Taking the newly generated features as input, the prediction module forecasts the passenger flow using GBDT model with stacked data, thereby enhancing the prediction performance. The proposed model is tested in two real-life bus lines in Guangzhou, China. Results show that SS-GBDT not only presents superiority in both prediction accuracy and stability, but can also better handle the multicollinearity issue with multi-source data. It can also prioritize the influential factors on passenger flow prediction. The prediction model is flexible and scalable, which enables the integration of various influential factors in the presence of big data.},

In this study, a joint optimization of running route and scheduling for responsive feeder transit under mixed demand (i.e., reservation and real-time demands) of the time-dependent road network was investigated. A two-stage optimization method was designed together with considering the mixed demands. At the first stage, the initial running route and scheduling were determined according to all reservation demands. At the second stage, the running route and scheduling were continuously optimized based on the real-time demands. The real-time demand responsive strategy, which is built up by using quantitative batch treatment rather than immediate treatment and dynamic route updating strategy for global optimization, were designed by utilizing the submission order of real-time demands. A joint optimization model of running route and scheduling was constructed based on the quantitative batch decision points in the time-dependent road network together with combination of the actual road network. In this model, the minimum total system cost was used, which is composed of the vehicle running costs and passengers&#39; traveling time costs with constraints including vehicle capacity, passengers&#39; time window, and vehicle running time. A solving algorithm based on the adaptive genetic algorithm was designed by considering the characteristics of the joint optimization model.},

Encouraged by the urgent need for cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, vehicle electrification has been advancing at an unprecedented pace. As a major component of the multimodal transportation system, public transit is at the forefront of adopting battery technology into its operation. Battery Electric Bus (BEB), with superior features such as zero-emission and reduced noise, is made ready for commercial deployment in the past several years. However, it is still a grand challenge to successfully deploy BEB system given the nature of the public transit system and the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of BEB. This research presents a bi-objective optimization model for BEB deployment to consider constraints unique to the BEB system and to address the trade-off between environmental equity for the disadvantaged population and capital investment. The model is further demonstrated using the transit system operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to offer insights on the benefits gained as a result of BEB deployment. Optimal deployment plans under different budgets are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the model. The trade-offs in each of the plans are further discussed and compared. This research set the foundation for transit agencies to develop optimal deployment strategies for BEB systems when multiple goals need to be considered, allowing planners and decision-makers to create a transportation ecosystem that better serves livable and sustainable communities.},

  abstract     = {Differing from the conventional fixed-route transit, Demand Responsive Connector (DRC) is scheduled to pick up passengers based on requests, and delivers them to a common destination (e.g., a metro station). The demand for DRC is affected by not only the fare and travel time, but also time reliability. The latter&#39; impact is non-negligible because of the uncertainty nature of DRC on collecting the temporally and spatially distributed passengers. This paper explicitly introduces an elastic demand function embedded with a time deviation penalty model. Based on that, one-vehicle and two-vehicle DRC models are formulated to maximize the social welfare. The decision variables include fare, service area, and operating cycle time. Augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method is applied to solve the optimization problem. Simulation is performed to verify the validity of the models. In numerical studies, sensitivity analysis unveils the influences of several key parameters, e.g., potential demand density, vehicle capacity, line-haul distance and elasticity factors. By comparison, threshold values of demand density are revealed for the applicability of the one-vehicle and two-vehicle schemes. The proposed model provides a decision-making tool for DRC operators considering local conditions.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of electric buses (EBs) is expected to alleviate traffic pollution. However, the promotion of EBs requires a long transition period; during this period, EBs cannot wholly replace conventional buses (CBs). In addition, compared with CBs, EBs have long charging times and short cruising ranges, resulting in short operating times being available for the scheduling process. Therefore, to effectively schedule EBs and CBs, we propose a joint optimal scheduling model for a mixed bus fleet under micro driving conditions. First, we estimate the bus trip time under micro driving conditions. To ensure that all bus transportation tasks can be executed as planned, we propose a buffer time setting method for bus transportation tasks. On this basis, we construct an optimization model, which is used for the joint optimal scheduling of EBs and CBs under different mixing rates. A heuristic procedure based on the genetic algorithm is designed to solve the model. The proposed methodology is validated based on data from Beijing Public Transport, China. The results show that the proposed model considering micro driving conditions is superior to the conventional model in terms of rationality and reliability.},

An ant colony optimization-based two-stage heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the bilevel programming model within an acceptance computation time. Different from conventional methods, the proposed methodology benefits from using real temporal and spatial characteristic datasets of travel demand aggregated from cellular data and traveling time and distance matrices under actual traffic conditions resulted from an open geographic information system (GIS) tool. Results of a real-life case study in Chongqing municipality, China, show that the proposed methodology could achieve a significant reduction of 2.9% total passenger travel time compared with a traditional method.

  abstract     = {In the MaaS (Mobility as a Service) age, the alternatives of route choice for a trip will not be the single mode paths, but the combined routes utilizing more than one travel mode in the multi-modal transportation systems. When modeling the multi-modal combined route choices, alternative routes are correlated not only because of the overlapping of physical links, but also because of the overlapping of travel modes. We define this problem as the generalized path overlapping problem. To address the generalized overlapping problem, a multi-modal logit kernel (MLK) model is proposed to explicitly consider the correlations of unobserved utilities of combined routes. In this model, the unobserved utilities of combined routes are divided to two parts, the link specific parts and the independent route specific parts. The link specific parts are further divided to two parts: physical link specific and the mode specific. The generalized path overlapping problem is captured by the sharing of these two parts of unobserved link utilities. Based on this model, the stochastic user equilibrium on multi-model transport networks is represented as a fixed-point problem. Numerical studies are designed to illustrate the effects of incorporating generalized overlapping problem on disaggregated route choice prediction and aggregated traffic flow assignment. With different settings of physical link and mode specific error terms, the variations of disaggregated route choice predictions and aggregated traffic flows are discussed. It is found that, the generalized overlapping problem can be captured by the proposed model and significantly affect both the individual route choice predictions and aggregated traffic flows at equilibrium.},

This article proposes a proactive real-time control method based on data-driven transit demand prediction with multi-source traffic data. A proactive control strategy is to predict the possible disturbance in the future by monitoring and inferring the system operation, and takes measures in advance to prevent the disturbance from disrupting the service regularity. Firstly, the further service reliability is assessed based on the evolution of the latest service reliabilities, to justify whether to conduct control actions. Secondly, if a control action is required, predict the transit demand and the number of alighting passengers. Thirdly, according to the predicted results, the bus dispatching time is optimized by minimizing passenger waiting time. A calculation process is introduced to solve the problem and the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with the data of a real transit route. The results show that the control method based on transit demand prediction suits the needs of real-time control in the smart transit context.},

  abstract     = {Demand responsive transit (DRT) services in suburban regions serve residents as the complements of the public transportation. Since suburban DRT service usually faces demand fluctuation in some special situations, such as terrible weather, DRT operators have recourse to temporal rental vehicles to satisfy all requests. There are two types of rental contracts. In the first case, the costs of rental vehicles are similar to the costs of owned vehicles, and the multi-trip vehicle routing problem is studied. In the second case, the costs of outbound trips are not covered by DRT companies, and the open vehicle routes are introduced. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed to model the route optimization problem of the suburban DRT service, in which the number of rental vehicles and two classes of routes should be decided simultaneously. To solve the proposed model, a branch-and-price algorithm is designed, which has two pricing subproblems to generate two classes of routes, respectively. From the results of experiments, it can be found that the service sequence is introduced, when open routes are involved. Renting vehicles can help DRT companies save operational costs even in daily operations.},

First, we establish a mixed-integer programming model to formulate the problem, where decision-making considerations in bus route planning, path choice between nodes, and passenger assignment are concurrently integrated. Then, we develop a hybrid metaheuristic (combining tabu search and variable neighborhood search) to solve the model, in which satisfactory performance is observed from the numerical test in a small-sized example. Finally, the problem and methodology are addressed in a city-scale instance, where the effects of time-window features and traffic congestion, as well as the benefits from path flexibility inclusion in terms of cost, travel time, and distance are investigated.},

To fill the research gap, a long-term electric fleet management framework is developed, with fully considering the practical battery capacity loss within charge and discharge cycling. As the battery aging rate is highly dependent on the state of battery charge, we propose to constrain state of battery charge within a predefined range and quantify its cost-effective feature through lifecycle cost analysis. We employ 6 groups of the selected ranges to valid the model and conduct a cost-benefit analysis through comparing their corresponding lifecycle costs. It shows that the battery lifespan can be extended by up to 3 years and the lifecycle cost of electric bus fleet can reduce 24.7% through keeping the state of battery charge within a low and narrow range. A number of managerial insights stemmed from the numerical cases were fully analyzed.

Thus, we analyze the passenger flow from scopes on both macroscopic and microscopic levels, in order to take full advantage of the information from a variety of views. To better understand the role of different views, decision-tree-based models are used in modeling and predicting passenger flow. The defects and key features of decision-tree-based models are then analyzed. The results of the analysis can assist the architecture design of the deep learning network. Inspired by the feature engineering of decision-tree-based models, a modular convolutional neural network is designed, which contains automatic feature extraction block, feature importance block, fully-connected block, and data fusion block.

  abstract     = {The advent of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Mobile Internet technologies is reshaping the public transport sector. Autonomous buses are equipped with varying advanced sensors, and hold great promises to enhancing the responsiveness and flexibility of public transit system. In the context of CAVs, transit operators can not only optimize service headway but also adjust bus capacity to meet the time-varying passenger demand. Anticipated benefits of introducing autonomous buses to the existing transit systems include safety improvement, driver cost reduction, and optimal routing. Bus electrification is another global trend to replace traditional diesel buses for energy savings. Electric buses are advantageous to both operators and passengers due to low greenhouse gas emission, maintenance cost, as well as noise pollution. In recent years, demand responsive public transport (DRPT) services (e.g. customized bus, microtransit) receive huge success thanks to the development of Mobile Internet. Unlike traditional bus services or the fixed-route transit service that relies on passive recipients, fixed stops, and schedules, DRPT can provide personalized service for specific clients through interactive information platform (Internet or smartphone). The aforementioned new types of public transit services significantly improve service quality, reduce energy consumption, and ultimately attract more ridership. To fully explore the benefits of personalized, electric and autonomous transit systems, new analytical models and data-driven methods for transit planning and operation are needed. The authors have selected 15 articles for review in this special issue. A summary of these articles is outlined below.},

  abstract     = {Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning that can be implemented in the IoV. However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we present a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition formation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the UAVs. The joint auction-coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions. The auction scheme is designed to take into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single coalition, is not always stable due to the profit-maximizing behavior of the UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases, the UAVs prefer to support the IoV components independently and not to form any coalition.},

The daily roadway commutes of vehicle drivers may form “virtual” mobile communities, called Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs).

In this paper, we consider a non-cooperative VCS campaign where multiple vehicles are incentivized by dynamically priced tasks and social network effect.

However, location privacy leakage is a serious issue in spatial crowdsourcing because workers who participate in a crowdsourcing task are required to upload their driving locations. In this paper, we propose a decentralized location privacy-preserving SC for IoV, which allows vehicle users to securely participate in SC with ensuring the task&#39;s location policy privacy and providing multi-level privacy preservation for workers&#39; locations. Specifically, we introduce blockchain technology into SC, which can eliminate the control of vehicle user data by SC-server. We combine the additively homomorphic encryption and circle-based location verification to ensure the confidentiality of task&#39;s location policy. To achieve multi-level privacy preservation for workers&#39; driving locations, we only reveal a grid where workers are located in. The size of the grid represents the level of privacy preservation. We leverage the order-preserving encryption and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof to prevent workers from illegally obtaining rewards by forging their driving locations. The security analysis results show that our framework can satisfy the above requirements. In addition, the experiment results demonstrate that our framework is efficient and feasible in practice.},

  abstract     = {While communication-based train control (CBTC) systems play a crucial role in the efficient and reliable operation of urban rail transits, its high penetration level of communication networks opens doors to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Current researches regarding MitM attacks do not consider the characteristics of CBTC systems. Particularly, the limited computing capability of the on-board computers prevents the direct implementation of most existing intrusion detection and defense algorithms against the MitM attack. In order to tackle this dilemma, in this article, we first introduce edge intelligence (EI) into CBTC systems to enhance the computing capability of the system. A cross-layer defense scheme, which includes the detection and defense stages, are proposed next. For the cross-layer detection stage, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based detection method to combine the detection probability calculated from the train control parameter sequence and operation log files. For the cross-layer defense stage, we construct a Bayesian game based defense model to derive the optimal defense policy against MitM attacks. To further improve the accuracy of the defense scheme as well as optimize the communication resource allocation scheme, we propose an optimal communication resource allocation scheme based on the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm at last. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves excellent performance in defending against MitM attacks.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, surveillance cameras have been pervasively equipped with vehicles in public transport systems. For the sake of public security, it is crucial to upload recorded surveillance videos to remote servers timely for backup and necessary video analytics. However, continuously uploading video content generated by tens of thousands of vehicles can be extremely bandwidth consuming. In this work, we investigate the video uploading problem for moving buses by proposing to deploy dedicated access points (AP) at bus stops to facilitate video uploading. We define the harmonic objective for our problem, which includes minimizing the video uploading delay and minimizing the AP deployment cost. This problem is with two fundamental challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to balance the bandwidth capacity allocated to many buses because a bus obtains bandwidth resource from a series of APs deployed at stops along its route. Secondly, due to the randomness of bus movement and the complexity of bus routes, it is hard to predict the workload of an AP. Hence, it is challenging to estimate the delay of uploading video content through an AP. To cope with these challenges, we propose a water filling placement (WFP) algorithm, aiming to balance the aggregated bandwidth allocated to each bus. A queuing model is established to analyze the uploading delay of video content. We further resort to machine learning models to factor the influence of bus routes into our queuing model. Finally, a convex problem is formulated to optimize the harmonic objective, which can be optimally solved with the gradient descent (GD) based algorithm. We validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by carrying out extensive experiments using bus traces collected in Shenzhen city of China. In comparison with benchmark algorithms, our solution can always achieve the best performance.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables real-time data exchange among vehicles and roadside units and thus provides a promising solution to alleviate traffic jams in the urban area. Meanwhile, better traffic management via efficient traffic light control can benefit the IoV as well by enabling a better communication environment and decreasing the network load. As such, IoV and efficient traffic light control can formulate a virtuous cycle. Edge computing, an emerging technology to provide low-latency computation capabilities at the edge of the network, can further improve the performance of this cycle. However, while the collected information is valuable, an efficient solution for better utilization and faster feedback has yet to be developed for edge-empowered IoV. To this end, we propose a Decentralized Reinforcement Learning at the Edge for traffic light control in the IoV (DRLE). DRLE exploits the ubiquity of the IoV to accelerate traffic data collection and interpretation towards better traffic light control and congestion alleviation. Operating within the coverage of the edge servers, DRLE aggregates data from neighboring edge servers for city-scale traffic light control. DRLE decomposes the highly complex problem of large area control into a decentralized multi-agent problem. We prove its global optima with concrete mathematical reasoning and demonstrate its superiority over several state-of-the-art algorithms via extensive evaluations.},

  abstract     = {In the transportation industry, task offloading services of edge-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) are expected to provide vehicles with the better Quality of Experience (QoE). However, the various status of diverse edge servers and vehicles, as well as varying vehicular offloading modes, make a challenge of task offloading service. Therefore, to enhance the satisfaction of QoE, we first introduce a novel QoE model. Specifically, the emerging QoE model restricted by the energy consumption: 1) intelligent vehicles equipped with caching spaces and computing units may work as carriers; 2) various computational and caching capacities of edge servers can empower the offloading; and 3) unpredictable routings of the vehicles and edge servers can lead to diverse information transmission. We then propose an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named PS-DDPG with the prioritized experience replay (PER) and the stochastic weight averaging (SWA) mechanisms based on deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) to seek an optimal offloading mode, saving energy consumption. Specifically, the PER scheme is proposed to enhance the availability of the experience replay buffer, thus accelerating the training. Moreover, reducing the noise in the training process and thus stabilizing the rewards, the SWA scheme is introduced to average weights. Extensive experiments certify the better performance, i.e., stability and convergence, of our PS-DDPG algorithm compared to existing work. Moreover, the experiments indicate that the QoE value can be improved by the proposed algorithm.},

The self-driving vehicle, on the other hand, entails a new passenger profile where sophisticated infotainment applications are expected to enhance the quality of travel. From the technical stand point, for this vision to become a reality a streamlined edge computing infrastructure, namely Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC), is required where computationally intensive workloads are offloaded to a nearby VEC infrastructure. However, the highly dynamic environment renders it difficult to efficiently operate a VEC system to yield the crisp performance required on an autonomous vehicle. In this setting, where to offload each task stands out as a crucial decision problem, and the conventional methods prove insufficient for its solution. In our work, we proposed a two-stage machine learning-based vehicular edge orchestrator which takes into account not only the task completion success but also the service time. To demonstrate how our approach performs in a realistic setting, we employed EdgeCloudSim to design extensive experiments where the characteristics of the vehicular applications, upload/download sizes, computational footprints of the tasks, the LAN, MAN and WAN network models, and the mobility are considered. Detailed performance evaluation of the proposed system via simulation is carried out where both overall and service type-specific performance scores in comparison with opponent schemes are reported.},

Due to the increasing number of vehicles and the asymmetrical distribution of traffic flows, it is essential for the network operator to design intelligent offloading strategies to improve network performance and provide high-quality services for users. However, the lack of global information and the time-variety of IoVs make it challenging to perform effective offloading and caching decisions under long-term energy constraints of RSUs. Since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning can greatly enhance the intelligence and the performance of IoVs, we push AI inspired computing, caching and communication resources to the proximity of smart vehicles, which jointly enable RSU peer offloading, vehicle-to-RSU offloading and content caching in the IoV framework. A Mix Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to minimize total network delay, consisting of communication delay, computation delay, network congestion delay and content downloading delay of all users. Then, we develop an online multi-decision making scheme (named OMEN) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization method to solve the formulated problem, and prove that OMEN achieves near-optimal performance. Leveraging strong cognition of AI, we put forward an imitation learning enabled branch-and-bound solution in edge intelligent IoVs to speed up the problem solving process with few training samples.

  abstract     = {Efficient urban traffic monitoring is a key enabler for intelligent planning and management of modern cities. Network tomography can monitor the urban traffic with a comparably small number of traffic detectors like cameras, and has become an appealing technique for urban traffic management. However, previous work on network tomography based traffic monitoring focuses primarily on developing estimators using the given end-to-end travel time measurements, while the design of data collection for efficiently distributed collecting and processing the raw monitoring videos to such measurements is often neglected. We fill this gap by exploring the vision of edge intelligence for optimal urban traffic monitoring, and tackle the following two problems in regard of limited telecommunications resources: 1) when the total number of monitoring videos that are successfully processed into the end-to-end travel time measurements is pre-bounded, we employ a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to help determine the best quota scheme for the monitoring videos that each traffic detector need to generate and 2) when the centralised processing of monitoring videos alone is insufficient, we make use of the computation capabilities from these edge devices, i.e., traffic detectors, and employ a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to help them conduct intelligent computation offloading individually. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively reduces the estimation error of network tomography compared to common approaches with either uniform or random strategy.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the ultra-low delay requirements of many emerging Internet of Vehicles (IoV) services by shifting the service caching and the computation capacities to the network edge. However, due to the constraints of the multidimensional (storage-computing-communication) resources capacities and the cost budgets of vehicles, there are two main issues need to be addressed: 1) How to collaboratively optimize the service caching decision among edge nodes to better reap the benefits of the storage resource and save the time-correlated service reconfiguration cost? 2) How to allocate resources among various vehicles and where vehicular requests are scheduled to improve the efficiency of the computing and communication resources utilization? In this paper, we formulate an edge caching and computation management problem that jointly optimizes the service caching, the request scheduling, and the resource allocation strategies. Our focus is to minimize the time-average service response delay of the random arriving service requests in a cost-efficient way. To cope with the dynamic and unpredictable challenges of IoVs, we leverage the combined power of Lyapunov optimization, matching theory, and consensus alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the problem in an online and distributed manner. Theoretical analysis shows that the developed approach achieves a close-to-optimal delay performance without relying on any prior knowledge of the future network information. Moreover, simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baselines substantially.},

  abstract     = {Origin-destination matrices help understand the movement of people within cities. This work is built upon the premise that stakeholders, e.g. decision makers, need to analyze mobility flows from spatio-temporal perspectives that are appropriate to their context of analysis. The data retrieved from sensors and Intelligent Transportation Systems are useful for this purpose due to their lower acquisition costs and fine granularity, although it is complex to use such data in an integrated way, as they might have heterogeneous representations of spatio-temporal attributes and granularities. Most of the related works on the analysis of OD flows consider matrices with a fixed spatio-temporal aggregation level, and do not explore the intrinsic issue of data heterogeneity. Herein we report our findings on building the semantic foundation of knowledge-assisted visualization tools for analyzing OD matrices from multiple stakeholder levels. We propose a set of ontology design patterns for modeling the semantics of OD data, and the relations between the spatio-temporal constructs that stakeholders ought to choose when visualizing urban mobility flows. Our approach aims to be reusable by researchers and practitioners. We describe a practical implementation using estimated flows from smart card data from Porto, Portugal.},

On the basis of comprehensively solving the power quality problems of electrified railway, a multi-application strategy based on the railway static power conditioner (RPC) with the energy storage system (ESS) is proposed in this paper to improve the economic benefits of the traction system. Through the implementation of the peak clipping and the recuperation and utilization of regenerative braking energy of traction load with the guidance of such strategy, the comprehensive economic benefits of the traction system can be improved. By analyzing the mathematical relationship between the comprehensive economic benefits and the parameters such as peak clipping rate and regenerative braking energy utilization rate of the system, an optimization model with the goal of maximizing the comprehensive economic benefits is established. Therefore, the optimal configuration capacity of the ESS is obtained. Finally, the experiments are carried out in MATLAB. The results show that, with the multi-application strategy, the peak load clipping and the recuperation and utilization of regenerative braking energy can be simultaneously realized. It is also demonstrated that the comprehensive economic benefits and environmental benefits can be improved while improving energy efficiency.},

A personalized recommender system is one of the important methods for solving the problem of big data overload. However, to make use of these mobile data from vehicles, traditional recommender services are confronted by severe challenges. Therefore, we study the diversified recommendation problem based on a real-world dataset, represented as a tensor with three dimensions of user, location and activity. As the tensor is rather sparse, we employ tensor decomposition to predict missing values. Additionally, we directly regard recommendation precision as an objective. In addition to precision, we also consider the recommendation novelty and coverage, providing a more comprehensive view of the recommender system. Thus, visitors can discover attractive spots that are less visited in a personalized manner, relieving traffic pressure at famous scenic spots and balancing overall transportation. By integrating all these objectives, we construct a many-objective recommendation model. To optimize this model, we propose a distributed parallel evolutionary algorithm employing the nondominated ranking and crowding distance. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm performs well and is very efficient.},

Despite potentially bringing richer insights, the use of open-ended questions poses great challenges in terms of extracting useful information while significantly increasing the analysis time. Nevertheless, automatic text analysis techniques speed up the analysis of open-ended responses. In this research, we explore the potential to use techniques in topic modelling [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Supervised LDA (sLDA)] to extract information from open-ended responses. This is compared to the information obtained from closed-ended responses, accomplished using a questionnaire that measures the intention to use shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Two versions of the questionnaire- Ver_OE and Ver_Lk were used, with open-ended and Likert scales measuring the same attitudes in the alternative versions. Factors were extracted for closed-ended questions. For questions common to both versions of the questionnaire, respondents answering Ver_OE had a higher positive attitude towards autonomous vehicles. These attitudinal questions were placed after the open-ended questions. When evaluating the performance of the models that predict the intention to use SAVs, models estimated using Ver_OE performed better. This increased further with the inclusion of the information extracted from the open-ended responses using both, the unsupervised (LDA) and supervised (sLDA) methods. No improvement was observed in the model for Ver_Lk. These indicate the potential for the use of open-ended questions to measure attitudes and topic modelling to extract information from these responses.},

One of the critical factors affecting such a percentage and more, in general, the demand for public transport services, with an increasing reluctance to use them, is their quality. End-users can perceive quality from various perspectives, including the availability of information, i.e., the access to details about the transit and the provided services. The approach proposed in this paper, using innovative methodologies resorting on data mining and machine learning techniques, aims to make available the unavailable data about public transport. In particular, by mining GPS traces, we manage to reconstruct the complete transit graph of public transport. The approach has been successfully validated on a real dataset collected from the local bus system of the city of L&#39;Aquila (Italy). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach and implemented framework are both effective and efficient, thus being ready for deployment.},

  abstract     = {The rapid and convenient travel of people and the timely transportation of goods depend on the correct decision of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Due to the decision-making of ITS requires a large amount of data to support, UAV-enabled periodic data collection is an effective method. However, due to the limited resources of UAV, UAV cannot directly collect data from all storage devices, resulting in unfair data collection. Therefore, we propose a UAV Speed Control based Fairness Data Collection (USCFDC) scheme. First, since the fairness of data collection will affect the decision-making of ITS, a framework for controlling the flight speed of the UAV is proposed to improve the fairness of data collection. The flight speed of UAV will slow down in areas with a large number of nodes, thereby improving the fairness of data collection. Second, a novel method is proposed to maximize the amount of data collected by UAV from each node. With this method, the value of the amount of data will be used as the dichotomous value in the dichotomy algorithm, and the UAV must collect a certain amount of data from each node. The upper and lower limits of the dichotomy algorithm are adjusted according to the time duration for UAV to collect data. Compared with previous schemes, the fairness of data collection can be improved by a maximum of 15.89% under the same flight time of UAV. Besides, the energy consumption is reduced by 49.31%-52.55% and the flight time of the UAV is reduced by 48%-62.38% when the amount of collected data is the same.},

C-ITS are transport system of systems that involves many stakeholders from different sectors. While running their own systems and providing services independently, stakeholders cooperate with each other for improving the overall transport performance such as safety, efficiency and sustainability. Massive information on road and traffic is already available and provided through standard services with different protocols. By reusing and composing the available heterogeneous services, novel value-added applications can be developed. This paper introduces a choreography-based service composition platform, i.e. the CHOReVOLUTION Integrated Development and Runtime Environment (IDRE), and it reports on how the IDRE has been successfully exploited to accelerate the reuse-based development of a choreography-based Urban Traffic Coordination (UTC) application. The UTC application takes the shape of eco-driving services that through real-time eco-route evaluation assist the drivers for the most eco-friendly and comfortable driving experience. The eco-driving services are realized through choreography and they are exploited through a mobile app for online navigation. From specification to deployment to execution, the CHOReVOLUTION IDRE has been exploited to support the realization of the UTC application by automatizing the generation of the distributed logic to properly bind, coordinate and adapt the interactions of the involved parties. The benefits brought by CHOReVOLUTION IDRE have been assessed through the evaluation of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).},

Moreover, different passengers have different needs for AVs, thus, how to provide personalized choices for different passengers is another issue for AVs. Therefore, a human-like decision making framework is designed for AVs in this paper. Different driving styles and social interaction characteristics are formulated for AVs regarding driving safety, ride comfort and travel efficiency, which are considered in the modeling process of decision making. Then, Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg game theory are applied to the noncooperative decision making. In addition, potential field method and model predictive control (MPC) are combined to deal with the motion prediction and planning for AVs, which provides predicted motion information for the decision-making module. Finally, two typical testing scenarios of lane change, i.e., merging and overtaking, are carried out to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed decision-making framework considering different human-like behaviors. Testing results indicate that both the two game theoretic approaches can provide reasonable human-like decision making for AVs. Compared with the Nash equilibrium approach, under the normal driving style, the cost value of decision making using the Stackelberg game theoretic approach is reduced by over 20%.},

Through the perspective of space-time network, the CB service design problem (CBSDP) is formulated as an integrated optimization model with the objectives of maximizing passenger accessibility and minimizing operating cost. An inconvenience index of passengers is introduced in the problem to measure the service quality, and the total number of stops for all involved CB routes is set as one of the objectives to optimize the total cost of the CB system. A heuristic approach is applied to generate efficient solutions for the CBSDP. Two types of instance, namely, a numerical experiment and a real-world instance, are implemented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. We also conduct a series of sensitive analyses to explore the influences of various parameters on the CB system for capturing the interaction among stops, routes, and timetables. Final results show that the CB plans obtained by the proposed method can provide efficient services by balancing passenger convenience and operating cost.},

Also, it proposes an IoV model for intelligent edge computing task offloading and migration under the SDVN (Software Defined Vehicular Networks) architecture, that is, the JDE-VCO (Joint Delay and Energy-Vehicle Computational task Offloading) optimization. And the simulation is performed. The results show that in the analysis of the impact of different offloading strategies on the IoV, it is found that the JDE-VCO algorithm is superior to other schemes in terms of transmission delay and total offloading energy consumption. In the analysis of the impact of the task unloading of the IoV, the JDE-VCO algorithm is less than RTO (Random Tasks Offloading) and UTO (Uniform Tasks Offloading) algorithm schemes in terms of the number of tasks per unit time, and the average task completion time for the same amount of uploaded data. In the analysis of the packet loss ratio and transmission delay, it can be found that the packet loss ratio and transmission delay of the JDE-VCO algorithm are less than the RTO and UTO algorithms. Moreover, the packet loss ratio of the JDE-VCO algorithm is about 0.1, and the transmission delay is stable at 0.2s, which has obvious advantages. Therefore, through research, the IoV model of task offloading and migration built by intelligent edge computing can significantly improve the load sharing rate, offloading efficiency, packet loss ratio, and transmission delay when the IoV is processing tasks and uploading data. It provides experimental basis for the improvement of the IoV system.},

  abstract     = {The growth in online goods delivery is causing a dramatic surge in urban vehicle traffic from last-mile deliveries. On the other hand, ride-sharing has been on the rise with the success of ride-sharing platforms and increased research on using autonomous vehicle technologies for routing and matching. The future of urban mobility for passengers and goods relies on leveraging new methods that minimize operational costs and environmental footprints of transportation systems. This article considers combining passenger transportation with goods delivery to improve vehicle-based transportation. We propose FlexPool: a distributed model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly serves passengers &amp; goods workloads by learning optimal dispatch policies from its interaction with the environment. The proposed algorithm pools passengers for a ride-sharing service and delivers goods using a multi-hop transit method. These flexibilities decrease the fleet’s operational cost and environmental footprint while maintaining service levels for passengers and goods. The dispatching algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is integrated with an efficient matching algorithm for passengers and goods. Through simulations on a realistic multi-agent urban mobility platform, we demonstrate that FlexPool outperforms other model-free settings in serving the demands from passengers &amp; goods. FlexPool achieves 30% higher fleet utilization and 35% higher fuel efficiency in comparison to (i) model-free approaches where vehicles transport a combination of passengers &amp; goods without the use of multi-hop transit, and (ii) model-free approaches where vehicles exclusively transport either passengers or goods.},

  abstract     = {The mixed traffic flow, which comprises both cooperative automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles, is becoming more common in modern urban areas. CAVs can expand the capabilities such as that can be achieved with automation and vehicular communication individually. However, the energy-saving benefits may be one of the exceptions when three or more vehicles drive in a row under the mixed traffic scenarios. The undesired driving behaviors of human-driven vehicles can introduce a high level of randomness to traffic flow, which results in energy-inefficient driving profiles for CAVs with aggressive operations or even vehicle crashing. In this paper, we investigate an eco-platooning problem for CAVs under the mixed traffic flow. This is a challenging problem due to both of the platoon-wide energy-saving and driving security requirements. To address this problem, an ecological and string stable platooning scheme, called E-CACC, is provided. First, novel spacing policies are presented to enforce that all platoon members track energy-efficient driving profiles. Then, control laws are designed to ensure the tracking performances of the proposed spacing policies. Furthermore, the theoretical proof is provided to prove the platoon string stability of the proposed strategy. Finally, performance evaluation is conducted. Results have illustrated the energy efficiency of the proposed E-CACC scheme.},

  abstract     = {Modern transportation systems, such as computer networks, have become increasingly faster, aiming to “shorten” distances and travel time. This trend allows thinking about new services and induces to reconsider existing ones starting from new technologies, as for Intelligent Transportation Systems. Thereby, an all-encompassing scenario laying at the intersection of several domains, including manufacturing, logistics, traveling, insurance, maintenance, and trading, with the transportation one, can be envisioned. The building block for the resulting transportation ecosystem is an information system that is able to gather and connect all involved stakeholders and domains around the concept of mobility and vehicle to address complex multifaceted problems in an efficient and trustworthy way. This paper proposes the adoption of distributed ledgers to implement such a vehicle-centric information system, distributing data across the network while ensuring trustworthiness. Starting from the vehicle lifecycle immutable and certified information, new services for cross-cuttingly addressing diversity and complexity in the transportation ecosystem can be implemented. The proposed solution merges Multichain and MongoDB technologies to achieve a trade-off between trustworthiness and performance, storing only the metadata in the Multichain network. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by an example on a vehicle trading service showing an overhead for the proposed solution below 18% against a pure MongoDB one on I/O operations.},

Therefore, this paper aims at co-locating 3D objects from mobile LiDAR point clouds without any help of supervised training data. To realize it, we propose a new framework to implement 3D object co-localization for automatically extracting the objects of the same category from different point-cloud scenes. Specifically, to search and exploit the co-information from objects in different point-cloud scenes, we formulate a 3D object co-localization problem as a maximal subgraph matching problem. During the graph construction procedure, to handle the inconsistent representation of objects in different scenes, we propose a multi-scale clustering method to represent objects by a pyramid structure. In addition, because the maximal subgraph matching problem is NP-hard, we propose a stochastic search algorithm to generate the co-localization results. Extensive experiments on the point-cloud data collected by the Reigl VMX450 mobile LiDAR system demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Accurate road marking extraction and classification play a significant role in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and high-definition (HD) maps. Due to point density and intensity variations from mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems, most of the existing thresholding-based extraction methods and rule-based classification methods cannot deliver high efficiency and remarkable robustness. To address this, we propose a capsule-based deep learning framework for road marking extraction and classification from massive and unordered MLS point clouds. This framework mainly contains three modules. Module I is first implemented to segment road surfaces from 3D MLS point clouds, followed by an inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation method for 2D georeferenced image generation. Then, in Module II, a U-shaped capsule-based network is constructed to extract road markings based on the convolutional and deconvolutional capsule operations. Finally, a hybrid capsule-based network is developed to classify different types of road markings by using a revised dynamic routing algorithm and large-margin Softmax loss function. A road marking dataset containing both 3D point clouds and manually labeled reference data is built from three types of road scenes, including urban roads, highways, and underground garages. The proposed networks were accordingly evaluated by estimating robustness and efficiency using this dataset. Quantitative evaluations indicate the proposed extraction method can deliver 94.11% in precision, 90.52% in recall, and 92.43% in F 1 -score, respectively, while the classification network achieves an average of 3.42% misclassification rate in different road scenes.},

  abstract     = {Traffic facilities extraction is of vital importance to various applications such as intelligent transportation systems, infrastructures inventory and city management related applications. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems provide a new technique to capture and update traffic facilities information. However, classifying raw MLS point clouds into semantic objects is still one of the most challenging and important issues. In this study, we separate the raw off-ground point clouds into individual segments and explore an object-based Deep Belief Network (DBN) architecture to detect roadside traffic facilities (trees, cars, and traffic poles) with limited labeled samples. To deal with various roadside traffic objects with different types, sizes, orientations and levels of incompleteness, we develop a simple and general multi-view feature descriptor to characterize the global feature of individual objects and extend the quantity of the training samples. Extensive experiments are employed to evaluate the validities of the proposed algorithm with six test datasets acquired by different MLS Systems. Four accuracy evaluation metrics precision, recall, quality and Fscore of trees, cars and traffic poles on the selected MLS datasets achieve (96.08%, 97.61%, 93.86%, 96.81%), (97.55%, 94.10%, 91.69%, 95.58%) and (94.39%, 97.71%, 92.37%, 95.99%), respectively.

  abstract     = {Map-based localization and sensing are one of the key components in autonomous driving technologies, where high quality 3D map reconstruction is fundamentally utmost important. However, due to the highly dynamic and uncontrollable properties of real world environment, building a high quality 3D map is not straightforward and requires several strong assumptions. To address this challenge, we present a complete framework, which detects and extracts the moving objects from a sequence of unordered and texture-less point clouds, to build high quality static maps. To accurately detect the moving objects from data acquired with a possibly fast moving platform, we propose a novel 3D Flow Field Analysis approach in which we inspect the motion behaviour of the registered point sets. The proposed algorithm elegantly models the temporal and spatial displacement of the moving objects. Thus, both small moving objects (e.g. walking pedestrians) and large moving objects (e.g. moving trucks) can be detected effectively. Further, by incorporating the Sparse Subspace Clustering framework, we propose a Sparse Flow Clustering algorithm to group the 3D motion flows under both the constraints of motion similarity and spatial closeness. To this end, the static scene parts and the moving objects can be independently processed to achieve photo-realistic 3D reconstructions. Finally, we show that the proposed 3D Flow Field Analysis algorithm and the Sparse Flow Clustering approach are highly effective for motion detection and segmentation, as exemplified on the KITTI benchmark, and yield high quality reconstructed static-maps as well as rigidly moving objects.},

With embedded multi-sensors, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) hold great potential for collecting sensing data and providing social services in smart city. However, due to the limited battery lifetime and processing capacities of UAVs, the efficient offloading scheme of UAVs is urgently needed in smart city. Therefore, in this article, a vehicle-assisted computing offloading architecture for UAVs is proposed to improve offloading efficiency by harnessing the moving vehicles in smart city. We first develop an offloading model for UAVs to determine the offloading strategy. Next, to select the optimal vehicles for offloading, we formulate a matching scheme based on the preference lists of UAVs and vehicles to derive the optimal matching between UAVs and vehicles. After that, to improve the offloading efficiency and maximize the utilities of UAVs and vehicles, the transaction process of computing data between UAVs and vehicles is modeled as a bargaining game. Moreover, an offloading algorithm for UAVs and vehicles is proposed to obtain the optimal strategy. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed offloading scheme. The results demonstrate that the proposed offloading scheme can significantly save resource and improve the utilities of UAVs and vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) aims to retrieve all images of a target vehicle from a large gallery where the vehicles are captured from non-overlapping cameras. However, the drastic variation in vehicle appearance under different viewpoints greatly affects the performance of the multi-view vehicle Re-ID model, so the key issue in multi-view vehicle Re-ID is learning an effective feature representation that is robust to both dramatic intra-class variability and small inter-class variability. To achieve this goal, we have proposed a multi-center metric learning framework for multi-view vehicle Re-ID. In our approach, we model latent views from vehicle visual appearance directly without any extra labels except ID. Firstly, we introduce several latent view clusters for a vehicle to model latent multi-view information and each view cluster has a learnable center. Then multi-view vehicle matching task can be transformed into two subproblems, cross-view matching and cross-target matching. Finally, an intra-class ranking loss with cross-view center constraint and a cross-class ranking loss with cross-vehicle center constraint are proposed to address the two subproblems, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on three widely used benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed framework in contrast to a series of existing state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {The global trends in urbanization have caused many problems, among which Urban Traffic Control (UTC) becomes a priority issue for most big cities in many countries. As traffic demand changes rapidly, appropriate control policies are required to be generated in real time in order to, e.g., minimize congestion to reduce average travel time and air pollution. A practical way to meet the challenge is to build an intelligent control mechanism of road traffic. In this context, automated planning, a powerful and effective technique, can be exploited as an aid to dynamically produce plans to alleviate the problems of UTC. In this paper, we present an approach based on automated planning, in particular temporal planning scheme that aims for producing predictable management strategies of UTC. Meanwhile, a logic style control knowledge is employed to provide useful guidance for the search process in planning. We show the preliminary evaluations on simulation benchmarks closely related to UTC. Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, compared with the state-of-the-art planners that participate in recent International Planning Competitions.},

To analyzing massive data under the required time for transportation issues, the edge computing paradigm is applied, which pre-processing large amounts of data at the network edge to save bandwidth and improve response time. However, data reliability and security are still facing many challenges in the edge environment. In this article, we propose a multi-authority hybrid attribute-based signature scheme (SDABS). It is composed of four phases: system initialization, signature generation, signature verification, and attribute revocation phases. To better describe frequently changing features in the transportation systems like location, the dynamic attribute is introduced in building the signature. The multi-layer policy tree is applied to support flexible and various access policies, which also naturally form user groups and help data searching. Besides, the multi-authority structure is more suitable for the distributed edge environment. We evaluate SDABS from both theoretical analysis and practical analysis. Compared with two classical signature schemes (MABS and ODMA-ABS), experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SDABS can achieve better performance at an acceptable cost in the terms of attributes and attribute authorities.},

In this paper, we propose a Mutual Encouragement Network (MENet), which includes a semantic segmentation branch and a disparity regression branch, and simultaneously generates semantic map and visual disparity. In the cost volume construction phase, the depth information is embedded in the semantic segmentation branch to increase contextual understanding. Similarly, the semantic information is also included in the disparity regression branch to generate more accurate disparity. Two branches mutually promote each other during training phase and inference phase. We conducted our method on the popular dataset KITTI, and the experimental results show that our method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods on both visual disparity generation and semantic segmentation. In addition, extensive ablation studies also demonstrate that the two tasks in our method can facilitate each other significantly with the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {An intelligent transportation system (ITS) plays an important role in public transport management, security and other issues. Traffic flow detection is an important part of the ITS. Based on the real-time acquisition of urban road traffic flow information, an ITS provides intelligent guidance for relieving traffic jams and reducing environmental pollution. The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment. After that, the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is optimized by retraining the feature extractor for multiobject vehicle tracking. Then, we propose a real-time vehicle tracking counter for vehicles that combines the vehicle detection and vehicle tracking algorithms to realize the detection of traffic flow. Finally, the vehicle detection network and multiple-object tracking network are migrated and deployed on the edge device Jetson TX2 platform, and we verify the correctness and efficiency of our framework. The test results indicate that our model can efficiently detect the traffic flow with an average processing speed of 37.9 FPS (frames per second) and an average accuracy of 92.0% on the edge device.},

  abstract     = {The development of Electric Vehicle (EV) helps to ease energy crises and deduce vehicle exhaust emissions. However, it also brings a great impact on both transportation networks and power grids. There are some serious impediments in terms of energy charging to the popularization of EV, such as high deployment cost of charging stations, low charging efficiency, and voltage deviation of power grid. To address these issues, we design a new EV charging system, which levers the bus network in urban areas through the integration of OnLine Electric Vehicle (OLEV) system and Microwave Power Transfer (MPT) system. We formulate the EV route scheduling problem based on this new charging system to maximize the total residual energy subject to all EVs can arrive to their destinations before deadlines. Then, we propose an approximation algorithm, RSA, to solve the route scheduling problem. To relieve the traffic congestion, we further formulate the conflict-free EV route scheduling problem, and use the matching based algorithm, FRSA, to find the EV route schedules with the maximal residual energy. Through the extensive simulations, we demonstrate that RSA and FRSA can increase the average residual energy by 67.66% and 50.36% compared with the solution without the designed wireless charging system, respectively. Moreover, RSA reduces 22.22% of travel time and outputs 77.23% of residual energy, and FRSA can obtain 83.51% residual energy with 3.62% of extra travel time of the corresponding optimal solutions on average, respectively.},

  abstract     = {We attempt to intelligently identify violations of throwing waste from vehicles (TWV) in real-time traffic surveillance videos. In addition to polluting the environment, TWV easily causes injury to sanitation workers responsible for cleaning roads by passing vehicles. However, manual inspection is still the commonest way to recognize such uncivilized behavior in videos with very high time and labor-consuming. In answer to these challenges, we design a novel 20-layer residual network (Nov-ResNet-20) for training the vehicle-thrown-waste identification model (VTWIM). Then, incorporating Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), we propose the deep-residual-network-leveraged vehicle-thrown-waste identification method (DRN-VTWI). Our method first splits one video frame into several regions matching suspected objects marked with location boxes via Selective Search. Then, in terms of the VTWIM trained by Nov-ResNet-20 our method identifies the regions containing TWV. Last, our method removes the redundant location boxes for each recognized, vehicle-thrown waste and only keeps the best one. The significance of our work is four-fold: 1) Nov-ResNet-20 has a moderate depth: 6 convolutional layers, 7 residual layers, and in total 20 weight layers. Due to the joint contribution of the residual, batch normalization, dropout, and cross-entropy loss, it is eligible to identify TWV using a small quantity of manually-annotated training samples. 2) Selective Search diversely marks all possible, suspected objects in video frames, whereas NMS keeps the best location box for each recognized vehicle-thrown waste, removing all redundancies. In this way, DRN-VTWI finds potential violations of TWV as many as possible and optimally annotates vehicle-thrown wastes in frames as well. 3) Combining the power of Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and NMS, DRN-VTWI well solves the challenging, intelligent identification of vehicle-thrown wastes for real-time traffic surveillance. Experimental studies conducted on real-time traffic surveillance videos demonstrate the effectiveness as well as superiority of our efforts.},

Compared with traditional trust evaluation mechanism, mobility-based trust evaluation owns the advantages of low energy consumption and high evaluation accuracy. Meanwhile, we investigate the problem of minimizing transmission hops of trust evaluation and refers to this as the mobile trust evaluation problem (MTEP). We first formalize the MTEP into an optimization problem and present a heuristic moving strategy of single electric vehicle. Then, we consider the MTEP with multiple electric vehicles. By scheduling the electric vehicles to access the nodes on spanning tree with maximum neighbor distance ratio, the algorithm can improve the efficiency of trust evaluation. In experiments, we compare moving strategy of single electric vehicle and multiple electric vehicles with existing methods respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are able to effectively reduce the entire transmission hops of trust evaluation and thus prolong the life of the network.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) supports multiple traffic services by processing abundant data from sensors and video surveillance devices. With edge computing, video surveillance services can be certainly improved due to the handy resource provision for video storage and processing. Generally, to reduce the hardware and maintenance investment, it is a popular manner to deploy the limited amount of edge nodes along with the surveillance devices. However such edge node layout leads to the unstable service distribution and complicated data transmission across the surveillance devices and edge nodes, which consequently decreases the quality of the surveillance services. In addition, the service trustworthiness is suspected since the privacy information may be revealed to some extent during the data transmission. To combat these challenges, a trust-aware task offloading method (TOM) for video surveillance in edge computing enabled IoV is presented for minimizing the response time of the services, achieving the load balance of the edge nodes and realizing privacy protection. Technically, SPEA2 (improving the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm) is employed to acquire balanced task offloading solutions. Then, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and MCDM (Multiple Criteria Decision Making) are exercised to ascertain the optimal solution. Finally, the experimental simulation demonstrates that TOM performs efficient and trust.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression is one of the important characteristics of drivers during driving. It is very useful in safe driving detection. Recognizing drivers&#39; expressions by the facial images can be solved with machine learning classification strategies. To obtain a reliable reorganization performance, most of approaches assume that the facial images in the training and testing datasets are independently and identically distributed. However, for real time drivers&#39; facial expression recognition, due to vehicle motion, changes in illumination, noise and head movement, the features displayed for the training dataset may be not valid for the testing dataset. To solve this problem, a novel approach is proposed for cross-dataset transfer driver expression recognition via global discriminative and local structure knowledge exploitation in shared projection subspace (GD-LS-SS). By leaning a shared common subspace, GD-LS-SS utilizes the local geometrical structure of data by exploiting the knowledge of graph topology, meanwhile exploiting the global discriminative information by using the pairwise constrained knowledge between the source and labeled target data. Taking advantage of kernel trick, the kernel version of GD-LS-SS is proposed to learn the kernel projection for handling nonlinear cross-dataset transfer and to further promote the recognition accuracy. Experiments on the KMU-FED dataset show that the satisfactory recognition performance of GD-LS-SS outperforms several traditional non-transfer and related transfer approaches.},

  abstract     = {In the field of intelligent transportation, transfer learning (TL) is often used to recognize EEG-based drowsy driving for a new subject with few subject-specific calibration data. However, most of existing TL-based models are offline, non-transparent, and in which features are only represented from one view (usually only one algorithm is used to extract features). In this paper, we consider an online multi-view regression model with high interpretability. By taking the 1-order TSK fuzzy system as the basic regression component and injecting the nature of the multi-view settings into the existing transfer learning framework and enforcing the consistencies across different views, we propose an online multi-view &amp; transfer TSK fuzzy system for driver drowsiness estimation. In this novel model, features in both the source domain and the target domain are represented from multi-view perspectives such that more pattern information can be utilized during model training. Also, comparing with offline training, the proposed online fuzzy system meets the practical requirements more competently. An experiment on a driving dataset demonstrates that the proposed fuzzy system has smaller drowsiness estimation errors and higher interpretability than introduced benchmarking models.},

  abstract     = {Real-time (online) road network traffic state estimation plays a vital role in enhancing the services offered by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Spatio-temporal data vacancies of contemporary acquisition systems considerably limit the reliability of online traffic state estimation. Online estimation insists smaller temporal frame widths inhibiting the accuracies of low rank matrix reconstruction approaches, while matrix imputation methods do not capture the non-trivial traffic data relationships. Alternatively, this paper investigates traffic state estimation by constructing sparse representations via Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) and Block SBL (BSBL) approaches to accommodate under-sampled data, independent of the acquisition type. Appropriate kernel matrices are determined by leveraging historical spatio-temporal correlations among the road network traffic data. Subsequently, unavailable traffic states are estimated from predictive distributions. The estimates are further pruned by kalman filter that corroborates online processing. With the SBL approach, experiments on PeMS traffic data demonstrate less than 6% Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) for a Signal Integrity (SI) of 0.5. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, this value is significantly better. BSBL approach gives similar error performance as SBL despite a SI of 0.26, at the cost of increased computational time. The NMAE from kalman filtered SBL (SBL+K) approach is less than 3.5% in contrast to 4.5% from kalman filtered BSBL (KBSBL) approach, thus demonstrating SBL+K approach as a good compromise between NMAE and computational time, facilitating more accurate online traffic state estimation.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles rely on sophisticated hardware and software technologies for acquiring holistic awareness of their immediate surroundings. Deep learning methods have effectively equipped modern self-driving cars with high levels of such awareness. However, their application requires high-end computational hardware, which makes utilization infeasible for the legacy vehicles that constitute most of today’s automotive industry. Hence, it becomes inherently challenging to achieve high performance while at the same time maintaining adequate computational complexity. In this paper, a monocular vision and scalar sensor-based model car is designed and implemented to accomplish autonomous driving on a specified track by employing a lightweight deep learning model. It can identify various traffic signs based on a vision sensor as well as avoid obstacles by using an ultrasonic sensor. The developed car utilizes a single Raspberry Pi as its computational unit. In addition, our work investigates the behavior of economical hardware used to deploy deep learning models. In particular, we herein propose a novel, computationally efficient, and cost-effective approach. The designed system can serve as a platform to facilitate the development of economical technologies for autonomous vehicles that can be used as part of intelligent transportation or advanced driver assistance systems. The experimental results indicate that this model can achieve real-time response on a resource-constrained device without significant overheads, thus making it a suitable candidate for autonomous driving in current intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Every year, approximately 350,000 vulnerable road users (VRU), like pedestrians and bicyclists, die due to collisions with vehicles. One approach for reducing this number of fatalities is using VRU collision avoidance systems, which aim at detecting and preventing possible collisions. Existing products for VRU collision avoidance systems using sensors mounted on vehicles may already decrease the number of accidents. However, these products require a line-of-sight between the vehicle and a VRU. Especially in urban environments, the line-of-sight between a vehicle and a VRU is often obstructed, e.g., by parked cars. Cooperative VRU collision avoidance systems promise to be a solution to this limitation. In such cooperative collision avoidance systems, the VRU is equipped with a portable device like a smartphone or a smartwatch. This allows exchanging the movement information between the vehicle and the VRU. However, one open question is how accurately such a system needs to recognize the movement of the VRU to achieve the necessary system performance. In this article, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how the accuracy of recognizing a pedestrian&#39; s movement influences the reliability of detecting collisions between the car and the pedestrian in cooperative VRU collision avoidance systems. We conduct this analysis for the “Car-to-Pedestrian Nearside” scenarios from the “Test protocol for Autonomous Emergency Braking VRU systems” of the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP).},

We propose an offline learning to analyze the correlation of all video frames in a reference path and to extract effective feature patches of key frames with an offline feature-shifts approach to achieve real-time place recognition. Our recognition results are on the basis of both the instant feature matching of frames and the historical recognition results which impose temporal logic constraints on the movement of a vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on different challenging datasets, especially for the case which requires a trade-off between the performance and the processing time. We believe that our FMPR offers a useful alternative to computationally expensive deep learning-based methods especially for applications with battery-powered or resource-limited devices.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) were initially designed to assist in traffic management and delivery of safety messages. Due to the significant evolution in modern vehicles, the features offered by VANETs have expanded to include comfort and entertainment relevant services. This expansion has further increased the need to secure them. The security of VANETs is mainly dependent on sharing a cryptographic group key confidentially. Due to the frequent change in group membership, there is a need to update the group key repeatedly, which is difficult in highly dynamic networks like VANETs. Therefore, designing a secure, scalable, and efficient group key management protocol is challenging. Existing group key management protocols introduce a variety of limitations, including high computational cost for both group key computation and retrieval, additional computational and communication overhead when the membership in the group changes, and collusion among receiving vehicles. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel group key management protocol, ALMS. Performance analysis reveals that, compared to existing protocols, ALMS is more scalable since it introduces a low computational overhead for both the Trusted Authority (TA) and the receiving vehicles. Also, it does not suffer from the key distribution limitation as symmetric key management protocols do. Moreover, ALMS introduces only a light overhead on the TA for group membership change. This is achieved by decoupling the initialization from group key computation and performing it offline without affecting the size of the encrypted group key.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AV) have advanced considerably over the past decade and their potential to reduce road accidents is without equal. That said, the evolution towards fully automated driving will be accompanied by new and unfamiliar risks. The deployment of AVs hinges on the premise that they are considerably safer than human drivers. However, the ability of manufacturers, insurers and regulators to quantifiably demonstrate this risk reduction, relative to humans, presents a major barrier. Based on accident rates, it will likely take hundreds of millions of autonomous miles to derive statistically meaningful results. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a novel means of quantifying AV accident risks by benchmarking against a more familiar and quantifiable risk - Human Behaviour. This method is used to proactively quantify AV safety relative to human drivers. Currently, anomalous driving behaviour stems from human susceptibilities such as fatigue or aggression. We exploit this observation and explore AV driving behaviour where driving anomalies are symptoms of technology errors. The comparative behaviours of AV and safe human driving can be used to measure AV accident risk. An end-to-end model AV is simulated using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to compare human and AV driving behaviours. Using a machine learning technique called Gaussian Processes (GP), contextual driving anomalies are detected, the frequency and severity of which are used to derive a risk score. This paper offers a starting point for addressing the challenges surrounding AV risk modelling.},

  abstract     = {In the context of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), this paper aims to examine the impacts of CAVs on mixed regular-automated traffic flow with the increase of the market penetration rate, in consideration of on-ramp merging and off-ramp diverging of vehicles. Lane changes are a major part of lateral motions, affecting surrounding vehicles locally and traffic flow collectively. On the basis of reinforcement learning technique, a cooperative lane-changing strategy was first developed to enable farsighted lane-changing behavior by CAVs in favor of traffic efficiency. The 3-lane highway stretch with one on-ramp and one off-ramp was applied in this study. With extensive simulations, the results suggest that the inclusion of CAVs considerably improves traffic flow, mean speed, and traffic capacity. Meanwhile, the existence of on/off-ramps has substantial impacts on the lane-changing processes. This work can shed some light on an aspect of the mixed traffic network dynamics for future mobility.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the stability of the vehicular platoon consisting of a leader and multiple cooperative autonomous driving followers. The objective of the platoon control is to ensure all vehicles traveling at the same speed while maintaining a safety spacing. To achieve the objective, a novel control framework consisting of the distributed adaptive event-triggered observer and the car-following control protocol is proposed for the vehicular platoon control. The condition that only few following vehicles can access the information of the leader is considered. In order to design controllers while avoid using any global information, such as the system matrix and the state of the leader, a distributed event-triggered observer is proposed, such that each vehicle can observe the dynamics of the leader. Based on this observer, both collision avoidance and limited communication source of each vehicle are simultaneously considered in the design of the observer. It is shown that under the proposed control framework, the platoon can achieve asymptotical stable, meanwhile, the amount of transmission data and communication cost among vehicles can be reduced. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to show the applicability of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {A paradigm shift towards agile and adaptive traffic signal control empowered with the massive growth of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is emerging rapidly for Intelligent Transportation Systems. Generally, an adaptive signal control system fine-tunes signal timing parameters based on pre-defined control hyperparameters using instantaneous traffic detection information. Once traffic pattern changes, those hyperparameters (e.g., maximum and minimum green times) need to be adjusted according to the evolution of traffic dynamics over a very short-term period. Such adjustment processes are usually conducted by professional and experienced traffic engineers. Here we present a human-in-the-loop parallel learning framework and its utilization in an end-to-end recommendation system that mimics and enhances professional signal control engineers&#39; behaviors. The system has been deployed into a real-world application for an extended period in Hangzhou, China, where signal control hyperparameters are recommended based on large-scale multidimensional traffic datasets. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in traffic efficiency through the use of our signal recommendation system.},

Thus, monitoring of abnormalities in every sensor is important for robust perception of the environment. Since it is difficult to obtain anomalous data, it is hard to develop a robust detection algorithm using only a relatively small number of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method for oversampling minority anomalies in lane detection. Using a generative adversarial network that makes the generator learn to estimate the distribution of anomalous data, it generates synthesized minority anomalies. The generated anomalies are used to train an anomaly detection network while minimizing latency for use in real situations. During training, the generated anomalies, with various mixed quality, are sampled differently according to their quality. This helps the detection network to be optimized with better quality data. Experimental result shows that when using the proposed anomaly detection framework for monitoring lane abnormality, it improves the performance by 12% when compared to the vanilla recurrent neural network.},

However, the majority of existing work centers on daytime scenes with favorable illumination and weather conditions, and relies on supervision with pixel-level annotations. This paper seeks to address the problem of semantic segmentation for rainy, night-time scenes without using pixel-level annotations. We introduce a near scene semantic approach that uses images of daytime scenes as a bridge for transferring knowledge from pre-trained segmentation models to rainy night images. Specifically, we first present near scene oriented Representation Adaptation (RA) to reduce the domain shift on the representation level. Next, we adapt the segmentation model from the daytime scenario, under varying weather conditions, to the rainy night scenario by using near scene oriented Segmentation Space Adaptation (SSA). Consequently, this further reduces the impact of the domain shift on the segmentation space level. For evaluation, we created a new dataset containing 7000 distinct daytime-night-time image pairs of near scenes obtained by a webcam, and 5266 daytime-rainy night image pairs collected by a car-mounted camera. In addition, we carefully annotated 226 rainy night images with classes defined in Cityscapes. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP) is a generalization of the well-known multiple traveling salesman problem. It utilizes colors to differentiate the accessibility of its cities to its salesmen. In our prior work, CTSPs are formulated over graphs associated with a city-color matrix. This work redefines a general colored traveling salesman problem (GCTSP) in the framework of hypergraphs and reveals several important properties of GCTSP. In GCTSP, the setting of city colors is richer than that in CTSPs. As results, it can be used to model and address various complex scheduling problems. Then, a Delaunay-triangulation-based Variable Neighborhood Search (DVNS) algorithm is developed to solve large-scale GCTSPs. At the beginning stage of DVNS, a divide and conquer algorithm is exploited to prepare a Delaunay candidate set for lean insertion. Next, the incumbent solution is perturbed by utilizing greedy multi-insertion and exchange mutation to obtain a variety of neighborhoods. Subsequently, 2-opt and 3-opt are used for local search in turn. Extensive experiments are conducted for many large scale GCTSP cases among which two maximal ones are up to 33000+ cities for 4 salesmen and 240 salesmen given 11000+ cities, respectively. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing four genetic algorithms and two VNS methods in terms of search ability and convergence rate.},

This study aims to provide a general framework for the testing scenario library generation (TSLG) problem with different operational design domains (ODDs), CAV models, and performance metrics. Given an ODD, the testing scenario library is defined as a critical set of scenarios that can be used for CAV test. Each testing scenario is evaluated by a newly proposed measure, scenario criticality, which can be computed as a combination of maneuver challenge and exposure frequency. To search for critical scenarios, an auxiliary objective function is designed, and a multi-start optimization method along with seed-filling is applied. Theoretical analysis suggests that the proposed framework can obtain accurate evaluation results with much fewer number of tests, if compared with the on-road test method. In part II of the study, three case studies are investigated to demonstrate the proposed method. Reinforcement learning based technique is applied to enhance the searching method under high-dimensional scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a fuel efficient vehicle speed control strategy for a connected and autonomous vehicle to pass the intersection (the eco-approach application). A control framework is developed to integrate traffic prediction (enabled by connectivity) and speed optimization. The traffic prediction is based on traffic flow model and can be applied to mixedtraffic scenarios where both connected and non-connected vehicles are on the road. Real-time information from connected vehicles and signal lights provides `partial&#39; measurement of the traffic states. The unknown traffic states are estimated using an observer (Unscented Kalman Filter). Uncertainties in the traffic prediction are systematically considered during the vehicle speed optimization to improve the robustness of the optimal control. Effects of powertrain states (the transmission gear ratio) on fuel consumption are considered as well. The vehicle speed optimization problem is real-time implementable using an efficient nonlinear programming solver. The optimal speed control strategy is evaluated in both a simulated traffic scenario and a real-world traffic scenario. In the simulated traffic scenario, fuel benefits vary from 5.3% to 9.4% as the penetration rate of connectivity increases. This is satisfactory compared to 11.7% fuel benefits with perfect traffic prediction. In the realworld traffic scenario, experimental results show that 6.9% fuel benefits can be achieved with two connected preceding vehicles and 11.2% fuel benefits can be obtained with perfect prediction. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the traffic prediction and the optimal vehicle speed control strategy.},

The current slip controllers typically correctly work during the regular train run. However, there are some cases when some slip controllers may fail. The correct operation at low velocities is one of the cases in which the slip controller can fail. The long-time response of the velocity measurement that is caused by incremental encoders with a low number of pulses per revolution is causing the problem in this case. The wheel slippage can occur when the adhesion conditions are adverse, and applied forces are high in this case. This paper describes a novel slip controller based on the unscented Kalman filter that correctly works during the train low velocity operation with any adhesion conditions. The slip controller was designed with taking into account all aspects that influence the controller operation. Therefore, the adhesion, electric drive, the slip controller, and problem background are described in the paper. The slip controller functionality is verified on measured data and a mathematical model that was verified on the measured data.},

RiLLD-Net can handle most common scenes of lane line detection.

The proposed model generates a set of speed profiles using the basic information of the bus trip: trip time, trip length, and distances between successive bus stops. The generated speed profiles could accurately reflect the various traffic conditions and speed behaviors of real-world situations. Roadway Level of Service (LoS) is incorporated in the proposed model to simulate different traffic conditions. Further, a stochastic model for the bus speed profile is adopted to simulate the probability of the bus to stop at each on-route designated stop. The generated speed profiles are then inputted to an accurate EBEC model that considers the route topography, auxiliary loads (lighting, sound, and radio systems) and the impact of the weather conditions. The operation of the heat, ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) is also incorporated in the model using the thermal mass balance principle. Using the proposed model, the characteristics of EBEC on a given route can be evaluated through generating a set of speed profiles for the studied route. The proposed model provides transit network planners with a useful tool to appropriately design electric-based transit networks when there is a lack or unavailability of real-time and high resolution data.},

Via mathematical analysis and comprehensive simulation studies under an optimal control framework, the work has revealed a capacity-drop-related mechanism that MTFC and ramp metering are based on to take effects, and obtained a number of important conclusions: (1) applications of any control measure (RM, MTFC, or RM+MTFC) in freeways are justified by the existence of capacity drop in field; (2) an appropriate usage of the control measures can effectively prevent the activation of potential bottlenecks on freeways and hence avoid capacity drop; (3) any control measure is beneficial for a large majority of the driver population in a freeway network if it can manage to increase the accumulated total network exit flow; (4) it is a common misconception that ramp metering would simply transfer traffic loads from the freeway mainstream to on-ramps.

This paper proposes a Smart Black Box (SBB) to augment traditional low-bandwidth data logging with value-driven high-bandwidth data capture. The SBB caches short-term histories of data as buffers through a deterministic Mealy machine based on data value and similarity. Compression quality for each frame is determined by optimizing the trade-off between value and storage cost. With finite storage, prioritized data recording discards low-value buffers to make room for new data. This paper formulates SBB compression decision making as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem with novel value metrics and filtering. The SBB has been evaluated on a traffic simulator which generates trajectories containing events of interest (EOIs) and corresponding first-person view videos. SBB compression efficiency is assessed by comparing storage requirements with different compression quality levels and event capture ratios. Performance is evaluated by comparing results with a traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) recording scheme. Deep learning performance on images recorded at different compression levels is evaluated to illustrate the reproducibility of SBB recorded data.},

This paper presents a new unconventional intersection design to improve the operational efficiency of the intersections with limited traffic lanes and short distance for vehicular queuing, such as the intersections on collector roads. The new design combines the advantage of the tandem control and exit-lanes for left-turn control (CTE). An optimization model is established to maximize the capacity of the intersection under the CTE design in which the allocation of the mixed-usage lane, lane markings, and signal timings are integrated. A case study and extensive numerical analysis are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Comparisons are made between the proposed CTE design and the other three designs, namely the tandem design, exit-lanes for left-turn design, and conventional design, under different geometric and traffic demand cases. The results show that CTE design has promising property when the left turn ratio is low to medium (&lt;; 50%), and the queue length is limited (&lt;; 200m).},

  abstract     = {Mobile telematics is a relatively new innovation that involves collecting data on driving behavior using the internal sensors in a smartphone rather than from an in-vehicle data recorder. However, telematics data are usually not labeled, which makes extracting driving patterns from them very difficult. Therefore, unsupervised learning algorithms play an important role in this field. In addition, most current research is based on datasets developed in a laboratory or from site investigations and questionnaires, which are very different from real-world driving behaviors. To advance unsupervised learning techniques in this field, and to fill the gap in findings based on real-world data, we have developed an unsupervised pattern recognition framework for mobile telematics data. The framework comprises three main components: a self-organizing map, a nine-layers deep auto-encoder, and partitive clustering algorithms. The SOM algorithm reduces the complexity of the data, the deep auto-encoder extracts the features, and the clustering algorithm groups driving events with similar patterns into behaviors. Further, given clustering with mobile telematics data is an under-researched area, we undertook an empirical comparison of five well-known clustering algorithms to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each method and which is best suited to categorizing driving styles. The study was conducted with a real-world insurance dataset containing 500,000 journeys by 2500 drivers, and the results were evaluated against three measures- Davis Boulding, Calinski Harabasz, and execution time. Overall, we find that k-means clustering and a self-organizing map were able to extract more accurate patterns than others. A statistical analysis of the 29 clusters produced by SOM and k-means, revealed 29 unique driving styles, all of which can be found in the transportation literature. The results from the study, with support from the corresponding literature review, demonstrate the efficacy of the presented framework in unsupervised settings. Additionally, the results provide a basis for developing a future risk analysis and automatic decision support system for usage-based insurance companies.},

  abstract     = {In general, proposed solutions for LiDAR-based localization used in autonomous cars require expensive sensors and computationally expensive mapping processes. Moreover, the global localization for autonomous driving is converging to the use of maps. Straightforward strategies to reduce the costs are to produce simpler sensors and use maps already available on the Internet. Here, an analysis is presented to show how simple can a LiDAR sensor be without degrading the localization accuracy that uses road and satellite maps together to globally pose the car. Three characteristics of the sensor are evaluated: the number of range readings, the amount of noise in the LiDAR readings, and the frame rate, with the aim of finding the minimum number of LiDAR lines, the maximum acceptable noise and the sensor frame rate needed to obtain an accurate position estimation. The analysis is performed using an autonomous car in complex field scenarios equipped with a 3D LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E. Several experiments were conducted reducing the number of frames, the number of scans per 3D point-cloud and artificially adding up to 15% of error in the ray length. Among other results, we found that using only 4 vertical lines per scan and with an artificial error added up to 15% of the ray length, the car was capable to localize itself within 2.11 meters error average. All experimental results and the followed methodology are explained in detail herein.},

This approach leads to interesting model interpretations in terms of traffic state transition and propagation, which form a basis for extending the proposed forecasting model.

First, an event-triggering communication scheme is proposed to enhance the efficiency of network resource utilization while counteracting the impact of aperiodic DoS attacks on the USV control system performance. Second, an event-based switched USV control system is presented to account for the simultaneous presence of communication delays, disturbance, faults, and DoS jamming attacks. Third, by using the piecewise Lyapunov functional (PLF) approach, criteria for exponential stability analysis and co-design of a desired observer-based fault detection filter and an event-triggered controller are derived and expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method. The results show that this method not only ensures the safe and stable operation of the USV but also reduces the amount of data transmissions.},

The proposed method combines model-based signal filtering and anomaly detection methods. Specifically, we use adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) to smooth sensor readings of a CAV based on a nonlinear car-following model. Using the car-following model the subject vehicle (i.e., the following vehicle) utilizes the leading vehicle&#39;s information to detect sensor anomalies by employing previously-trained One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) models. This approach allows the AEKF to estimate the state of a vehicle not only based on the vehicle&#39;s location and speed, but also by taking into account the state of the surrounding traffic. A communication time delay factor is considered in the car-following model to make it more suitable for real-world applications. Our experiments show that compared with the AEKF with a traditional x 2 -detector, our proposed method achieves a better anomaly detection performance. We also demonstrate that a larger time delay factor has a negative impact on the overall detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in information and communication technologies have led to the ubiquitous use of mobile sensing devices, such as smartphones and vehicle trackers, to obtain high-resolution movement data of commercial vehicles during the conduct of freight studies. Using a digital data collection platform known as the Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) platform, an ongoing commercial vehicle survey was conducted to collect the stop activity and movement information of heavy goods vehicles operating within Singapore. However, despite the successful recruitment of 1,662 drivers who verified their stop activities as part of the survey, a majority of the stops recorded are left unverified with the verified stops showing a significant imbalance between the different activity types reported. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to develop an activity prediction model using the temporal, sequential, contextual, and environmental features collected through the FMS platform, as well as point-of-interest information from Open Street Map. The proposed model was developed based on a gradient boosting approach and supplemented with different data resampling techniques to address the issue of class imbalance. By integrating the proposed model into the FMS platform, the activity-related fields of the survey can be pre-populated to reduce respondent burden and improve the completion rates of future surveys. The activity prediction model can also be used to recover the activity information from the unverified stops collected through the FMS platform, leading to an increased understanding of the movement and parking behaviours of commercial vehicles operating within Singapore.},

It is therefore necessary to detect traffic objects in front of the trains and inform the driver to take timely action. To detect these objects in railways, we proposed an object-detection method using a differential feature fusion convolutional neural network (DFF-Net). DFF-Net includes two modules: the prior object-detection module and the object-detection module. The prior module produces initial anchor boxes for the subsequent detection module. Taking the initial anchor boxes as input, the object-detection module applies a differential feature fusion sub-module to enrich the sematic information for object detection, enhancing the detection performance, particularly for small objects. In experiments conducted on a railway traffic dataset, compared with the current state-of-the-art detectors, the proposed method exhibited significant higher performance and was more effective and more efficient than the other methods for object detection in railway tracks. Additionally, evaluation results based on PASCAL VOC2007 and VOC2012 indicated that the proposed method was significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of “what to fuse”, “when to fuse”, and “how to fuse” remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we provide tables that summarize topics and methods.

Unfortunately, the semantics in the spatial layout (e.g., social interactions and properties of the locations) are ignored, leading to inaccuracies in discovering the ridesharing groups. Meanwhile, the destinations manually entered by users impact the accuracy of matching, as these addresses are usually not available in a road network or are not optimal for passenger pickup. This is particularly true when a passenger travels in a less familiar place. Given a set of passengers and the distribution of their destination, our approach is to compute the ridesharing matching between passengers. The raw GPS trajectories can be characterized by a combination of time constraints, traffic environments, and social activities. We first developed a PrefixSpan-prediction using a partial matching (P-PPM) destination-prediction algorithm to mine the frequent movement patterns from the trajectory data and determine the confidence of the movement rules. Our method uses the total travel time as the matching objective. Our approach is superior to the baseline methods in terms of accuracy (increased from 46% to 80%). We have also achieved significant improvements on other metrics, such as users&#39; saved travel distance. We demonstrated that using our proposed method, a group of passengers could save over 19% of total travel miles, which shows that the ridesharing scheme could be effective.},

  abstract     = {Fully convolutional network is a powerful tool for per-pixel semantic segmentation/detection. However, it is problematic when coping with crack detection using partially accurate ground truths (GTs): the network may easily converge to the status that treats all the pixels as background (BG) and still achieves a very good loss, named “All Black” phenomenon, due to the unavailability of accurate GTs and the data imbalance. To tackle this problem, we propose crack-patch-only (CPO) supervised generative adversarial learning for end-to-end training, which forces the network to always produce crack-GT images while reserves both crack and BG-image translation abilities by feeding a larger-size crack image into an asymmetric U-shape generator to overcome the “All Black” issue. The proposed approach is validated using four crack datasets; and achieves state-of-the-art performance comparing with that of the recently published works in efficiency and accuracy.},

Flow observability is essential for freeway traffic modeling, surveillance, and control. It is a longstanding and tricky issue to estimate flows for unmeasured ramp pairs. This problem seems to be hardly tractable in conventional approaches, and this paper intends to handle it based on machine learning. The work was partially inspired by transfer learning. Consider that no measurements are available for a target ramp pair, and the knowledge about ramp flow estimation may be drawn from other (measured) ramp pairs, provided that measured and unmeasured ramp pairs would share similarities in some key traffic flow patterns. Two simple machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM), were employed to this end. RF and GBM were driven by real measurement data to establish models that relate ramp flows to adjacent mainstream traffic conditions. The models were then applied for our task. The estimation performance was evaluated using real measurement data from the Shanghai Urban Expressway and the Intercity Highway in California, with satisfactory results obtained.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification supports cross-camera tracking and the location of specific vehicles in a smart city. The gallery images of vehicles are ranked based on the similarities in the appearance of objects to a vehicle query image. Previous work on vehicle re-identification has mainly focused on global or local analyses of predefined regions of vehicles to classify the vehicle images with a softmax loss function. On the one hand, separate global or predefined local regions of vehicles are often sensitive to perspective and occlusions. On the other hand, the embedding space supervised by the softmax loss function is not sufficiently compact for the object class. To solve these problems, we propose an end-to-end distance-based global and partial multi-regional deep network (DGPM) that combines multi-regional features to identify global and local differences. We exploit a three-branch architecture to learn the global and partial features from coarsely partitioned regions. A global similarity module is introduced to reduce the background information interference in the local branches. Unlike general classification, we design a distance-based classification layer that maintains consistency among criteria for similarity evaluation. Furthermore, we use spatiotemporal vehicle information to improve the vehicle re-identification results when the camera and shooting time are available. Systematic comparative evaluations performed on the large-scale VeRi and VehicleID datasets showed that our approach robustly achieved state-of-the-art performance. For instance, for the VeRi dataset, we achieve (79.39 + 2.78)% mAP and (96.19 + 2.26)% Rank-1 accuracy.},

A cascade of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers is then applied for text recognition. Firstly, a novel proposal generator for the code localization is introduced by integrating convolutional layers producing HOG-like (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features into a CNN. The proposals are then filtered using a deep network. After the code is localized, character detection and recognition are carried out using two separate deep CNNs.

  abstract     = {Connected vehicles have been considered as an effective solution to enhance driving safety as they can be well aware of nearby environments by exchanging safety beacons periodically. However, under dynamic traffic conditions, especially for dense-vehicle scenarios, the naive beaconing scheme where vehicles broadcast beacons at a fixed rate with a fixed transmission power can cause severe channel congestion and thus degrade the beaconing reliability. In this paper, by considering the kinematic status and beaconing rate together, we study the rear-end collision risk and define a danger coefficient ρ to capture the danger threat of each vehicle being in the rear-end collision. In specific, we propose a fully distributed adaptive beacon control scheme, called ABC, which makes each vehicle actively adopt a minimal but sufficient beaconing rate to avoid the rear-end collision in dense scenarios based on individually estimated ρ. With ABC, vehicles can broadcast at the maximum beaconing rate when the channel medium resource is enough and meanwhile keep identifying whether the channel is congested. Once a congestion event is detected, an NP-hard distributed beacon rate adaptation (DBRA) problem is solved with a greedy heuristic algorithm, in which a vehicle with a higher ρ is assigned with a higher beaconing rate while keeping the total required beaconing demand lower than the channel capacity. We prove the heuristic algorithm&#39;s close proximity to the optimal result and thoroughly analyze the communication overhead of ABC scheme. By using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)-generated vehicular traces, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed ABC scheme. Simulation results show that vehicles can adapt beaconing rates according to the driving safety demand, and the beaconing reliability can be guaranteed even under high-dense vehicle scenarios.},

To handle these problems, a Dynamic Transition Convolutional Neural Network (DTCNN) is proposed for the purpose of precise traffic demand prediction. Particularly, a transition network is first constructed according to the citiwide historical departure and arrival records, where the nodes are virtual stations discovered by a density-peak based clustering algorithm and the edges of two nodes correspond to transition flows of two stations. Then, a dynamic transition convolution unit is designed to model the spatial distributions of the traffic demands, and to capture the evolution of the demand dynamics. Last, a unifying learning framework is provided to incorporate the spatiotemporal states of the traffic demands with environmental factors. Experiments have been conducted on NYC taxi and bike-sharing data, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This paper proposes a self-adaptive clustering system for ensuring a suitable trade-off between data aggregation (over the cellular network) and communication congestion due to cluster management (within the V2V network). The system&#39;s algorithms use a distributive justice approach for selecting cluster heads, to improve fairness among car drivers and hence help the social acceptability of self-adaptive clustering. Simulation results show that this approach significantly improves fairness over time without affecting network performance.

The main advantage of the proposed methods is that they are model-free. The methods are based on exploiting the phenomenon of critical slowing down which occurs in dynamical systems near certain types of bifurcations, such as traffic jams. One can forecast the onset of traffic jams and the dynamics of the traffic after the bifurcation by using a few traffic measurements before the tipping point occurs. The measurements required for forecasting are recorded dynamical features of the system such as headways between cars in traffic, velocity or accelerations of each car. Forecasting approaches are applied to several simulated and experimental traffic flow conditions. Results show that one can successfully predict the onset of traffic jams and the traffic dynamics after this critical point using the proposed approaches while no model of the system is required.},

However, finding such routes is computationally difficult due to the huge solution space constituted by billions of possible routes. Considering the limited scalability of exact search methods, heuristic search methods were proposed to boost the efficiency and incorporate flexible constraints. Nevertheless, the existing methods conceal multiple criteria in an objective, and thus evaluating the performance of the generated route becomes challenging due to the lack of comparable alternatives. Inspired by the prior study, we formulate the definition of pareto-optimal transit routes based on multiple criteria. However, extracting these routes remains challenging because: A) the sheer volume of possible transit routes; and B) the sparsity of pareto-optimal routes. We address these challenges by developing an efficient search framework: for challenge A, a random search method is developed based on Monte Carlo tree search where the unproductive solution subspaces are pruned progressively to reduce the search cost; and for challenge B, an estimation method is derived to guide the search process by assessing the value for each solution subspace. The superior effectiveness of our approach in approximating the pareto-optimal transit routes was demonstrated by the comprehensive evaluation based on the real-world data.},

Specifically, a route-based TSP model (R-TSP) and its local version (L-TSP) are formulated. Timing and progression deviations are introduced as a simple and novel way to approximate the TSP impacts on passenger vehicle delays. An online adaptive TSP system is developed to leverage the continuous availability of CV data to monitor bus priority needs, trigger new formulations of the TSP models wwithith newly updated bus running data, and implement new signal timings in real-time. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate a variety of R-TSP and L-TSP model variants to understand their respective effectiveness to improve bus schedule adherence and their impacts to other traffic. Simulation study on a hypothetical corridor show that an R-TSP model variant with both timing and progression deviation defined can improve a 100% late bus fleet to 98.4% of on-time arrival with only 5.5% increase in passenger car delays. In comparison, none of the L-TSP models could produce comparable benefits for buses and caused too much delay on passenger vehicles. These simulation studies conclude that (1) connected vehicle technologies provide critical data to allow route-based TSP model to be formulated simply and solved continuously, and (2) granting bus priority at route level is much more beneficial than only providing bus priority on a signal by signal basis.},

  abstract     = {Now more than ever, monitoring railway track geometry from in-service vehicles is an attractive proposition that ensures improved infrastructure performance without interrupting railway operations. Communicating the collected sensors-data to a central server has always been an issue due to the current GSM-R and LTE data-rate and spectrum limitations. The prospect of opportunistic access to an inefficiently utilised frequency spectrum, known as TV White Spaces (TVWS), is proposed to solve the spectrum scarcity problem that exploits desirable railway propagation characteristics. In order to provide full protection for the spectrum primary users, IEEE 802.22 standard sets strict policies on the mobile platforms. This research proposes a novel handover scheme that utilises a greedy algorithm to select the operational frequency channels. The scheme takes into account; the train&#39;s trajectory, including the possibility of train delays, and coexistence issues between the spectrum&#39;s secondary users. A case study of two trains reporting their collected maintenance data to 3 Access Points (APs) while travelling between Selly Oak and New Street Station, Birmingham, UK is presented. For high channels availability (≥40%), an average of 30 megabytes of extra track data can be transmitted using the new approach for an 8 min journey. In addition, a single channel can be used in the new approach for an average consecutive distance of 1.05 km compared with an average of 0.58 km for IEEE 802.22 standard. Both systems provide identical interference performance with more transmission power that can reach up to 42.2 dBm allowed under the new scheme.},

Recently, various deep learning methods, such as convolution neural network (CNN), have shown promising performance in traffic prediction. However, it samples traffic data in regular grids as the input of CNN, thus it destroys the spatial structure of the road network. In this paper, we introduce a graph network and propose an optimized graph convolution recurrent neural network for traffic prediction, in which the spatial information of the road network is represented as a graph. Additionally, distinguishing with most current methods using a simple and empirical spatial graph, the proposed method learns an optimized graph through a data-driven way in the training phase, which reveals the latent relationship among the road segments from the traffic data. Lastly, the proposed method is evaluated on three real-world case studies, and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art traffic prediction methods.},

The past few years have witnessed much progress on the research of pedestrian detection methods, especially through the successful use of the deep learning based techniques. However, occlusion and large scale variation remain the challenging issues for pedestrian detection. In this work, we propose a Part-Aware Multi-Scale Fully Convolutional Network (PAMS-FCN) to tackle these difficulties. Specifically, we present a part-aware Region-of-Interest (RoI) pooling module to mine body parts with different responses, and select the part with the strongest response via voting. As such, a partially visible pedestrian instance can receive a high detection confidence score, making it less likely to become a missing detection. This module operates in parallel with an instance RoI pooling module to combine local parts and global context information. To handle vast scale variation, we construct a fully convolutional network in which multi-scale feature maps are generated efficiently, and small-scale and large-scale pedestrians are detected separately. By integrating these structures, the proposed detector achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Caltech, KITTI, INRIA and ETH pedestrian detection datasets.},

In fact, indicators on the road geometry, the actuation redundancy, the optimal velocity profile, and the driving mode are evaluated for each segment of the URV&#39;s trajectory. To reach this objective, a power consumption estimation model is developed for the URV. Due to the presence of unknown dynamic parameters of the URV and uncertainties about its interaction with the environment, an artificial intelligence (AI) technique, based on data-learning qualitative method, is used for the power consumption estimation, namely Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The ANFIS model is obtained using trained data from a Real URV dynamics. Then, an energy digraph is built with all feasible configurations taking into account the kinematic and dynamic constraints based on a 3D grid map setup, according to velocity, arc-length, and driving mode. In this weighted directed graph, the edges describe the consumed energy by the URV along a segment of a trajectory. The vertices describe the start and end points of each segment. Subsequently, an optimization algorithm is applied on the digraph to get a global optimal solution combining driving mode, power consumption, and velocity profile of the URV. The obtained results are compared with the dynamic programming method for global offline optimization. Finally, the obtained simulation and experimental results, applied on RobuCar URV, highlight the effectiveness of the proposed energy planning.},

Inspired by researches on the steering estimation, this paper proposes a novel loss function to train a high-performance end-to-end model for handling the imbalanced training problem, which is named SteeringLoss. Firstly, the imbalanced distribution of the steering value for driving datasets is analyzed, which is similar to the double long-tailed distribution. Secondly, with the feature of distribution, this paper designs a cost-sensitive loss function step by step, the new loss function can improve the impact of the sharp steering value while maintaining the impact of the small steering value. Thirdly, three typical steering estimation models are established with SteeringLoss for demonstration, including the CNN model, the CNN-LSTM model and the 3DCNN-LSTM model. Finally, three experiments are designed for SteeringLoss: Experiment I demonstrates SteeringLoss can avoid imbalanced training problem; Experiment II discusses the finetuning principle of SteeringLoss and gives the basic guideline for using SteeringLoss; Experiment III shows the results on different typical end-to-end steering estimation models, which shows effectiveness of SteeringLoss for all the models and gives different solutions for the steering estimation. Moreover, the SteeringLoss is suitable for the imbalanced training with similar distributions of datasets besides end-to-end steering estimation, which indicates the potential value of the research on SteeringLoss in the future.},

In recent years, GPS-based identification is gradually replacing the conventional survey-based information-gathering process due to the more detailed and precise data on individual&#39;s travel patterns. Nonetheless, existing research suffers from deficient feature selection, high data dimensionality, and data under-utilization issues. In this work, we propose a novel travel mode identification mechanism based on discrete wavelet transform and recent developments of deep learning techniques. The proposed mechanism aims to take GPS trajectories of arbitrary lengths to develop accurate travel mode results in both global and online identification scenarios. In this mechanism, raw GPS data is first pre-processed to compute preliminary motion and displacement attributes, which are input into a tailor-made deep neural network. Discrete wavelet transform is also adopted to further extract time-frequency domain characteristics of the trajectories to assist the neural network in the classification task. To evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism, a series of comprehensive case studies are conducted. The results indicate that the mechanism can notably outperform existing travel mode identifications on a same data set with minuscule computation time. Furthermore, an architecture test is performed to determine the best-performing structure for the proposed mechanism. Lastly, we demonstrate the capability of the mechanism in handling online identifications, and the performance sensitivity of the selected attributes is evaluated.},

More specifically, this paper develops two novel probabilistic models assuming correlated Gumbel noises and latent utility functions. One is based on shallow Gaussian priors and the other assumes deep Gaussian priors. In the active learning algorithm, the next-to-compare decision is determined by an original acquisition function. The proposed algorithm and models have been benchmarked using functions with multiple local optima and one public airline itinerary dataset. In both experiments, nests are designed to capture correlated Gumbel noises. The experiments indicate the effectiveness of our active learning algorithm and models. The deep Gaussian models are proven to find the best choice with a lower number of pairwise comparisons than the shallow one. In both experiments, deep Gaussian models outperform the shallow model. The shallow model is recommended when the choice set is large and less computational time is required (e.g. in one experiment, deep Gaussian models require approximately 60%-70% more time on average).},

  abstract     = {Accurate localization is a crucial step for intelligent vehicles (IVs). And vision-based localization methods are promising due to its good accuracy and low cost. However, vision-based methods are usually not robust enough due to the errors of matching similar road scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a visual map-based localization method, called multi-view site matching (MVSM). We proposed using two camera views (i.e., downward-view and front-view) to construct visual map. The visual map consists of a serial of nodes. Each node encodes the features of the road, the 2D structure, and the poses of the vehicle. Based on the constructed visual map, we proposed a multi-scale method for accurate vehicle localization. In coarse localization, we adopt a topological model to obtain a set of candidate nodes from visual map. Furthermore, holistic features from front view are matched within the candidates such that the best matched node is determined for image-level localization. In metric localization, the best matched is first verified with the local features from downward view. And the vehicle pose is finally computed by utilizing the 2D structure from the verified nodes in the map. In the experiment, the proposed MVSM method has been tested with actual field data covering different pavement types in different seasons. The proposed MVSM method can achieve less than 0.20m mean localization errors. Compared to existing vision-based methods, the proposed method utilizes two views to enhance image-level localization and 2D pavement structure to improve metric localization so as to greatly improve the overall localization performance.},

  abstract     = {Mobile network operators are interested in providing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication services using their cellular infrastructure. Regional split of operators is one possible approach to support multi-operator infrastructure-based cellular V2V communication. In this approach, a geographical area is divided into non-overlapping regions, each one served by a unique operator. Its main drawback is the communication interruption motivated by the inter-operator handover in border areas, which prevents the fulfillment of the maximum end-to-end (E2E) latency requirements of fifth generation (5G) V2V services related to autonomous driving. In this work, we enable a fast inter-operator handover based on the pre-registration of the users on multiple operators, which substantially reduces the handover time to guarantee maximum E2E latency values of 100 ms in non-congested scenarios. To further reduce the latency of time-critical services to always less than 70 ms, even with the handover interruption time, while providing a latency around 20 ms in the majority of locations, we propose to complement the former technique with a mobile edge computing approach. Our proposal consists in the localization of application servers and broadcasting entities in all the base stations, to avoid the communication through the core network, together with the use of a new set of nodes in the base stations of cross-border areas called inter-operator relays, to minimize the communication latency between operators. Based on analytic and simulation results, it is demonstrated that the proposed techniques are effective to support low-latency infrastructure-based cellular V2V communications in multi-operator environments with regional split.},

The other is image segmentation for recognizing drivable areas and guiding the vehicle forward. For the latter, unlike those traditional image segmentation methods, image semantic segmentation based on deep learning architecture can handle the irregularly shaped road areas better, guiding a vehicle to drive in a more complex environment. With the popularity of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) in recent year, the traditional hand-crafted features methods have shown to be outperformed. However, deep CNN models are difficult to implement on vehicle application because the severe cost of time for complex processing. Although some proposed methods, such as Efficient neural network (Enet), achieved higher speed by removing some layers, it also led to the decrease of segmentation accuracy. In this research work, we propose a novel semantic segmentation network, Edgenet, which contains a class-aware edge loss module and a channel-wise attention mechanism, aiming to improve the accuracy with no harm to inference speed. We evaluate Edgenet on Cityscapes dataset, which is the most challenging and authoritative on-road semantic segmentation dataset.

This paper contributes to solving the challenges from the viewpoint of passengers by improving their on-vehicle experience. Specifically, we focus on the problem: Given an urban public transit network and a number of passengers, with some of them controllable and the rest uncontrollable, how can we plan for the controllable passengers to improve their experience in terms of their service preference? We formalize this problem as a multi-agent path planning (MAPP) problem with soft collisions, where multiple controllable passengers are allowed to share on-vehicle service resources with one another under certain constraints. We then propose a customized version of the SC-M* algorithm to efficiently solve the MAPP task for bus transit system in complex urban environments, where we have a large passenger size and multiple types of passengers requesting various types of service resources. We demonstrate the use of SC-M* in a case study of the bus transit system in Porto, Portugal. In the case study, we implement a data-driven on-vehicle experience simulator for the bus transit system, which simulates the passenger behaviors and on-vehicle resource dynamics, and evaluate the SC-M* on it. The experimental results show the advantages of the SC-M* in terms of path cost, collision-free constraint, and the scalability in run time and success rate.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the problem of optimally locating an automotive service firm (ASF) subject to stochastic customer demands, varying setup cost and regional constraints. The goal is to minimize the transportation cost while maintaining the specified profit of the ASF. This work studies two variants of the problem: ASF location with known demand probability distributions and with partial demand information, i.e., only the support and mean of the customer demands are known. For the former, a chance-constrained program is formulated that improves an existing model, and then an equivalent deterministic nonlinear program is constructed based on our property analysis results. For the latter, a novel distribution-free model is developed. The proposed models are solved by solver LINGO. Computational results on the benchmark examples show that: i) for the first variant, the proposed approach outperforms the existing one; ii) for the second one, the proposed distribution-free model can effectively handle stochastic customer demands without complete probability distributions; and iii) the results of the distribution-free model are slightly worse than those of the deterministic nonlinear one, but the former is more cost-efficient for the practical ASF location as it is less expensive in obtaining demand information. Moreover, the proposed models and approaches are extended to address a multi-ASF location allocation under demand uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {The early detection of a driver&#39;s intention prior to the initiation of actual maneuvering is to offer effective means of assisting the driver in times of safety. Conventional approaches in predicting a driver&#39;s intention include framing the motion parameters of the car and driver as well as the eye gaze sequence of the driver into the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for analysis. However, their power of describing driver behavior is not only limited but also their performance, indicated by the recognition rate relative to the amount of preceding time in early detection, is not satisfactory and needs further improvement. This paper presents an approach for early detection of a driver&#39;s intention by modeling and analyzing driver behavior by using structural pattern recognition based on context-free and context-sensitive grammars. We specifically structured a sequence of the driver&#39;s eye fixations as well as of the vehicle speed, steering angle and signaling into a sequence of symbolic vectors to form sentences representing a specific driver behavior. It turns out that the proposed approach resulted in an average of 70.5% and 80% recognition rates at the respective 2 and 1 second preceding time to the actual initiation of maneuvering behavior. This performance can be compared to 56.8% and 69% by the state-of-the-art conventional results.},

  abstract     = {Exiting from highways in crowded dynamic traffic is an important path planning task for autonomous vehicles (AVs). This task can be challenging because of the uncertain motion of surrounding vehicles and limited sensing/observing window. Conventional path planning methods usually compute a mandatory lane change (MLC) command, but the lane change behavior (e.g., vehicle speed and gap acceptance) should also adapt to traffic conditions and the urgency for exiting. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-enhanced highway-exit planner. The learning-based strategy learns from past failures and adjusts the vehicle motion when the AV fails to exit. The reinforcement learning is based on the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) approach. The proposed learning-enhanced highway-exit planner is tested 6000 times in stochastic simulations. The results indicate that the proposed planner achieves a higher probability of successful highway exiting than a benchmark MLC planner.},

In the centralized scheduling, an RSU schedules data dissemination using a hybrid of infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Specifically, RSUs cooperate with each other by transferring unserved requests, and each RSU schedules the data services based on its locally received requests and the transferred requests. In the decentralized scheduling, vehicles driving in opposite directions share the cached data items via V2V communication when out of the coverage of RSU. The ad hoc scheduling can be benefited from the cooperation among RSUs since the chance for V2V data sharing could be enhanced when considering transferred requests into scheduling at each RSU. We formulate a hybrid of centralized and ad hoc data scheduling (HCA) problem, aiming at best exploiting the synergistic effects of I2V and V2V communication based on centralized data broadcast and ad hoc data sharing. On this basis, we propose an RSU Cooperation-based Adaptive Scheduling (RCAS) algorithm that consists of three mechanisms, including a centralized scheduling mechanism at each RSU, an ad hoc scheduling mechanism for vehicles, and a cluster management mechanism. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed solution under a variety of circumstances.},

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety impacts of the VSL system implemented on Interstate 5 in Seattle, United States since 2010. A Full Bayesian (FB) before-after analysis was conducted based on 9,787 crashes that occurred in a 72-month study period. The analysis was conducted for all crashes, crash severity levels, crash types, and crash causes. The FB before-after results implied that the total crash count was reduced by 32.23% with a standard deviation of 3.58% after the VSL system was applied on the freeway. The count of crashes with no injury decreased more than crashes with severe injury and possible injury. The effect of rear-end crash reduction was the most beneficial among all crash types, while the effect on sideswipe crash reduction was the least. The study also compared the traffic speed features in the before and after periods to fully evaluate the impacts of the VSL system on traffic operations. The result indicated that, with VSL control, the difference in speed was reduced by the VSL system. The results of this study are particularly valuable for policy and control strategy development, and cost-benefit evaluation associated with VSL system implementations.},

  abstract     = {Data augmentation plays a crucial role in training a CNN-based detector. Most previous approaches were based on using a combination of general image-processing operations and could only produce limited plausible image variations. Recently, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) based methods have shown compelling visual results. However, they are prone to fail at preserving image-objects and maintaining translation consistency when faced with large and complex domain shifts, such as day-to-night. In this paper, we propose AugGAN, a GAN-based data augmenter which could transform on-road driving images to a desired domain while image-objects would be well-preserved. The contribution of this work is three-fold: (1) we design a structure-aware unpaired image-to-image translation network which learns the latent data transformation across different domains while artifacts in the transformed images are greatly reduced; (2) we quantitatively prove that the domain adaptation capability of a vehicle detector is not limited by its training data; (3) our object-preserving network provides significant performance gain in the difficult day-to-night case in terms of vehicle detection. AugGAN could generate more visually plausible images compared to competing methods on different on-road image translation tasks across domains. In addition, we quantitatively evaluate different methods by training Faster R-CNN and YOLO with datasets generated from the transformed results and demonstrate significant improvement on the object detection accuracies by using the proposed AugGAN model.},

Its core idea is to exploit generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to resolve the 3D cooperative positioning problem after converting it as a generalized linear mixing problem. Unfortunately, the positioning performance of 3D UCL is severely degraded by the inaccurate ranging measurements from the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links. Therefore, a 3D geographical information enhanced UCL (3D GIE-UCL) is developed by combining 3D UCL with a NLOS identification mechanism assisted by geographical information. Finally, 3D UCL is accelerated by graphics processing unit (GPU) parallelization, particle reduction and message censoring. 3D GIE-UCL is accelerated by particle reduction and anchor upgrading. Simulation results validate state-of-the-art positioning performances and cooperative gains of both 3D UCL and 3D GIE-UCL after comparing them with existing cooperative localizers. 3D GIE-UCL approaches to its performance upper bound provided by its correspondence with oracle link-type information. 3D UCL and GIE-UCL show 241× and 3.3× speedup after adopting the acceleration techniques, respectively.},

The integer linear programming method is used to build the green time extension and red time truncation models. In the proposed model, the optimization object includes two levels: the maximum priority effect for the first level and minimum time deviations for non-transit phases for the second level. Based on this, the semi-ring structure and the backward/forward migration time parameters of coordinated phases are further presented for establishing the constraints. The overall scheme is thoroughly tested and demonstrated in a realistic experimental scenario. Compared with the TSP scheme which takes the coordinated phase as the deadline for adjusting phases, the proposed method can maximize the priority effect by taking full advantage of the migration state of coordinated phases. Moreover, it also reduces the effects to non-transit phases by compensation and traffic-state-based compression mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient mutual interference suppression method using wavelet denoising in automotive radar systems. When a radar signal transmitted from another radar-equipped vehicle flows into our radar system, it acts as an interference signal and degrades the target detection performance. With wavelet denoising, the interference signal can be extracted from the time-domain low-pass filter output. Then, the effect of the interference can be mitigated by subtracting the interference signal from the original low-pass filter output. As a result, the beat frequency containing the target information can be estimated accurately. Simulation results show that the proposed method can enhance the estimation accuracy of the target&#39;s distance, velocity, and angle. In addition, the performance of the proposed method is verified through actual experiments using heterogeneous radars. In the measurement results, even though the exact specifications of the radar signal transmitted from the other vehicle are not identified, the interference is effectively suppressed. Unlike other existing methods, the proposed method using wavelet denoising does not need to generate a specific radar waveform and it can mitigate interference only by signal processing without changing the existing hardware.},

Challenges and opportunities of smartphone-based driving cycle synthesis are described. A frequency analysis presents differences in sampling rates and energy characteristics. It is shown that a sampling rate of 1Hz is sufficient to cover relevant dynamics for low-power electric two-wheelers (E2Ws). The driving behavior of E2Ws in Shanghai is used as a case study and analyzed by means of a data collection campaign. Based on a localized E2W driving cycle in Shanghai, a data collection strategy for improving driving cycles is proposed. In particular, the inclusion of data collection by smartphone and an offline data fusion with IMU data to improve energy predictions are presented. The derived method can help manufacturers to estimate energy consumption and improve the design process of localized driving cycles.},

  abstract     = {Object instance segmentation in traffic scenes is an important research topic. For training instance segmentation models, synthetic data can potentially complement real data, alleviating manual effort on annotating real images. However, the data distribution discrepancy between synthetic data and real data hampers the wide applications of synthetic data. In light of that, we propose a virtual-real interaction method for object instance segmentation. This method works over synthetic images with accurate annotations and real images without any labels. The virtual-real interaction guides the model to learn useful information from synthetic data while keeping consistent with real data. We first analyze the data distribution discrepancy from a probabilistic perspective, and divide it into image-level and instance-level discrepancies. Then, we design two components to align these discrepancies, i.e., global-level alignment and local-level alignment. Furthermore, a consistency alignment component is proposed to encourage the consistency between the global-level and the local-level alignment components. We evaluate the proposed approach on the real Cityscapes dataset by adapting from virtual SYNTHIA, Virtual KITTI, and VIPER datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Absolute positioning is an essential factor for the arrival of autonomous driving. At present, GNSS is the indispensable source that can supply initial positioning in the commonly used high definition map-based LiDAR point cloud positioning solution for autonomous driving. However, the non-light-of-sight (NLOS) reception dominates GNSS positioning performance in super-urbanized areas. The recent proposed 3D map aided (3DMA) GNSS can mitigate the majority of the NLOS caused by buildings. However, the same phenomenon caused by moving objects in urban areas is currently not modeled in the 3D geographic information system (GIS). Therefore, we present a novel method to exclude the NLOS receptions caused by a double-decker bus, one of the symbolic tall moving objects in road transportations. To estimate the dimension and orientation of the double-decker buses relative to the GNSS receiver, LiDAR-based perception is utilized. By projecting the relative positions into GNSS Skyplot, the direct transmission path of satellite signals blocked by the moving objects can be identified and excluded from positioning. Finally, GNSS positioning is estimated by the weighted least square (WLS) method based on the remaining satellites after the NLOS exclusion. Both static and dynamic experiments are conducted in Hong Kong. The results show that the proposed NLOS exclusion using LiDAR-based perception can greatly improve the GNSS single point positioning (SPP) performance.},

  abstract     = {Large scale 3D maps constructed via LiDAR sensor are widely used on intelligent vehicles for localization in outdoor scenes. However, loading, communication and processing of the original dense maps are time consuming for onboard computing platform, which calls for a more concise representation of maps to reduce the complexity but keep the performance of localization. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning paradigm to compress the 3D point cloud map. Specifically, we first find a subset of LiDAR points with high number of observations to preserve the localization performance, which is regarded as the teacher of map compression. An efficient optimization strategy is proposed to deal with the massive data in original map. With the supervision of compressed map, a student model is built by training a random forest model fed with geometric feature descriptors of each point. As a result, the student model is able to compress the map without referring to the expensive numerical optimization. Additionally, by incorporating the features, the innovative student model can be generalized to other new maps while no re-training is required. We conduct thorough experiments on multi-session dataset and KITTI dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning paradigm, and the comparison with other map compression methods. The final results show that the learned student model can achieve efficient map compression with comparable LiDAR based localization performance to the original map at the same time.},

  abstract     = {Although significant improvement has been achieved in fully autonomous driving and semantic high-definition map (HD) domains, most of the existing 3D point cloud segmentation methods cannot provide high representativeness and remarkable robustness. The principally increasing challenges remain in completely and efficiently extracting high-level 3D point cloud features, specifically in large-scale road environments. This paper provides an end-to-end feature extraction framework for 3D point cloud segmentation by using dynamic point-wise convolutional operations in multiple scales. Compared to existing point cloud segmentation methods that are commonly based on traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our proposed method is less sensitive to data distribution and computational powers. This framework mainly includes four modules. Module I is first designed to construct a revised 3D point-wise convolutional operation. Then, a U-shaped downsampling-upsampling architecture is proposed to leverage both global and local features in multiple scales in Module II. Next, in Module III, high-level local edge features in 3D point neighborhoods are further extracted by using an adaptive graph convolutional neural network based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Finally, in Module IV, a conditional random field (CRF) algorithm is developed for postprocessing and segmentation result refinement. The proposed method was evaluated on three large-scale LiDAR point cloud datasets in both urban and indoor environments. The experimental results acquired by using different point cloud scenarios indicate our method can achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance in feature representativeness, segmentation accuracy, and technical robustness.},

Taking the advantages of cooperative scheme, a residual decomposition method is used to model the measurement errors into common and specific parts, a greedy search strategy is used to exclude the faulty measurements based on its sub-statistics. Simulation results show that CIM has better detection of GNSS fault than traditional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM).

Fast and accurate detection of driver intervention is therefore of importance. In this article a novel driver intervention detection method for automated vehicles is presented and tested. Non-critical transitions are considered, excluding safety related applications. The transfer function between the electric power steering torque and steering column angle is estimated by perturbing the steering system with a known disturbance. This estimated value is used to detect whether a driver is intervening. The detection algorithm has been tested in simulations using a four degree-of-freedom vehicle model. The parameters of this vehicle model have been obtained via frequency response measurements performed on a test vehicle. Secondly, the performance of the algorithm has been tested with on-road measurements. The results show that driver intervention can be successfully detected within 0.4 seconds. The performance in terms of true and false detections has been analyzed, and the presented solution is shown to be robust to measurement noise and road disturbances.},

This paper presents a cascaded deep convolutional network for directly recognizing vehicle logos without depending on the existence of license plates. This is a two-stage processing framework composed of a region proposal network and a convolutional capsule network. First, potential region proposals that might contain vehicle logos are generated by the region proposal network. Then, the convolutional capsule network classifies these region proposals into the background and different types of vehicle logos. We have evaluated the proposed framework on a large test set towards vehicle logo recognition. Quantitative evaluations show that a detection rate, a recognition rate, and an overall performance of 0.987, 0.994, and 0.981, respectively, are achieved. Comparative studies with the Faster R-CNN and other three existing methods also confirm that the proposed method performs effectively and robustly in recognizing vehicle logos of various conditions.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the increasing need of the real-world patrolling, this paper studies a practical city-scale patrolling (CSP) variant. In CSP, the police are scheduled to patrol city regions, and the objective is not only to protect public security but also to respond to incidents timely. We use an integer program (IP) to formulate the CSP problem, with the objective of maximizing the police visibility rate (PVR) to improve public safety and the additional constraint of response time guarantee to handle incidents timely. For such an NP-hard problem, existing studies either cannot scale-up or do not provide a bound from optimum. To fill the research gap, we propose a decomposition and grafting approach. We first decompose the original CSP into two weakly-coupled subproblems, minimizing police problem (MinP) and maximizing PVR (MaxP) problem. By exploiting the subproblem structures, a polynomial time approximation algorithm is proposed for MinP, and a polynomial time optimal algorithm is proposed for MaxP. We prove that such a decomposition can provide the 1 - α approximation ratio, where α is the percentage of the police used in MinP. To further improve patrolling efficiency, a grafting mechanism is proposed to integrate the two subproblems&#39; solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the real dataset of Foshan, a modern Chinese city. The results demonstrate that compared with benchmarks, our approach scales well to city-scale problem instances with fine-grained periods, hundreds of regions, and hundreds of police officers.},

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) a probability frontend framework for the alignment of point clouds using the local point cloud surface variance as the weight of registration, which modifies registration failure caused by the lack of features in sparse point clouds, (2) a robust submap-based strategy for loop closure detection and back-end optimization under sparse point clouds, and (3) a modified PointNet model for classifying the point clouds of underground parking lots into four categories: ceiling, floor, wall, others.

For these reasons, the use of deep learning for vehicle control is becoming increasingly popular. Although important advancements have been achieved in this field, these works have not been fully summarised. This paper surveys a wide range of research works reported in the literature which aim to control a vehicle through deep learning methods. Although there exists overlap between control and perception, the focus of this paper is on vehicle control, rather than the wider perception problem which includes tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. The paper identifies the strengths and limitations of available deep learning methods through comparative analysis and discusses the research challenges in terms of computation, architecture selection, goal specification, generalisation, verification and validation, as well as safety.

A connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) is an AV with vehicle connectivity capability, which enhances the situational awareness of the AV and enables the cooperation between AVs. Hence, CAV technology can enhance the capabilities and robustness of AV to be a promising transportation solution in the future. This paper introduces a representative architecture of CAVs and surveys the latest research advances, methods, and algorithms for sensing, perception, planning, and control of CAVs.

Furthermore, the implementations and impact of vehicle connectivity and the corresponding consequential challenges of cooperative perception, complex connected decision making, and multi-vehicle controls are summarized and their significant research issues enumerated. Most importantly, the critical review in this paper provides a list and discussion of the remaining challenges and unsolved problems of CAVs in each Section which would be helpful to researchers in the field.

  abstract     = {Power simulation of lithium ion battery through battery model is of great significance for dynamic response simulation, heat generation calculation and charge-discharge strategy development. The accuracy and applicability of the model become crucial. In order to demonstrate the battery transient characteristics more effectively, a novel identification method for parameters of the 2 nd order RC equivalent circuit model was proposed. Based on the derived evolution law of battery transient characteristics under the continuous pulse excitation, four feature points are extracted for parameter identification in each cycle. The proposed method reduced the time cost of identification from 11796.88s to 0.06s while ensuring that the error of voltage doesn&#39;t exceed 2.2mV. In order to verify the power profiles applicability of the proposed method, applicability analysis of power profile for different identification methods was carried out including the methods using different amount of data (4N points, 200 points, 6000 points) under unidirectional current pulse excitation (UCPE), bidirectional current pulse excitation (BCPE) and unidirectional voltage pulse excitation (UVPE). It was illustrated that the identification process using data of multiple cycles could significantly reduce errors, including maximum error and average error. What&#39;s more, the proposed method under UCPE had the lowest maximum error of 0.420% in voltage simulation and -0.421% in the current simulation of power profiles. Compared with the conventional method (using 200 points of single pulse data for parameter identification), the proposed method can reduce the average voltage error and the maximum error by 62.5% and 11.8% respectively under the DST power profile.},

  abstract     = {With the development of extreme fast charging technology, charging stations need to use energy storage stations to reduce the rising peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is a chemical power source that uses both Faraday process and non-Faraday process to store energy. Because of its attractive performance in terms of rate characteristics and chemical stability, it is suitable for some energy storage stations that consider both power density and energy density. It is important to describe the current-voltage characteristics of LIC to predict the charge and discharge efficiency in the early design of energy storage power stations. During the test, however, a full discharge or charge results in a high temperature rise, and the electrical model parameters near a specific temperature point cannot be accurately obtained. The short current pulses cannot stabilize the polarization. In this paper, a high-accuracy parameters identification method based on an improved Butler-Volmer-Equation-Based electrical model is used to summarize the phenomena caused by the rate of change of high-energy LIC. The accuracy of the method is tested under the dynamic stress condition test. The maximum voltage error is less than 2%. Energy efficiency calculation based on the used model is simulated by the design condition from the energy storage station of the Haizhu line in Guangzhou. The maximum error is less than 0.2%.},

  abstract     = {The mechanism revelation of performance decrease and fast-charging limitation of lithium-ion batteries at low temperatures is indispensable to optimize battery design and develop fast-charging methods. In this article, an electrochemical model-based quantitative analysis method is proposed to uncover the dominant reason for performance decrease and fast-charging limitation of batteries at low temperatures. The highly important dynamic parameters are carefully determined by the experimental data from the checked three-electrode battery and optimized by the genetic algorithm, rather than directly taken from the references. Validation results confirm that the electrochemical model can well reproduce battery behaviors under different conditions and that identified parameters are accurate. The quantitative analysis indicates that the sluggish diffusion in cathode and anode electrodes is the principal reason for battery available capacity loss. Battery available power attenuation is primarily attributed to the increased film resistance of anode and the reduced exchange current density of cathode, and it is substantially independent of the reduced diffusivity. The comparison result from the lithium-plating-prevention charging current reveals that the increased film resistance of the anode is responsible for the predominant limitation of low-temperature fast-charging, despite the most change in the exchange current density of the anode. This quantitative revelation breaks through the traditional understanding from the qualitative analysis that performance decrease and fast-charging limitation of batteries at low temperatures are highly associated with the degree of the change of characteristic parameters.},

  abstract     = {With the development of battery technology, large-scale battery applications are increasing. In order to obtain a higher current and voltage level and improve the overall energy efficiency, batteries are connected in series and parallel. Bulk model is the most used model to simulate battery packs, and the simulation results of single cell are enlarged several times to represent a battery pack. But bulk model ignores inconsistency between the batteries, and when the current magnification is large, such as in the extreme fast charge scenario, this neglect cannot reflect the current distribution inside the battery pack. Our paper proposes a simplify algorithm based on equivalent circuit model, which applied for non-uniform series and parallel-connected batteries. This simplification can greatly improve simulation speed while maintaining accuracy under the consideration of inconsistency. More importantly, this algorithm applies to any complex circuit, regardless of how many series-parallel structure layers. With the proposed algorithm, Monte Carlo simulations were evaluated to obtain the influence of battery series and parallel number and normal distribution parameters on current distribution. Simulation results show that an increase in the number of series will reduce the inconsistency of the current distribution, and an increase in the number of parallel and an increase in the relative standard deviation of the normal distribution of the battery parameters will increase the inconsistency of the current distribution.},

  abstract     = {In both normal and fast wireless electric vehicle charging systems, constant current/constant voltage (CC/CV) charging profile, regardless of the variation of the battery state of charge, is one of the most essential characteristics to ensure the battery performance and reliability. The input zero phase angle (ZPA) is able to minimize the system volt-ampere rating, enhance the power transfer capability, and make it easy to achieve soft-switching operation over the full range of battery charging profile. Therefore, the load-independent CC and CV output characteristics with ZPA conditions are necessary for wireless charging systems. However, the existing methods that can achieve these functions either add power switches or need a large number of compensation components, which make the system inefficient, uneconomical, and bulky. In this paper, a unified resonant tuning configuration with minimum passive component counts is proposed to achieve CC and CV outputs at two ZPA operating frequencies. According to the proposed configuration, all the possible inductive power transfer (IPT) and capacitive power transfer (CPT) topologies are analogized. With these topologies, both CC and CV outputs with ZPA are achieved using a minimum number of compensation components and no additional power switches. Among all the simplest IPT topologies, a primary Series-secondary Series and Parallel (S-SP) compensation topology is illustrated to demonstrate the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Inductive power transfer (IPT) technologies have gained a wide acceptance in onboard battery charging applications due to some significant advantages over traditional plug-in systems. An IPT battery charger is expected to provide a configurable charging profile consisting of an initial constant current (CC) and a subsequent constant voltage (CV) efficiently. With a wide load range during the charging process, two sets of IPT topologies with the inherent load-independent CC and CV at the same zero-phase angle (ZPA) frequency are commonly combined into a hybrid topology to avoid sophisticated control schemes, while maintaining nearly unity power factor and soft switching of power switches simultaneously. However, the load-independent CC and CV are usually constrained by parameters of a loosely coupled transformer (LCT), making the LCT hard to design. To solve it, this paper systematically presents a method to derive such effective hybrid IPT converters, which starts from some existing topologies having the configurable CC or CV output and cascades a general T network for mode transition. Design principles with fewer mode switches and compensation components are proposed and some available hybrid topologies regardless of the constraint of LCT parameters are given in this paper. Control logic and sensitivities of compensation parameters to the input impedance and the load-independent output are also discussed. Finally, a 1 kW hybrid IPT battery charger prototype based on LCC-LCC and LCC-S topologies is built to verify the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Acting as a key to future environmentally friendly transportation systems, electric vehicles (EVs) have attached importance to develop fast charging technologies to accomplish the requirement of vehicle users. However, fast charging behaviors would cause degradations in EVs’ batteries, as well as negative effects like new demand peak and feeder overloads to the connected distribution network, especially when plugging in large scale EVs. Decentralized coordination is encouraged and our goal is to achieve an optimal strategy profile for EVs in a decentralized way considering both the need of fast charging and reducing degradations in batteries and the distribution network. In this article, we innovatively model the EV fast charging problem as an optimization coordination problem subject to the coupled feeder capacity constraints in the distribution network. The need of fast charging is expressed by the total charging time, and the relative tendency to fully charge within the desired time period. We introduce a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{0}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm of the charging strategy which is non-convex to represent the total charging time, and apply the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{1}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm minimization to approximate the sparse solution of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{0}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm minimization. The shorter the charging horizon is the stronger willing of fast charging the user has. The objective of the optimization problem tradeoffs the EVs’ battery degradation cost, the load regulation in the distribution network, the satisfaction of charging and the total charging time, which is non-separable among individual charging behaviors. Even though alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely applied in distributed optimization with separable objective and coupled constraints, its decentralized scheme cannot be applied directly to the underlying non-separable EV charging coordination problem. Hence, a hierarchical algorithm based on ADMM is proposed such that the convergence to the optimal strategies is guaranteed under certain step-size parameter. Furthermore, a receding horizon based algorithm is proposed considering the forecast errors on the base demand and the EV arrival distribution. The results are demonstrated via some simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Safe and reliable intelligent charging stations are imperative in an intelligent transportation infrastructure. Over the past few years, a big number of smart charging stations have been deployed, and most of them are online and connected, resulting in potential risks of threats. Although there exists related work on securing intelligent vehicles, very little work focused on the security of charging devices. Unlike traditional network systems, these power-related Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) use many different proprietary protocols and diverse interactions. Traditional anomaly detection methods based on network traffic are thus not suitable for these systems. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection method in real vehicle power supply systems based on a deep architecture model. In particular, we propose a novel traffic anomaly detection model based on Multi-Head Attentions (MHA) that take into account the inherent correlations of traffic generated by ICSs. The MHA model is employed to substitute the traditional feature extraction and rule making process with an acceptable computational cost for classifying traffic data. It is an attention-based model that employs Google Transformer encoder architecture to extract recessive features of traffic for anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by experiments on two real-world power ICS testbeds including a substation with a slave charging station and a power generation simulation platform based on a distributed control system. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the MHA model outperforms the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based and classical machine learning detection models with an accuracy rate of 99.86%.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are viewed as an attractive option to reduce carbon emission and fuel consumption, but the popularization of EVs has been hindered by the cruising range limitation and the inconvenient charging process. In public charging stations, EVs usually spend a lot of time on queuing especially during peak hours of charging. Therefore, building an effective charging planning system has become a crucial task to reduce the total charging time for EVs. In this paper, we first introduce EVs charging scheduling problem and prove the NP-hardness of the problem. Then, we formalize the scheduling problem of EV charging as a Markov Decision Process and propose deep reinforcement learning algorithms to address it. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to minimize the total charging time of EVs and maximal reduction in the origin-destination distance. Finally, we experiment on real-world data and compare with two baseline algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. It shows that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the charging time of EVs compared to EST and NNCR algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Significant developments and advancement pertaining to electric vehicle (EV) technologies, such as extreme fast charging (XFC), have been witnessed in the last decade. However, there are still many challenges to the wider deployment of EVs. One of the major barriers is its availability of fast charging stations. A possible solution is to build a fast charging sharing system, by encouraging small business owners or even householders to install and share their fast charging devices, by reselling electricity energy sourced from traditional utility companies or their own solar grid. To incentivize such a system, a smart dynamic pricing scheme is needed to facilitate those growing markets with fast charging stations. The pricing scheme is expected to take into account the dynamics intertwined with pricing, demand, and environment factors, in an effort to maximize the long-term profit with the optimal price. To this end, this paper formulates the problem of dynamic pricing for fast charging as a Markov decision process and accordingly proposes several algorithmic schemes for different applications. Experimental study is conducted with useful and interesting insights.},

In this paper, we focus on the EV public charging market with heterogeneous charging stations (CSs) under the time-based billing model. We jointly consider the charging time optimization for EVs, the EV-CS pairing, and the pricing mechanism for CSs. A hierarchical game, which mathematically corresponds to an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), is then developed to formulate the three coupled problems. In the proposed hierarchical game, each CS sets the charging price to maximize its own revenue first, then the EVs choose their desired CSs and determine the charging time. We analyze the optimal charging time strategies for EVs, and a many-to-one matching algorithm is applied to solve the EV-CS pairing problem. Besides, a block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm is applied for each CS to solve the pricing problem. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can achieve the performance improvement of the charging system.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, but the frequent charging and large charging latency remain major obstacles to the EV industry. This article focuses on the charging scheduling of on-the-move EVs in a transportation network to minimize EVs’ charging latency, including driving time to charging stations (CSs), wait time and charging time. We formulate this charging scheduling problem as a graphical game to characterize the strong couplings of charging latency among neighboring EV players. Specially, we investigate correlated equilibrium (CE) to describe the joint strategies of EV players, which is expected to further reduce the charging latency of EVs compared with Nash equilibrium (NE). It is shown that CE always exists in a finite game, and can be found by linear programming tools. In addition, we propose a method of wait time prediction, which can improve the prediction accuracy by combining the data of deterministic EV arrivals and the stochastic property of potential EV arrivals. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of the proposed game-based approach, the efficiency of CE, the preciseness of our proposed wait time prediction method, the impacts of CS deployment on EVs’ charging latency, etc. We can draw a conclusion that our method has apparent advantages in situations where the locations of EV players are in dense manners.},

This paper proposes a coordinated planning method for power distribution networks and XFC EV charging stations, with the on-site batteries considered. Firstly, considering the traffic flow pattern, the operation of XFC stations is analyzed on both energy and power demand. Secondly, the coordinated planning model is developed to satisfy the time-varying XFC load, with both transportation and electricity constraints considered. In addition, the on-site batteries are introduced to flatten the XFC energy used and supplement its power supply. The case studies have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. The influence of XFC on the distribution networks and the effects of the on-site storage are also studied.},

In addition, the proposed model captures the long-term costs of critical grid assets induced by uncertainty and impulsiveness of charging demand. Finally, the model can be easily scaled to various coupling configurations and temporal resolutions through a graph-based scheme.

  abstract     = {Adopting extreme fast charging for electric vehicles will significantly reduce the charging time for electric vehicle owners, which will improve the public acceptance of electric vehicle. However, under the conditions of wide spread fast charging stations, large charging power of fast charging stations will bring nonnegligible impacts to the power system. For an aggregator that owns multiple fast charging stations, installing battery storage systems within the fast charging stations can reduce the impacts and give more flexibility. It will bring extra benefit if the aggregator participates in electricity markets by utilizing the flexibility of the storage. In order to deal with the operation and market participation problem for EV fast charging stations, this paper proposes bidding strategies in both energy and reserve markets for an aggregator of multiple fast charging stations with energy storage systems. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) based mixed integer quadratic programming formulation is built to hedge the risks of random charging demands and volatile market prices. The proposed formulation is converted into a linear programming problem and an iterative solution method is designed to reduce the computation time. Case studies based on the trajectory data of taxis in Beijing have been carried out. Simulation results show that the aggregator can achieve higher economic benefits while satisfying the fast charging demand of electric vehicles.},

TSR systems can further augment efforts in many other applications, such as highway asset maintenance and management. Despite the relative success of detectors with hand-crafted features in Europe, most, if not all, non-deep-learning based systems are not scalable to accurately recognize a large subset of traffic signs in the United States. The recent works in the domain of object detection using machine learning have shown the necessity of deep neural networks (DNNs) in TSR, whereby a DNN can learn features automatically without hand-crafting them. Due to the lack of datasets in the U.S. and the inefficient use of traditional methods for traffic sign recognition (TSR) in the U.S., we created the Automotive Repository of Traffic Signs (ARTS), a new dataset for traffic signs recognition in the U.S. ARTS covers a wide range of sign-types, including Regulatory, Guide, Warning, and Temporary signs as defined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). It also features geospatial data to localize signs using their GPS coordinates. Benchmarks are presented to assess the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning based detectors.},

The objective is to maximize the number of vehicles that can communicate with the prescribed requirement on latency and reliability. The joint scheduling and power control problem is formulated as a mixed Boolean linear programming (MBLP) problem. A column generation method is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the joint problem. From the joint problem, we formulate a scheduling-alone problem (given a power allocation) as a Boolean linear programming (BLP) problem and a power control-alone problem (given a schedule) as an MBLP problem. The scheduling problem is numerically sensitive due to the high dynamic range of channel values and adjacent channel interference ratio (ACIR) values. Therefore, a novel sensitivity reduction technique, which can compute a numerically stable optimal solution at the price of increased computational complexity, is proposed. Numerical results show that ACI, just as CCI, is a serious problem in direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication due to near-far situations and hence should not be ignored, and its impact can be reduced by proper scheduling and power control.},

The first layer computes the maximum distance that need to be traveled to complete a mission by a team of vehicles. We have developed a nearest-neighbor-search based approach to assign closely located tasks to each vehicle in the team. We developed a stochastic optimization based path planning algorithm that can compute the collision-free (with both static and dynamic obstacles) trajectory for a vehicle to navigate from start to the target location. By combining task assignment with path planning algorithm, we can estimate the maximum traveled distance for a mission with a team of vehicles. The second layer determines the optimal number of vehicles required for a mission based on any user defined constraint by casting it as a multiobjective optimization problem with two competing objectives, i.e. time vs cost. The methods derived in layer one are utilized to evaluate the objective functions in layer two. Finally, we have proposed a data driven neural network-based prediction model that will forecast the mission completion time with a reasonable accuracy which will utilize the historical information of the previous missions. The forecasting model is intended to facilitate the effective planning of parallel and subsequent missions.

  abstract     = {Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (ITSC) systems have attracted the attention of researchers and the general public alike as a means of alleviating traffic congestion. Recently, the vehicular wireless technologies have enabled a cost-efficient way to achieve ITSC by detecting vehicles using Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) wireless communications. Traditional ITSC algorithms, in most cases, assume that every vehicle is detected, such as by a camera or a loop detector, but a V2I implementation would detect only those vehicles equipped with wireless communications capability. We examine a family of transportation systems, which we will refer to as `Partially Detected Intelligent Transportation Systems&#39;. An algorithm that can perform well under a small detection rate is highly desirable due to gradual increasing penetration rates of the underlying technologies such as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach in Artificial Intelligence (AI) could provide indispensable tools for such problems where only a small portion of vehicles are detected by the ITSC system. In this paper, we report a new RL algorithm for Partially Detected Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (PD-ITSC) systems. The performance of this system is studied under different car flows, detection rates, and types of the road network. Our system is able to efficiently reduce the average waiting time of vehicles at an intersection, even with a low detection rate, thus reducing the travel time of vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian re-identification (Re-ID) is a very challenging and unavoidable problem in the field of multi-camera surveillance in smart transportation. Among many ways to solve this problem, keep it simple and straightforward (KISS) metric learning (KISSME) stands out since it has unbeatable advantages in running time while maintaining highly acceptable matching rate. It can be used to realize effective pedestrian Re-ID in an open world. Although it has achieved highly acceptable performance in some applications, it encounters a small sample size (S 3 ) problem that causes too small eigenvalues of its covariance matrix, thus resulting in an instability issue. Its large eigenvalues are overestimated; while its small ones are underestimated. In order to solve this problem, we use an orthogonal basis vector to generate virtual samples to overcome the S 3 problem. The resulting algorithm named KISS+ is experimentally shown to have the eigenvalues of its covariance matrix significantly larger than those of the original KISSME. In order to show its advantage in pedestrian Re-ID, this work uses multi-feature fusion to extract more discriminant features, and obtain a low-dimensional expression of features through dimension reduction. Experiments based on several well-known databases show that our method can improve the matching rate, while maintaining the advantage of fast computation. Compared with deep learning algorithms, our algorithm does not achieve their matching rate, but it is highly suitable for real-time pedestrian Re-ID of an open world due to its simplicity, easy operation and fast execution.},

Understanding commuters&#39; needs and preferences are essential for promoting and providing metro services. In this work, we survey a group of Delhi metro commuters to study their metro convenience preferences. Using mixed-method analysis, we identify the factors that contribute to commuters&#39; convenience through stated preference valuations obtained from a survey (368 valid responses). These factors are a combination of metro route attributes (boarding/de-boarding stations and line interchanges) shaped by commuter experiences associated with safety concerns, last-mile connectivity, and their perceptions of travel time, crowdedness, and getting a seat. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications these preferences and perceptions have on user experience with the Delhi metro. We then propose design guidelines to enhance the existing Delhi metro app to improve user experience with metro train service.},

In order to ensure the efficient operation of automated metro in emergency scenarios, it is necessary to understand the potential relationship between system change and emergency procedures. To solve this problem, an evaluation method for emergency procedures is proposed. Firstly, on the basis of investigation, interview and empirical analysis of different types of automated metro lines, combined with Team-Cognitive Work Analysis(CWA) method and network theory, the team emergency task network is established. Then four characteristic indexes, i.e. degree, average shortest path length, agglomeration coefficient and overall network efficiency, are selected as the analysis metrics of emergency task network complexity. The complexity of different emergency procedures under grades of automation(GOA) 4 and same emergency procedure under GOA1-GOA4 are comprehensively analyzed. The research results reveal that no matter what level of automation system, the more nodes and communication between nodes, the larger network scale is, which will lead to the emergency procedures more complicated, and vice versa. The driver&#39;s behavior plays a decisive role in the variation of communicating frequencies.},

  abstract     = {The introduction of autonomous vehicles can potentially lead to enhanced situational awareness and safety for road transport. However, the performance required for autonomous operations places stringent requirements on the vehicle navigation systems design. Relevant performance measures include not only the accuracy of the system but also its ability to detect sensor faults within a specified Time-to-Alert (TTA) and without generating an excessive number of false alarms. A new integrated navigation system architecture is proposed which utilizes Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), low-cost Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), visual odometry and Vehicle Dynamic Models (VDM). The system design is based on various navigation modes, each with independent failure mechanisms and fault-detection capabilities. A two-step data fusion approach is adopted to optimize the system accuracy and integrity performance. This includes a Knowledge-Based Module (KBM) performing a detailed sensor integrity analysis followed by a conventional Extended Kalman Filer (EKF). CAV navigation integrity requirement (i.e., alert limits and time-to-alert) are considered in the KBM where fault detection probabilities are calculated for each mode and translated to protection levels. A simulation case study is executed to verify the performance of each navigation mode in the presence of faults affecting the individual navigation sensors. Results confirm that the required CAV integrity performances are met, while the inclusion of visual odometry and VDM data provides significant performance enhancements both in terms of accuracy and integrity over existing INS/GNSS systems.},

  abstract     = {A safe trajectory planning for on-road autonomous driving is a challenging problem owing to the variety and complexity of driving environments. The problem should involve the consideration of numerous aspects such as road geometry, lane-structured roads, traffic regulations, traffic participants, and vehicle physical limitations. Furthermore, dynamically changing movements of surrounding vehicles make the problem more challenging. It requires the planner&#39;s ability to react to the changes in the driving environments in real time. To solve this problem, sampling and numerical optimization-based trajectory planners were introduced. However, these methods have their own limitations in generating a safe trajectory in these dynamic scenarios. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning scheme to integrate the strength of the sampling and optimization methods. With the sampling method for a lateral movement, the planner can deal with various trajectories with multiple maneuvers. This helps the planner to generate a reactive trajectory in a dynamically changing environment. The numerical optimization of a longitudinal movement enables the planner to adapt to diverse situations without restriction of predefined patterns for specific driving purposes. The proposed method was implemented with an embedded optimization coder and C++ environment. Based on this, its performance was evaluated through simulation and real driving tests in various on-road dynamic scenarios.},

Then, the application of the modeling to the design of merging behavior control is proposed. First, the driving behavior on the main lane at a highway junction is observed using a driving simulator, particularly focusing on the driver&#39;s state of decision (SOD), which represents the acceptance for merging a car coming from the merging lane. Second, the driver&#39;s SOD is modeled using a logistic regression model and the prediction performance of the identified model is verified. Finally, the speed controller of the merging car is designed to maximize the acceptance from the cars on the main lane. The key idea here is to minimize the entropy of the SOD of the driver on the main lane by optimizing the speed of a merging vehicle. This problem is quantitatively formulated using an identified decision-making model and addressed by applying a randomized approach to the optimization. This enables the automated vehicle to realize a considerate merging behavior at a highway junction. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed design scheme.},

We observe that traffic jams are closely related to the convergence of multiple platoons into a single platoon containing all the agents in the model. We also observed that at high-density, traffic system maintains a metastable state when it has multiple platoons in it. A traffic jam occurs when these multiple platoons are merged into a single platoon, which is equivalent to the concept of an infinite cluster in percolation theory.},

  abstract     = {The rapidly increasing traffic volumes using local road networks allied to the implications of climate change drive the demand for cost-effective, reliable and accurate road condition assessment. A particular concern for local road asset managers is the loss of material from the road surface known as fretting which unchecked can lead to potholes. In order to assess the road condition quantitatively and affordably, a system should be designed with low complexity, be capable of operating in a variety of weather conditions and operate at normal traffic-speeds. Many different techniques have been developed for road condition assessment such as ground penetrating radar, visual sensors and mobile scanning lasers. In this work, the use of the point laser technique for scanning the road surface is investigated. It has the advantages of being sufficiently accurate, is relatively unaffected by levels of illumination and it produces relatively low volumes of data. In this work, road fretting/surface disintegration was determined using a novel signal processing approach which considers a number of features of reflected laser signals. The proposed methodology was demonstrated using data collected from the UK’s local road network. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system can assess road fretting to an accuracy which is comparable to a visual inspection, and at Information Quality Level (IQL) 3 which is sufficient for tactical road asset management whereby road sections requiring treatment are selected and appropriate treatments identified.},

It is challenging, however, to perform route planning over a large number of students each having multiple potential pickup locations. We develop a graph-based data structure that embeds potential pickup locations of all students with the awareness of real-world constraints and existing public transits. Based on the graph structure, we prove that the optimal last-mile school shuttle planning problem is NP-hard and thereafter design a Tabu-based expansion algorithm to solve the problem, which strikes at a proper balance between the savings of students&#39; commute time and the total cost of operating the shuttle buses. Extensive experiments with large-scale real-world crowdsensed trajectory data demonstrate that our last-mile school shuttles can save the traveling time for most students by over 20% and the savings can be up to 65% for 10% of the students.},

  abstract     = {Exploring human mobility is essential for urban applications. To observe human mobility, various data-driven techniques based on different data sources, such as cell phone and transportation data, have been proposed. This paper investigates human mobility through the emerging vehicular Internet service on public bus system. The key idea is that if a passenger is using WiFi on the bus or his/her WiFi device is activated in the background, we know that the passenger is traveling on the bus. By fusing the network events generated by WiFi devices with the data from the automatic fare collection (AFC) system, and the bus GPS information, we exploit not only the origin but also the destination of a passenger. Based on this idea, we develop a novel system called ViFi-MobiScanner which consists of about 4, 800 mobile routers distributed in a city with 1, 992 KM 2 urban area. We develop an ID matching algorithm that matches part of the users’ network identities and their smartcard identities anonymously. As a result, we have built a set of labeled samples with the reference of observation from smartcard data and use them to train a classifier to infer users mobility from their network activities. We evaluate ViFi-MobiScanner with both field tests and collected datasets associated with 168 million network events, 3.6 million trips, and 1.4 million users. The evaluation results show that ViFi-MobiScanner increases the observability on the passengers and trips by about 53.9% and 48.1% over the smartcard observations. ViFi-MobiScanner also helps to estimate the passengers’ destination that cannot be observed by current smartcard systems and the estimation can be accomplished in minutes. Thus it expands the observability of mobility in object, temporal and spatial dimensions and provides unique insights on human mobility at metropolitan scales.},

Then, under the framework of the communication-based train control technology, the interaction of desirable speed information among trains and the wayside control center is described by the directed topological graph. Next, a distributed cruise controller is designed by taking advantages of the graphic theory such that the multiple trains track different target speeds, and both the distance of neighboring cars and the headway of successive trains are kept in appropriate ranges. Finally, to eliminate the influence of external disturbances, we adopt the disturbance observer to approximate the perturbations, and present a sufficient condition for the existence of the distributed control strategy and the observer gain parameter in form of the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Numerical experiments illustrate that the composite control law is effective in inhibiting the external disturbances, and guaranteeing the safety, efficiency and comfort of high-speed trains&#39; movement.},

The conditional probability density functions of travel time in each specific period play a fundamental role in the modeling of time-varying variability and reliability. Nonparametric kernel density estimation is applied to travel time data, which enhances the flexibility and accuracy in accommodating travel time distributions under various complex traffic conditions. The proposed functional travel time density model (FTTDM) uses functional principal component analysis in kernel density function estimates for modeling and depicting time-varying variability through the dependence on the departure time of day. The resulting quantile estimates are used to obtain time-varying reliability, which considers the addition of extra time to the average or the median for an on-time arrival. This study uses linked travel time data of an electronic toll collection system to estimate route travel times in the Taiwan Freeway system. As illustrated in the data applications, the FTTDM effectively captures the time-varying feature of travel time variability and reliability, and the reliability indicators identify the unreliable departure time of day of a route.},

  abstract     = {Continuous point cloud data is being used more and more widely in practical applications such as mapping, localization and object detection in autonomous driving systems, but due to the huge volume of data involved, sharing and storing this data is currently expensive and difficult. One possible solution is the development of more efficient methods of compressing the data. Other researchers have proposed converting 3D point cloud data into 2D images, or using tree structures to store the data. In a previous study targeting streaming point cloud data, we proposed an MPEG-like compression method which utilizes simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) results to simulate LiDAR’s operating process. In this paper, instead of imitating MPEG, we propose new strategy for more efficient reference frame distribution and more natural frame prediction, and use a different algorithm to encode the residual, greatly improving the algorithm’s performance and its stability in different scenarios. We also discuss how various parameters affect compression performance. Using our proposed method, streaming point cloud data collected by LiDAR sensors can be compressed to 1/50th of its original size, with only 2 cm of Root Mean Square Error for each detected point. We evaluate our proposed method by comparing its performance with several other existing point cloud compression methods in three different driving scenarios, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms them.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a novel de-centralized traffic signal controller, achieved using a Nash bargaining game-theoretic framework, that operates a flexible phasing sequence to adapt to dynamic changes in traffic demand levels. The Nash bargaining algorithm is used to optimize the traffic signal timings at each signalized intersection by modeling each phase as a player in a game, where players cooperate to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. The algorithm was implemented in the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation software and tested on two sample networks. The proposed control approach was compared to the operation of an optimum fixed-time coordinated plan, an actuated controller, a centralized adaptive phase split controller, a decentralized phase split and cycle length controller, and a fully coordinated adaptive phase split, cycle length, and offset optimization controller to evaluate its performance. Testing was initially conducted on an isolated intersection, showing a 77% reduction in queue length, a a 64% reduction in vehicle delay, and a 17% reduction in vehicle emission levels. In addition, the algorithm was tested on an arterial network producing statistically significant reductions in total delay ranging between 36% and 67% and vehicle emission reductions ranging between 6% and 13%.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction has received rising research interest recently since it is a key step to prevent and relieve traffic congestion in urban areas. Existing methods mostly focus on road-level or region-level traffic prediction, and fail to deeply capture the high-order spatial-temporal correlations among the road links to perform a road network-level prediction. In this paper, we propose a network-scale deep traffic prediction model called TrafficGAN, in which Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is utilized to predict traffic flows under an adversarial learning framework. To capture the spatial-temporal correlations among the road links of a road network, both Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models are embedded into TrafficGAN. In addition, we also design a deformable convolution kernel for CNN to make it better handle the input road network data. We extensively evaluate our proposal over two large GPS probe datasets in the arterial road network of downtown Chicago and Bay Area of California. The results show that TrafficGAN significantly outperforms both traditional statistical models and state-of-the-art deep learning models in network-scale short-term traffic flow prediction.},

  abstract     = {Railways safety regulations require the drivers acting on a pedal to signal that they are awake and vigilant. This implies a noticeable biomechanical load on the driver. In this work, we propose an embedded computer-vision system that, using a single camera placed on the cockpit of a train, analyzes the driver&#39;s watchfulness by monitoring gaze and eyelid blinking. The proposed system provides a consensus to the control logic of the train, which replaces the action on the pedal. The system copes with the peculiar conditions of a train&#39;s cabin, such as variable illumination, the variability of the driver&#39;s face image and presence of more than one people in the cabin. At the same time, it accounts for the constraints posed by the international regulation (Safety Integrity Level IV) and customer specifications, which poses limitations on the hardware selection. The paper presents the design and evaluation of this system. The former includes the hardware selection and the algorithm development, whereas the latter includes preliminary tests for tuning the algorithm and final tests in real operating conditions for the evaluation of the system. The results show that the systems always correctly detects the driver&#39;s watchfulness and, importantly, it does not report false positives. As such, it can be used to avoid the driver&#39;s action on the pedal and reducing the biomechanical load.},

  abstract     = {The detection of driving events could be useful for reducing accidents, fleet management and insurance premiums etc. Currently, top of the range vehicles and large fleets employ expensive driver monitoring systems. However, most drivers do not have access to such systems. The required monitoring platform would have to deliver the required performance while also being affordable and accessible. A candidate with considerable promise is the smartphone with sensors built-in that could be exploited for the detection of driving events. However, to date it has not been possible to achieve the required correct, missed and false detection rates in addition to the computational efficiency for real-time operations. This paper proposes a novel bagging tree and dynamic time warping (DTW) integrated algorithm for the detection of driving events employing acceleration and orientation data from a smartphone&#39;s low cost three-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes. The bagging tree-based machine learning algorithm provides the initial maneuver detection results, as well as the location of the event start and end points. Event detection is then achieved by calculating the similarity of the results predicted through the bagging tree algorithm with the corresponding templates extracted from the experience datasets, while also applying a number of constraints to verify the calculated results. Field test results show that the proposed integrated algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art, achieving a high correct detection accuracy of 97.5%, a low missed detection of 2.5% and a false detection rate of 2.9%. The corresponding results for the best alternative candidate method are 90.2%, 9.8% and 11.7%. Furthermore, the improvement in computational efficiency offered by our proposed approach is three to more than ten times greater than that of the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles are one of the common safety issues at signalized intersections. Pedestrian Flashing GREEN (FG), a time interval for pedestrians on crosswalks to safely finish crossing before the next phase occurs, may fail to clear the crosswalk in the allotted time, due to significant pedestrian non-compliant behavior. In this manner, probability of pedestrian-vehicle exposures increases when non-compatible vehicle flows are released at the next immediate phase. This paper seeks to address this issue by presenting a traffic signal control strategy for urban traffic networks that aims to minimize vehicle traveling delay (increase efficiency) as well as pedestrian crossing risk (increase safety). First, a macroscopic model for pedestrian-vehicle mixed-flow networks is proposed. Considering the high-incidence rate of pedestrian violations during FG, an additional Dynamic All RED (DAR) phase is introduced at the end of each FG period, whose duration is adaptively adjusted according to the number of non-compliant pedestrians. With computational complexity being a concern for our model, an evolutionary algorithm with repairing mechanism (EARM), is proposed to solve our problem. Case studies are provided to illustrate the potential impact of the pedestrian movement to the vehicle traffic networks when pedestrian safety is considered in the system, as well as the efficacy of our traffic light control strategy for pedestrians and vehicles on risk reduction.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a motion-planning framework for urban autonomous driving at uncontrolled intersections. The intention and future state of the target vehicles are predicted using information obtained from the environment sensors. The target state prediction module employs an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter to infer the intention of targets. The prediction results of each model of the IMM filter are fused to predict the future state of targets. The proposed predictor uses the intelligent driver model based-driver behavior model to construct the local filter of IMM. The driving mode decision is realized as a state machine consisting of two phases, `Approach&#39; and `Risk Management&#39;. The risk management phase is composed of two sub-modes, `Cross&#39; and `Yield&#39;. The state transition conditions between phases and modes are defined by introducing the concepts of `Critical gap&#39; and `Follow-up gap&#39;. Based on the determined driving mode, the motion planning module consists of two sub-modules for each phase. The required deceleration determination for the approach phase is proposed to consider the occluded region in order to prevent inevitable collisions caused by fast approaches. The model predictive controller for the risk management phase is designed to determine the desired acceleration to guarantee safety and prevent unnecessary deceleration simultaneously. Both computer simulation studies and vehicle tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. The results indicate that the proposed framework ensures the safety at uncontrolled intersections with a driving pattern similar to that of a driver.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies employ advanced deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for monocular depth perception, which can hardly run efficiently on small drones that rely on low/middle-grade GPU(e.g. TX2 and 1050Ti) for computation. In addition, the methods which can effectively and efficiently produce probabilistic depth prediction with a measure of model confidence have not been well studied. The lack of such a method could yield erroneous, sometimes fatal, decisions in drone applications (e.g. selecting a waypoint in a region with a large depth yet a low estimation confidence). This paper presents a real-time onboard approach for monocular depth prediction and obstacle avoidance with a lightweight probabilistic CNN (pCNN), which will be ideal for use in a lightweight energy-efficient drone. For each video frame, our pCNN can efficiently predict its depth map and the corresponding confidence. The accuracy of our lightweight pCNN is greatly boosted by integrating sparse depth estimation from a visual odometry into the network for guiding dense depth and confidence inference. The estimated depth map is transformed into Ego Dynamic Space (EDS) by embedding both dynamic motion constraints of a drone and the confidence values into the spatial depth map. Traversable waypoints are automatically computed in EDS based on which appropriate control inputs for the drone are produced. Extensive experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our depth prediction method runs at 12Hz and 45Hz on TX2 and 1050Ti GPU respectively, which is 1.8X~5.6X faster than the state-of-the-art methods and achieves better depth estimation accuracy. We also conducted experiments of obstacle avoidance in both simulated and real environments to demonstrate the superiority of our method to the baseline methods.},

In this context, this paper proposes an integrated risk assessment framework for an electric power system, considering scenarios that involve the electrified transportation system enabled by EVs charging technology in New York (NY) State. Firstly, scenarios in the transportation network of NY State, e.g. of reduced capacity and incident, are generated by a Monte Carlo non-sequential algorithm. Then, the cell transmission model (CTM) is used to simulate the evolution of the traffic flows under such scenarios. This allows evaluating the spatial-temporal EV charging loads in different areas of the electrified transportation system of NY State. Correspondingly, the running parameters in the studied power system are updated by the alternative current (AC) power flow model. Finally, the risk for the power system coming from the transportation system scenarios is assessed within a probabilistic risk analysis framework. The proposed integrated risk assessment framework is able to model the propagation of the effects of scenarios in the transportation system onto the power system of NY State and quantify the consequences. A real test case is used to illustrate the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Maritime collision risk prediction is crucial for the safety management of ocean transportation. Previous studies have primarily focused on near-miss collision risk of ship pairs, yet the risk due to congestion caused by multiple ships is significant. This paper proposes a novel space-time geographical approach for addressing multi-ship near-miss collision risk based on vessel motion behavior. The direction-constrained space-time prism is used to characterize the interaction possibility of ships, enabling potential collision risk to be evaluated. The advantage of direction-constrained space-time prism in analyzing ship movements is that it accounts for direction limitation thereby eliminating unreasonable estimation associated with the assumption of arbitrary changes in sailing direction through the classical space-time prism. This paper uses the trajectories of ships traveling the southeast coast of China to investigate the viability of the proposed approach. In comparison to the fuzzy quaternion ship domain model and closest point of approach-based methods, the proposed approach is capable of identifying hierarchical near-miss collision risks for different ships to improve risk evaluation. This is essential for ship path optimization that accounts for changes in the speed and course of ships. This work supports maritime collision risk forecasting, but also provides detailed insights for actionable steps to reduce risks.},

It is a prominent collective intelligence application producing significant benefits both for individuals (reduced costs) and for the entire community (reduced pollution and traffic). Despite these very promising potential advantages, the percentage of users who currently adopt ridesharing solutions is very low, well below the adoption rate required to achieve said benefits. One of the reasons of this insufficient engagement by the public is the lack of effective incentive policies by regulatory authorities, who are not able to estimate the costs and the benefits of a given ridesharing adoption policy. Here we address these issues by (i) developing a novel algorithm that makes large-scale, real-time peer-to-peer ridesharing technologically feasible; and (ii) exhaustively quantifying the impact of different ridesharing scenarios in terms of environmental benefits (i.e., reduction of CO2 emissions, noise pollution, and traffic congestion) and quality of service for the users. Our analysis on a real-world dataset shows that major societal benefits are expected from deploying peer-to-peer ridesharing depending on the trade-off between environmental benefits and quality of service. Results on a real-world dataset show that our approach can produce reductions up to a 70.78% in CO2 emissions and up to 80.08% in traffic congestion.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents our method for enabling a UAV quadrotor, equipped with a monocular camera, to autonomously avoid collisions with obstacles in unstructured and unknown indoor environments. When compared to obstacle avoidance in ground vehicular robots, UAV navigation brings in additional challenges because the UAV motion is no more constrained to a well-defined indoor ground or street environment. Unlike ground vehicular robots, a UAV has to navigate across more types of obstacles - for e.g., objects like decorative items, furnishings, ceiling fans, sign-boards, tree branches, etc., are also potential obstacles for a UAV. Thus, methods of obstacle avoidance developed for ground robots are clearly inadequate for UAV navigation. Current control methods using monocular images for UAV obstacle avoidance are heavily dependent on environment information. These controllers do not fully retain and utilize the extensively available information about the ambient environment for decision making. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based method for UAV obstacle avoidance (OA) which is capable of doing exactly the same. The crucial idea in our method is the concept of partial observability and how UAVs can retain relevant information about the environment structure to make better future navigation decisions. Our OA technique uses recurrent neural networks with temporal attention and provides better results compared to prior works in terms of distance covered without collisions. In addition, our technique has a high inference rate and reduces power wastage as it minimizes oscillatory motion of UAV.},

  abstract     = {Intersection queue length estimation using high-resolution probe vehicle trajectory data has received increasing attentions in recent years. Existing methods for cycle-based queue length estimation still face the challenge of low and/or unstable estimation accuracies under the condition of sparse vehicle trajectory data, i.e., there is no greater than one vehicle trajectory per cycle on average. To address this challenge, this study proposed a novel approach for cycle-based queue length estimation by fusing real-time and historical probe vehicle trajectory data, through a statistical parameter estimation method, i.e., maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). With known signal timing information, firstly, the historical probe trajectory data are used to acquire the arrival flow rate distribution over the entire study period. Then, a likelihood function of queue length is derived by fully exploiting real-time traffic flow information provided by the queued and non-queued probe vehicles. Finally, the MLE method is adopted to estimate the cycle-based queue lengths with the maximum probability. The proposed approach is verified using both simulation and empirical data. Results indicate that precise estimation for cycle-based queue lengths can be realized based on sparse vehicle trajectory data, while showing superiority to a representative existing method. The proposed method is basically an offline method, but it can also work in an online manner if provided a priori arrival distribution either acquired from historical probe vehicle trajectory data or a theoretical assumption.},

  abstract     = {In major metropolitan cities, metro and intercity rail services usually share stations or have stations in close proximity to facilitate smooth connections for passengers. A large number of passengers may arrive on metro platforms within a short period of time upon the arrivals of intercity trains, while the number may drop significantly afterward. This injected passenger demand is not coped well by the metro timetable with the commonly adopted regular train headway. Focusing on metro lines connecting to intercity railways, this study puts forward a timetable model to optimize train headways at each station, assuming all passengers board the first train available. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time of passengers at platforms throughout the metro line, without changing the number of vehicle trips. To calculate the passenger waiting time accurately, a mathematical model is proposed to obtain the number of transfer passengers arriving at metro platform in each time interval, based on arrivals of intercity trains and transfer facilities at the station. A genetic algorithm, combined with interior-point algorithm, is developed to obtain the solution of the proposed timetable model. Real-life case studies show that the optimized timetable reduces the total passenger waiting time when compared with the current timetable and the solution of another model optimizing train departure times at the first station only. In addition, the peak number of passengers congregating at metro platforms drops significantly, which relieves passenger crowding on the platform.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring and control of traffic networks represent alternative, inexpensive strategies to minimize traffic congestion. As the number of traffic sensors is naturally constrained by budgetary requirements, real-time estimation of traffic flow in road segments that are not equipped with sensors is of significant importance - thereby providing situational awareness and guiding real-time feedback control strategies. To that end, firstly we build a generalized traffic flow model for stretched highways with arbitrary number of ramp flows based on the Lighthill Whitham Richards (LWR) flow model. Secondly, we characterize the function set corresponding to the nonlinearities present in the LWR model, and use this characterization to design real-time and robust state estimators (SE) for stretched highway segments. Specifically, we show that the nonlinearities from the derived models are locally Lipschitz continuous by providing the analytical Lipschitz constants. Thirdly, the analytical derivation is then incorporated through a robust SE method given a limited number of traffic sensors, under the impact of process and measurement disturbances and unknown inputs. The estimator is based on deriving a convex semidefinite optimization problem. Finally, numerical tests are given showcasing the applicability, scalability, and robustness of the proposed estimator for large systems under high magnitude disturbances, parametric uncertainty, and unknown inputs.},

  abstract     = {Due to random nature of traffic and unpredictability of human behaviors, one of challenging problems in transportation engineering is traffic congestion which has a direct impact on the economy and environment with the increase in traveling time, fuel consumption and emissions. One of approaches to reduce traffic congestions is the advance Route Guidance Systems (RGSs) which can propose alternative optimal routes for vehicles, which are in or will be entering congested roads or areas. Advanced RGSs, usually employ real-time and predicted traffic information of the roads to find the best possible route for vehicles in a way that total traffic congestions will be reduced. In this paper, The ReFOCUS+, a dynamic semi-distributed, multi-layer, and Fog-Cloud based advance route guidance system architecture has been introduced. The ReFOCUS+ architecture, employ Road Side Units (RSUs), to calculate different traffic-related factors such as current and predicted road congestions, area congestions, traveling time, etc. Then, the ReFOCUS+ uses traffic factors to proposes a novel method to detect congested roads in an area and, apply re-routing to vehicles to ease the traffic congestion within each area using a multi-metric fitness function, called Road Weight Measurement (RWM). To evaluate the performance of ReFOCUS+, a new open-source Python-based program has been developed which is able to connect to SUMO traffic simulator and control the simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that ReFOCUS+ outperforms existing solutions and improve traveling time, fuel consumption and gas emissions. 11 The developed program and software in this paper available at https://www.github.com/hamednoori/ReFOCUS+},

  abstract     = {Traditional mapping modules in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (i.e. Visual SLAM) systems can only estimate 3D information of isolated sparse or semi-dense feature points. But there are lots of object instances in the environments which geometric information can be utilized to enhance the quality of mapping and localization. Hence, it is required for the Visual SLAM system to utilize high-dimensional features like object instances or structural lines in mapping and localization. To meet the gap between the above requirements and the traditional implementation of Visual SLAM systems, we present in this paper a novel Visual SLAM method that can effectively utilize texture-less object instances for mapping and localization. The proposed Visual SLAM method includes newly designed feature extraction, matching, localization and mapping modules, which jointly use object features and point features to estimate camera 6-DOF poses and do richer map construction. A group of organized raster points is used to represent objects during feature matching and pose estimation process in the proposed Visual SLAM pipeline. Owing to the object feature fusion in the co-visibility graph it could conduct scale aware bundle adjustments to reduce accumulated error. The advantages of proposed Visual SLAM method are demonstrated through experiments conducted both on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, aiming to reduce the metropolitan air pollution caused by fossil fuel-powered vehicles, the electrification of transportation, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and electric buses (EBs), has attracted great attention from the automobile industry, academia, and public transportation. EBs, driven by decarbonized electricity, can reduce the air pollution and noise level. Besides, they can also recover electricity from regenerative braking. Recent years have witnessed continuous works on the topics of EB energy storage, power management, and charging scheduling. In this review, we have comprehensively surveyed three primary parts: important components; existing research topics; and open issues of EBs. Specifically, we first introduce the important components of EBs, including energy storage systems, powertrains, interleaving elements and electric motors, and driving cycles. Then, we review the existing research topics of EBs, including the energy storage system sizing, power/energy management, range remedy methods, charging design/scheduling, and trial projects. At last, extending from existing literatures, we further propose the future research opportunities and ongoing challenges, such as extending EV related research to EBs, EB charging demand modeling, and EB impact on power systems.},
