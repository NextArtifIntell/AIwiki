  abstract     = {Distributed Arithmetic Coding (DAC) is a practical realization of Slepian-Wolf coding that partitions source space into cosets. Coset Cardinality Spectrum (CCS) is an important property of DAC that was defined in our previous work. In this paper, we give two applications of CCS. First, we find that DAC bitstream is not compact. The rate loss of DAC bitstream is caused by two factors: unequal coset partitioning and bit indivisibility . It is proved that as code length goes to infinity, the expected value of bit-indivisibility rate loss will tend to 0.5 for any irrational Rate Change Step (RCS), where the RCS refers to the rate change when one source bit is flipped. With the help of CCS, the bit-indivisibility rate loss can be compensated to some extend. Especially, for any irrational RCS, as code length goes to infinity, the expected value of the remaining bit-indivisibility rate loss after compensation will tend to about 0.47. The second application of CCS is DAC decoder design. We derive the formula of path metric and find that in the original paper on DAC, the intuitive formula of path metric is not correct. The backward-replacing algorithm is proposed to make full use of memory. Experimental results confirm the correctness of theoretical analyses.},

  abstract     = {We revisit and take a closer look at a (not so well known) result of a 2017 paper, showing that the differential uniformity of any vectorial function is bounded from below by an expression depending on the size of its image set. We make explicit the resulting tight lower bound on the image set size of differentially $\delta $ -uniform functions (which is the only currently known non-trivial lower bound on the image set size of such functions). We also significantly improve an upper bound on the nonlinearity of vectorial functions obtained in the same reference and involving their image set size. We study when the resulting bound is sharper than the covering radius bound. We obtain as a by-product a lower bound on the Hamming distance between differentially $\delta $ -uniform functions and affine functions, which we improve significantly with a second bound. This leads us to study what can be the maximum Hamming distance between vectorial functions and affine functions. We provide an upper bound which is slightly sharper than a bound by Liu, Mesnager and Chen when $m &amp;lt; n$ , and a second upper bound, which is much stronger in the case (happening in practice) where $m$ is near $n$ ; we study the tightness of this latter bound; this leads to an interesting question on APN functions, which we address (negatively). We finally derive an upper bound on the nonlinearity of vectorial functions by means of their Hamming distance to affine functions and make more precise the bound on the differential uniformity which was the starting point of the paper.},

Our general framework recovers a comprehensive array of well-known gossip algorithms as special cases, including the pairwise randomized gossip algorithm and path averaging gossip, and allows for the development of provably faster variants. The flexibility of the new approach enables the design of a number of new specific gossip methods. For instance, we propose and analyze novel block and the first provably accelerated randomized gossip protocols, and dual randomized gossip algorithms. From a numerical analysis viewpoint, our work is the first that explores in depth the decentralized nature of randomized iterative methods for linear systems and proposes them as methods for solving the average consensus problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed gossip protocols by performing extensive experimental testing on typical wireless network topologies.},

In this paper, we extend this work from point-to-point to networks. We consider a connected network with pairwise communication between the nodes and assume that each node is provided with a certain amount of secret bits before communication commences. An eavesdropper with unlimited computing power has access to all communication and can hack a subset of the nodes not known to the rest of the nodes. We investigate the limits on information-theoretic secure communication with end-to-end encryption for this network. We establish a tradeoff between the secure channel rate (for a node pair) and the secure network rate (sum over all node pair rates) and show that information-theoretic secrecy can be achieved asymptotically if and only if the sum rate of any subset of unhacked channels does not exceed the shared unhacked-secret-bit rate of these channels. We also propose a practical scheme that achieves a good balance of network and channel rates with information-theoretic secrecy guarantee. This work has a wide range of potential applications for which strong secrecy is desired, such as cyber-physical systems, distributed-control systems, and ad-hoc networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new algorithm, named Householder Dice (HD), for simulating dynamics on dense random matrix ensembles with rotational invariance. Examples include the Gaussian ensemble, the Haar-distributed random orthogonal ensemble, and their complex-valued counterparts. A “direct” approach to the simulation, where one first generates a dense $n \times n$ matrix from the ensemble, requires at least $\mathcal {O}(n^{2})$ resource in space and time. The HD algorithm overcomes this $\mathcal {O}(n^{2})$ bottleneck by using the principle of deferred decisions: rather than fixing the entire random matrix in advance, it lets the randomness unfold with the dynamics. At the heart of this matrix-free algorithm is an adaptive and recursive construction of (random) Householder reflectors. These orthogonal transformations exploit the group symmetry of the matrix ensembles, while simultaneously maintaining the statistical correlations induced by the dynamics. The memory and computation costs of the HD algorithm are $\mathcal {O}(nT)$ and $\mathcal {O}(nT^{2})$ , respectively, with $T$ being the number of iterations. When $T \ll n$ , which is nearly always the case in practice, the new algorithm leads to significant reductions in runtime and memory footprint. Numerical results demonstrate the promise of the HD algorithm as a new computational tool in the study of high-dimensional random systems.},

  abstract     = {We consider parameter estimation in distributed networks, where each sensor in the network observes an independent sample from an underlying distribution and has $k$ bits to communicate its sample to a centralized processor which computes an estimate of a desired parameter. We develop lower bounds for the minimax risk of estimating the underlying parameter for a large class of losses and distributions. Our results show that under mild regularity conditions, the communication constraint reduces the effective sample size by a factor of $d$ when $k$ is small, where $d$ is the dimension of the estimated parameter. Furthermore, this penalty reduces at most exponentially with increasing $k$ , which is the case for some models, e.g., estimating high-dimensional distributions. For other models however, we show that the sample size reduction is re-mediated only linearly with increasing $k$ , e.g. when some sub-Gaussian structure is available. We apply our results to the distributed setting with product Bernoulli model, multinomial model, Gaussian location models, and logistic regression which recover or strengthen existing results. Our approach significantly deviates from existing approaches for developing information-theoretic lower bounds for communication-efficient estimation. We circumvent the need for strong data processing inequalities used in prior work and develop a geometric approach which builds on a new representation of the communication constraint. This approach allows us to strengthen and generalize existing results with simpler and more transparent proofs.},

  abstract     = {The stochastic block model (SBM) is a random graph model in which the edges are generated according to the underlying cluster structure on the vertices. The (ferromagnetic) Ising model, on the other hand, assigns ±1 labels to vertices according to an underlying graph structure in a way that if two vertices are connected in the graph then they are more likely to be assigned the same label. In SBM, one aims to recover the underlying clusters from the graph structure while in Ising model, an extensively-studied problem is to recover the underlying graph structure based on i.i.d. samples (labelings of the vertices). In this paper, we propose a natural composition of SBM and the Ising model, which we call the Stochastic Ising Block Model (SIBM). In SIBM, we take SBM in its simplest form, where $n$ vertices are divided into two equal-sized clusters and the edges are connected independently with probability $p$ within clusters and $q$ across clusters. Then we use the graph $G$ generated by the SBM as the underlying graph of the Ising model and draw $m$ i.i.d. samples from it. The objective is to exactly recover the two clusters in SBM from the samples generated by the Ising model, without observing the graph $G$ . As the main result of this paper, we establish a sharp threshold $m^\ast $ on the sample complexity of this exact recovery problem in a properly chosen regime, where $m^\ast $ can be calculated from the parameters of SIBM. We show that when $m\ge m^\ast $ , one can recover the clusters from $m$ samples in $O(n)$ time as the number of vertices $n$ goes to infinity. When $m &amp;lt; m^\ast $ , we further show that for almost all choices of parameters of SIBM, the success probability of any recovery algorithms approaches 0 as $n\to \infty $ .},

Here $|.|$ takes element-wise magnitudes of a vector. The different matrices $\boldsymbol {A}_{k}$ are i.i.d. and each contains i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries. We obtain an improved guarantee for AltMinLowRaP, which is an Alternating Minimization solution to LRPR that was introduced and studied in our recent work. As long as the right singular vectors of ${ \boldsymbol {X}^{\ast}}$ satisfy the incoherence assumption, we can show that the AltMinLowRaP estimate converges geometrically to ${ \boldsymbol {X}^{\ast}}$ if the total number of measurements $mq \gtrsim nr^{2} (r + \log (1/\epsilon))$ . In addition, we also need $m \gtrsim max(r, \log q, \log n)$ because of the specific asymmetric nature of our problem. Compared to our recent work, we improve the sample complexity of the AltMin iterations by a factor of $r^{2}$ , and that of the initialization by a factor of $r$ . We argue, based on comparison with related well-studied problems, why the above sample complexity cannot be improved any further for non-convex solutions to LRPR.

  abstract     = {In our “big data” age, the size and complexity of data is steadily increasing. Methods for dimension reduction are ever more popular and useful. Two distinct types of dimension reduction are “data-oblivious” methods such as random projections and sketching, and “data-aware” methods such as principal component analysis (PCA). Both have their strengths, such as speed for random projections, and data-adaptivity for PCA. In this work, we study how to combine them to get the best of both. We study “sketch and solve” methods that take a random projection (or sketch) first, and compute PCA after. We compute the performance of several popular sketching methods (random iid projections, random sampling, subsampled Hadamard transform, CountSketch, etc) in a general “signal-plus-noise” (or spiked) data model. Compared to well-known works, our results are: 1) give asymptotically exact results; 2) apply when the signal components are only slightly above the noise, but the projection dimension is non-negligible. We also study stronger signals allowing more general covariance structures. We find that: 1) signal strength decreases under projection in a delicate way depending on the structure of the data and the sketching method; 2) orthogonal projections are slightly more accurate; 3) randomization does not hurt too much, due to concentration of measure; 4) the CountSketch can be somewhat improved by a normalization method. Our results have implications for statistical learning and data analysis. We also illustrate that the results are highly accurate in simulations and in analyzing empirical data.},

It is well-known that roughly $k$ measurements from a single sample are sufficient to recover the support. In the multiple sample setting, do $k$ overall measurements still suffice when only $m$ measurements per sample are allowed, with $m &amp;lt; k$ ? We answer this question in the negative by considering a generative model setting with independent samples drawn from a subgaussian prior. We show that $n=\Theta ((k^{2}/ m^{2})\cdot \log k(d- k))$ samples are necessary and sufficient to recover the support exactly. In turn, this shows that when $m &amp;lt; k$ , $k$ overall measurements are insufficient for support recovery ; instead we need about $m$ measurements each from $k^{2}/ m^{2}$ samples, and therefore $k^{2}/ m$ overall measurements are necessary.},

  abstract     = {We consider the high-dimensional linear regression problem, where the algorithmic goal is to efficiently infer an unknown feature vector $\beta ^{*}\in \mathbb {R}^{p}$ from its linear measurements, using a small number $n$ of samples. Unlike most of the literature, we make no sparsity assumption on $\beta ^{*}$ , but instead adopt a different regularization: In the noiseless setting, we assume $\beta ^{*}$ consists of entries, which are either rational numbers with a common denominator $Q\in \mathbb {Z}^{+}$ (referred to as $Q-$ rationality); or irrational numbers taking values in a rationally independent set of bounded cardinality, known to learner; collectively called as the mixed-range assumption. Using a novel combination of the Partial Sum of Least Squares (PSLQ) integer relation detection, and the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovász (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithms, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm which provably recovers a $\beta ^{*}\in \mathbb {R}^{p}$ enjoying the mixed-range assumption, from its linear measurements $Y=X\beta ^{*}\in \mathbb {R}^{n}$ for a large class of distributions for the random entries of $X$ , even with one measurement ( $n=1$ ). In the noisy setting, we propose a polynomial-time, lattice-based algorithm, which recovers a $\beta ^{*}\in \mathbb {R}^{p}$ enjoying the $Q-$ rationality property, from its noisy measurements $Y=X\beta ^{*}+W\in \mathbb {R}^{n}$ , even from a single sample ( $n=1$ ). We further establish that for large $Q$ , and normal noise, this algorithm tolerates information-theoretically optimal level of noise. We then apply these ideas to develop a polynomial-time, single-sample algorithm for the phase retrieval problem. Our methods address the single-sample ( $n=1$ ) regime, where the sparsity-based methods such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the Basis Pursuit are known to fail. Furthermore, our results also reveal algorithmic connections between the high-dimensional linear regression problem, and the integer relation detection, randomized subset-sum, and shortest vector problems.},

What is the minimum common feedback to the users needed to ensure that scheduling is collision-free? Instead of a naive scheme of listing the indices of the $k$ active users in the order in which they should transmit, at a cost of $k\log (n)$ bits, this paper shows that for the case of $b=k$ , the rate of the minimum fixed-length common feedback code scales only as $k \log (e)$ bits, plus an additive term that scales in $n$ as $\Theta (\log \log (n))$ for fixed $k$ . If a variable-length code can be used, assuming uniform activity among the users, the minimum average common feedback rate still requires $k \log (e)$ bits, but the dependence on $n$ can be reduced to $O(1)$ . When $b&amp;gt;k$ , the number of feedback bits needed for collision-free scheduling can be significantly further reduced. Moreover, a similar scaling on the minimum feedback rate is derived for the case of scheduling $m$ users per slot, when $k \le mb$ . The problem of constructing a minimum collision-free feedback scheduling code is connected to that of constructing a perfect hashing family, which allows practical feedback scheduling codes to be constructed from perfect hashing algorithms.},

MSR codes are attractive for use in distributed storage systems, and by now a variety of ingenious constructions of MSR codes are available. However, they all suffer from exponentially large sub-packetization $\ell \gtrsim r^{k/r}$ . Our main result is an almost tight lower bound showing that for an MSR code, one must have $\ell \geqslant \exp (\Omega (k/r))$ . Previously, a lower bound of $\approx \exp (\sqrt {k/r})$ , and a tight lower bound for a restricted class of “optimal access” MSR codes, were known.},

  abstract     = {Lifted Reed-Solomon and multiplicity codes are classes of codes, constructed from specific sets of $m$ -variate polynomials. These codes allow for the design of high-rate codes that can recover every codeword or information symbol from many disjoint sets. Recently, the underlying approaches have been combined for the bi-variate case to construct lifted multiplicity codes, a generalization of lifted codes that can offer further rate improvements. We continue the study of these codes by first establishing new lower bounds on the rate of lifted Reed-Solomon codes for any number of variables $m$ , which improve upon the known bounds for any $m\ge 4$ . Next, we use these results to provide lower bounds on the rate and distance of lifted multiplicity codes obtained from polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables, which improve upon the known results for any $m\ge 3$ . Specifically, we investigate a subcode of a lifted multiplicity code formed by the linear span of $m$ -variate monomials whose restriction to an arbitrary line in ${\mathbb {F}}_{q}^{m}$ is equivalent to a low-degree univariate polynomial. We find the tight asymptotic behavior of the fraction of such monomials when the number of variables $m$ is fixed and the alphabet size $q=2^\ell $ is large. Using these results, we give a new explicit construction of batch codes utilizing lifted Reed-Solomon codes. For some parameter regimes, these codes have a better trade-off between parameters than previously known batch codes. Further, we show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and the number of disjoint recovering sets for every codeword or information symbol than previously known constructions, thereby providing the best known PIR codes for some parameter regimes. Additionally, we present a new local self-correction algorithm for lifted multiplicity codes.},

If this decoder does not succeed, it may either fail to return a codeword or miscorrect to an incorrect codeword, and good upper bounds on the fraction of error matrices for which these events occur are known. The decoding algorithm immediately applies to interleaved alternant codes as well, i.e., the subfield subcodes of interleaved Reed–Solomon codes, but the fraction of decodable error matrices differs, since the error is now restricted to a subfield.

  abstract     = {In general coding theory, we often assume that error is observed in transferring or storing encoded symbols, while the process of encoding itself is error-free. Motivated by recent applications of coding theory, in this paper, we consider the case where the process of encoding is distributed and prone to error. We introduce the problem of distributed encoding, comprised of a set of $K \in \mathbb {N}$ isolated source nodes and $N \in \mathbb {N}$ encoding nodes. Each source node has one symbol from a finite field, which is sent to each of the encoding nodes. Each encoding node stores an encoded symbol from the same field, as a function of the received symbols. However, some of the source nodes are controlled by the adversary and may send different symbols to different encoding nodes. Depending on the number of the adversarial nodes, denoted by $\beta \in \mathbb {N}$ , and the cardinality of the set of symbols that each one generates, denoted by $v \in \mathbb {N}$ , the process of decoding from the encoded symbols could be impossible. Assume that a decoder connects to an arbitrary subset of $t \in \mathbb {N}$ encoding nodes and wants to decode the symbols of the honest nodes correctly, without necessarily identifying the sets of honest and adversarial nodes. An important characteristic of a distributed encoding system is $t^{*} \in \mathbb {N}$ , the minimum of such $t$ , which is a function of $K$ , $N$ , $\beta $ , and $v$ . In this paper, we study the distributed linear encoding system, i.e. one in which the encoding nodes use linear coding. We show that $t^{*}_{\textrm {Linear}}=K+2\beta (v-1)$ , if $N\ge K+2\beta (v-1)$ , and $t^{*}_{\textrm {Linear}}=N$ , if $N\le K+2\beta (v-1)$ . In order to achieve $t^{*}_{\textrm {Linear}}$ , we use random linear coding and show that in any feasible solution that the decoder finds, the messages of the honest nodes are decoded correctly. In order to prove the converse of the fundamental limit, we show that when the adversary behaves in a particular way, it can always confuse the decoder between two feasible solutions that differ in the message of at least one honest node.},

This work shows that erasure coding of data objects can flexibly handle skews in the request rates. Coding can help boost the service rate region , that is, increase the overall volume of data access requests that the system can handle. This paper aims to postulate the service rate region as an important consideration in the design of erasure-coded distributed systems. We highlight several open problems that can be grouped into two broad threads: 1) characterizing the service rate region of a given code and finding the optimal request allocation, and 2) designing the underlying erasure code for a given service rate region. As contributions along the first thread, we find the rate regions of maximum-distance-separable, locally repairable, and simplex codes. We show the effectiveness of hybrid codes that combine replication and erasure coding in terms of code design. We also discover fundamental connections between multi-set batch codes and the problem of maximizing the service rate region.},

Using the fact that a sphere $S^{2n-1}$ is foliated by manifolds $S_{\cos \eta }^{n-1} \times S_{\sin \eta }^{n-1}$ , $\eta \in [0,\pi /2]$ , we distribute points in dimension $2^{k}$ via a recursive algorithm from a basic construction in $\mathbb {R}^{4}$ . Our procedure outperforms some current constructive methods in several small-distance regimes and constitutes a compromise between achieving a large number of codewords for a minimum given distance and effective constructiveness with low encoding computational cost. Bounds for the asymptotic density are derived and compared with other constructions. The encoding process has storage complexity $O(n)$ and time complexity $O(n \log n)$ . We also propose a sub-optimal decoding procedure, which does not require storing the codebook and has time complexity $O(n \log n)$ .},

  abstract     = {The subblock energy-constrained codes (SECCs) and sliding window-constrained codes (SWCCs) have recently attracted attention due to various applications in communication systems such as simultaneous energy and information transfer. In a SECC, each codeword is divided into smaller non-overlapping windows, called subblocks, and every subblock is constrained to carry sufficient energy. In a SWCC, however, the energy constraint is enforced over every window. In this work, we focus on the binary channel, where sufficient energy is achieved theoretically by using relatively high weight codes, and study the bounded SECCs and bounded SWCCs, where the weight in every window is bounded between a minimum and maximum number. Particularly, we focus on the cases of parameters that there is no rate loss, i.e. the channel capacity is one, and propose two methods to construct capacity-approaching codes with low redundancy and linear-time complexity, based on Knuth’s balancing technique and sequence replacement technique. These methods can be further extended to construct SECCs and SWCCs. For certain codes parameters, our methods incur only one redundant bit. We also impose the minimum distance constraint for error correction capability of the designed codes, which helps to reduce the error propagation during decoding as well.},

Our results show that the case of ${\mathrm{ Geometric}}(p_{n})$ -length fragments and the case of deterministic length- $(1/p_{n})$ fragments are qualitatively different and, surprisingly, the capacity of the former is larger.

  abstract     = {Consider the following communication scenario. An encoder observes a stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it, under a constraint on the expected number of bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. The encoder and the decoder are synchronized in time. For a class of continuous Markov processes satisfying regularity conditions, we find the optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation mean-square error under the rate constraint. We show that the optimal encoding policy transmits a 1-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it to decide the running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and calculate its distortion-rate function. Furthermore, we show that the optimal causal code also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by a continuous Markov process and controlled by an additive control signal.},

In this paper, motivated by a coding problem for emerging memory technologies, a set of sequences which generalize the window property of de Bruijn sequences, on its shorter subsequences, are defined. These sequences can be also defined and viewed as constrained sequences. Hence, they will be called locally-constrained de Bruijn sequences and a set of such sequences will be called a locally-constrained de Bruijn code . Several properties and alternative definitions for such codes are examined and they are analyzed as generalized sequences in the de Bruijn graph (and its generalization) and as constrained sequences. Various enumeration techniques are used to compute the total number of sequences for any given set of parameters. A construction method of such codes from the theory of shift-register sequences is proposed. Finally, we show how these locally-constrained de Bruijn sequences and codes can be applied in constructions of codes for correcting synchronization errors in the $\ell $ -symbol read channel and in the racetrack memory channel. For this purpose, these codes are superior in their size to previously known codes.},

  abstract     = {We give a complete answer to the following basic question: “What is the maximal fraction of deletions or insertions tolerable by $q$ -ary list-decodable codes with non-vanishing information rate?” This question has been open even for binary codes, including the restriction to the binary insertion-only setting, where the best-known result was that a $\gamma \leq 0.707$ fraction of insertions is tolerable by some binary code family. For any desired $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$ , we construct a family of binary codes of positive rate which can be efficiently list-decoded from any combination of $\gamma $ fraction of insertions and $\delta $ fraction of deletions as long as $\gamma + 2\delta \leq 1 - \varepsilon $ . On the other hand, for any $\gamma, \delta $ with $\gamma + 2\delta = 1$ list-decoding is impossible. Our result thus precisely characterizes the feasibility region of binary list-decodable codes for insertions and deletions. We further generalize our result to codes over any finite alphabet of size $q$ . Surprisingly, our work reveals that the feasibility region for $q&amp;gt;2$ is not the natural generalization of the binary bound above. We provide tight upper and lower bounds that precisely pin down the feasibility region, which turns out to have a $(q-1)$ -piece-wise linear boundary whose $q$ corner-points lie on a quadratic curve. The main technical work in our results is proving the existence of code families of sufficiently large size with good list-decoding properties for any combination of $\delta,\gamma $ within the claimed feasibility region. We achieve this via an intricate analysis of codes introduced by [Bukh and Ma, 2014]. Finally, we give a simple yet powerful concatenation scheme for list-decodable insertion-deletion codes which transforms any such (non-efficient) code family (with vanishing information rate) into an efficiently decodable code family with constant rate.},

In certain settings, such as in the construction of polar codes, the output alphabet of $W$ is ‘too large’, and hence we replace $W$ by a channel $Q$ having a smaller output alphabet. We say that $Q$ is upgraded with respect to $W$ if $W$ is obtained from $Q$ by processing its output. In this case, the mutual information $I(P_{X},W)$ between the input and output of $W$ is upper-bounded by the mutual information $I(P_{X},Q)$ between the input and output of $Q$ . In this paper, we present an algorithm that produces an upgraded channel $Q$ from $W$ , as a function of $P_{X}$ and the required output alphabet size of $Q$ , denoted $L$ . We show that the difference in mutual informations is ‘small’. Namely, it is $O(L^{-2/(| \mathcal {X}|-1)})$ , where $| \mathcal {X}|$ is the size of the input alphabet. This power law of $L$ is optimal. We complement our analysis with numerical experiments which show that the developed algorithm improves upon the existing state-of-the-art algorithms also in non-asymptotic setups.},

Our study stems from the consideration of constructing universal capacity-achieving codes under low-complexity decoding algorithms, where universality refers to the fact that we are considering a family of channels with equal capacity. Consider, e.g., the right-regular sequence by Shokrollahi and the heavy-tail Poisson sequence by Luby et al . Both sequences are provably capacity-achieving under belief propagation decoding when transmission takes place over the binary erasure channel. In this paper we show that many existing capacity-achieving sequences of low-density parity-check codes are not universal under belief propagation decoding. We reveal that the key to showing this non-universality result is determined by the stability of the underlying codes. More concretely, for an ordered and complete channel family and a sequence of low-density parity-check code ensembles, we determine a stability threshold associated with them, which gives rise to a sufficient condition under which the sequence is not universal under belief propagation decoding. Moreover, we show that the same stability threshold applies to blockwise or bitwise maximum a posteriori decoding as well. We demonstrate how the stability threshold can determine an upper bound on the corresponding blockwise or bitwise maximum a posteriori threshold, revealing the operational significance of the stability threshold.},

At each time instant, the decoder receives $K$ new codewords from the observers, combines them with the past received codewords, and produces a minimum-distortion estimate of the latest block of $n$ source symbols. This scenario extends the classical one-shot CEO problem to multiple rounds of communication with communicators maintaining the memory of the past. We extend the Berger-Tung inner and outer bounds to the scenario with inter-block memory, showing that the minimum asymptotically (as $n \to \infty $ ) achievable sum rate required to achieve a target distortion is bounded by minimal directed mutual information problems. For the Gauss-Markov source observed via $K$ parallel AWGN channels, we show that the inner bound is tight and solve the corresponding minimal directed mutual information problem, thereby establishing the minimum asymptotically achievable sum rate. Finally, we explicitly bound the rate loss due to a lack of communication among the observers; that bound is attained with equality in the case of identical observation channels. The general coding theorem is proved via a new nonasymptotic bound that uses stochastic likelihood coders and whose asymptotic analysis yields an extension of the Berger-Tung inner bound to the causal setting. The analysis of the Gaussian case is facilitated by reversing the channels of the observers.},

We provide a tight representation of the optimal communication rates via linear programming, and more importantly, propose explicit algorithms for the optimal distributed simulation for a wide class of hypergraphs. In particular, the optimal communication rate in complete hypergraphs is still achievable in sparser hypergraphs containing a path-connected cycle-free cluster of topologically connected components. Some key steps in analyzing the upper bounds rely on two different definitions of connectivity in hypergraphs, which may be of independent interest.},

Due in part to a crucial relation between the variable-length and fixed-length compression problems, our analysis requires a careful and refined analysis of the fundamental limits of fixed-length compression in the setting where the error probabilities are allowed to approach either zero or one polynomially in the blocklength. To obtain the refinements, we employ tools from moderate deviations and strong large deviations. Finally, we provide the third-order asymptotics for the problem of variable-length compression with non-vanishing error probabilities. We show that unlike several other information-theoretic problems in which the third-order asymptotics are known, for the problem of interest here, the third-order term depends on the permissible error probability.},

We provide the asymptotic distribution and we show that it differs when the values taken by the marginal distribution of the process are equiprobable (a situation that we call degeneracy ) and when they are not.

In contrast to other interactive capacity definitions in the literature, this definition makes no assumptions on the order of speakers (which can be adaptive) and does not allow any use of private/public randomness; hence, the essential interactive capacity is a function of the channel model only. It is shown that the essential interactive capacity of any binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel is at least 0.0302 its Shannon capacity. To that end, we present a simple coding scheme, based on extended-Hamming codes combined with error detection, that achieves the lower bound in the special case of the binary symmetric channel (BSC). We then adapt the scheme to the entire family of BMS channels, and show that it achieves the same lower bound using extremes of the Bhattacharyya parameter.},

In this article, we consider this problem under a sampling control constraint when one is allowed, at each point in time, to sample a single process. The objective is to raise an alarm as quickly as possible subject to a proper false alarm constraint. We show that under sampling control, a simple myopic-sampling-based sequential change-point detection strategy is second-order asymptotically optimal when the number $M$ of processes is fixed. This means that the proposed detector, even by sampling with a rate $1/M$ of the full rate, enjoys the same detection delay, up to some additive finite constant, as the optimal procedure.

In this paper, new bounds on the restricted isometry constants $\delta _{{{ tk}}}$ ( $0 &amp;lt; {t} &amp;lt; \frac {4}{3}{d}$ ), where $d$ is a key constant determined by prior support information, are established to guarantee the sparse signal recovery via the weighted $\ell _{{p}}$ minimization in both noiseless and noisy settings. This result fills a vacancy on $\delta _{{{ tk}}}$ with $0 &amp;lt; {t} &amp;lt; \frac {4}{3}{d}$ , compared with previous works on $\delta _{{{ tk}}}$ ( ${t} \geqslant \frac {4}3{d}$ ). We show that, when the accuracy of prior support estimate is at least 50\%, the new recovery condition in terms of $\delta _{{{ tk}}}$ ( $0 &amp;lt; {t} &amp;lt; \frac {4}{3}{d}$ ) via weighted $\ell _{1}$ minimization is weaker than the condition required by classical $\ell _{1}$ minimization without weighting. Our weighted $\ell _{1}$ minimization gives better recovery error bounds in noisy setting. Similarly, the new recovery condition in terms of $\delta _{{{ tk}}}$ ( $0 &amp;lt; {t} &amp;lt; \frac {4}{3}{d}$ ) is extended to weighted $\ell _{{p}}$ ( $0 &amp;lt; {p} &amp;lt; 1$ ) minimization, and it is also weaker than the condition obtained by standard non-convex $\ell _{{p}}$ ( $0 &amp;lt; {p} &amp;lt; 1$ ) minimization without weighting.

Briefly, we transform the completeness of $\mathcal F$ into showing the permutation properties of two polynomials over $\mathbb F_{q}$ obtained from these $f_{i}$ ’s. Then, following the wide applications, we investigate the constructions of linear complete permutations over $\mathbb F_{2}^{n}$ based on the rotations and XOR s. The following two cases are considered: the first one is to use some different circularly left shift transforms $f_{i}$ ’s and the second one is to assume $f_{i}$ ’s are of the form $b_{i}f$ with a fixed $f$ and different $b_{i}$ ’s in $\mathbb F_{q}$ . In both cases, we show that the completeness of the permutation is closely related to the ranks of some matrices with particular forms, which can be determined by the cycle decomposition of the permutation over the $n$ branches. Besides, we present several explicit linear complete permutations which might be used in the design as well as the provable security of cryptographic schemes.},

We analyze the generalized construction for four different instantiations: two possible layer functions that are in turn instantiated with either a block cipher or a pseudorandom function. We prove that each of these instantiations gives a stream cipher that is pseudorandom and forward secure in the multi-user setting with a very tight bound. A comprehensive analysis shows that the two block cipher based instantiations achieve very similar bounds. For the pseudorandom function based instantiations there is no clear winner: either layer can be beneficial over the other one, depending on the choice of parameters. By instantiating the pseudorandom function with a generic construction such as the sum of permutations, we obtain a highly efficient and competitive stream cipher based on an n-bit block cipher that is secure beyond the $2^{\text {n}/2}$ birthday bound.},

It has recently been highlighted that such functions also play an important role in a new framework related to side-channel attack counter-measures. Since then, the interest in correlation immune Boolean functions has been renewed, and new challenges regarding these functions have appeared. Specifically, low Hamming weight correlation immune functions have been selected as useful for counter-measures to side-channel attacks. Despite their importance, the literature is not abundant in this research direction. Two very interesting articles in which such correlation immune functions were nicely explored, given this novel use of them. Carlet initiated the first one in 2013, and the second one is due to Carlet and Chen (2018). This paper deals with correlation immune Boolean functions aiming to produce more candidates of those processing low Hamming weights. We shall focus on correlation immune Boolean functions with Hamming weights power of 2 (which offer a flexibility to control the correlation immunity aspects) and present several methods of designing them. Some design methods are efficient and could be employed to derive such functions. Consequently, given two positive integers $n$ and $m$ , we derive new effective constructions of correlation immune Boolean functions with Hamming weight power of 2. Furthermore, an upper bound on the correlation immunity of the newly constructed $n$ -variable Boolean functions with Hamming weight $2^{m}$ was determined for $n-m\ge 0$ . Besides, exact values and lower bounds on the maximum correlation immunity of those functions are explored and discussed, mainly when the values of $n$ and $m$ are very close. This paper also exhibits explicit examples of those correlation immune functions that illustrate our methods.},

In the first model, if a new update arrives when the service is busy, it is blocked; in the second model, a new update preempts the current update in service. For the blocking model, we first derive an exact age expression for G/G/1/1 systems. Then, using the age expression for G/G/1/1 systems, we calculate average age expressions for special cases, i.e., M/G/1/1 and G/M/1/1 systems. We observe that deterministic interarrivals minimize the average age of G/M/1/1 systems for a given mean interarrival time. Next, for the preemption in service model, we first derive an exact average age expression for G/G/1/1 systems. Then, similar to blocking discipline, using the age expression for G/G/1/1 systems, we calculate average age expressions for special cases, i.e., M/G/1/1 and G/M/1/1 systems. Average age for G/M/1/1 can be written as a summation of two terms, the first of which depends only on the first and second moments of interarrival times and the second of which depends only on the service rate. In other words, interarrival and service times are decoupled. We prove that deterministic interarrivals are optimum for G/M/1/1 systems for a given mean interarrival time. On the other hand, we observe for non-exponential service times that the optimal distribution of interarrival times depends on the relative values of the mean interarrival time and the mean service time. Finally, we propose a simple to calculate upper bound to the average age for the preemption in service discipline.},

  abstract     = {A private proximity retrieval ( PPR ) scheme is a protocol which allows a user to retrieve the identities of all records in a database that are within some distance $r$ from the user’s record $x$ . The user’s privacy at each server is given by the fraction of the record $x$ that is kept private. In this paper, this research is initiated and protocols that offer trade-offs between privacy, computational complexity, and storage are studied. In particular, we assume that each server stores a copy of the database and study the required minimum number of servers by our protocol which provides a given privacy level. Each server receives a query in the protocol and the set of queries forms a code. The main focus in the paper is dedicated to studying the family of codes generated by the set of queries. These codes will be shown to satisfy a specific covering property and will be called private proximity retrieval intersection covering codes . In particular, since the query every server receives is a codeword, the goal is to minimize the number of codewords in such a code which is the minimum number of servers required by the protocol. These codes are closely related to a family of codes known as covering designs . We introduce several lower bounds on the sizes of such codes as well as several constructions. This work focuses on the case when the records are binary vectors together with the Hamming distance. Other metrics such as the Johnson metric are also investigated.},

An obvious example is the incognito mode in internet browsers. But beyond internet browsing, ON-OFF privacy can be a desired feature in most online applications. The challenge is that the statistical correlation over time of a user’s online behavior can lead to leakage of information. We consider the setting in which a user is interested in retrieving the latest message generated by one of $N$ sources. The user’s privacy status can change between ON and OFF over time. When privacy is ON the user wants to hide his request. Moreover, since the user’s requests depend on personal attributes such as age, gender, and political views, they are typically correlated over time. As a consequence, the user cannot simply ignore privacy when privacy is OFF. We model the correlation between user’s requests by an $N$ state Markov chain. The goal is to design query schemes with optimal download rate, that preserve privacy in an ON-OFF privacy setting. In this paper, we present inner and outer bounds on the achievable download rate for $N$ sources. We also devise an efficient algorithm to construct an ON-OFF privacy scheme achieving the inner bound and prove its optimality in the case $N=2$ sources. For $N &amp;gt; 2$ , finding tighter outer bounds and efficient constructions of ON-OFF privacy schemes that would achieve them remains an open question.},

It is assumed that ${\mathbf{A}}_{s}\in \mathbb {F}_{q}^{L\times K}, {\mathbf{B}}_{s}\in \mathbb {F}_{q}^{K\times M}, s\in {1,2,\cdots, S}$ are uniformly and independently distributed and $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ is a large finite field. The rate of an SDBMM scheme is defined as the ratio of the number of bits of desired information that is retrieved, to the total number of bits downloaded on average. The supremum of achievable rates is called the capacity of SDBMM. In this work we explore the capacity of SDBMM, as well as several of its variants, e.g., where the user may already have either ${\mathbf{A}}$ or ${\mathbf{B}}$ available as side-information, and/or where the security constraint for either ${\mathbf{A}}$ or ${\mathbf{B}}$ may be relaxed. We obtain converse bounds, as well as achievable schemes for various cases of SDBMM, depending on the $L, K, M, N, X$ parameters, and identify parameter regimes where these bounds match. In particular, the capacity for securely computing a batch of outer products of two vectors is $(1-X/N)^{+}$ , for a batch of inner products of two (long) vectors the capacity approaches $(1-2X/N)^{+}$ as the length of the vectors approaches infinity, and in general for sufficiently large $K$ (e.g., $K &amp;gt; 2\min (L,M)$ ), the capacity $C$ is bounded as $(1-2X/N)^{+}\leq C &amp;lt; (1-X/N)^{+}$ . A remarkable aspect of our upper bounds is a connection between SDBMM and a form of private information retrieval (PIR) problem, known as multi-message $X$ -secure $T$ -private information retrieval (MM-XSTPIR). Notable features of our achievable schemes include the use of cross-subspace alignment and a transformation argument that converts a scalar multiplication problem into a scalar addition problem, allowing a surprisingly efficient solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to address two fundamental challenges arising in eigenvector estimation and inference for a low-rank matrix from noisy observations: 1) how to estimate an unknown eigenvector when the eigen-gap (i.e. the spacing between the associated eigenvalue and the rest of the spectrum) is particularly small; 2) how to perform estimation and inference on linear functionals of an eigenvector—a sort of “fine-grained” statistical reasoning that goes far beyond the usual $\ell _{2}$ analysis. We investigate how to address these challenges in a setting where the unknown $n\times n$ matrix is symmetric and the additive noise matrix contains independent (and non-symmetric) entries. Based on eigen-decomposition of the asymmetric data matrix, we propose estimation and uncertainty quantification procedures for an unknown eigenvector, which further allow us to reason about linear functionals of an unknown eigenvector. The proposed procedures and the accompanying theory enjoy several important features: 1) distribution-free (i.e. prior knowledge about the noise distributions is not needed); 2) adaptive to heteroscedastic noise; 3) minimax optimal under Gaussian noise. Along the way, we establish valid procedures to construct confidence intervals for the unknown eigenvalues. All this is guaranteed even in the presence of a small eigen-gap (up to $O(\sqrt {n/\mathrm {poly}\log (n)}\,)$ times smaller than the requirement in prior theory), which goes significantly beyond what generic matrix perturbation theory has to offer.},

We build upon this fact and introduce a mathematical formulation to obtain upper bounds on this relative entropy. Assuming that the data is discrete, we then develop a strategy using this formulation, based on the method of types and typicality, to find explicit upper bounds on the generalization error of stable algorithms, i.e., algorithms that produce similar output hypotheses given similar input datasets.

  abstract     = {In compressed sensing, the restricted isometry property (RIP) on $M \times N$ sensing matrices (where $M &amp;lt; N$ ) guarantees efficient reconstruction of sparse vectors. A matrix has the $(s,\delta)$ - $\mathsf {RIP}$ property if behaves as a $\delta $ -approximate isometry on $s$ -sparse vectors. It is well known that an $M\times N$ matrix with i.i.d. $\mathcal {N}(0,1/M)$ entries is $(s,\delta)$ - $\mathsf {RIP}$ with high probability as long as $s\lesssim \delta ^{2}~M/\log N$ . On the other hand, most prior works aiming to deterministically construct $(s,\delta)$ - $\mathsf {RIP}$ matrices have failed when $s \gg \sqrt {M}$ . An alternative way to find an RIP matrix could be to draw a random gaussian matrix and certify that it is indeed RIP. However, there is evidence that this certification task is computationally hard when $s \gg \sqrt {M}$ , both in the worst case and the average case. In this paper, we investigate the exact average-case time complexity of certifying the RIP property for $M\times N$ matrices with i.i.d. $\mathcal {N}(0,1/M)$ entries, in the “possible but hard” regime $\sqrt {M} \ll s\lesssim M/\log N$ . Based on analysis of the low-degree likelihood ratio, we give rigorous evidence that subexponential runtime $N^{\tilde \Omega (s^{2}/M)}$ is required, demonstrating a smooth tradeoff between the maximum tolerated sparsity and the required computational power. This lower bound is essentially tight, matching the runtime of an existing algorithm due to Koiran and Zouzias. Our hardness result allows $\delta $ to take any constant value in (0, 1), which captures the relevant regime for compressed sensing. This improves upon the existing average-case hardness result of Wang et al. , which is limited to $\delta = o(1)$ .},

Among these variants, OFDM with subcarrier number modulation (OFDM-SNM) has been proven to be efficient for simple communication systems with low constellation modulation orders and limited decoding capability. To rigorously verify the performance advantages of OFDM-SNM, we present the study of OFDM-SNM in this paper from the information-theoretic perspective. In particular, we determine an upper bound on the mutual information of OFDM-SNM in closed form by using the log sum inequality. Also, we analyze the optimal pattern utilization probabilities (PUPs) for OFDM-SNM by channel-dependent coding and propose an easy-to-implement iterative algorithm to approach the optimal PUPs. Moreover, considering the practical achievability, we propose a Huffman coding based achievable PUP vector construction scheme to obtain the achievable PUPs and the corresponding achievable rate. We carry out numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of this study and illustrate the efficiency of the obtained PUPs in comparison with several benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Uplink-downlink duality refers to the fact that under a sum-power constraint, the capacity regions of a Gaussian multiple-access channel and a Gaussian broadcast channel with Hermitian transposed channel matrices are identical. This paper generalizes this result to a cooperative cellular network, in which remote access-points are deployed as relays in serving the users under the coordination of a central processor (CP). In this model, the users and the relays are connected over noisy wireless links, while the relays and the CP are connected over noiseless but rate-limited fronthaul links. Based on a Lagrangian technique, this paper establishes a duality relationship between such a multiple-access relay channel and broadcast relay channel, under the assumption that the relays use compression-based strategies. Specifically, we show that under the same total transmit power constraint and individual fronthaul rate constraints, the achievable rate regions of the Gaussian multiple-access and broadcast relay channels are identical, when either independent compression or Wyner-Ziv and multivariate compression strategies are used. The key observations are that if the beamforming vectors at the relays are fixed, the sum-power minimization problems under the achievable rate and fronthaul constraints in both the uplink and the downlink can be transformed into either a linear programming or a semidefinite programming problem depending on the compression technique, and that the uplink and downlink problems are Lagrangian duals of each other. Moreover, the dual variables corresponding to the downlink rate constraints become the uplink powers; the dual variables corresponding to the downlink fronthaul constraints become the uplink quantization noises. This duality relationship enables an efficient algorithm for optimizing the downlink transmission and relaying strategies based on the uplink.},

We establish a new criterion to evaluate the covertness of the communication between Alice and Bob, and investigate the performance of covert communication accordingly. Subject to the proposed constraint on covertness, we investigate the feasible transmit power and transmission duration under three SCPD algorithms, namely, the Shewhart test, the finite moving average chart (FMAC), and the cumulative sum (CUSUM) test, and characterize how the covert communication throughput scales with the average run length to false alarm (ARL2FA) of Willie’s detector as the ARL2FA increases without bound. Our theoretical results can be viewed as upper bounds on the covert communication throughput that can be achieved, and we show that compared with the case where Willie performs the CUSUM test, Alice and Bob achieve a higher covert communication throughput if Willie performs the Shewhart test or the FMAC.},

  abstract     = {The two-user Gaussian interference channel (G-IC) is revisited, with a particular focus on practically amenable discrete input signalling and treating interference as noise (TIN) receivers. The corresponding deterministic interference channel (D-IC) is first investigated and coding schemes that can achieve the entire capacity region of the D-IC under TIN are proposed. These schemes are then systematically translated into multi-layer superposition coding schemes based on purely discrete inputs for the real-valued G-IC. Our analysis shows that the proposed scheme is able to achieve the entire capacity region to within a constant gap for all channel parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first constant-gap result under purely discrete signalling and TIN for the entire capacity region and all the interference regimes. Furthermore, the approach is extended to obtain coding schemes based on discrete inputs for the complex-valued G-IC. For such a scenario, the minimum distance and the achievable rate of the proposed scheme under TIN are analyzed, which takes into account the effects of random phase rotations introduced by the channels. Simulation results show that our scheme is capable of approaching the capacity region of the complex-valued G-IC and significantly outperforms Gaussian signalling with TIN in various interference regimes.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes the Guruswami-Sudan (GS) list decoding algorithm for one-point elliptic codes, in which the interpolation is realized by the module basis reduction (BR). Elliptic codes are a kind of algebraic-geometric (AG) codes with a genus of one. Over the same finite field, they have a greater codeword length than Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, capable of correcting more errors. The GS decoding consists of interpolation and root-finding, while the former that determines the interpolation polynomial $\mathcal {Q}(\text {x}, \text {y}, \text {z})$ dominates the decoding complexity. By defining the Lagrange interpolation function over an elliptic function field, a basis of the interpolation module can be constructed. The desired Gröbner basis that contains $\mathcal {Q}(\text {x}, \text {y}, \text {z})$ can be determined by reducing the constructed basis. This is namely the BR interpolation and it requires less finite field arithmetic operations than the conventional Kötter’s interpolation, facilitating the GS decoding. Re-encoding transform (ReT) is further introduced to facilitate the BR interpolation. This work also shows that both the BR interpolation and its ReT variant will have a lower complexity as the code rate ${k}/{n}$ increases, where n and ${k}$ are the length and dimension of the code, respectively. Our numerical results demonstrate the complexity advantage of the BR interpolation over Kötter’s interpolation, and the performance advantage of elliptic codes over RS codes.},

  abstract     = {The basic goal of threshold group testing is to identify up to $d$ defective items among a population of $n$ items, where $d$ is usually much smaller than $n$ . The outcome of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset has at least $u$ defective items, negative if it has up to $\ell $ defective items, where $0 \leq \ell &amp;lt; u$ , and arbitrary otherwise. This is called threshold group testing. The parameter $g = u - \ell - 1$ is called the gap . In this paper, we focus on the case $g &amp;gt; 0$ , i.e., threshold group testing with a gap. Note that the results presented here are also applicable to the case $g = 0$ ; however, the results are not as efficient as those in related work. Currently, a few reported studies have investigated test designs and decoding algorithms for identifying defective items. Most of the previous studies have not been feasible because there are numerous constraints on their problem settings or the decoding complexities of their proposed schemes are relatively large. Therefore, it is compulsory to reduce the number of tests as well as the decoding complexity, i.e., the time for identifying the defective items, for achieving practical schemes. The work presented here makes five contributions. The first is a more accurate theorem for a non-adaptive algorithm for threshold group testing proposed by Chen and Fu. The second is an improvement in the construction of disjunct matrices, which are the main tools for tackling (threshold) group testing and other tasks such as constructing cover-free families or learning hidden graphs. Specifically, we present a better exact upper bound on the number of tests for disjunct matrices compared with that in related work. The third and fourth contributions are a reduced exact upper bound on the number of tests and a reduced asymptotic bound on the decoding time for identifying defective items in a noisy setting on test outcomes. The fifth contribution is a simulation on the number of tests of the resulting improvements for previous work and the proposed theorems.},

This paper contains the following contributions. First, we establish the closed-form expression of the minimum update bandwidth attainable by irregular array codes. Second, after defining a class of irregular array codes, called Minimum Update Bandwidth (MUB) codes, which achieve the minimum update bandwidth of irregular array codes, we determine the smallest code redundancy attainable by MUB codes. Third, the code parameters, with which the minimum code redundancy of irregular array codes and the smallest code redundancy of MUB codes can be equal, are identified, which allows us to define MR-MUB codes as a class of irregular array codes that simultaneously achieve the minimum code redundancy and the minimum update bandwidth. Fourth, we introduce explicit code constructions of MR-MUB codes and MUB codes with the smallest code redundancy. Fifth, we establish a lower bound of the update complexity of MR-MUB codes, which can be used to prove that the minimum update complexity of irregular array codes may not be achieved by MR-MUB codes. Last, we construct a class of $(n = k + 2, k)$ vertical maximum-distance separable (MDS) array codes that can achieve all of the minimum code redundancy, the minimum update bandwidth and the optimal repair bandwidth of irregular array codes.},

Then, the channels’ outputs, received by the decoder, are used to recover the transmitted sequence, and the main problem under this paradigm is to calculate the minimum number of channels that enables unique reconstruction of the transmitted word. This problem is equivalent to finding the size of the largest intersection of channels’ outputs sets received after transmitting distinct codewords. Motivated by the error behavior observed in DNA storage systems, the present work extends the study of the reconstruction model to the case in which a binary word is transmitted over channels prone to substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Furthermore, we also study the size of the error balls generated by either one deletion and at most a fixed number of substitutions or one insertion and at most one substitution in a binary word. For the case of only substitutions, we present a decoder of optimal complexity, which improves upon a recent construction of such a decoder. Lastly, a simplification of that decoder is studied in case there are more channels than the minimum required number.},

  abstract     = {In caching system, it is desirable to design a coded caching scheme with the transmission load $R$ and subpacketization $F$ as small as possible, in order to improve efficiency of transmission in the peak traffic times and to decrease implementation complexity. Yan et al. reformulated the centralized coded caching scheme as designing a corresponding $F\times K$ array called placement delivery array (PDA), where $F$ is the subpacketization and $K$ is the number of users. Motivated by several constructions of PDAs, we introduce a framework for constructing PDAs, where each row is indexed by a row vector of some matrix called row index matrix and each column’s index is labelled by an element of a direct product set. Using this framework, a new scheme is obtained, which can be regarded as a generalization of some previously known schemes. When $K$ is equal to ${\binom{m}{ t}}q^{t}$ for positive integers $m$ , $t$ with $t &amp;lt; m$ and $q\geq 2$ , we show that the row index matrix must be an orthogonal array if all the users have the same memory size. Furthermore, the row index matrix must be a covering array if the coded gain is ${\binom{m}{ t}}$ , which is the maximal coded gain under our framework. Consequently the lower bounds on the transmission load and subpacketization of the schemes are derived under our framework. Finally, using orthogonal arrays as the row index matrix, we obtain two more explicit classes of schemes which have significantly advantages on the subpacketization while the transmission load is equal or close to that of the schemes constructed by Shangguan et al. for the same number of users and memory size.},

Some strategies can be used to improve the parameters of these codes. For example, entanglement can provide a way for quantum error-correcting codes to achieve higher rates than the one obtained by means of the traditional stabilizer formalism. Such codes are called entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes. In this paper, we utilize algebraic geometry codes to construct several families of EAQEC codes derived from the Euclidean and the Hermitian construction. Three families constructed here consist of codes whose quantum Singleton defect is equal to zero, one, or two. We also construct families of EAQEC codes with an encoding rate exceeding the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Additionally, asymptotically good towers of linear complementary dual codes are used to obtain asymptotically good families of EAQEC codes consuming maximal entanglement. Furthermore, a simple comparison with the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound demonstrates that, by utilizing the proposed construction, it is possible to generate an asymptotically family of EAQEC codes that exceeds this bound.},

  abstract     = {Deletion errors are notoriously difficult to correct. The capacity of the binary deletion channel is not yet fully known, and there is no completely satisfactory solution even to the specific problem of correcting only two deletion errors. In this paper, we show that polarization theory, along with the powerful methods of polar coding and successive-cancellation decoding, can be extended to channels with deletion errors. Our results further generalize to channels corrupted by insertion errors and/or combinations of insertions and deletions. It was recently proposed to correct deletion errors using polar codes designed for the BEC, precoded with a sufficiently powerful CRC code. In this approach, in order to correct ${d}$ deletions in a codeword of length ${n}$ , successive-cancellation decoding is run separately for each of the $\binom {n}{d}$ possible deletion patterns, while treating the deleted symbols as erasures. The resulting complexity of decoding is ${O}\bigl ({n}^{d+1}\log {n}\bigr)$ . In contrast, we develop herein a natural generalization of successive-cancellation decoding to channels with deletion errors. Our algorithm is based on the recursive structure of polar codes, processing the channel output in ${m} = \log _{2} {n}$ decoding layers, just like the conventional successive-cancellation decoder. Every node in each decoding layer propagates its uncertainty about the deletion pattern to the nodes in the next layer and, eventually, the correct deletion pattern becomes visible at the decoder output, with high probability. This makes it possible to consider at most $\binom {d+2}{2}$ scenarios at each node, and the overall decoding complexity is only ${O}\bigl ({d}^{3} {n} \log {n}\bigr)$ , which scales polynomially rather than exponentially with the number of deletions. Based on the proposed algorithm, we also investigate the channel polarization phenomenon. We are able to prove weak polarization where the number of deletions ${d}$ is small, i.e. ${d}={o}({n})$ . We also conjecture the strong polarization for when ${d}={O}(1)$ and provide some evidence to support this conjecture. The strong polarization, if proven, implies that our coding scheme achieves the capacity of any binary-input symmetric channel which furthermore introduces a constant number of deletions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a recently-proposed model of teaching and learning under uncertainty, in which a teacher receives independent observations of a single bit corrupted by binary symmetric noise, and sequentially transmits to a student through another binary symmetric channel based on the bits observed so far. After a given number $n$ of transmissions, the student outputs an estimate of the unknown bit, and we are interested in the exponential decay rate of the error probability as $n$ increases. We propose a novel block-structured teaching strategy in which the teacher encodes the number of 1s received in each block, and show that the resulting error exponent is the binary relative entropy $D\left({\frac {1}{2}\|\max (p,q)}\right)$ , where $p$ and $q$ are the noise parameters. This matches a trivial converse result based on the data processing inequality, and settles two conjectures of [Jog and Loh, 2021] and [Huleihel et al. , 2019]. In addition, we show that the computation time required by the teacher and student is linear in $n$ . We also study a more general setting in which the binary symmetric channels are replaced by general binary-input discrete memoryless channels. We provide an achievability bound and a converse bound, and show that the two coincide in certain cases, including (i) when the two channels are identical, and (ii) when the student-teacher channel is a binary symmetric channel. More generally, we give sufficient conditions under which our learning rate is the best possible for block-structured protocols.},

It is well-known that the capacity-achieving input distribution for this channel is discrete with finitely many points. We sharpen this result by introducing upper and lower bounds on the number of mass points. Concretely, an upper bound of order $\mathsf {A}\log ^{2}(\mathsf {A})$ and a lower bound of order $\sqrt { \mathsf {A}}$ are established where $\mathsf {A}$ is the constraint on the input amplitude. In addition, along the way, we show several other properties of the capacity and capacity-achieving distribution. For example, it is shown that the capacity is equal to $- \log P_{Y^\star }(0)$ where $P_{Y^\star }$ is the optimal output distribution. Moreover, an upper bound on the values of the probability masses of the capacity-achieving distribution and a lower bound on the probability of the largest mass point are established. Furthermore, on the per-symbol basis, a nonvanishing lower bound on the probability of error for detecting the capacity-achieving distribution is established under the maximum a posteriori rule.},

  abstract     = {We consider a point–to–point communication system, where in addition to the encoder and the decoder, there is a helper that observes non–causally the realization of the noise vector and provides a (lossy) rate– $ {R}_{{ \text { h}}}$ description of it to the encoder ( $ {R}_{{ \text { h}}} &amp;lt; \infty $ ). In continuation to Lapidoth and Marti (2020), who derived the capacity of this model, here our focus is on error exponents. We consider both continuous–alphabet, additive white Gaussian channels and finite–alphabet, modulo–additive channels, and for each one of them, we study the cases of both fixed–rate and variable–rate noise descriptions by the helper. Our main finding is that, as long as the channel–coding rate, R, is below the helper–rate, $ {R}_{{ \text { h}}}$ , the achievable error exponent is unlimited (i.e., it can be made arbitrarily large), and in some of the cases, it is even strictly infinite (i.e., the error probability can be made strictly zero). However, in the range of coding rates $( {R}_{{ \text { h}}}, {R}_{{ \text { h}}}+ {C}_{0})$ , C 0 being the ordinary channel capacity (without help), the best achievable error exponent is finite and strictly positive, although there is a certain gap between our upper bound (converse bound) and lower bound (achievability) on the highest achievable error exponent. This means that the model of encoder–assisted communication is essentially equivalent to a model, where in addition to the noisy channel between the encoder and decoder, there is also a parallel noiseless bit–pipe of capacity $ {R}_{{ \text { h}}}$ . We also extend the scope to the Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC) and characterize the rate sub–region, where the achievable error exponent is unlimited or even infinite.},

Using random codewords uniformly distributed on a sphere and a maximum likelihood decoder, the derived MAC bound on each transmitter’s rate matches the MolavianJazi-Laneman bound (2015) in its first- and second-order terms, improving the remaining terms to $\frac {1}2\frac {\log {n}}{n}+{O} \left ({\frac {1}{n}}\right)$ bits per channel use. The result $\vphantom {\sum ^{R}}$ then extends to a RAC model in which neither the encoders nor the decoder knows which of ${K}$ possible transmitters are active. In the proposed rateless coding strategy, decoding occurs at a time ${n}_{t}$ that depends on the decoder’s estimate ${t}$ of the number of active transmitters ${k}$ . Single-bit feedback from the decoder to all encoders at each potential decoding time ${n}_{i}$ , ${i} \leq {t}$ , informs the encoders when to stop transmitting. For this RAC model, the proposed code achieves the same first-, second-, and third-order performance as the best known result for the Gaussian MAC in operation.},

We first list many open questions about it. We study its algebraic normal form and its bivariate representation. We characterize its linear structures and specify nonexistence cases; we show, for n even, their relation with the bent components of F. We pose three related open problems. We characterize further in terms of γ F the fact that a component function of F is bent and study if the number of bent components can be optimal. We consider in particular two classes, one of which is that of APN power functions. We study more deeply the relation between the Walsh transform of γ F and the Walsh transform of F. By applying the Titsworth relation to the Walsh transform W γF , we deduce a new relation satisfied by W F 2 , which is as simple as Chabaud-Vaudenay&#39;s characterization by the fourth moment of the Walsh transform (which is in fact a particular case of the new relation), and provides more information. From this new relation, we deduce, for a sub-class of APN functions, a lower bound on the nonlinearity, which is significantly stronger than nl(F) &gt; 0 (the only general known bound). This sub-class of APN functions includes all known APN functions. The question (which is another open problem that we state) arises whether this sub-class equals that of all APN functions, but our bound provides at least a beginning of explanation why all known APN functions have non-weak nonlinearity. We finally show how the nonlinearities of γ F and F are related by a simple formula; this leads to a last open problem.},

Users employ exactly the same codebook, and the task of the receiver is to decode the list of transmitted messages. We present a concatenated coding construction for U-RA on the AWGN channel, in which a sparse regression code (SPARC) is used as an inner code to create an effective outer OR-channel. Then an outer code is used to resolve the multiple-access interference in the OR-MAC. We propose a modified version of the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm as an inner decoder and give a precise asymptotic analysis of the error probabilities of the AMP decoder and of a hypothetical optimal inner MAP decoder. This analysis shows that the concatenated construction under optimal decoding can achieve a vanishing per-user error probability in the limit of large blocklength and a large number of active users at sum-rates up to the symmetric Shannon capacity, i.e. as long as K a R 2 (1+K a SNR). This extends previous point-to-point optimality results about SPARCs to the unsourced multiuser scenario. Furthermore, we give an optimization algorithm to find the power allocation for the inner SPARC code that minimizes the SNR required to achieve a given target per-user error probability with the AMP decoder.},

  abstract     = {Inhomogeneous random K-out graphs were recently introduced to model heterogeneous sensor networks secured by random pairwise key predistribution schemes. First, each of the n nodes is classified as type-1 (respectively, type-2) with probability 0 n arcs towards K n distinct nodes) selected uniformly at random, and then the orientation of the arcs is ignored. It was recently established that the inhomogeneous random K-out graph is 1-connected asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) if and only if K n =ω(1). In this work, we analyze the k-connectivity of inhomogeneous random K-out graphs; i.e., with k=1, 2, ⋯ , the property that the network remains connected despite the removal of any k-1 nodes or links. We first establish a zero-one law for the property that the minimum node degree is at least k. In particular, we present scaling conditions on μ and K n such that the resulting graph has minimum degree at least k with probability approaching one (respectively, zero) constituting the one-law (respectively, zero-law), as the number of nodes gets large. We show that for k=2, 3, ⋯ , we need to set K n = \frac 11-μ(logn +(k-2)loglogn + ω(1)) for the network to have a minimum node degree of at least k a.a.s. Next, we prove that having K n = \frac 11-μ(logn +(k-2)loglogn + ω(1)) also ensures that the graph is k-connected a.a.s., meaning that the zero-one laws for minimum node degree and k-connectivity coincide. We present simulation results to demonstrate the usefulness of the results in the finite node regime. The results given here indicate an interesting fact about inhomogeneous random K-out graphs, i.e., that the number of additional edges needed to go from 1-connectivity to k-connectivity with k ≥ 2 is unexpectedly larger as compared to many classical random graph models studied before.},

  abstract     = {Boolean functions with high algebraic immunity are important cryptographic primitives in some stream ciphers. In this paper, two methodologies for constructing minimal binary codes from sets, Boolean functions and vectorial Boolean functions with high algebraic immunity, are proposed. More precisely, a general construction of new minimal codes using minimal codes contained in Reed-Muller codes and sets without nonzero low degree annihilators is presented. The other construction allows us to yield minimal codes from certain subcodes of Reed-Muller codes and vectorial Boolean functions with high algebraic immunity. Via these general constructions, infinite families of minimal binary linear codes of dimension m and length less than or equal to m(m+1)/2 are obtained. Besides, a lower bound on the minimum distance of the proposed minimal linear codes is established. Conjectures and open problems are also presented. The results of this paper show that Boolean functions with high algebraic immunity have nice applications in several fields additionally to symmetric cryptography, such as coding theory and secret sharing schemes.},

We find a general characterization of the PIR capacity, which is the same as the capacity of the original PIR problem with the number of databases N replaced by a number S * . S * is the optimal solution to a linear programming problem that is a function of the incidence matrix of the collusion pattern. Hence, the essence of any collusion pattern can be distilled into one number S * . In the proposed achievable scheme, databases are non-uniformly queried according to the optimal solution of a linear programming problem based on the collusion pattern. It can be seen that the databases who collude more with others are queried less. In the converse proof, Shearer&#39;s lemma is applied, in place of Han&#39;s inequality, to a linear combination of inequalities, where each inequality corresponds to one colluding set in the collusion pattern. The weights of the linear combination come from the optimal solution of another linear programming problem based on the collusion pattern. Finally, by noting the interesting fact that the two seemingly different linear programming problems, one used in the achievability proof and the other used in the converse proof, are in fact dual problems, we characterize the capacity of the PIR problem under arbitrary collusion patterns.},

  abstract     = {The hardcore model on a graph $G$ with parameter $\lambda &amp;gt; 0$ is a probability measure on the collection of all independent sets of $G$ , that assigns to each independent set $I$ a probability proportional to $\lambda ^{|I|}$ . In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the parameter $\lambda $ given a single sample from the hardcore model on a graph $G$ . To bypass the computational intractability of the maximum likelihood method, we use the maximum pseudo-likelihood (MPL) estimator, which for the hardcore model has a surprisingly simple closed form expression. We show that for any sequence of graphs ${G_{N}}_{N \geq 1}$ , where $G_{N}$ is a graph on $N$ vertices, the MPL estimate of $\lambda $ is $\sqrt {N}$ -consistent (that is, it converges to the true parameter at rate $1/\sqrt {N}$ ), whenever the graph sequence has uniformly bounded average degree. We then extend our methods to obtain estimates for the vector of activity parameters in general $H$ -coloring models, in which restrictions between adjacent colors are encoded by a constraint graph $H$ . These constitute an important class of Markov random fields that includes all hard-constraint models, which arise in a broad array of fields including combinatorics, statistical physics, and communication networks. Given a single sample from an $H$ -coloring model, we derive sufficient conditions under which the MPL estimate is $\sqrt {N}$ -consistent. Moreover, we verify the sufficient conditions for $H$ -coloring models for which there is at least one ‘unconstrained’ color (that is, there exists at least one vertex in the constraint graph $H$ that is connected to all vertices), as long as the graph sequence has uniformly bounded average degree. This applies to many $H$ -coloring examples such as the Widom-Rowlinson and multi-state hard-core models. On the other hand, for the $q$ -coloring model, which falls outside this class, we show that the condition can fail and consistent estimation may be impossible even for graphs with bounded average degree. Nevertheless, we show that the MPL estimate is $\sqrt {N}$ -consistent in the $q$ -coloring model when ${G_{N}}_{N \geq 1}$ has bounded average double neighborhood. The presence of hard constraints, as opposed to soft constraints, leads to new challenges, and our proofs entail applications of the method of exchangeable pairs as well as combinatorial arguments that employ the probabilistic method.},

We further require the probability of the estimation error to decay either exponentially or sub-exponentially fast (corresponding respectively to the large and moderate deviations regimes in information theory parlance). Based on the training sequences as well as the test sequence consisting of a single change-point, we design a change-point estimator and further show that this estimator is optimal by establishing matching (strong) converses.

In domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers (i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {With the growing use of machine learning algorithms in highly consequential domains, the quantification and removal of disparity in decision making with respect to protected attributes, such as gender, race, etc., is becoming increasingly important. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of a business (e.g., hiring) may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way that any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted. For instance, in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application, a coding-test score may be a critical feature that is weighed strongly in the decision even if it introduces disparity, whereas other features, such as name, zip code, or reference letters may be used to improve decision-making, but only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this work, we propose a novel information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity (a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a non-exempt component which quantifies the part of the disparity that cannot be accounted for by the critical features, and an exempt component which quantifies the remaining disparity. This decomposition is important: it allows one to check if the disparity arose purely due to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of disparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt component of disparity if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical examples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that any measure of non-exempt disparity should satisfy. We then demonstrate that our proposed counterfactual measure of non-exempt disparity satisfies all of them. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson&#39;s paradox, and a body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure of non-exempt disparity can satisfy all of the desired properties, which leads us to relax our goals and examine alternative observational measures that satisfy only some of these properties. We perform case studies to show how one can audit existing models as well as train new models while reducing non-exempt disparity.},

However, their constructions are based on probabilistic arguments which only guarantee the code parameters with high probability whereas our bounds hold unconditionally. Further, balanced products allow for non-abelian twisting of the check matrices, leading to a construction of LDPC quantum codes that can be shown to have K ∈ Θ(N) and that we conjecture to have linear distance D ∈ Θ(N).},

Hence minimizing the degrees of freedom that a quantum code utilizes is helpful. One quantum error correction solution is to encode quantum information into one or more bosonic modes. We revisit rotation-invariant bosonic codes, which are supported on Fock states that are gapped by an integer g apart, and the gap g imparts number shift resilience to these codes. Intuitively, since phase operators and number shift operators do not commute, one expects a trade-off between resilience to number-shift and rotation errors. Here, we obtain results pertaining to the non-existence of approximate quantum error correcting g-gapped single-mode bosonic codes with respect to Gaussian dephasing errors. We show that by using arbitrarily many modes, g-gapped multi-mode codes can yield good approximate quantum error correction codes for any finite magnitude of Gaussian dephasing and amplitude damping errors.},

  abstract     = {We propose a generalization of the Wasserstein distance of order 1 to the quantum states of n qudits. The proposal recovers the Hamming distance for the vectors of the canonical basis, and more generally the classical Wasserstein distance for quantum states diagonal in the canonical basis. The proposed distance is invariant with respect to permutations of the qudits and unitary operations acting on one qudit and is additive with respect to the tensor product. Our main result is a continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy with respect to the proposed distance, which significantly strengthens the best continuity bound with respect to the trace distance. We also propose a generalization of the Lipschitz constant to quantum observables. The notion of quantum Lipschitz constant allows us to compute the proposed distance with a semidefinite program. We prove a quantum version of Marton&#39;s transportation inequality and a quantum Gaussian concentration inequality for the spectrum of quantum Lipschitz observables. Moreover, we derive bounds on the contraction coefficients of shallow quantum circuits and of the tensor product of one-qudit quantum channels with respect to the proposed distance. We discuss other possible applications in quantum machine learning, quantum Shannon theory, and quantum many-body systems.},

Under the above condition, we show that the hulls of GRS codes via Goppa codes are still GRS codes via Goppa codes.

The protocols and their security are based on the existence of Bell inequalities and the ability to violate them by measuring entangled states. We study the entanglement needed for DIQKD protocols in two different ways. Our first contribution is the derivation of upper bounds on the key rates of CHSH-based DIQKD protocols in terms of the violation of the inequality; this sets an upper limit on the possible DI key extraction rate from states with a given violation. Our upper bound improves on the previously known bound of Kaur et al. Our second contribution is the initiation of the study of the role of bound entangled states in DIQKD. We present a revised Peres conjecture stating that such states cannot be used as a resource for DIQKD. We give a first piece of evidence for the conjecture by showing that the bound entangled state found by Vertesi and Brunner, even though it can certify DI randomness, cannot be used to produce a key using protocols analogous to the well-studied CHSH-based DIQKD protocol.},

We derive various error exponents in the bee identification problem under two different decoding rules. Under naïve decoding, which decodes each bee independently of the others, we analyze a general discrete memoryless channel and a relatively wide family of stochastic decoders. Upper and lower bounds to the random coding error exponent are derived and proved to be equal at relatively high coding rates. Then, we propose a lower bound on the error exponent of the typical random code, which improves upon the random coding exponent at low coding rates. We also derive a third bound, which is related to expurgated codes, which turns out to be strictly higher than the other bounds, also at relatively low rates. We show that the universal maximum mutual information decoder is optimal with respect to the typical random code and the expurgated code. Moving further, we derive error exponents under optimal decoding, the relatively wide family of symmetric channels, and the maximum likelihood decoder. We first propose a random coding lower bound, and then, an improved bound which stems from an expurgation process. We show numerically that our second bound strictly improves upon the random coding bound at an intermediate range of coding rates, where a bound derived in a previous work no longer holds.},

  abstract     = {We study the generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF) of cellular networks under finite precision channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). We consider downlink settings modeled by the interfering broadcast channel (IBC) under no multi-cell cooperation, and the overloaded multiple-input-single-output broadcast channel (MISO-BC) under full multi-cell cooperation. We focus on three regimes of interest: the mc-TIN regime, where a scheme based on treating inter-cell interference as noise (mc-TIN) was shown to be GDoF optimal for the IBC; the mc-CTIN regime, where the GDoF region achievable by mc-TIN is convex without the need for time-sharing; and the mc-SLS regime which extends a previously identified regime, where a simple layered superposition (SLS) scheme is optimal for the 3-transmitter-3-user MISO-BC, to overloaded cellular-type networks with more users than transmitters. We first show that the optimality of mc-TIN for the IBC extends to the entire mc-CTIN regime when CSIT is limited to finite precision. The converse proof of this result relies on a new application of aligned images bounds. We then extend the IBC converse proof to the counterpart overloaded MISO-BC, obtained by enabling full transmitter cooperation. This, in turn, is utilized to show that a multi-cell variant of the SLS scheme is optimal in the mc-SLS regime under full multi-cell cooperation, albeit only for 2-cell networks. The overwhelming combinatorial complexity of the GDoF region stands in the way of extending this result to larger networks. Alternatively, we appeal to extremal network analysis, recently introduced by Chan et al., and study the GDoF gain of multi-cell cooperation over mc-TIN in the three regimes of interest. We show that this extremal GDoF gain is bounded by small constants in the mc-TIN and mc-CTIN regimes, yet scales logarithmically with the number of cells in the mc-SLS regime.},

Our adaptive JSCC scheme not only subsumes existing lossy coding methods for two-way simultaneous communication but also improves their performance. Furthermore, we derive outer bounds for our two-way lossy transmission problem and establish complete JSCC theorems in some special settings.

As a major topic in the research of LRCs, bounds and constructions of the corresponding optimal codes are of particular concerns. In this work, codes with (r,δ)-locality which have optimal minimal distance w.r.t. the bound given by Prakash et al. are considered. Through parity-check matrix approach, constructions of both optimal (r,δ)-LRCs with all symbol locality ( (r,δ) a -LRCs) and optimal (r,δ)-LRCs with information locality ( (r,δ) i -LRCs) are provided. As a generalization of a work of Xing and Yuan, these constructions are built on a connection between sparse hypergraphs and optimal (r,δ)-LRCs. With the help of constructions of large sparse hypergraphs, the lengths of codes obtained from our construction can be super-linear in the alphabet size. This improves upon previous constructions when the minimal distance of the code is at least 3δ+1. As two applications, optimal H-LRCs with super-linear lengths and GSD codes with unbounded lengths are also constructed.},

The main goal of this paper is to obtain self-orthogonal codes by investigating the hulls. Let $\mathcal {C}_{(r,r^{m}-1,\delta,b)}$ be the primitive BCH code over $\mathbb {F}_{r}$ of length $r^{m}-1$ with designed distance $\delta $ , where $\mathbb {F}_{r}$ is the finite field of order $r$ . In this paper, we will present Euclidean (or Hermitian) self-orthogonal codes and determine their parameters by investigating the Euclidean (or Hermitian) hulls of some primitive BCH codes. Several sufficient and necessary conditions for primitive BCH codes with large Hermitian hulls are developed by presenting lower and upper bounds on their designed distances. Furthermore, some Hermitian self-orthogonal codes are proposed via the hulls of BCH codes and their parameters are also investigated. In addition, we determine the dimensions of the code $\mathcal {C}_{(r,r^{2}-1,\delta,1)}$ and its hull in both Hermitian and Euclidean cases for $2 \le \delta \le r^{2}-1$ .

We then investigate the error probability, i.e. the probability that the Babai point does not coincide with the nearest lattice point, motivated by the fact that for some cases, a distributed algorithm for finding the Babai point is sufficient for finding the nearest lattice point itself. Two different probability models for $\boldsymbol {X}$ are considered—uniform and Gaussian. For the uniform model, in dimensions two and three, the error probability is seen to grow with the packing density, and we demonstrate that the densest lattice in dimension two presents the worst error probability. For higher dimensions, we develop probabilistic concentration bounds as well as bounds based on geometric arguments for the error probability. The probabilistic bounds lead to the conclusion that for lattices which generate suitably thin coverings of $\mathbb {R}^{n}$ (which includes lattices that meet Rogers’ bound on the covering radius), the error probability goes to unity as $n$ grows. Probabilistic and geometric bounds are also used to estimate the error probability under the uniform model for various lattices including the $A_{n}$ family and the Leech lattice, $\Lambda _{24}$ . On the other hand, for the Gaussian model, the error probability goes to zero as the lattice dimension tends to infinity, provided the noise variance is sufficiently small.},

The Reed-Solomon codes are over \mathbb F ql and have redundancy r = n-k ≥ q m , 1 ≤ m ≤ l , where n and k are the code length and dimension, respectively. In particular, for one erasure, we show that our schemes can achieve optimal repair bandwidths whenever n=q l and r = q m , for all 1 ≤ m ≤ l . For two erasures, our schemes use the same bandwidth per erasure as the single erasure schemes, for l /m is a power of q, and for l = q a , m=q b -1 &gt; 1 ( a ≥ b ≥ 1), and for m ≥ l /2 when l is even and q is a power of two.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the capacity region of an average transmit power constrained Gaussian Broadcast Channel (GBC) with independent noise realizations at the receivers is enlarged by the presence of causal noiseless feedback. When the noise variances at the receivers are identical, even passive feedback via independent memoryless Gaussian links can lead to a capacity region enlargement. The last fact remains true even when the feedback noise variance is very high, and available only from one of the receivers. While such capacity enlargements are feasible for several other feedback models in the Gaussian BC setting, it is also known that feedback does not change the capacity region for physically degraded broadcast channels. In this paper, we consider a two user GBC with independent noise realizations at the receivers, where the feedback links from the receivers are corrupted by independent additive Gaussian noise processes. We investigate the set of four noise variances, two forward and two feedback, for which no capacity enlargement is possible. A sharp characterization of this region is derived, i.e., any quadruple outside the presented region will lead to a capacity enlargement, whereas quadruples inside will leave the capacity region unchanged. Our results lead to the conclusion that when the forward noise variances are different, too noisy a feedback from one of the receivers alone is not always beneficial for enlarging the capacity region, be it from the stronger user or the weaker one, in sharp contrast to the case of equal forward noise variances.},

On the theoretical side, we prove sharp oracle inequalities for the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These inequalities are valid with positive probability for any sample size and include the estimation of unbounded log-densities. Along the proofs, we derive several analytical lemmas related to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as well as concentration inequalities, that are of independent interest.

  abstract     = {The Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem (Schnorr and Stimm, 1972) concerns finite-state gamblers that bet on infinite sequences of symbols taken from a finite alphabet Σ. The theorem asserts that, for any such sequence S, the following two things are true. (1) If S is not normal in the sense of Borel (meaning that every two strings of equal length appear with equal asymptotic frequency in S), then there is a finite-state gambler that wins money at an infinitely-often exponential rate betting on S. (2) If S is normal, then any finite-state gambler loses money at an exponential rate betting on S. In this paper we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to formulate the lower asymptotic divergence div(S||α) of a probability measure α on Σ from a sequence S over Σ and the upper asymptotic divergence Div(S||α) of α from S in such a way that a sequence S is α-normal (meaning that every string w has asymptotic frequency α(w) in S) if and only if Div(S||α)=0. We also use the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the total risk Risk G (w) that a finite-state gambler G takes when betting along a prefix w of S. Our main theorem is a strong dichotomy theorem that uses the above notions to quantify the exponential rates of winning and losing on the two sides of the Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem (with the latter routinely extended from normality to α-normality). Modulo asymptotic caveats in the paper, our strong dichotomy theorem says that the following two things hold for prefixes w of S. ( $1~&#39;$ ) The infinitely-often exponential rate of winning in 1 is 2 Div(S||α)|w| . ( $2~&#39;$ ) The exponential rate of loss in 2 is 2 - RiskG(w) . We also use (1 $&#39;$ ) to show that 1- Div(S||α)/c, where c = log(1/ min a ∈ Σ α(a)), is an upper bound on the finite-state α-dimension of S and prove the dual fact that 1- div(S||α)/c is an upper bound on the finite-state strong α-dimension of S.},

  abstract     = {We characterize the capacity region of the two-user broadcast packet erasure channel (PEC) with single-user delayed channel state information (CSI). More precisely, we assume one receiver does not provide its channel state to the other two nodes (the other receiver and the transmitter), while the other receiver reveals its state globally with unit delay. This is a hybrid CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) setting where the transmitter has the delayed CSI of one user but not the other. Previous results developed opportunistic network coding schemes for this setting, which strictly enlarge the achievable rate region compared to the no-CSIT baseline. Characterization of the capacity region with single-user delayed CSI, however, remained open. In this work, we develop an improved achievability strategy and show that the capacity region, surprisingly, matches that of the broadcast PEC with global delayed CSI of both users. The key to such improvement over previous results is a new precoding strategy for the retransmission phase of the opportunistic network coding scheme. It harnesses the single-user delayed CSI in the retransmission phase, so that interference from the feedback receiver can be aligned at the other receiver. Besides the broadcast PEC with two private messages, an extension to a model with an additional common message is also provided and the corresponding capacity region with single-user CSI also matches that with global delayed CSI. Finally, further extensions to three-user cases are also provided.},

Much of prior work in this area is (i) either sub-optimal in terms of its straggler resilience, or (ii) suffers from numerical problems, i.e., there is a blow-up of round-off errors in the decoded result owing to the high condition numbers of the corresponding decoding matrices. Our work presents a convolutional coding approach to this problem that removes these limitations. It is optimal in terms of its straggler resilience, and has excellent numerical robustness as long as the workers&#39; storage capacity is slightly higher than the fundamental lower bound. Moreover, it can be decoded using a fast peeling decoder that only involves add/subtract operations. Our second approach has marginally higher decoding complexity than the first one, but allows us to operate arbitrarily close to the storage capacity lower bound. Its numerical robustness can be theoretically quantified by deriving a computable upper bound on the worst case condition number over all possible decoding matrices by drawing connections with the properties of large block Toeplitz matrices. All above claims are backed up by extensive experiments done on the AWS cloud platform.},

  abstract     = {Compute and Forward (CF) is a coding scheme which enables receivers to decode linear combinations of simultaneously transmitted messages while exploiting the linear properties of lattice codes and the additive nature of a shared medium. The scheme was originally designed for relay networks, yet, it was found useful in other communication problems, such as MIMO communication. Works in the current literature assume a fixed number of transmitters and receivers in the system. However, following the increase in communication networks density, it is interesting to investigate the performance of CF when the number of transmitters is large. In this work, we show that as the number of transmitters, L, grows, CF becomes degenerated, in the sense that a relay prefers to decode only one (strongest) user instead of any other linear combination of the transmitted codewords, treating the other users as noise. Moreover, the system&#39;s sum-rate tends to zero as well. This makes scheduling necessary in order to maintain the superior abilities CF provides. We thus examine the problem of scheduling for CF. We start with insights on why good scheduling opportunities can be found. Then, we provide an asymptotically optimal, polynomial-time scheduling algorithm and analyze its performance. We conclude that with proper scheduling, CF is not merely non-degenerated, but, in fact, provides a gain for the system sum-rate, up to the optimal scaling law of O(loglogL).},

A threshold-based distributed selective feedback policy is proposed for the discovery of the optimum relay location with finite average feedback load. It is established that the total number of relays feeding back obeys a Poisson distribution and an analytical expression for the average feedback load is derived. The analytical expressions for the average rate and outage probability with and without selective feedback are obtained for general path-loss models. It is shown that the optimum location-based relay selection policy outperforms other common relay selection strategies notably. It is also shown that utilizing location information from five relays on average is enough to achieve almost the same performance with the infinite feedback load case. As generalizations, isotropic Poisson point processes and heterogeneous source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links are also studied.},

  abstract     = {Large gains in the rate of cache-aided broadcast communication are obtained using coded caching, but to obtain this most existing centralized coded caching schemes require that the files at the server be divisible into a large number of parts (this number is called subpacketization). In fact, most schemes require the subpacketization to be growing asymptotically as exponential in √[\leftroot -1\uproot 1r]K for some positive integer r and K being the number of users. On the other extreme, few schemes having subpacketization linear in K are known; however, they require large number of users to exist, or they offer only little gain in the rate. In this work, we propose two new centralized coded caching schemes with low subpacketization and moderate rate gains utilizing projective geometries over finite fields. Both the schemes achieve the same asymptotic subpacketization, which is exponential in O((logK) 2 ) (thus improving on the √[\leftroot -1\uproot 1r]K exponent). The first scheme has a larger cache requirement but has at most a constant rate (with increasing K), while the second has small cache requirement but has a larger rate. As a special case of our second scheme, we get a new linear subpacketization scheme, which has a more flexible range of parameters than the existing linear subpacketization schemes. Extending our techniques, we also obtain low subpacketization schemes for other multi-receiver settings such as distributed computing and the cache-aided interference channel. We validate the performance of all our schemes via extensive numerical comparisons. For a special class of symmetric caching schemes with a given subpacketization level, we propose two new information theoretic lower bounds on the optimal rate of coded caching.},

The structure of the proposed polar lattices allows to integrate entropy coding into the lattice quantizer, which greatly simplifies the compression process. The overall complexity of encoding and decoding is $O(N \log ^{2} N)$ for any target distortion and fixed rate larger than the rate-distortion bound. Moreover, the nesting structure of polar lattices provides solutions to various multi-terminal coding problems. The Wyner-Ziv coding problem for a Gaussian source can be solved by using a capacity-achieving polar lattice for the Gaussian channel, nested with a rate-distortion bound achieving lattice, while the Gelfand-Pinsker problem can be solved in a reversed manner. The polar lattice quantizer is further extended to extract Wyner’s common information of a pair of Gaussian sources or multiple Gaussian sources.},

One of our main results is summarized as Theorem 3 on causal inner bounds for SM-SK rate pairs, which follows immediately by leveraging the unified seminal theorem for WTCs with non-causal CSI at Alice that has been recently established by Bunin et al.. The only thing to do here is just to re-interpret the latter non-causal scheme in a causal manner by restricting the range of auxiliary random variables appearing in non-causal encoding to a subclass of auxiliary random variables for the causal encoder. This technique is referred to as “plugging.” Then, we are able to dispense with the block-Markov encoding scheme used in the previous works by Chia and El Gamal, Fujita, and Han and Sasaki and then extend all the known results on achievable rates. The other main results include the exact SM-SK capacity region for WTCs with non-causal CSI at “both” Alice and Bob (Theorem 2), a “tighter” causal SM-SK outer bound for state-reproducing coding schemes with CSI at Alice (Proposition 4), and the exact SM-SK capacity region for degraded WTCs with causal/non-causal CSI at both Alice and Bob (Theorem 4).},

An active adversary James eavesdrops on their communication over a binary symmetric channel (BSC( q)), and may maliciously flip (up to) a certain fraction p of their transmitted bits based on his observations. We consider a setting where the communication must be simultaneously covert as well as reliable, i.e., James should be unable to accurately distinguish whether or not Alice is communicating, while Bob should be able to correctly recover Alice&#39;s message with high probability regardless of the adversarial jamming strategy. We show that, unlike the setting with passive adversaries, covert communication against active adversaries requires Alice and Bob to have a shared key (of length at least Ω(logn)) even when Bob has a better channel than James. We present lower and upper bounds on the information-theoretically optimal throughput as a function of the channel parameters, the desired level of covertness, and the amount of shared key available. These bounds match for a wide range of parameters of interest. We also develop a computationally efficient coding scheme (based on concatenated codes) when the amount of shared key available is Ω(√n logn), and further show that this scheme can be implemented with much less amount of shared key when the adversary is assumed to be computationally bounded.},

For a d-dimensional random vector X and a scalar random variable Y, where X and Y are jointly Gaussian with an unknown correlation vector ρ, parties P 1 and P 2 observe independent copies of X and Y, respectively. The parties seek to test if their observations are correlated or not, namely they seek to test if ||ρ|| 2 exceeds τ or is it 0. To that end, they communicate interactively and declare the test output. We show that roughly order d/τ 2 bits of communication are sufficient and necessary for resolving the distributed correlation testing problem above. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound of roughly d 2 /τ 2 bits for the communication needed for distributed estimation of ρ, implying that distributed correlation testing requires less communication than distributed estimation. Both our lower bounds for testing and estimation hold for an arbitrary d and interactive communication with shared randomness, while our distributed test requires only one-way communication with shared randomness. For the one-dimensional case, with one-way communication and with probability of one of the error-types fixed, our bounds are more refined in the dependence on the other error-type and are tight even in the constant.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a novel strategy for social learning by introducing the critical feature of adaptation. In social learning, several distributed agents update continually their belief about a phenomenon of interest through: i) direct observation of streaming data that they gather locally; and ii) diffusion of their beliefs through local cooperation with their neighbors. Traditional social learning implementations are known to learn well the underlying hypothesis (which means that the belief of every individual agent peaks at the true hypothesis), achieving steady improvement in the learning accuracy under stationary conditions. However, these algorithms do not perform well under nonstationary conditions commonly encountered in online learning, exhibiting a significant inertia to track drifts in the streaming data. In order to address this gap, we propose an Adaptive Social Learning (ASL) strategy, which relies on a small step-size parameter to tune the adaptation degree. First, we provide a detailed characterization of the learning performance by means of a steady-state analysis. Focusing on the small step-size regime, we establish that the ASL strategy achieves consistent learning under standard global identifiability assumptions. We derive reliable Gaussian approximations for the probability of error (i.e., of choosing a wrong hypothesis) at each individual agent. We carry out a large deviations analysis revealing the universal behavior of adaptive social learning: the error probabilities decrease exponentially fast with the inverse of the step-size, and we characterize the resulting exponential learning rate. Second, we characterize the adaptation performance by means of a detailed transient analysis, which allows us to obtain useful analytical formulas relating the adaptation time to the step-size. The revealed dependence of the adaptation time and the error probabilities on the step-size highlights the fundamental trade-off between adaptation and learning emerging in adaptive social learning.},

We develop optimal transport plans (probabilistic couplings) for univariate distributions such as the normal, the uniform, and the triangular distribution.

However, a unifying methodology accompanied with a rigorous theory is lacking in high-dimensional settings. This paper studies the problem of risk estimation under the moderately high-dimensional asymptotic setting n,p → ∞ and n/p → δ &gt; 1 ( δ is a fixed number), and proves the consistency of three risk estimators that have been successful in numerical studies, i.e., leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), approximate leave-one-out (ALO), and approximate message passing (AMP)-based techniques.

Generalized mutual information measures that go beyond classical Shannon mutual information have also received much interest in these applications. We derive the mean squared error convergence rates of kernel density-based plug-in estimators of general mutual information measures between two multidimensional random variables X and Y for two cases: 1) X and Y are continuous; 2) X and Y may have a mixture of discrete and continuous components. Using the derived rates, we propose an ensemble estimator of these information measures called GENIE by taking a weighted sum of the plug-in estimators with varied bandwidths. The resulting ensemble estimators achieve the 1/N parametric mean squared error convergence rate when the conditional densities of the continuous variables are sufficiently smooth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonparametric mutual information estimator known to achieve the parametric convergence rate for the mixture case, which frequently arises in applications (e.g. variable selection in classification). The estimator is simple to implement and it uses the solution to an offline convex optimization problem and simple plug-in estimators. A central limit theorem is also derived for the ensemble estimators and minimax rates are derived for the continuous case. We demonstrate the ensemble estimator for the mixed case on simulated data and apply the proposed estimator to analyze gene relationships in single cell data.},

  abstract     = {The Byzantine distributed quickest change detection (BDQCD) is studied, where a fusion center monitors the occurrence of an abrupt event through a bunch of distributed sensors that may be compromised. We first consider the binary hypothesis case where there is only one post-change hypothesis and prove a novel converse to the first-order asymptotic detection delay in the large mean time to a false alarm regime. This converse is tight in that it coincides with the currently best achievability shown by Fellouris et al.; hence, the optimal asymptotic performance of binary BDQCD is characterized. An important implication of this result is that, even with compromised sensors, a 1-bit link between each sensor and the fusion center suffices to achieve asymptotic optimality. To accommodate multiple post-change hypotheses, we then formulate the multi-hypothesis BDQCD problem and again investigate the optimal first-order performance under different bandwidth constraints. A converse is first obtained by extending our converse from binary to multi-hypothesis BDQCD. Two families of stopping rules, namely the simultaneous d-th alarm and the multi-shot d-th alarm, are then proposed. Under sufficient link bandwidth, the simultaneous d-th alarm, with d being set to the number of honest sensors, can achieve the asymptotic performance that coincides with the derived converse bound; hence, the asymptotically optimal performance of multi-hypothesis BDQCD is again characterized. Moreover, although being shown to be asymptotically optimal only for some special cases, the multi-shot d-th alarm is much more bandwidth-efficient and energy-efficient than the simultaneous d-th alarm. Built upon the above success in characterizing the asymptotic optimality of the BDQCD, a corresponding leader-follower Stackelberg game is formulated and its solution is found.},

  abstract     = {In image detection, one problem is to test whether the set, though mainly consisting of uniformly scattered points, also contains a small fraction of points sampled from some (a priori unknown) curve, for example, a curve with C α -norm bounded by β. One approach is to analyze the data by counting membership in multiscale multianisotropic strips, which involves an algorithm that delves into the length of the path connecting many consecutive “significant” nodes. In this paper, we develop the mathematical formalism of this algorithm and analyze the statistical property of the length of the longest significant run. The rate of convergence is derived. Using percolation theory and random graph theory, we present a novel probabilistic model named, pseudo-tree model. Based on the asymptotic results for the pseudo-tree model, we further study the length of the longest significant run in an “inflating” Bernoulli net. We find that the probability parameter p of significant node plays an important role: there is a threshold p c , such that in the cases of p c and p &gt; p c , very different asymptotic behaviors of the length of the significant runs are observed. We apply our results to the detection of an underlying curvilinear feature and prove that the test based on our proposed longest run theory is asymptotically powerful.},

  abstract     = {The nondispersive per-sample channel model for the optical fiber channel is considered. Under certain smoothness assumptions, the problem of finding the minimum amount of noise energy that can render two different input points indistinguishable is formulated. This minimum noise energy is then taken as a measure of distance between the points in the input alphabet. Using the machinery of optimal control theory, necessary conditions that describe the minimum-energy noise trajectories are stated as a system of nonlinear differential equations. It is shown how to find the distance between two input points by solving this system of differential equations. The problem of designing signal constellations with the largest minimum distance subject to a peak power constraint is formulated as a clique-finding problem. As an example, a 16-point constellation is designed and compared with conventional quadrature amplitude modulation. A computationally efficient approximation for the proposed distance measure is provided. It is shown how to use this approximation to design large constellations with large minimum distances. Based on the control-theoretic viewpoint of this paper, a new decoding scheme for such nonlinear channels is proposed.},

  abstract     = {In communication networks, cooperative strategies are coding schemes where network nodes work together to improve performance metrics such as the total rate delivered across the network. This work studies encoder cooperation in the setting of a discrete multiple access channel (MAC) with two encoders and a single decoder. A network node, here called the cooperation facilitator (CF), that is connected to both encoders via rate-limited links, enables the cooperation strategy. Previous work by the authors presents two classes of MACs: (i) one class where the average-error sum-capacity has an infinite derivative in the limit where CF output link capacities approach zero, and (ii) a second class of MACs where the maximal-error sum-capacity is not continuous at the point where the output link capacities of the CF equal zero. This work contrasts the power of the CF in the maximal- and average-error cases, showing that a constant number of bits communicated over the CF output link can yield a positive gain in the maximal-error sum-capacity, while a far greater number of bits, even a number that grows sublinearly in the blocklength, can never yield a non-negligible gain in the average-error sum-capacity.},

  abstract     = {Consider a (multiple-access) wireless communication system where users are connected to a unique base station over a shared-spectrum radio links. Each user has a fixed number k of bits to send to the base station, and his signal gets attenuated by a random channel gain (quasi-static fading). In this paper we consider the many-user asymptotics of Chen-Chen-Guo&#39;2017, where the number of users grows linearly with the blocklength. Differently, though, we adopt a per-user probability of error (PUPE) criterion (as opposed to classical joint-error probability criterion). Under PUPE the finite energy-per-bit communication is possible, and we are able to derive bounds on the tradeoff between energy and spectral efficiencies. We reconfirm the curious behaviour (previously observed for non-fading MAC) of the possibility of almost perfect multi-user interference (MUI) cancellation for user densities below a critical threshold. Further, we demonstrate the suboptimality of standard solutions such as orthogonalization (i.e. TDMA/FDMA) and treating interference as noise (i.e. pseudo-random CDMA without multi-user detection). Notably, the problem treated here can be seen as a variant of support recovery in compressed sensing for the unusual definition of sparsity with one non-zero entry per each contiguous section of 2 k coordinates. This identifies our problem with that of the sparse regression codes (SPARCs) and hence our results can be equivalently understood in the context of SPARCs with sections of length 2 100 . Finally, we discuss the relation of the almost perfect MUI cancellation property and the replica-method predictions.},

For this, we develop a linear state-space model of trapping sets (TSs) which incorporates the layered nature of scheduling. We demonstrate that the contribution of each TS to the error floor is not only a function of the topology of the TS, but also depends on the row layers in which different check nodes of the TS are located. This information, referred to as TS layer profile (TSLP), plays an important role in the harmfulness of a TS. As a result, the harmfulness of a TS in particular, and the error floor of the code in general, can significantly change by changing the order in which the information of different layers, corresponding to different row blocks of the parity-check matrix, is updated. We also study the problem of finding a layer ordering that minimizes the error floor, and obtain row layered decoders with error floor significantly lower than that of their flooding counterparts. As part of our analysis, we make connections between the parameters of the state-space model for a row layered schedule and those of the flooding schedule. Simulation results are presented to show the accuracy of analytical error floor estimates.},

These codes have found many recent applications, e.g., to distributed cloud storage. We will discuss the problem of constructing good locally recoverable codes and present some constructions using algebraic surfaces that improve previous constructions and sometimes provide codes that are optimal in a precise sense. The main conceptual contribution of this paper is to consider surfaces fibered over a curve in such a way that each recovery set is constructed from points in a single fiber. This allows us to use the geometry of the fiber to guarantee the local recoverability and use the global geometry of the surface to get a hold on the standard parameters of our codes. We look in detail at situations where the fibers are rational or elliptic curves and provide many examples applying our methods.},

Motivated by practical applications such as initial beam alignment in array processing, heavy hitter detection in networking, and visual search in robotics, we consider practically important complexity constraints/metrics: time complexity , computational and memory complexity , and the complexity of possible query sets in terms of geometry and cardinality. Two novel search strategy, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$ , are proposed. Pertinent to the practicality of our solutions, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$ are of a connected query geometry (i.e. query set is always a connected set) implemented with low computational and memory complexity. Additionally, $hiePM$ has a hierarchical structure and, hence, a further reduction in the cardinality of possible query sets, making $hiePM$ practically suitable for applications such as beamforming in array processing where memory limitations favors a small and predefined query sets. Through a unified analysis with Extrinsic Jensen Shannon (EJS) Divergence, $dyaPM$ is shown to be asymptotically optimal in search time complexity (asymptotic in both resolution (rate) and error (reliability)). On the other hand, $hiePM$ is shown to be near-optimal in rate. In addition, both $hiePM$ and $dyaPM$ are shown to outperform prior work in the non-asymptotic regime.},

Storage nodes are prone to permanent failures, where such node failures cause all stored data to be permanently lost, and failed nodes are replaced with nodes that initially store no data. To maintain recoverability of the source data as storage nodes fail and are replaced, a total amount of storage capacity that is larger than the source data size is allocated to store the source data, and a repairer continually reads data from and writes data to the storage nodes as they fail and are replaced. We prove information-theoretic lower bounds on the rate at which a repairer reads data from the storage system as a function of the rate at which nodes fail and the amount by which the allocated storage capacity exceeds the source data size. These lower bounds hold for any repairer, i.e., any repairer that does not read data at or above the lower bound rate will provably not maintain recoverability of the source data. The bounds are provably tight asymptotically as the number of storage nodes grows and the allocated storage capacity approaches the source data size.},

  abstract     = {We prove that, for the binary erasure channel (BEC), the polar-coding paradigm gives rise to codes that not only approach the Shannon limit but do so under the best possible scaling of their block length as a function of the gap to capacity. This result exhibits the first known family of binary codes that attain both optimal scaling and quasi-linear complexity of encoding and decoding. Our proof is based on the construction and analysis of binary polar codes with large kernels. When communicating reliably at rates within ε &gt; 0 of capacity, the code length n often scales as O(1/ε μ ), where the constant μ is called the scaling exponent. It is known that the optimal scaling exponent is μ = 2, and it is achieved by random linear codes. The scaling exponent of conventional polar codes (based on the 2×2 kernel) on the BEC is μ = 3.63. This falls far short of the optimal scaling guaranteed by random codes. Our main contribution is a rigorous proof of the following result: for the BEC, there exist l × l binary kernels, such that polar codes constructed from these kernels achieve scaling exponent μ( l ) that tends to the optimal value of 2 as l grows. We furthermore characterize precisely how large l needs to be as a function of the gap between μ( l ) and 2. The resulting binary codes maintain the recursive structure of conventional polar codes, and thereby achieve construction complexity O(n) and encoding/decoding complexity O(nlogn).},

  abstract     = {We consider the use of the well-known dual capacity bounding technique for deriving upper bounds on the capacity of indecomposable finite-state channels (FSCs) with finite input and output alphabets. In this technique, capacity upper bounds are obtained by choosing suitable test distributions on the sequence of channel outputs. We propose test distributions that arise from certain graphical structures called Q-graphs. As we show in this paper, the advantage of this choice of test distribution is that, for the important sub-classes of unifilar and input-driven FSCs, the resulting upper bounds can be formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem, which makes the bounds tractable. We illustrate this for several examples of FSCs, where we are able to solve the associated DP problems explicitly to obtain capacity upper bounds that either match or beat the best previously reported bounds. For instance, for the classical trapdoor channel, we improve the best known upper bound of 0.661 (due to Lutz (2014)) to 0.584, shrinking the gap to the best known lower bound of 0.572, all bounds being in units of bits per channel use.},

  abstract     = {We consider the fundamental limits of reliable communication over a two-state compound channel when the state of the channel needs to be masked. Our model is closely related to an area of study known as covert communication, a setting in which the transmitter wishes to communicate to legitimate receiver(s) while ensuring that the communication is not detected by an adversary. Our main contribution is the establishment of upper and lower bounds on the throughput-key length region when the constraint that quantifies how much the states are masked is defined to be the total variation distance between the channel output distributions of the two states. When length of the key is sufficiently large, we provide sufficient conditions for the bounds to coincide. Our results follow the so-called square-root law and hence are reminiscent of results in covert communications. Numerical examples, including that of a Gaussian channel, are provided to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {It has long been observed that cooperation between users in a communication network can improve its performance. Unfortunately, in practical ad-hoc networks, cooperation links can be unreliable, and in many cases part of the users in the system cannot be updated about their availability. In such a case we need robust coding schemes that exploit the cooperation links if they are present, but can still operate if cooperation is not possible. In this work we study the general broadcast channel with degraded message sets and cooperation link that may be absent, and derive its capacity region under such uncertainty conditions. A generalization of this model is studied, where the cooperation link capacity is one of k possible values, and its capacity region is derived. We examine the situation where the cooperation link capacity is random and suggest the following performance criterion: maximize the average rate of one user, subject to a constraint on the rate of the other user and the requirement that the system will operate in any realization of the (random) cooperation link. As examples to illustrate our results, the Gaussian broadcast channel is extensively examined, and its capacity is derived for the various cooperation models and assumptions suggested throughout.},

While various combinations of these properties have been considered in the literature, this work provides generalizations of codes constructions that satisfy all the properties with arbitrary parameters of l and ∈. Furthermore, for practical values of l and ∈, we show that our encoders achieve higher rates than existing results in the literature and approach capacity.

In this paper, two types of deterministic constructions of binary measurement matrices are presented via unitary geometry. Then, the lower bounds of the spark of unitary geometry measurement matrices are theoretically analyzed, and an asymptotic comparison between unitary geometry measurement matrices and projective geometry measurement matrices is given via the worst-case recovery capability. After that, a clipping-embedding operation is proposed for binary matrices to generate measurement matrices with more sizes, which can strongly extend the applicability of the deterministic binary matrices in practice. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the performance of our measurement matrices is comparable to, sometimes even better than, that of the corresponding Gaussian random matrices under OMP and BP.},

  abstract     = {Barcoding photons, atoms, and any quantum states can provide a host of functionalities that could benefit future quantum communication systems and networks beyond today&#39;s imagination. As a significant application of barcoding photons, we introduce code division multiple-access (CDMA) communication systems for various applications. In this context, we introduce and discuss the fundamental principles of a novel quantum CDMA (QCDMA) technique based on spectrally encoding and decoding of continuous-mode quantum light pulses. In particular, we present the mathematical models of various QCDMA modules that are fundamental in describing an ideal and typical QCDMA system, such as quantum signal sources, quantum spectral encoding phase operators, M×M quantum broadcasting star-coupler, quantum spectral phase decoding operators, and the quantum receivers. Following the above discussions, we then elaborate on a QCDMA system with M users. In describing a QCDMA system, this paper considers a unified approach where the input continuous-mode quantum light pulses can take on any form of pure states such as quantum coherent (Glauber) states and quantum number (Fock) states. The mathematical presentation is independent of the form of the input pure quantum states. We show that the spectrally encoded quantum states of the light at the quantum star-coupler output are not, in general, factorized states, except for input Glauber states. For input number states, one can observe features like entanglement and quantum interference. Moreover and interestingly, as a consequence of Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle, the quantum signals sent by photon number states obtain complete phase uncertainty at the time of measurement. Therefore, at the receiver output, the multiaccess inter-signal interference vanishes. Due to Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle, the received signal intensity at the photodetector&#39;s output, right at the time of measurement, changes from coherent detection scheme for input Glauber states to incoherent detection scheme for input number states. We also would like to highlight that the mathematical models and tools developed in this paper, in the context of QCDMA, become very useful for developing and analyzing other quantum multiple-access techniques based on wavelength, space and time domain. Furthermore, our mathematical model is valuable in signal design and data modulations of point-to-point quantum communications, quantum pulse shaping, and quantum radar signals and systems where the inputs are continuous mode quantum signals. QCDMA may open up novel possibilities for various quantum technologies such as data privacy, distributed quantum computation, quantum internet, and anti-jamming quantum communication systems.},

Let X and Y be jointly distributed random variables, each taking values in some measurable space. Alice and Bob observe X and Y respectively, can communicate interactively through a public noiseless channel, and want to agree on a key length and a key that is approximately uniformly distributed over all bit sequences with the agreed key length. The public discussion is observed by an eavesdropper, Eve. The key should be approximately independent of the public discussion, conditional on the key length. We show that the optimal expected key length is close to the mutual information I(X;Y) within a logarithmic gap. Moreover, an upper bound and a lower bound on the optimal expected key length can be written down in terms of I(X;Y) only. This means that the optimal one-shot performance is always within a small gap of the optimal asymptotic performance regardless of the distribution of the pair (X,Y). This one-shot result may find applications in situations where the components of an i.i.d. pair source (X n ,Y n ) are observed sequentially and the key is output bit by bit, or in situations where the random source is not an i.i.d. or ergodic process.},

The objective is to construct a lossless source code that maps X n to a sequence ∧Y m of length m that is indistinguishable, in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, from a sequence emitted by another DMS with known distribution p Y . The main result is the existence of a coding scheme that performs this task with an optimal ratio m/n equal to H(X)/H(Y), the ratio of the Shannon entropies of the two distributions, as n goes to infinity. The coding scheme overcomes the challenges created by the lack of knowledge about p X by a type-based universal lossless source coding scheme that produces as output an almost uniformly distributed sequence, followed by another type-based coding scheme that jointly performs source resolvability and universal lossless source coding. The result recovers and extends previous results that either assume p X or p Y uniform, or p X known. The price paid for these generalizations is the use of common randomness with vanishing rate, whose length scales as the logarithm of n. By allowing common randomness larger than the logarithm of n but still negligible compared to n, a constructive low-complexity encoding and decoding counterpart to the main result is also provided for binary sources by means of polar codes.},

In this model, we do not pose any constraints on the sources, i.e. Bob is not degraded to or less noisy than Eve. We obtain the optimal secret key rate in this problem, both for the discrete memoryless sources and vector Gaussian sources. The vector Gaussian characterization is derived by suitably applying the enhancement argument, and proving a new extremal inequality. The extremal inequality can be seen as coupling of two extremal inequalities, which are related to the degraded compound MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel, and the vector generalization of Costa&#39;s entropy power inequality, accordingly.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of Private Information Retrieval (PIR), where a user wishes to retrieve a single message from N non-communicating and non-colluding databases (servers). All servers store the same set of M messages and they respond to the user through a block fading Gaussian Multiple Access Channel (MAC). The goal in this setting is to keep the index of the required message private from the servers while minimizing the communication overhead. This work provides joint privacy and channel coding retrieval schemes for the Gaussian MAC with and without fading. The schemes exploit the linearity of the channel while using the Compute and Forward (CF) coding scheme. Consequently, single-user encoding and decoding are performed to retrieve the required message. In the case of a channel without fading, the achievable retrieval rate is shown to outperform a separation-based scheme, in which the retrieval and the channel coding are designed separately. Moreover, this rate equals the channel capacity without privacy constraints for even N (hence the joint scheme is optimal) and has a negligible gap from the capacity for odd N as N grows. When the channel suffers from fading, the asymmetry between the servers&#39; channels forces a more complicated solution, which involves a hard optimization problem. Nevertheless, we provide coding schemes and lower bounds on the expected achievable retrieval rate which are shown to have the same scaling laws as the channel capacity, both in the number of servers and the SNR.},

We prove a square-root law for the covert identification problem. This states that an ID message of size exp(exp(Θ(√{ n})) can be transmitted over n channel uses. We then characterize the exact pre-constant in the Θ(·) notation. This constant is referred to as the covert identification capacity. We show that it equals the recently developed covert capacity in the standard covert communication problem, and somewhat surprisingly, the covert identification capacity can be achieved without any shared key between the sender and receivers. The achievability proof relies on a random coding argument with pulse-position modulation (PPM), coupled with a second stage which performs code refinements. The converse proof relies on an expurgation argument as well as results for channel resolvability with stringent input constraints.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates reducing sub-packetization of capacity-achieving schemes for uncoded Storage Constrained Private Information Retrieval (SC-PIR) systems. In the SC-PIR system, a user aims to download one out of K files from N servers while revealing nothing about the identity of the requested file to any individual server, in which the K files are stored at the N servers in an uncoded form and each server can store up to μK equivalent files, where μ is the normalized storage capacity of each server. We first prove that there exists a capacity-achieving SC-PIR scheme for a given storage design if and only if all the packets are stored exactly at M\triangleq μN servers for μ such that M=μN ∈ {2,3,...,N}. Then, the optimal sub-packetization for capacity-achieving linear SC-PIR schemes is characterized as the solution to an optimization problem, which is typically hard to solve since it involves non-continuous indicator functions. Moreover, a new notion of array called Storage Design Array (SDA) is introduced for the SC-PIR system. With any given SDA, an associated capacity-achieving SC-PIR scheme is constructed. Next, the SC-PIR schemes that have equal-size packets are investigated. Furthermore, the optimal equal-size sub-packetization among all capacity-achieving linear SC-PIR schemes characterized by Woolsey et al. is proved to be \frac N(M-1)gcd(N,M), which is achieved by a construction of SDA. Finally, by allowing unequal size of packets, a greedy SDA construction is proposed, where the sub-packetization of the associated SC-PIR scheme is upper bounded by \frac N(M-1)gcd(N,M). Among all capacity-achieving linear SC-PIR schemes, the sub-packetization is optimal when min{M,N-M}|N or M=N, and within a multiplicative gap \frac min{M,N-M}gcd(N,M) of the optimal one in general. In particular, for the special case N=d·M±1 where the positive integer d ≥ 2, we propose another SDA construction to obtain lower sub-packetization.},

  abstract     = {Information-theoretic formulations of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem have been investigated under a variety of scenarios. Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) is a variant where a user is able to privately retrieve one out of K messages from N non-colluding replicated databases without learning anything about the remaining K-1 messages. However, the goal of perfect privacy can be too taxing for certain applications. In this paper, we investigate if the information-theoretic capacity of SPIR (equivalently, the inverse of the minimum download cost) can be increased by relaxing both user and DB privacy definitions. Such relaxation is relevant in applications where privacy can be traded for communication efficiency. We introduce and investigate the Asymmetric Leaky PIR (AL-PIR) model with different privacy leakage budgets in each direction. For user privacy leakage, we bound the probability ratios between all possible realizations of DB queries by a function of a non-negative constant ϵ. For DB privacy, we bound the mutual information between the undesired messages, the queries, and the answers, by a function of a non-negative constant δ. We propose a general AL-PIR scheme that achieves an upper bound on the optimal download cost for arbitrary ϵ and δ. We show that the optimal download cost of AL-PIR is upper-bounded as D * (ϵ,δ) ≤ 1+\frac 1N-1-\frac δe ϵ N K-1 -1. Second, we obtain an information-theoretic lower bound on the download cost as D * (ϵ,δ) ≥ 1+\frac 1Ne ϵ -1-\frac δ(Ne ϵ ) K-1 -1. The gap analysis between the two bounds shows that our AL-PIR scheme is optimal when ϵ = 0, i.e., under perfect user privacy and it is optimal within a maximum multiplicative gap of \frac N-e -ϵ N-1 for any ϵ &gt; 0 and δ &gt; 0.},

The one-shot distillable dynamic entanglement of a bipartite quantum channel under the free superchannels is found to be bounded by a resource monotone that we construct from the hypothesis-testing relative entropy of channels with minimization over separable channels.

Secondly, built on the pair-elliptical family, we advocate using quantile-based statistics for estimating the scatter matrix. For this, we provide a family of quantile-based statistics. They outperform the existing ones for better balancing the efficiency and robustness. In particular, we show that the propose estimators have comparable performance to the moment-based counterparts under the Gaussian assumption.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a multi-armed bandit in which each arm is a Markov process evolving on a finite state space. The state space is common across the arms, and the arms are independent of each other. The transition probability matrix of one of the arms (the odd arm) is different from the common transition probability matrix of all the other arms. A decision maker, who knows these transition probability matrices, wishes to identify the odd arm as quickly as possible, while keeping the probability of decision error small. To do so, the decision maker collects observations from the arms by pulling the arms in a sequential manner, one at each discrete time instant. However, the decision maker has a trembling hand, and the arm that is actually pulled at any given time differs, with a small probability, from the one he intended to pull. The observation at any given time is the arm that is actually pulled and its current state. The Markov processes of the unobserved arms continue to evolve. This makes the arms restless. For the above setting, we derive the first known asymptotic lower bound on the expected time required to identify the odd arm, where the asymptotics is of vanishing error probability. The continued evolution of each arm adds a new dimension to the problem, leading to a family of Markov decision problems (MDPs) on a countable state space. We then stitch together certain parameterised solutions to these MDPs and obtain a sequence of strategies whose expected times to identify the odd arm come arbitrarily close to the lower bound in the regime of vanishing error probability. Prior works dealt with independent and identically distributed (across time) arms and rested Markov arms, whereas our work deals with restless Markov arms.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by applications such as discovering strong ties in social networks and assembling genome subsequences in biology, we study the problem of recovering a hidden $2k$ -nearest neighbor (NN) graph in an $n$ -vertex complete graph, whose edge weights are independent and distributed according to $P_{n}$ for edges in the hidden $2k$ -NN graph and $Q_{n}$ otherwise. The special case of Bernoulli distributions corresponds to a variant of the Watts-Strogatz small-world graph. We focus on two types of asymptotic recovery guarantees as $n\to \infty $ : (1) exact recovery: all edges are classified correctly with probability tending to one; (2) almost exact recovery: the expected number of misclassified edges is $o(nk)$ . We show that the maximum likelihood estimator achieves (1) exact recovery for $2 \le k \le n^{o(1)}$ if $\liminf \frac {2\alpha _{n}}{\log n}&amp;gt;1$ ; (2) almost exact recovery for $1 \le k \le o\left ({\frac {\log n}{\log \log n} }\right)$ if $\liminf \frac {kD(P_{n}||Q_{n})}{\log n}&amp;gt;1$ , where $\alpha _{n} \triangleq -2 \log \int \sqrt {d P_{n} d Q_{n}} ^{^{^{^{}}}}$ is the Rényi divergence of order $\frac {1}{2}$ and $D(P_{n}||Q_{n})$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Under mild distributional assumptions, these conditions are shown to be information-theoretically necessary for any algorithm to succeed. A key challenge in the analysis is the enumeration of $2k$ -NN graphs that differ from the hidden one by a given number of edges. We also analyze several computationally efficient algorithms and provide sufficient conditions under which they achieve exact/almost exact recovery. In particular, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that attains the threshold for exact recovery under the small-world model.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by modern applications of light detection and ranging (LIDAR), we study the model of an optical receiver based on an avalanche photo-diode (APD), followed by electronic circuitry for detection of reflected optical signals and estimation of their delay. This model is known to be quite complicated as it consists of at least three different types of noise: thermal noise, shot noise, and multiplicative noise (excess noise) that stems from the random gain associated with the photo-multiplication of the APD. Consequently, the derivation of the optimal likelihood ratio test (LRT) associated with signal detection is a non-trivial task, which has no apparent exact closed-form solution. We consider instead a class of relatively simple detectors, that are based on correlating the noisy received signal with a given deterministic waveform, and our purpose is to characterize the optimal waveform in the sense of the best tradeoff between the false-alarm (FA) error exponent and the missed-detection (MD) error exponent. In the same spirit, we also study the problem of estimating the delay on the basis of maximizing the correlation between the received signal and a time-shifted waveform, as a function of this time shift. We characterize the optimal correlator waveform that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) in the regime of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The optimal correlator waveforms for detection and for estimation turn out to be different, but their limiting behavior is the same: when the thermal Gaussian noise is dominant, the optimal correlator waveform becomes proportional to the clean signal, but when the thermal noise is negligible compared to the other noises, then it becomes a logarithmic function of the clean signal, as expected.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a memoryless state-dependent multiple access channel (MAC) where two transmitters wish to convey a message to a receiver under the assumption of causal and imperfect channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) and imperfect channel state information at receiver (CSIR). In order to emphasize the limitation of transmitter cooperation between physically distributed nodes, we focus on the so-called distributed CSIT assumption, i.e., where each transmitter has its individual channel knowledge, while the message can be assumed to be partially or entirely shared a priori between transmitters by exploiting some on-board memory. Under this setup, the first part of the paper characterizes the common message capacity of the channel at hand for arbitrary CSIT and CSIR structure. The optimal scheme builds on Shannon strategies, i.e., optimal codes are constructed by letting the channel inputs be a function of current CSIT only. For a special case when CSIT is a deterministic function of CSIR, the considered scheme also achieves the capacity region of a common message and two private messages. The second part addresses an important instance of the previous general result in a context of a cooperative multi-antenna Gaussian channel under i.i.d. fading operating in frequency-division duplex mode, such that CSIT is acquired via an explicit feedback of perfect CSIR. The capacity of the channel at hand is achieved by distributed linear precoding applied to Gaussian codes. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that it is suboptimal to send a number of data streams bounded by the number of transmit antennas as typically considered in a centralized CSIT setup. Finally, numerical examples are provided to evaluate the sum capacity of the binary MAC with binary states as well as the Gaussian MAC with i.i.d. fading.},

They can support more users than perfect complementary sequence sets in MC-CDMA systems. It is desirable to design QCSSs with good parameters that are a trade-off of large set size, small periodic maximum magnitude correlation and small alphabet size. The main results are to construct new infinite families of QCSSs that all have small alphabet size and asymptotically optimal periodic maximum magnitude correlation. In this paper, we propose three new constructions of QCSSs using additive characters over finite fields. Notably, these QCSSs have new parameters and small alphabet sizes. Using the properties of characters and character sums, we determine their maximum periodic correlation magnitudes and prove that these QCSSs are asymptotically optimal with respect to the lower bound.},

Cyclic-skew-cyclic codes are characterized as left ideals of a suitable non-commutative finite ring, constructed using skew polynomials on top of polynomials (or vice versa). Single generators of such left ideals are found, and they are used to construct generator matrices of the corresponding codes. The notion of defining set is introduced, using pairs of roots of skew polynomials on top of poynomials. A lower bound (called sum-rank BCH bound) on the minimum sum-rank distance is given for cyclic-skew-cyclic codes whose defining set contains certain consecutive pairs. Sum-rank BCH codes, with prescribed minimum sum-rank distance, are then defined as the largest cyclic-skew-cyclic codes whose defining set contains such consecutive pairs. The defining set of a sum-rank BCH code is described, and a lower bound on its dimension is obtained. Thanks to it, tables are provided showing that sum-rank BCH codes beat previously known codes for the sum-rank metric for binary 2 ×2 matrices (i.e., codes whose codewords are lists of 2 ×2 binary matrices, for a wide range of list lengths that correspond to the code length). Finally, a decoder for sum-rank BCH codes up to half their prescribed distance is obtained.},

In this paper we construct some classes of new Euclidean LCD MDS codes and Hermitian LCD MDS codes which are not monomially equivalent to Reed-Solomon codes, called LCD MDS codes of non-Reed-Solomon type. Our method is based on the constructions of Beelen et al. (2017) and Roth and Lempel (1989). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper on the construction of LCD MDS codes of non-Reed-Solomon type; any LCD MDS code of non-Reed-Solomon type constructed by our method is not monomially equivalent to any LCD code constructed by the method of Carlet et al. (2018).},

  abstract     = {We consider (n, k , l) MDS codes of length n, dimension k, and subpacketization l over a finite field F . A codeword of such a code consists of n column-vectors of length l over F , with the property that any k of them suffice to recover the entire codeword. Each of these n vectors may be stored on a separate node in a network. If one of the n nodes fails, we can recover its content by downloading symbols from the surviving nodes, and the total number of symbols downloaded in the worst case is called the repair bandwidth of the code. By the cut-set bound, the repair bandwidth of an (n, k , l) MDS code is at least l(n-1)/(n- k). There are several constructions of MDS codes whose repair bandwidth meets or asymptotically meets the cut-set bound. For example, letting r=n-k denote the number of parities, Ye and Barg constructed (n, k, r n ) Reed-Solomon codes that asymptotically meet the cut-set bound, Ye and Barg also constructed optimal-bandwidth and optimal-update (n, k, r n ) MDS codes. Wang, Tamo, and Bruck constructed optimal-bandwidth (n, k, r n/(r+1) ) MDS codes, and these codes have the smallest known subpacketization for optimal-bandwidth MDS codes. A key idea in all these constructions is to represent certain integers in base r. We show how this technique can be refined to improve the subpacketization of the two MDS code constructions by Ye and Barg, while achieving asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth. Specifically, when r=s m for an integer s, we obtain an (n, k, s m+n-1 ) Reed-Solomon code and an optimal-update (n, k, s m+ n-1 ) MDS code, both having asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth. Thus for r = 2 m , for example, we achieve the subpacketization of 2 m+n-1 rather than 2 mn in the original constructions by Ye and Barg. When r is not an integral power, we can still obtain (n, k, s m+n-1 ) Reed-Solomon codes and optimal-update ( n, k, s m+ n-1 ) MDS codes by choosing positive integers s and m such that s m ≤ r. In this case, however, the resulting codes have bandwidth that is near-optimal rather than asymptotically optimal. We also present an extension of this idea to reduce the subpacketization of the Wang-Tamo-Bruck construction while achieving a repair-by-transfer scheme with asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth. For example, for r = 2 m we achieve the subpacketization of 2 k/r+ m-1 , which significantly improves upon the subpacketization of 2 mn/(r+1) in the Wang-Tamo-Bruck construction. Based on the foregoing examples, we believe our approach may be generally useful in reducing the subpacketization of MDS code constructions that utilize r-ary expansion.},

The speed-ups are achieved by new algorithms that reduce the cores of the underlying computational problems of the decoders to one common tool: computing left and right approximant bases of matrices over skew polynomial rings. To accomplish this, we describe a skew-analogue of the existing PM-Basis algorithm for matrices over ordinary polynomials. This captures the bulk of the work in multiplication of skew polynomials, and the complexity benefit comes from existing algorithms performing this faster than in classical quadratic complexity. The new algorithms for the various decoding-related computational problems are interesting in their own and have further applications, in particular parts of decoders of several other codes and foundational problems related to the remainder-evaluation of skew polynomials.},

In this paper, we give a further study on the construction of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes via generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes and their extended codes. The main idea of our construction is to choose suitable evaluation points such that the corresponding (extended) GRS codes are Euclidean self-dual. Firstly, we consider the evaluation set consists of two disjoint subsets, one of which is based on the trace function, the other one is a union of a subspace and its cosets. Then four new families of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes are constructed. Secondly, we give a simple but useful lemma to ensure that the symmetric difference of two intersecting subsets of finite fields can be taken as the desired evaluation set. Based on this lemma, we generalize our first construction and provide two new families of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes. Finally, by using two multiplicative subgroups and their cosets which have nonempty intersection, we present three generic constructions of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes with flexible parameters. Several new families of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes are explicitly constructed.},

Bounds are given in terms of Sibson&#39;s Mutual Information, α-Divergences, Hellinger Divergences, and f-Divergences. A case of particular interest is the Maximal Leakage (or Sibson&#39;s Mutual Information of order infinity), since this measure is robust to post-processing and composes adaptively.

As a result, we have reduced the problem of finding the compositional inverse of such a permutation polynomial over a finite field to that of finding the inverse of a bijection over a smaller set. We demonstrate our method by interpreting several recent known results, as well as by providing new explicit results on more classes of permutation polynomials in different types.

  abstract     = {We study a distributed sampling problem where a set of processors want to output (approximately) independent and identically distributed samples from a given joint distribution with the help of a common message from a coordinator. Each processor has access to a subset of sources from a set of independent sources of “shared” randomness. We consider two cases - in the “omniscient coordinator setting”, the coordinator has access to all these sources of shared randomness, while in the “oblivious coordinator setting,” it has access to none. In addition, all processors and the coordinator may privately randomize. In the omniscient coordinator setting, when the subsets at the processors are disjoint (individually shared randomness model), we characterize the rate of communication required from the coordinator to the processors over a multicast link. For the two-processor case, the optimal rate matches a special case of relaxed Wyner&#39;s common information proposed by Gastpar and Sula (2019), thereby providing an operational meaning to the latter. We also give an upper bound on the communication rate for the “randomness-on-the-forehead” model where each processor observes all but one source of randomness and present an achievable strategy for the general case where the processors have access to arbitrary subsets of sources of randomness. Also, we consider a more general model where the processors observe components of correlated sources (with the coordinator observing all the components), where we characterize the communication rate when all the processors wish to output the same random sequence. In the oblivious coordinator setting, we completely characterize the trade-off region between the communication and shared randomness rates for the general case where the processors have access to arbitrary subsets of sources of randomness.},

It is known to hold for some special function classes such as XOR functions f(x ⊕ y) when the outer function f is monotone, symmetric, AC 0 , low F 2 -degree, linear threshold or read-k. However, for AND functions f(x ∧ y), Log-rank conjecture is only known to hold when the outer function is a monotone function or a function with small alternating numbers. In this paper, we show that Log-rank conjecture holds for AND functions whose outer functions are read-once F 2 -degree polynomials, constant-F 2 -degree polynomials, and symmetric functions. For read-once and symmetric AND functions, their proof are based on the elementary analysis of Möbius sparsity of the outer functions and designing efficient protocols for computing the corresponding AND functions in terms of the Möbius sparsity of their outer functions. For a constant- F 2 -degree AND function f(x ∧ y), we use the concept of the variable rank to design a decision tree for computing f where the tree depth is bounded above by a polynomial in the logarithm of the Möbius sparsity of f. The communication protocol can be obtained easily from the constructed decision tree. Our results deepen the understanding of the log-rank conjecture for AND functions.},

The concept of seed PU matrices is introduced and a systematic approach on how to compute the explicit forms of the functions in constructed CSSs and CCCs from the seed PU matrices is given. A general form of these functions only depends on a basis of the functions from \mathbb Z N to \mathbb Z q and representatives in the equivalent class of Butson-type Hadamard (BH) matrices. Especially, the realization of Golay pairs from our general form exactly coincides with the standard Golay pairs. The realization of ternary complementary sequences of size 3 is first reported here. For the realization of the quaternary complementary sequences of size 4, almost all the sequences derived here are never reported before. Generalized seed PU matrices and the recursive constructions of the desired PU matrices are also studied, and a large number of new constructions of CSSs and CCCs are given accordingly. From the perspective of this paper, all the known results of CSSs and CCCs with explicit GBF form in the literature (except non-standard Golay pairs) are constructed from the WHT matrices. This suggests that the proposed method with other BH matrices will yield a large number of new CSSs and CCCs with the significantly increasing number of the sequences of low peak-to-mean envelope power ratio.},

Mesnager et al. (2019) generalized this result by showing conditions on Λ (x) = x + Σj=1σ αjx2tj, αj ∈ F 2m, under which F(x) = x2r Trnm(Λ (x)) has the maximal possible number of bent components. We simplify these conditions and further analyse this class of functions. For all related vectorial bent functions F(x) = Trnm(γF(x)), γ ∈ F2n F 2m, which as we will point out belong to the Maiorana-McFarland class, we describe the collection of the solution spaces for the linear equations DaF(x) = F(x) + F(x+a) + F(a) = 0, which forms a spread of F2n. Analysing these spreads, we can infer neat conditions for functions H(x) = (F(x),G(x)) from F2n to F2m× F 2m to exhibit small differential uniformity (for instance for Λ (x) = x and r=0 this fact is used in the construction of Carlet&#39;s, Pott-Zhou&#39;s, Taniguchi&#39;s APN-function).

  abstract     = {One objective of this paper is to propose a novel class of sequence pairs, called “quasi-orthogonal Z-complementary pairs (QOZCPs)”, each depicting Z-complementary property for their aperiodic auto-correlation sums and also having a low correlation zone when their aperiodic cross-correlation is considered. Construction of QOZCPs based on Successively Distributed Algorithms under Majorization Minimization (SDAMM) is presented. Another objective of this paper is to apply the proposed QOZCPs in fully polarimetric radar systems and analyse the corresponding ambiguity functions. It turns out that QOZCP waveforms are much more Doppler resilient than the known Golay complementary waveforms.},

In dimension six, we were able to conduct an exhaustive search and obtain that there is only one such APN permutation up to CCZ-equivalence. In dimensions 7 and 8, we performed an exhaustive search for all but a few classes of linear self-equivalences and we did not find any new APN permutation.

While we have already built provable security models against the differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis cryptanalysis, impossible differential and zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis, the provable security against the meet-in-the-middle attack is missing. In this paper, we propose the subset representation of function based on which we could give an algorithm to compute the exact number of parameters of the Demirci-Selçuk&#39;s distinguisher given the input and output, respectively. Experiments show that this algorithm can be more efficient than the automatical tool presented by Shi et al. at Asiacrypt 2018. We further extract a formula based on this algorithm and show an upper bound for the length of the Demirci-Selçuk&#39;s distinguisher of an iterative SPN cipher. We prove that for an SPN block cipher whose block size equals the key size, an effective Demirci-Selçuk-type meet-in-the-middle distinguisher covers at most twice the maximum of the primitive indexes of the linear layer and its inverse. As a result, we show that the known length of the Demirci-Selçuk&#39;s distinguisher of the AES-128 cannot be improved unless the details of the S-boxes are exploited, which demonstrates that the AES has a provable security against the Demirci-Selçuk&#39;s meet-in-the-middle attack.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the resistance against algebraic attacks and fast algebraic attacks are considered as an important cryptographic property for Boolean functions used in stream ciphers. Both attacks are very powerful analysis concepts and can be applied to symmetric cryptographic algorithms used in stream ciphers. The notion of algebraic immunity has received wide attention since it is a powerful tool to measure the resistance of a Boolean function to standard algebraic attacks. Nevertheless, an algebraic tool to handle the resistance to fast algebraic attacks is not clearly identified in the literature. In the current paper, we propose a new parameter to measure a Boolean function&#39;s resistance to fast algebraic attack. We also introduce the notion of fast immunity profile and show that it informs both on the resistance to standard and fast algebraic attacks. Further, we evaluate our parameter for two secondary constructions of Boolean functions. Moreover, A coding-theory approach to the characterization of perfect algebraic immune functions is presented. Via this characterization, infinite families of binary linear complementary dual codes (or LCD codes for short) are obtained from perfect algebraic immune functions. Some of the binary LCD codes presented in this paper are optimal. These binary LCD codes have applications in armoring implementations against so-called side-channel attacks (SCA) and fault non-invasive attacks, in addition to their applications in communication and data storage systems.},

In this paper, we introduce and quantitatively characterize the two resolution limits for the line spectral estimation problem under deterministic noise: one is the minimum separation distance between the line spectra that is required for exact detection of their number, and the other is the minimum separation distance between the line spectra that is required for a stable recovery of their supports. The quantitative results imply a phase transition phenomenon in each of the two recovery problems, and also the subtle difference between the two. We further propose a sweeping singular-value-thresholding algorithm for the number detection problem and conduct numerical experiments. The numerical results confirm the phase transition phenomenon in the number detection problem.},

This problem finds numerous applications in signal processing, computer vision, and inverse problems. However, it is challenging to learn the filter efficiently due to the bilinear structure of the observations with respect to the unknown filter and inputs, as well as the sparsity constraint. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on nonconvex optimization over the sphere manifold by minimizing a smooth surrogate of the sparsity-promoting loss function. It is demonstrated that manifold gradient descent with random initializations will probably recover the filter, up to scaling and shift ambiguity, as soon as the number of observations is sufficiently large under an appropriate random data model. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method with comparisons to existing ones.},

This scenario is easily found in real-world wireless networks, where the two types of traffic coexist and share limited radio resources. We focus on single-transmitter, single-antenna wireless networks with cache-aided receivers, where the wireless channel is modelled by a degraded Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC). For this setting, we study the delay-rate trade-off, which characterizes the content delivery time and non-content communication rates that can be achieved simultaneously. We propose a scheme based on the separation principle, which isolates the coded caching and multicasting problem from the physical layer transmission problem. We show that this separation-based scheme is sufficient for achieving an information-theoretically order-optimal performance, up to a multiplicative factor of 2.01 for the content delivery time, when working in the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) limit. We further show that the achievable performance is near-optimal after relaxing the GDoF limit, up to an additional additive factor of 2 bits per dimension for the non-content rates. A key insight emerging from our scheme is that in some scenarios considerable amounts of non-content traffic can be communicated while maintaining the minimum content delivery time, achieved in the absence of non-content messages; compliments of `topological holes&#39; arising from asymmetries in wireless channel gains.},

This paper studies how to improve the computational complexity for the problem of minimizing the sum-rate for attaining omniscience in V. While the existing algorithms rely on the submodular function minimization (SFM) techniques and complete in O(|V| 2 · SFM (|V|) time, we prove the strict strong map property of the nesting SFM problem. We propose a parametric (PAR) algorithm that utilizes the parametric SFM techniques and reduces the complexity to O(|V| · SFM (|V|). We propose efficient solutions to the successive omniscience (SO): attaining omniscience successively in user subsets. We first focus on how to determine a complimentary subset X * \subsetneq V in the existing two-stage SO such that if the local omniscience in X * is reached first, the global omniscience whereafter can still be attained with the minimum sum-rate. It is shown that such a subset can be extracted at one of the iterations of the PAR algorithm. We then propose a novel multi-stage SO strategy: a nesting sequence of complimentary user subsets X * (1) \subsetneq ...\subsetneq X * (K) = V, the omniscience in which is attained progressively by the monotonic rate vectors r V (1) ≤ ...≤ r V (K) . We propose algorithms to obtain this K-stage SO from the returned results by the PAR algorithm. The run time of these algorithms is the same as the PAR algorithm.},

The outputs of a discrete Poisson channel with memory are Poisson distributed random variables with a mean comprising of a fixed additive noise and a linear combination of past input symbols. Assuming a maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder, we search for a codebook that has the smallest possible error probability. This problem is challenging because error probability of a code does not have a closed-form analytical expression. For the case of having only a total-power constraint, the optimal code structure is obtained, provided that the blocklength is greater than the memory length of the channel. For the case of having only a peak-power constraint, the optimal code is derived for arbitrary memory and blocklength in the high-power regime. For the case of having both the peak-power and total-power constraints, the optimal code is derived for memoryless Poisson channels when both the total-power and the peak-power bounds are large.},

We assume that the channel state is deterministic and known to all the nodes. While the private-message capacity region is well known to be achievable with dirty paper coding (DPC), we are interested in the simpler linearly precoded transmission schemes. In particular, we focus on linear precoding schemes combined with rate-splitting (RS). First, we derive an achievable rate region with minimum mean square error (MMSE) precoding at the transmitter and joint decoding of the sub-messages at the receivers. Then, we study the achievable sum rate of this scheme and obtain two findings: 1) an analytically tractable upper bound on the sum rate that is shown numerically to be a close approximation, and 2) how to reduce the number of active streams - crucial to the overall complexity - while preserving the sum rate to within a constant loss. The latter results in two practical algorithms: a stream elimination algorithm and a stream ordering algorithm. Finally, we investigate the constant-gap optimality of linearly precoded RS with respect to the capacity. Our result reveals that, while the achievable rate of linear precoding alone can be arbitrarily far from the capacity, the introduction of RS can help achieve the capacity region to within a constant gap in the two-user case. Nevertheless, we prove that the RS scheme&#39;s constant-gap optimality does not extend to the three-user case. Specifically, we show, through a pathological example, that the gap between the sum rate and the sum capacity can be unbounded.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks can achieve impressive performance in the regime where they are massively over-parameterized. Consequently, over the past year, there has been a growing interest in analyzing optimization and generalization properties of over-parameterized networks. However, the majority of existing work only applies to supervised learning. The role of over-parameterization in the unsupervised setting has by contrast gained far less attention. In this paper, we study the inductive bias of gradient descent for two-layer over-parameterized autoencoders with ReLU activation. We first provide theoretical evidence for the memorization phenomena observed in recent work using the property that infinitely wide neural networks under gradient descent evolve as linear models. We also analyze the gradient dynamics of the autoencoders in the finite-width setting. Starting from a randomly initialized autoencoder network, we rigorously prove the linear convergence of gradient descent in two weakly-trained and jointly-trained regimes. Our results indicate the considerable benefits of joint training over weak training in finding global optima, achieving a dramatic decrease in the required level of over-parameterization. Finally, we analyze the case of weight-tied autoencoders and prove that in the over-parameterized setting, training such networks from randomly initialized points leads to certain unexpected degeneracies.},

This relation on the one hand extends the optimal transport as well as the probabilistic graphical model theories, and on the other hand leads to fast algorithms for multi-marginal optimal transport by leveraging the well-developed algorithms in Bayesian inference.

To cope with the non-convexity issues arising from unlabelled heterogeneous data and low-complexity structure, we develop a three-stage meta-algorithm that is guaranteed to recover the unknown matrices with near-optimal sample and computational complexities under Gaussian designs. In addition, the proposed algorithm is provably stable against random noise. We complement the theoretical studies with empirical evidence that confirms the efficacy of our algorithm.},

In particular, we consider the problem of classifying m binary labels with XOR queries that ask whether the number of objects having a given attribute in the chosen subset of size d is even or odd. The subset size d, which we call query degree, can be varying over queries. We consider a general noise model where the accuracy of answers on queries changes depending both on the worker (the data provider) and query degree d. For this general model, we characterize the information-theoretic limit on the optimal number of queries to reliably recover m labels in terms of a given combination of degree-d queries and noise parameters.

In our security proof, the eavesdropper is allowed to modify wiretapped information dependently on the previously wiretapped messages. Our protocol guarantees the secrecy by utilizing one-way classical information transmission (public communication) in the same direction as the quantum network although the verification of quantum information transmission requires two-way classical communication.

Our canonical form provides a one-to-one correspondence between Clifford operators and layered quantum circuits. We report a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the canonical form. We employ this canonical form to generate a random uniformly distributed n-qubit Clifford operator in runtime O(n 2 ). The number of random bits consumed by the algorithm matches the information-theoretic lower bound. A surprising connection is highlighted between random uniform Clifford operators and the Mallows distribution on the symmetric group. The variants of the canonical form, one with a short Hadamard-free part and one allowing a circuit depth 9n implementation of arbitrary Clifford unitaries in the Linear Nearest Neighbor architecture are also discussed.

One type of gluing combines a perfect channel with a second channel to produce a generalized erasure channel pair ( B g , C g ). We consider two cases in which the second channel is (i) an amplitude-damping, or (ii) a phase-damping qubit channel; (ii) is the dephrasure channel of Leditzky et al. For both (i) and (ii), ( B g , C g ) depends on the damping parameter 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and a parameter 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 that characterizes the gluing process. In both cases we study Q (1) ( B g ) and Q (1) ( C g ), where Q (1) is the channel coherent information, and determine the regions in the (p, λ) plane where each is zero or positive, confirming previous results for (ii). A somewhat surprising result for which we lack any intuitive explanation is that Q (1) ( C g ) is zero for λ ≤ 1/2 when p=0, but is strictly positive (though perhaps extremely small) for all values of λ &gt; 0 when p is positive by even the smallest amount. In addition we study the nonadditivity of Q (1) ( B g ) for two identical channels in parallel. It occurs in a well-defined region of the (p, λ) plane in case (i). In case (ii) we have extended previous results for the dephrasure channel without, however, identifying the full range of (p, λ) values where nonadditivity occurs.

By optimizing the parametrized extended channels with specific structures such as the flag structure, we obtain new upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the original quantum channel. Furthermore, we extend our approach to estimating the fundamental limits of private communication and one-way entanglement distillation. As notable applications, we establish improved upper bounds to the quantum and private capacities for fundamental quantum channels of interest in quantum information, some of which are also the sources of noise in superconducting quantum computing.

Encouragingly, we can expect local quantum error-correcting codes with no string-like logical operators - such as the cubic code - to be robust to highly correlated, one-dimensional errors that span their lattice. The challenge remains to design decoding algorithms that utilise the high distance of these codes. Here, we begin the development of such algorithms by proposing an efficient decoder for the `Fibonacci code&#39;; a two-dimensional classical code that mimics the fractal nature of the cubic code. Our iterative decoder finds a correction through repeated use of minimum-weight perfect matching by exploiting symmetries of the code. We perform numerical experiments that show our decoder is robust to one-dimensional, correlated errors. First, using a bit-flip noise model at low error rates, we find that our decoder demonstrates a logical failure rate that scales super exponentially in the linear size of the lattice. In contrast, a decoder that could not tolerate spanning errors would not achieve this rapid decay in failure rate with increasing system size. We also find a finite threshold using a spanning noise model that introduces string-like errors that stretch along full rows and columns of the lattice. These results provide direct evidence that our decoder is robust to one-dimensional, correlated errors that span the lattice.},

However, in some multi-terminal communications scenarios, using random codes with constant finite blocklength in certain coding architectures leads to improved achievable regions compared to the conventional approach. In other words, in some network communication scenarios, there is a finite optimal value in the blocklength of the randomly generated code used for distributed processing of information sources. Motivated by this, a coding scheme is proposed which consists of two codebook layers: i) the primary codebook which has constant finite blocklength, and ii) the secondary codebook whose blocklength is taken to be asymptotically large. The achievable performance is analyzed in two steps. In the first step, a characterization of an inner bound to the achievable region is derived in terms information measures which are functions of multi-letter probability distributions.

  abstract     = {Sparse superposition codes, also referred to as sparse regression codes (SPARCs), are a class of codes for efficient communication over the AWGN channel at rates approaching the channel capacity. In a standard SPARC, codewords are sparse linear combinations of columns of an i.i.d. Gaussian design matrix, while in a spatially coupled SPARC the design matrix has a block-wise structure, where the variance of the Gaussian entries can be varied across blocks. A well-designed spatial coupling structure can significantly enhance the error performance of iterative decoding algorithms such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP). In this paper, we obtain a non-asymptotic bound on the probability of error of spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding. Applying this bound to a simple band-diagonal design matrix, we prove that spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel. The bound also highlights how the decay of error probability depends on each design parameter of the spatially coupled SPARC. An attractive feature of AMP decoding is that its asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) can be predicted via a deterministic recursion called state evolution. Our result provides the first proof that the MSE concentrates on the state evolution prediction for spatially coupled designs. Combined with the state evolution prediction, this result implies that spatially coupled SPARCs with the proposed band-diagonal design are capacity-achieving. Using the proof technique used to establish the main result, we also obtain a concentration inequality for the MSE of AMP applied to compressed sensing with spatially coupled design matrices. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results that demonstrate the finite length error performance of spatially coupled SPARCs. The performance is compared with coded modulation schemes that use LDPC codes from the DVB-S2 standard.},

We establish an area property based on the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. Under the assumption that the state evolution for AMP is correct for the coded system, the achievable rate of AMP is analyzed. We prove that AMP achieves the constrained capacity of the LRMS with an arbitrary signal distribution provided that a matching condition is satisfied. As a byproduct, we provide an alternative derivation for the constraint capacity of an LRMS using a proved property of AMP. We discuss realization techniques for the matching principle of binary signaling using irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and provide related numerical results. We show that the optimized codes demonstrate significantly better performance over un-matched ones under AMP. For quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation, bit error rate (BER) performance within 1 dB from the constrained capacity limit is observed.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes Bayes-optimal convolutional approximate message-passing (CAMP) for signal recovery in compressed sensing. CAMP uses the same low-complexity matched filter (MF) for interference suppression as approximate message-passing (AMP). To improve the convergence property of AMP for ill-conditioned sensing matrices, the so-called Onsager correction term in AMP is replaced by a convolution of all preceding messages. The tap coefficients in the convolution are determined so as to realize asymptotic Gaussianity of estimation errors via state evolution (SE) under the assumption of orthogonally invariant sensing matrices. An SE equation is derived to optimize the sequence of denoisers in CAMP. The optimized CAMP is proved to be Bayes-optimal for all orthogonally invariant sensing matrices if the SE equation converges to a fixed-point and if the fixed-point is unique. For sensing matrices with low-to-moderate condition numbers, CAMP can achieve the same performance as high-complexity orthogonal/vector AMP that requires the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) filter instead of the MF.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a generalization of sparse superposition codes (SPARCs) for communication over the complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In a SPARC, the codebook is defined in terms of a design matrix, and each codeword is a generated by multiplying the design matrix with a sparse message vector. In the standard SPARC construction, information is encoded in the locations of the non-zero entries of the message vector. In this paper we generalize the construction and consider modulated SPARCs, where information is encoded in both the locations and the values of the non-zero entries of the message vector. We focus on the case where the non-zero entries take values from a phase-shift keying (PSK) constellation. We propose a computationally efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder, and obtain analytical bounds on the state evolution parameters which predict the error performance of the decoder. Using these bounds we show that PSK-modulated SPARCs are asymptotically capacity achieving for the complex AWGN channel, with either spatial coupling or power allocation. We also provide numerical simulation results to demonstrate the error performance at finite code lengths. These results show that introducing modulation to the SPARC design can significantly reduce decoding complexity without sacrificing error performance.},

The goal of this study is twofold. First we study the setup in which not all substrings in the multispectrum are received, and then we focus on the case where the read substrings are not error free. In each case we provide specific code constructions of strings that their reconstruction is guaranteed even in the presence of failure in either model. We present efficient encoding and decoding maps and analyze the cardinality of the code constructions, while studying the cases where the rates of our codes approach 1.},

  abstract     = {Error-correcting codes that admit local decoding and correcting algorithms have been the focus of much recent research due to their numerous applications. An important goal is to obtain the best possible tradeoffs between the number of symbols of the codeword that the local decoding algorithm must examine (the locality), and the amount of redundancy in the encoding (the information rate). In Hamming&#39;s classical adversarial channel model, the current tradeoffs are dramatic, allowing either small locality but superpolynomial blocklength, or small blocklength but high locality. However, in the computationally bounded adversarial channel model, proposed by Lipton (STACS 1994), constructions of locally decodable codes suddenly exhibit small locality and small blocklength, but these constructions require strong trusted setup assumptions. We study variants of locally decodable and locally correctable codes in computationally bounded, adversarial channels, in a setting with no trusted setup. The only assumption we require is the selection of the public parameters (seed) for a collision-resistant hash function. Specifically, we provide constructions of relaxed locally correctable and relaxed locally decodable codes over the binary alphabet, with constant information rate, and poly-logarithmic locality. Our constructions, which compare favorably with their classical analogs, crucially employ collision-resistant hash functions and local expander graphs, extending ideas from recent cryptographic constructions of memory-hard functions.},

We prove that the Hamming distance and weighted Hamming distance distributions can be characterized as mixture models capturing the decoding error probability and code weight enumerator. Simulation and numerical results show that our proposed statistical approaches can accurately describe the distance distributions. Based on these distributions and with the aim to reduce the decoding complexity, several techniques, including stopping rules and discarding rules, are proposed, and their decoding error performance and complexity are accordingly analyzed. Simulation results for decoding various eBCH codes demonstrate that the proposed techniques can significantly reduce the decoding complexity with a negligible loss in the decoding error performance.},

Thus, we find the trade-off between the design minimum distance, the number of errors, the acceptable list size and the resulting uncertainty, which corresponds to the required number of distinct retrieved outputs for successful reconstruction. It is therefore seen that by accepting list-decoding one may decrease coding redundancy, or the required number of reads, or both.},

All users of a given type have identical preferences for the items, and similarly, items of a given type are either all liked or all disliked by a given user. We assume that the matrix encoding the preferences of each user type for each item type is randomly generated; in this way, the model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, the amount of structure depending on the number of each of the types. The measure of performance of the recommendation system is the expected number of disliked recommendations per user, defined as expected regret. We propose two algorithms inspired by user-user and item-item collaborative filtering (CF), modified to explicitly make exploratory recommendations, and prove performance guarantees in terms of their expected regret. For two regimes of model parameters, with structure only in item space or only in user space, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds on regret that match our upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose CodedSketch, as a distributed straggler-resistant scheme to compute an approximation of the multiplication of two massive matrices. The objective is to reduce the recovery threshold, defined as the total number of worker nodes that the master node needs to wait for to be able to recover the final result. To exploit the fact that only an approximated result is required, in reducing the recovery threshold, some sorts of pre-compression are required. However, compression inherently involves some randomness that would lose the structure of the matrices. On the other hand, considering the structure of the matrices is crucial to reduce the recovery threshold. In CodedSketch, we use count-sketch, as a hash-based compression scheme, on the rows of the first and columns of the second matrix, and a structured polynomial code on the columns of the first and rows of the second matrix. This arrangement allows us to exploit the gain of both in reducing the recovery threshold. To increase the accuracy of computation, multiple independent count-sketches are needed. This independency allows us to theoretically characterize the accuracy of the result and establish the recovery threshold achieved by the proposed scheme. To guarantee the independency of resulting count-sketches in the output, while keeping its cost on the recovery threshold minimum, we use another layer of structured codes. The proposed scheme provides an upper-bound on the recovery threshold as a function of the required accuracy of computation and the probability that the required accuracy can be violated. In addition, it provides an upper-bound on the recovery threshold for the case that the result of the multiplication is sparse, and the exact result is required.},

  abstract     = {The task of aggregating and denoising crowd-labeled data has gained increased significance with the advent of crowdsourcing platforms and massive datasets. We propose a permutation-based model for crowd labeled data that is a significant generalization of the classical Dawid-Skene model, and introduce a new error metric by which to compare different estimators. We derive global minimax rates for the permutation-based model that are sharp up to logarithmic factors, and match the minimax lower bounds derived under the simpler Dawid-Skene model. We then design two computationally-efficient estimators: the WAN estimator for the setting where the ordering of workers in terms of their abilities is approximately known, and the OBI- WAN estimator where that is not known. For each of these estimators, we provide non-asymptotic bounds on their performance. We conduct synthetic simulations and experiments on real-world crowdsourcing data, and the experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {We consider the question of estimating a real low-complexity signal (such as a sparse vector or a low-rank matrix) from the phase of complex random measurements. We show that in this phase-only compressive sensing (PO-CS) scenario, we can perfectly recover such a signal with high probability and up to global unknown amplitude if the sensing matrix is a complex Gaussian random matrix and the number of measurements is large compared to the complexity level of the signal space. Our approach proceeds by recasting the (non-linear) PO-CS scheme as a linear compressive sensing model built from a signal normalization constraint, and a phase-consistency constraint imposing any signal estimate to match the observed phases in the measurement domain. Practically, stable and robust estimation of the signal direction is achieved from any instance optimal algorithm of the compressive sensing literature (such as basis pursuit denoising). This is ensured by proving that the matrix associated with this equivalent linear model satisfies with high probability the restricted isometry property under the above condition on the number of measurements. We finally observe experimentally that robust signal direction recovery is reached at about twice the number of measurements needed for signal recovery in compressive sensing.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with the problem of recovering high-dimensional signals x ∈ \mathbb R n which belong to a convex set of low complexity from a small number of quantized measurements. We propose to estimate the signals via a convex program based on rectified linear units (ReLUs) for two different quantization schemes, namely one-bit and uniform multi-bit quantization. Assuming that the linear measurement process can be modelled by a sensing matrix with i.i.d. subgaussian rows, we obtain for both schemes near-optimal uniform reconstruction guarantees by adding well-designed noise to the linear measurements prior to the quantization step. In the one-bit case, we show that the program is robust against adversarial bit corruptions as well as additive noise on the linear measurements. Further, our analysis quantifies precisely how the rate-distortion relationship of the program changes depending on whether we seek reconstruction accuracies above or below the level of additive noise. The proofs rely on recent results by Dirksen and Mendelson on non-Gaussian hyperplane tessellations. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with numerical experiments which compare our method to other state-of-the-art methodologies.},

We study the problem of recovering the parameter θ * from i.i.d. samples of the model when the covariates are drawn from a normal distribution. Our focus is on leveraging information about the (known) function class G in order to design a procedure that adapts to the noise level in the problem, thereby reducing the bias of parameter estimation. We show that when given access to a natural “labeling oracle”, our procedure recovers the underlying parameter at a rate that depends explicitly on how well we are able to estimate a suitably defined “inverse” link function. Both the procedure and its analysis framework are flexible, admitting any black-box estimator for the inverse link function. The resulting rate of parameter estimation significantly improves upon the risk of classical semi-parametric procedures whenever consistent estimates of the inverse link function can be obtained. When the function class G is appropriately structured and empirical risk minimization is used to estimate the inverse function, we provide quantitative upper bounds on the risk that depend on natural complexity measures of the class of inverse functions. We specialize our framework to the case where G is a sub-class of monotone single-index models, showing a computationally efficient, end-to-end algorithm that achieves very fast rates of parameter estimation in the regime in which the signal-to-noise ratio in the problem is large. We also pay particular attention to parameter identifiability in the noiseless model, deriving sharper upper bounds as well as information-theoretic lower bounds. Consequences for some unimodal SIMs and the (real) phase retrieval problem are also discussed.},

It is also an important nonparametric regression method for estimating functions with heterogenous smoothness. Recent results have shown the TVD estimator to be nearly minimax rate optimal for the class of functions with bounded variation. In this paper, we complement these worst case guarantees by investigating the adaptivity of the TVD estimator to functions which are piecewise constant on axis aligned rectangles. We rigorously show that, when the truth is piecewise constant with few pieces, the ideally tuned TVD estimator performs better than in the worst case. We also study the issue of choosing the tuning parameter. In particular, we propose a fully data driven version of the TVD estimator which enjoys similar worst case risk guarantees as the ideally tuned TVD estimator.},

The underlying communication network is modeled by a sequence of random digraphs and is subjected to nonuniform random time-varying delays in channels. Each node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of a consensus term taking a weighted sum of its own estimate and neighbours’ delayed estimates, and an innovation term processing its own new measurement at each time step. By stochastic time-varying system, martingale convergence theories and the binomial expansion of random matrix products, we transform the convergence analysis of the algorithm into that of the mathematical expectation of random matrix products. Firstly, for the delay-free case, we show that the algorithm gains can be designed properly such that all nodes’ estimates converge to the true parameter in mean square and almost surely if the observation matrices and communication graphs satisfy the stochastic spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Secondly, for the case with time delays, we introduce delay matrices to model the random time-varying communication delays between nodes. It is shown that under the stochastic spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition, for any given bounded delays, proper algorithm gains can be designed to guarantee mean square convergence for the case with conditionally balanced digraphs.},

Data freshness is measured by a non-decreasing penalty function of age of information, where all sources have the same age-penalty function. Sources take turns to generate update packets, and forward them to their destinations one-by-one through a shared channel with random delay. There is a scheduler, that chooses the update order of the sources, and a sampler, that determines when a source should generate a new packet in its turn. We aim to find the optimal scheduler-sampler pairs that minimize the total-average age-penalty at delivery times (Ta-APD) and the total-average age-penalty (Ta-AP). We prove that the Maximum Age First (MAF) scheduler and the zero-wait sampler are jointly optimal for minimizing the Ta-APD. Meanwhile, the MAF scheduler and a relative value iteration with reduced complexity (RVI-RC) sampler are jointly optimal for minimizing the Ta-AP. The RVI-RC sampler is based on a relative value iteration algorithm whose complexity is reduced by exploiting a threshold property in the optimal sampler. Finally, a low-complexity threshold-type sampler is devised via an approximate analysis of Bellman&#39;s equation. This threshold-type sampler reduces to a simple water-filling sampler for a linear age-penalty function.},

  abstract     = {Coded caching has the potential to greatly reduce network traffic by leveraging the cheap and abundant storage available in end-user devices so as to create multicast opportunities in the delivery phase. In the seminal work by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN), the shared-link coded caching problem was formulated, where each user demands one file (i.e., single file retrieval). This article generalizes the MAN caching problem formulation from single file retrieval on the binary filed to general scalar linear function retrieval on an arbitrary finite field. The proposed novel scheme is linear, based on MAN uncoded cache placement, and leverages ideas from interference alignment. Quite surprisingly, the worst-case load of the proposed scheme among all possible demands is the same as the one of the scheme by Yu, Maddah-Ali, and Avestimehr (YMA) for single file retrieval. The proposed scheme has thus the same optimality guarantees as YMA, namely, it is optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache placement, and is optimal to within a factor 2 otherwise. Some extensions of the proposed scheme are then discussed. It is shown that the proposed scheme works not only on arbitrary finite field, but also on any commutative ring. The key idea of this article can be also extended to all scenarios to which the original MAN scheme has been extended, including but not limited to demand-private retrieval and Device-to-Device networks.},

  abstract     = {In wireless networks, link strengths are often affected by some topological factors such as propagation path loss, shadowing and inter-cell interference. Thus, different users in the network might experience different link strengths. In this work we consider a K-user asymmetric interference channel, where the channel gains of the links connected to Receiver k are scaled with √{P αk }, k=1,2, ..., K, for 0 1 ≤ α 2 ≤ ...≤ α K . For this setting, we show that the optimal sum generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF) is characterized as d sum = Σ k=1 K α k + α K -α K-1 /2 which matches the existing result d sum = K/2 when α 1 = α 2 = ... = α K = 1. The achievability is based on multi-layer interference alignment, where different interference alignment sub-schemes are designed in different layers associated with specific power levels, and successive decoding is applied at the receivers. While the converse for the symmetric case only requires bounding the sum degrees-of-freedom (DoF) for selected two users, the converse for this asymmetric case involves bounding the weighted sum GDoF for selected J+2 users, with corresponding weights (2 J , 2 J-1 , ..., 2 2 , 2 1 ), a geometric sequence with common ratio 2, for the first J users and with corresponding weights (1, 1) for the last two users, for J ∈ {1,2, ..., [log K/2]}.},

We introduce a modification of conditional min-entropies, with respect to the set F of allowed transformations, and show that under some conditions on F, these quantities characterize approximate simulability. If F is the set of free superchannels in a quantum resource theory of processes, the modified conditional min-entropies form a complete set of resource monotones. If the transformations in F consist of a preprocessing and a postprocessing of specified forms, approximate simulability is also characterized in terms of success probabilities in certain guessing games, where a preprocessing of a given form can be chosen and the measurements are restricted. These results are applied to several specific cases of simulability of quantum channels, including postprocessings, preprocessings and processing of bipartite channels by LOCC superchannels and by partial superchannels, as well as simulability of sets of quantum measurements. These questions are first studied in a general setting that is an extension of the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPT), suitable for dealing with channels. Here we prove a general theorem that shows that approximate simulability can be characterized by comparing outcome probabilities in certain tests. This result is inspired by the classical Le Cam randomization criterion for statistical experiments and contains its finite dimensional version as a special case.},

In the unassisted setting, we introduce a variant of randomness extraction framework where free incoherent operations are allowed before the incoherent measurement and the randomness extractors. We then show that the maximum number of random bits extractable from a given quantum state is precisely equal to the maximum number of coherent bits distillable from the same state. This relation enables us to derive tight second order expansions of both tasks in the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent operation classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states all admit the same second order expansions, indicating their operational equivalence for coherence distillation in both asymptotic and large block length regimes. We then generalize the above line of research to the assisted setting, arising naturally in bipartite quantum systems where Bob distills coherence from the state at hand, aided by the benevolent Alice possessing the other system. More precisely, we introduce a new assisted incoherent randomness extraction task and establish an exact relation between this task and the assisted coherence distillation. It strengthens the one-shot relation in the unassisted setting and confirms that this cryptographic framework offers a new perspective to the study of quantum coherence distillation. Likewise, this relation yields second order characterizations to the assisted tasks. As by-products, we show the strong converse property of the tasks above from their second order expansions.},

  abstract     = {One-dimensional (1-D) Golay complementary pair (GCP) and its extension Z-complementary pair (ZCP) with additional zero autocorrelation zone property have been widely studied in the literature. Recently, the investigation of 1-D GCPs have been extended to two-dimensional (2-D) and higher dimensional Golay complementary array pairs (GCAPs). In this article, the concept of zero correlation zone (ZCZ) is applied to 2-D GCAP and the 2-D Z-complementary array pair (ZCAP) is presented. Several constructions of ZCAPs are proposed in this article and the existence of ZCAPs is discussed as well. Based on the proposed constructions, 2-D ZCAPs are shown to exist for all sizes. Furthermore, an upper bound on the rectangular ZCZ size of the 2-D ZCAP is derived when both dimensions are odd. The proposed constructions can include ZCAPs which achieve the upper bound.},

  abstract     = {The CEO problem has received much attention since first introduced by Berger et al., but there are limited results on non-Gaussian models with non-quadratic distortion measures. In this work, we extend the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem to two non-Gaussian settings with general rth power of difference distortion. Assuming an identical observation channel across agents, we study the asymptotics of distortion decay as the number of agents and sum-rate, R sum , grow without bound, while individual rates vanish. The first setting is a regular source-observation model with rth power of difference distortion, which subsumes the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem, and we establish that the distortion decays at O (R sum -r/2 ) when r ≥ 2. We use sample median estimation after the Berger-Tung scheme for achievability. The other setting is a non-regular source-observation model, including uniform additive noise models, with rth power of difference distortion for which estimation-theoretic regularity conditions do not hold. The distortion decay O (R sum -r ) when r ≥ 1 is obtained for the non-regular model by midrange estimator following the Berger-Tung scheme. We also provide converses based on the Shannon lower bound for the regular model and the Chazan-Zakai-Ziv bound for the non-regular model, respectively. Lastly, we provide a sufficient condition for the regular model, under which quadratic and logarithmic distortions are asymptotically equivalent by an entropy power relationship as the number of agents grows. This proof relies on the Bernstein-von Mises theorem.},

Specifically, we undertake a Shannon-theoretic study of the above scenarios and focus on characterizing sufficient conditions for lossless recoverability of the sources at the decoder(s). We enhance the fixed block-length (B-L) coding technique by incorporating the technique of inducing source correlation onto channel inputs, originally discovered by Cover, El Gamal and Salehi. In contrast to the first part, performance analysis of a joint source-channel decoder poses new challenges. We enhance the earlier developed suite of coding and analytical tools to overcome these challenges and derive (simplified) single-letter characterizations for a new set of sufficient conditions for both scenarios. For both the MAC and IC problems, the derived sufficient conditions are (i) subsumed in the current known tightest, and (ii) strictly weaker for identified examples. Lastly, we propose simple `plug-in&#39; approaches that can further weaken the derived sufficient conditions. Our findings enable us to subsume Dueck&#39;s findings (1981) and go even further for the example considered therein.},

  abstract     = {The classical binary hypothesis testing problem is revisited. We notice that when one of the hypotheses is composite, there is an inherent difficulty in defining an optimality criterion that is both informative and well-justified. For testing in the simple normal location problem (that is, testing for the mean of multivariate Gaussians), we overcome the difficulty as follows. In this problem there exists a natural “hardness” order between parameters as for different parameters the error-probabilities curves (when the parameter is known) are either identical, or one dominates the other. We can thus define minimax performance as the worst-case among parameters which are below some hardness level. Fortunately, there exists a universal minimax test, in the sense that it is minimax for all hardness levels simultaneously. Under this criterion we also find the optimal test for composite hypothesis testing with training data. THIS criterion extends to the wide class of local asymptotic normal models, in an asymptotic sense where the approximation of the error probabilities is additive. Since we have the asymptotically optimal tests for composite hypothesis testing with and without training data, we quantify the loss of universality and gain of training data for these models.},

First, we study the general discrete AVC with fixed parameters, a model that combines the AVC and the time-varying channel. We determine both the deterministic code capacity and the random code capacity. Super-additivity is demonstrated, showing that the deterministic code capacity can be strictly larger than the weighted sum of the parametric capacities. In the second part, we consider the arbitrarily varying Gaussian product channel (AVGPC). Hughes and Narayan characterized the random code capacity through min-max optimization leading to a “double” water filling solution. As in the case of the standard Gaussian AVC, the deterministic code capacity is discontinuous in the input constraint, and depends on which of the input or state constraint is higher. As opposed to Shannon&#39;s classic water filling solution, it is observed that deterministic coding using independent scalar codes is suboptimal for the AVGPC. Finally, we establish the capacity of the AVC with colored Gaussian noise, where double water filling is performed in the frequency domain. The analysis relies on our preceding results, on the AVC with fixed parameters and the AVGPC.},

We prove that, under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, the proposed ensemble can achieve the capacity of binary-input output symmetric (BIOS) memoryless channels in terms of bit error rate (BER). The proof technique reveals a new mechanism, different from lowering down frame error rate (FER), that the BER can be lowered down by assigning light codeword vectors to light information vectors. The finite length performance is analyzed by deriving an upper bound and a lower bound, both of which are shown to be tight in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. To improve the waterfall performance, we construct the systematic convolutional LDGM (SysConv-LDGM) codes by a random splitting process. The SysConv-LDGM codes are easily configurable in the sense that any rational code rate can be realized without complex optimization. As a universal construction, the main advantage of the SysConv-LDGM codes is their near-capacity performance in the waterfall region and predictable performance in the error-floor region that can be lowered down to any target as required by increasing the density of the uncoupled LDGM codes. Numerical results are also provided to verify our analysis.},

Cyclic codes were considered by various authors as candidates for symbol-pair codes and they established minimum distance bounds on (certain) cyclic codes.

Here b ≥ 2 is an arbitrary prescribed positive integer and \mathbb F q is an arbitrary finite field. We also present a stability theorem for an arbitrary cyclic code C of dimension k and length n: the b-symbol Hamming weight enumerator of C is the same as the k-symbol Hamming weight enumerator of C if k ≤ b ≤ n-1. Moreover, we give improved tight lower and upper bounds on b-symbol Hamming weights of some cyclic codes related to irreducible cyclic codes. Throughout the paper the length n is coprime to q.},

Motivated by current technological constraints on DNA synthesis and sequencing, this model captures three key distinctive aspects of DNA storage systems: (1) the data is written onto many short DNA molecules; (2) the molecules are corrupted by noise during synthesis and sequencing and (3) the data is read by randomly sampling from the DNA pool.

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a new family of polar codes from evaluation codes, called polar decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes, and prove that families of polar codes with multiple kernels over certain symmetric channels can be viewed as polar decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes. This offers a unified treatment for such codes over any finite field. We define decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes as evaluation codes obtained from a set of monomials closed under divisibility over a Cartesian product and determine their parameters (length, dimension, and minimum distance). We show that the dual of a decreasing monomial-Cartesian code is monomially equivalent to a decreasing monomial-Cartesian code. Polar decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes are then obtained by utilizing decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes whose sets of monomials are closed with respect to a partial order. We prove that any sequence of invertible matrices over an arbitrary field satisfying certain conditions polarizes any channel that is symmetric over the field.},

From these bounds, it is explicit that both the information leakage and error probability are controlled by the average flatness factor of the eavesdropper&#39;s lattice, which we further interpret geometrically. It is concluded that the minimization of the (average) flatness factor of the eavesdropper&#39;s lattice leads to the study of well-rounded lattices, which are shown to be among the optimal in order to achieve these minima.

  abstract     = {To facilitate load balancing, distributed systems store data redundantly. We evaluate the load balancing performance of storage schemes in which each object is stored at d different nodes, and each node stores the same number of objects. In our model, the load offered for the objects is sampled uniformly at random from all the load vectors with a fixed cumulative value. We find that the load balance in a system of n nodes improves multiplicatively with d as long as d = o(log(n)), and improves exponentially once d = Θ(log(n)). We show that the load balance improves in the same way with d when the service choices are created with XOR&#39;s of r objects rather than object replicas. In such redundancy schemes, storage overhead is reduced multiplicatively by r. However, recovery of an object requires downloading content from r nodes. At the same time, the load balance increases additively by r. We express the system&#39;s load balance in terms of the maximal spacing or maximum of d consecutive spacings between the ordered statistics of uniform random variables. Using this connection and the limit results on the maximal d-spacings, we derive our main results.},

  abstract     = {In graph theory, a tree is one of the more popular families of graphs with a wide range of applications in computer science as well as many other related fields. While there are several distance measures over the set of all trees, we consider here the one which defines the so-called tree distance, defined by the minimum number of edit operations, of removing and adding edges, in order to change one tree into another. From a coding theoretic perspective, codes over the tree distance are used for the correction of edge erasures and errors. However, studying this distance measure is important for many other applications that use trees and properties on their locality and the number of neighbor trees. Under this paradigm, the largest size of code over trees with a prescribed minimum tree distance is investigated. Upper bounds on these codes as well as code constructions are presented. A significant part of our study is dedicated to the problem of calculating the size of the ball of trees of a given radius. These balls are not regular and thus we show that while the star tree has asymptotically the smallest size of the ball, the maximum is achieved for the path tree.},

  abstract     = {Let p ≥ 2. We improve the bound ||f|| p / ||f|| 2 ≤ (p-1) s/2 for a polynomial f of degree s on the boolean cube {0,1} n , which comes from hypercontractivity, replacing the right hand side of this inequality by an explicit bivariate function of p and s, which is smaller than (p-1) s/2 for any p &gt; 2 and s &gt; 0. We show the new bound to be tight, within a smaller order factor, for the Krawchouk polynomial of degree s. This implies several nearly-extremal properties of Krawchouk polynomials and Hamming spheres (equivalently, Hamming balls). In particular, Krawchouk polynomials have (almost) the heaviest tails among all polynomials of the same degree and l 2 norm. 1 The Hamming spheres have the following approximate edge-isoperimetric property: For all 1 ≤ s ≤ n/2, and for all even distances 0 ≤ i ≤ 2s(n-s) / n, the Hamming sphere of radius s contains, up to a multiplicative factor of O(i), as many pairs of points at distance i as possible, among sets of the same size (there is a similar, but slightly weaker and somewhat more complicated claim for all distances). This also implies that Hamming spheres are (almost) stablest with respect to noise among sets of the same size. In coding theory terms this means that a Hamming sphere (equivalently a Hamming ball) has the maximal probability of undetected error, among all binary codes of the same rate. We also describe a family of hypercontractive inequalities for functions on {0,1} n , which improve on the `usual&#39; “ q → 2” inequality by taking into account the concentration of a function (expressed as the ratio between its l r norms), and which are nearly tight for characteristic functions of Hamming spheres. 1 This has to be interpreted with some care.},

In this paper, we propose a recursive construction of ZCPs based on concatenation of sequences. Inspired by Turyn&#39;s construction of Golay complementary pairs, we also propose a construction of Type-II ZCPs from known ones. The proposed constructions can generate optimal Type-II ZCPs with new flexible parameters and Z-optimal Type-II ZCPs with any odd length.

Very recently, Mesnager and Qu [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 65 (12): 7884-7895] provided a systematic study of 2-to-1 mappings over finite fields. In particular, they determined all 2-to-1 mappings of degree at most 4 over any finite field. Besides, another research direction is to consider 2-to-1 polynomials with few terms. Some results about 2-to-1 monomials and binomials have been obtained in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 65 (12): 7884-7895]. Motivated by their work, in this present paper, we push further the study of 2-to-1 mappings, particularly over finite fields with characteristic 2 (binary case being the most interesting for applications). Firstly, we completely determine 2-to-1 polynomials with degree 5 over \mathbb F 2n using the well-known Hasse-Weil bound. Besides, we consider 2-to-1 mappings with few terms, mainly trinomials and quadrinomials. Using the multivariate method and the resultant of two polynomials, we present two classes of 2-to-1 trinomials, which explain all the examples of 2-to-1 trinomials of the form x k +βx l + αx ∈ \mathbb F 2n [x] with n ≤ 7. We derive twelve classes of 2-to-1 quadrinomials with trivial coefficients over \mathbb F 2n .},

An exact duplication inserts a copy of a substring of length k of the sequence immediately after that substring, e.g., ACGT → ACGACGT, where k=3, while a noisy duplication inserts a copy suffering from substitution noise, e.g., ACGT → ACGA TGT. Specifically, we design codes that can correct any number of exact duplication and one noisy duplication errors, where in the noisy duplication case the copy is at Hamming distance 1 from the original. Our constructions rely upon recovering the duplication root of the stored codeword. We characterize the ways in which duplication errors manifest in the root of affected sequences and design efficient codes for correcting these error patterns. We show that the proposed construction is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that it has the same asymptotic rate as optimal codes correcting exact duplications only.},

In this article, we investigate codes that correct either a single indel or a single edit and provide linear-time algorithms that encode binary messages into these codes of length n. Over the quaternary alphabet, we provide two linear-time encoders. One corrects a single edit with ⌈log n⌉+ O(loglog n) redundancy bits, while the other corrects a single indel with ⌈log n⌉+2 redundant bits. These two encoders are order-optimal. The former encoder is the first known order-optimal encoder that corrects a single edit, while the latter encoder (that corrects a single indel) reduces the redundancy of the best known encoder of Tenengolts (1984) by at least four bits. Over the DNA alphabet, we impose an additional constraint: the GC-balanced constraint and require that exactly half of the symbols of any DNA codeword to be either C or G. In particular, via a modification of Knuth&#39;s balancing technique, we provide a linear-time map that translates binary messages into GC-balanced codewords and the resulting codebook is able to correct a single indel or a single edit. These are the first known constructions of GC-balanced codes that correct a single indel or a single edit.},

The ultimate goal is to develop efficient coding schemes that can tolerate a high level of noise while increasing the communication by only a constant factor (i.e., constant rate). In this work we consider synchronous communication networks over an arbitrary topology, in the powerful adversarial insertion-deletion noise model. Namely, the noisy channel may adversarially alter the content of any transmitted symbol, as well as completely remove a transmitted symbol or inject a new symbol into the channel. We provide an efficient, constant rate scheme that conducts any computation on any arbitrary network, and succeeds with high probability as long as an oblivious adversary corrupts at most \frac εm fraction of the total communication, where m is the number of links in the network and ε is a small constant. In this work (the first part), our scheme assumes that the parties share a random string to which the adversarial noise is oblivious. While previous work considered the insertion-deletion noise model in the two-party setting, to the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first multiparty scheme that is resilient to insertions and deletions. Furthermore, our scheme is the first computationally efficient scheme in the multiparty setting that is resilient to adversarial noise.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and DNA storage systems have rekindled the interest in deletion channels. Multiple recent works have looked at variants of sequence reconstruction over a single and over multiple deletion channels, a notoriously difficult problem due to its highly combinatorial nature. Although works in theoretical computer science have provided algorithms which guarantee perfect reconstruction with multiple independent observations from the deletion channel, they are only applicable in the large blocklength regime and more restrictively, when the number of observations is also large. Indeed, with only a few observations, perfect reconstruction of the input sequence may not even be possible in most cases. In such situations, maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum aposteriori (MAP) estimates for the deletion channels are natural questions that arise and these have remained open to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we take steps to answer the two aforementioned questions. Specifically: 1. We show that solving for the ML estimate over the single deletion channel (which can be cast as a discrete optimization problem) is equivalent to solving its relaxation, a continuous optimization problem; 2. We exactly compute the symbolwise posterior distributions (under some assumptions on the priors) for both the single as well as multiple deletion channels. As part of our contributions, we also introduce tools to visualize and analyze error events, which we believe could be useful in other related problems concerning deletion channels.},

While most prior work on covering codes has focused on the Hamming metric, we consider the problem of designing covering codes defined in terms of either insertions or deletions. First, we provide new sphere-covering lower bounds on the minimum possible size of such codes. Then, we provide new existential upper bounds on the size of optimal covering codes for a single insertion or a single deletion that are tight up to a constant factor. Finally, we derive improved upper bounds for covering codes using R ≥ 2 insertions or deletions. We prove that codes exist with density that is only a factor O(R logR) larger than the lower bounds for all fixed R. In particular, our upper bounds have an optimal dependence on the word length, and we achieve asymptotic density matching the best known bounds for Hamming distance covering codes.},

In this paper, we devise a coding scheme for this one-way synchronization model. The scheme is based on multiple layers of Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes combined with off-the-shelf linear error-correcting codes, and uses a list decoder. We bound the expected list size of the decoder under certain assumptions, and validate its performance via numerical simulations. We also consider an alternative decoder that uses only the constraints from the VT codes (i.e., does not require a linear code), and has a smaller redundancy at the expense of a slightly larger average list size.},

While there has been considerable theoretical work on trace reconstruction, practical solutions have only recently started to emerge in the context of two rapidly developing research areas: immunogenomics and DNA data storage. In immunogenomics, traces correspond to mutated copies of genes, with mutations generated naturally by the adaptive immune system. In DNA data storage, traces correspond to noisy copies of DNA molecules that encode digital data, with errors being artifacts of the data retrieval process. In this paper, we introduce several new trace generation models and open questions relevant to trace reconstruction for immunogenomics and DNA data storage, survey theoretical results on trace reconstruction, and highlight their connections to computational biology.

More recently, the advent of modern genomic sequencing and the volume of data it generates has resulted in a return to the problem of local alignment. We conclude with how the mathematical formulation of Levenshtein distance as a metric made possible additional optimizations to similarity search in biological contexts. These modern optimizations are built around the low metric entropy and fractional dimensionality of biological databases, enabling orders of magnitude acceleration of biological similarity search.},

Therefore, new approaches must be considered to tackle this problem. This survey gives an account of the great effort made over the past few decades to better understand the (broadly defined) capacity of synchronization channels, including both the main results and the novel techniques underlying them. Besides the usual notion of channel capacity, we also discuss the zero-error capacity of adversarial synchronization channels.},

  abstract     = {Already in the 1960s, Levenshtein and others studied error-correcting codes that protect against synchronization errors, such as symbol insertions and deletions. However, despite significant efforts, progress on designing such codes has been lagging until recently, particularly compared to the detailed understanding of error-correcting codes for symbol substitution or erasure errors. This paper surveys the recent progress in designing efficient error-correcting codes over finite alphabets that can correct a constant fraction of worst-case insertions and deletions. Most state-of-the-art results for such codes rely on synchronization strings, simple yet powerful pseudo-random objects that have proven to be very effective solutions for coping with synchronization errors in various settings. This survey also includes an overview of what is known about synchronization strings and discusses communication settings related to error-correcting codes in which synchronization strings have been applied.},

  abstract     = {There are few mathematicians whose contributions go beyond named conjectures and theorems: Vladimir Iosifovich Levenshtein ( , 1935–2017) is one such true exception. During the five decades of his active research career, he enriched combinatorics, coding, and information theory with elegant problem formulations, ingenious algorithmic solutions, and highly original proof techniques. However, his work accomplished much more—it paved the way for the creation and advancement of new scientific disciplines, such as natural language processing, metagenomics, sequence alignment, and reference-based genome assembly, as well as DNA-based data storage, to name a few. A crucial concept behind sequence alignment algorithms used in phylogeny, comparative, and cancer genomics, as well as in natural language processing is the Levenshtein (edit) distance and its extension, termed the Damerau–Levenshtein distance between strings. The Levenshtein distance equals the smallest number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to convert one string into another. Levenshtein introduced this metric in 1965 [item 1) in the Appendix], followed by the notion of deletion and insertion error-correcting codes that have since been used in a myriad of systems presented with synchronization errors [items 1) and 2) in the Appendix]. Levenshtein’s work also inspired the introduction of the trace reconstruction problem [items 3) and 4) in the Appendix] which has since sparked substantial interest in the field of DNA-based data storage.},

For both classification and regression problems, existing works have shown that, if the distribution of the feature vector has bounded support and the probability density function is bounded away from zero in its support, the convergence rate of the standard kNN method, in which k is the same for all test samples, is minimax optimal. On the contrary, if the distribution has unbounded support, we show that there is a gap between the convergence rate achieved by the standard kNN method and the minimax bound. To close this gap, we propose an adaptive kNN method, in which different k is selected for different samples. Our selection rule does not require precise knowledge of the underlying distribution of features. The proposed adaptive method significantly outperforms the standard one. We characterize the convergence rate of the proposed adaptive method, and show that it matches the minimax lower bound.},

RATQ is easy to implement and involves only a Hadamard transform computation and adaptive uniform quantization with appropriately chosen dynamic ranges. For noisy gradients with almost surely bounded Euclidean norms, we establish an information theoretic lower bound for optimization accuracy using finite precision gradients and show that RATQ almost attains this lower bound. For mean square bounded noisy gradients, we use a gain-shape quantizer which separately quantizes the Euclidean norm and uses RATQ to quantize the normalized unit norm vector. We establish lower bounds for performance of any optimization procedure and shape quantizer, when used with a uniform gain quantizer. Finally, we propose an adaptive quantizer for gain which when used with RATQ for shape quantizer outperforms uniform gain quantization and is, in fact, close to optimal. As a by-product, we show that our fixed-length quantizer RATQ has almost the same performance as the optimal variable-length quantizers for distributed mean estimation. Also, we obtain an efficient quantizer for Gaussian vectors which attains a rate very close to the Gaussian rate-distortion function and is, in fact, universal for sub Gaussian input vectors.},

The upper bound incorporates the roles of both the discriminator and the generator of GANs, and matches the minimax lower bound in terms of the sample size and the norm of the parameter matrices of neural networks under ReLU activation. On the algorithmic side, we develop a generalization error bound for the stochastic gradient method (SGM) in training GANs. Such a bound justifies the generalization ability of the GAN training via SGM after multiple passes over the data and reflects the interplay between the discriminator and the generator. Our results imply that the training of the generator requires more samples than the training of the discriminator. This is consistent with the empirical observation that the training of the discriminator typically converges faster than that of the generator. The experiments validate our theoretical results.},

The decision maker is tasked to classify a test sequence which is known to be generated according to either one of the distributions. In particular, for the binary case, the decision maker wishes to perform the classification task with minimum number of the test samples, so, at each step, she declares that either hypothesis 1 is true, hypothesis 2 is true, or she requests for an additional test sample. We propose a classifier and analyze the type-I and type-II error probabilities. We demonstrate the significant advantage of our sequential scheme compared to an existing non-sequential classifier proposed by Gutman. Finally, we extend our setup and results to the multi-class classification scenario and again demonstrate that the variable-length nature of the problem affords significant advantages as one can achieve the same set of exponents as Gutman&#39;s fixed-length setting but without having the rejection option.},

The exact solution using constraints on the order statistic means is derived. The result is an integral of a rational parametric function whose parameters depend on the order statistic constraints. This integral equation can be solved directly for a small number of order statistic means, e.g., 1, 2, or at most 3, via a multidimensional search in the parameter space. As the number of constraints increases, the search for the optimum parameters becomes formidable. To resolve this problem we have proposed an approximate solution to the resultant integral equation based on Bernstein polynomials and estimates of a desired number of quantiles from available samples. The proposed approximation approach does not require any search in the parameter space and is formulated for any number of samples from an unknown distribution. Performance of this approach is evaluated under various practical conditions by using Kullback-Leibler divergence function.},

In this paper, we study the opposite question: given a dictionary and the l 1 -norm regularizer, find the largest sparsity pattern that can be recovered. We show that such a pattern is described by a mathematical object called a “maximum abstract simplicial complex,” and provide two different characterizations of this object: one based on extreme points and the other based on vectors of minimal support. In addition, we show how this new framework is useful in the study of sparse recovery problems when the dictionary takes the form of a graph incidence matrix or a partial discrete Fourier transform. In case of incidence matrices, we show that the largest sparsity pattern that can be recovered is determined by the set of simple cycles of the graph. As a byproduct, we show that standard sparse recovery can be certified in polynomial time, although this is known to be NP-hard for general matrices. In the case of the partial discrete Fourier transform, our characterization of the largest sparsity pattern that can be recovered requires the unknown signal to be real and its dimension to be a prime number.},

Underlying these methods are new asymptotic results for the high-dimensional spiked model with heteroscedastic noise, and consistent estimators for the relevant population parameters. We extend previous analysis on out-of-sample prediction to the setting of predictors with whitening. We demonstrate certain advantages of noise whitening. Specifically, we show that in a certain asymptotic regime, optimal singular value shrinkage with whitening converges to the best linear predictor, whereas without whitening it converges to a suboptimal linear predictor. We prove that for generic signals, whitening improves estimation of the principal components, and increases a natural signal-to-noise ratio of the observations.

  abstract     = {We consider a distributed stochastic optimization problem in networks with finite number of nodes. Each node adjusts its action to optimize the global utility of the network, which is defined as the sum of local utilities of all nodes. While Gradient descent method is a common technique to solve such optimization problem, the computation of the gradient may require much information exchange. In this paper, we consider that each node can only have a noisy numerical observation of its local utility, of which the closed-form expression is not available. This assumption is quite realistic, especially when the system is either too complex or constantly changing. Nodes may exchange partially the observation of their local utilities to estimate the global utility at each timeslot. We propose a distributed algorithm based on stochastic perturbation, under the assumption that each node has only part of the local utilities of the other nodes. We use stochastic approximation tools to prove that our algorithm converges almost surely to the optimum, given that the objective function is smooth and strictly concave. The convergence rate is also derived, under the additional assumption of strongly concave objective function. It is shown that the convergence rate scales as O(K -0.5 ) after a sufficient number of iterations K &gt; K 0 , which is the optimal rate order in terms of K for our problem. Although the proposed algorithm can be applied to general optimization problems, we perform simulations for a typical power control problem in wireless networks and present numerical results to corroborate our claims.},

  abstract     = {Uplink and downlink cloud radio access networks are modeled as two-hop K-user L-relay networks, whereby small base-stations act as relays for end-to-end communications and are connected to a central processor via orthogonal fronthaul links of finite capacities. Simplified versions of network compress-forward (or noisy network coding) and distributed decode-forward are presented to establish inner bounds on the capacity region for uplink and downlink communications, that match the respective cutset bounds to within a finite gap independent of the channel gains and signal to noise ratios. These approximate capacity regions are then compared with the capacity regions for networks with no capacity limit on the fronthaul. Although it takes infinite fronthaul link capacities to achieve these “fronthaul-unlimited” capacity regions exactly, these capacity regions can be approached approximately with finite-capacity fronthaul. The total fronthaul link capacities required to approach the fronthaul-unlimited sum-rates (for uplink and downlink) are characterized. Based on these results, the capacity scaling law in the large network size limit is established under certain uplink and downlink network models, both theoretically and via simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of user activity detection and large-scale fading coefficient estimation in a random access wireless uplink with a massive MIMO base station with a large number M of antennas and a large number of wireless single-antenna devices (users). We consider a block fading channel model where the M-dimensional channel vector of each user remains constant over a coherence block containing L signal dimensions in time-frequency. In the considered setting, the number of potential users K tot is much larger than L but at each time slot only K a tot of them are active. Previous results, based on compressed sensing, require that K a ≤ L, which is a bottleneck in massive deployment scenarios. In this work, we show that such limitation can be overcome when the number of base station antennas M is sufficiently large. More specifically, we prove that with a coherence block of dimension L and a number of antennas M such that K a /M = o(1), one can identify K a = O(L 2 /log 2 (K tot / K a )) active users, which is much larger than the previously known bounds. We also provide two algorithms. One is based on Non-Negative Least-Squares, for which the above scaling result can be rigorously proved. The other consists of a low-complexity iterative componentwise minimization of the likelihood function of the underlying problem. While for this algorithm a rigorous proof cannot be given, we analyze a constrained version of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) problem (a combinatorial optimization with exponential complexity) and find the same fundamental scaling law for the number of identifiable users. Therefore, we conjecture that the low-complexity (approximated) ML algorithm also achieves the same scaling law and we demonstrate its performance by simulation. We also compare the discussed methods with the (Bayesian) MMV-AMP algorithm, recently proposed for the same setting, and show superior performance and better numerical stability. Finally, we use the discussed approximated ML algorithm as the inner decoder in a concatenated coding scheme for unsourced random access, a grant-free uncoordinated multiple access scheme where all users make use of the same codebook, and the receiver must produce the list of transmitted messages, irrespectively of the identity of the transmitters. We show that reliable communication is possible at any E b /N 0 provided that a sufficiently large number of base station antennas is used, and that a sum spectral efficiency in the order of O (Llog(L)) is achievable.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of estimating a latent signal from a lossy compressed version of the data when the compressor is agnostic to the relation between the signal and the data. This situation arises in a host of modern applications when data is transmitted or stored prior to determining the downstream inference task. Given a bitrate constraint and a distortion measure between the data and its compressed version, let us consider the joint distribution achieving Shannon&#39;s rate-distortion (RD) function. Given an estimator and a loss function associated with the downstream inference task, define the RD risk as the expected loss under the RD-achieving distribution. We provide general conditions under which the operational risk in estimating from the compressed data is asymptotically equivalent to the RD risk. The main theoretical tools to prove this equivalence are transportation-cost inequalities in conjunction with properties of compression codes achieving Shannon&#39;s RD function. Whenever such equivalence holds, a recipe for designing estimators from datasets undergoing lossy compression without specifying the actual compression technique emerges: design the estimator to minimize the RD risk. Our conditions are simplified in the special cases of discrete memoryless or multivariate normal data. For these scenarios, we derive explicit expressions for the RD risk of several estimators and compare them to the optimal source coding performance associated with full knowledge of the relation between the latent signal and the data.},

  abstract     = {Capacities of quantum channels and decoherence times both quantify the extent to which quantum information can withstand degradation by interactions with its environment. However, calculating capacities directly is known to be intractable in general. Much recent work has focused on upper bounding certain capacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from operator theory. In the meantime, there has also been substantial recent progress on estimating decoherence times with techniques from analysis and geometry, even though many hard questions remain open. In this article, we introduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called transferred channels, which are built through representation theory from a classical Markov kernel defined on a compact group. In particular, we study two subclasses of such kernels: Hörmander systems on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on finite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing channel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on d qubits. Some of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels that randomly swap subsystems. We then extend tools developed in earlier work by Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of the classical Markov kernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different non-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article is the application of this transference principle to the estimation of decoherence time, of private and quantum capacities, of entanglement-assisted classical capacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking times, defined as the first time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking. Moreover, our estimates hold for non-ergodic channels such as the collective decoherence channels, an important scenario that has been overlooked so far because of a lack of techniques.},

The inputs to the synthesized bad channels are frozen by preshared EPR pairs between the sender and the receiver, so our scheme is entanglement assisted. We further show that quantum polarization can be achieved by choosing the channel combining Clifford operator randomly, from a much smaller subset of only nine two-qubit Clifford gates. Subsequently, we show that a Pauli channel polarizes if and only if a specific classical channel over a four-symbol input set polarizes. We exploit this equivalence to prove fast polarization for Pauli channels, and to devise an efficient successive cancellation based decoding algorithm for such channels. Finally, we present a code construction based on chaining several quantum polar codes, which is shown to require a rate of preshared entanglement that vanishes asymptotically.},

  abstract     = {The goal of coded distributed computation is to efficiently distribute a computation task, such as matrix multiplication, N-linear computation, or multivariate polynomial evaluation, across S servers through a coding scheme, such that the response from any R servers ( R is called the recovery threshold) is sufficient for the user to recover the desired computed value. Current state-of-art approaches are based on either exclusively matrix-partitioning (Entangled Polynomial (EP) Codes for matrix multiplication), or exclusively batch processing (Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC) for N-linear computations or multivariate polynomial evaluations). We present three related classes of codes, based on the idea of Cross-Subspace Alignment (CSA) which was introduced originally in the context of secure and private information retrieval. CSA codes are characterized by a Cauchy-Vandermonde matrix structure that facilitates interference alignment along Vandermonde terms, while the desired computations remain resolvable along the Cauchy terms. These codes are shown to unify, generalize and improve upon the state-of-art codes for distributed computing. First we introduce CSA codes for matrix multiplication, which yield LCC codes as a special case, and are shown to outperform LCC codes in general in download-limited settings. While matrix-partitioning approaches (EP codes) for distributed matrix multiplication have the advantage of flexible server computation latency, batch processing approaches (CSA, LCC) have significant advantages in communication costs as well as encoding and decoding complexity per matrix multiplication. In order to combine the benefits of these approaches, we introduce Generalized CSA (GCSA) codes for matrix multiplication that bridge the extremes of matrix-partitioning and batch processing approaches and demonstrate synergistic gains due to cross subspace alignment. Finally, we introduce N-CSA codes for N-linear distributed batch computations and multivariate batch polynomial evaluations. N-CSA codes include LCC codes as a special case, and are in general capable of outperforming LCC codes in download-constrained settings by upto a factor of N. Generalizations of N-CSA codes to include X-secure data and B-byzantine servers are also provided.},

Reed-Solomon codes have gained a lot of interest due to its encoding simplicity, well structuredness and list-decoding capability in the classical setting. This interest also translates to the insdel metric setting, as the Guruswami-Sudan decoding algorithm can be utilized to provide a deletion correcting algorithm in the insdel metric. Nevertheless, there have been few studies on the insdel error-correcting capability of Reed-Solomon codes. Our main contributions in this article are explicit constructions of two families of 2-dimensional Reed-Solomon codes with insdel error-correcting capabilities asymptotically reaching those provided by the Singleton bound. The first construction gives a family of Reed-Solomon codes with insdel error-correcting capability asymptotic to its length. The second construction provides a family of Reed-Solomon codes with an exact insdel error-correcting capability up to its length. Both our constructions improve the previously known construction of 2-dimensional Reed-Solomon codes whose insdel error-correcting capability is only logarithmic on the code length.},

Toward that, we propose constructions of SC-LDPCL codes that allow controlling the trade-off between local and global correction performance. In addition to local and global decoding, the paper develops a density-evolution analysis for a decoding mode we call semi-global decoding, in which the decoder has access to the requested sub-block plus a prescribed number of sub-blocks around it.

We propose two novel random coding schemes and a polar coding scheme for this noisy strong coordination problem, and derive inner and outer bounds for the respective strong coordination capacity region. The first scheme is a joint coordination-channel encoding scheme that utilizes the randomness provided by the communication channel to reduce the amount of local randomness required to generate the sequence of actions at Node Y. Based on this random coding scheme, we provide a characterization of the capacity region for a special case of the noisy strong coordination setup, namely, when the DMC is a deterministic channel. The second scheme exploits separate coordination and channel encoding where local randomness is extracted from the channel after decoding. Moreover, by leveraging the random coding results for this problem, we present an example in which the proposed joint encoding scheme is able to strictly outperform the separate encoding scheme in terms of achievable communication rate for the same amount of injected randomness into both systems. Thus, we establish the sub-optimality of the separation of strong coordination and channel encoding with respect to the communication rate over the DMC in this problem. Finally, the third scheme is a joint coordination-channel polar coding scheme for strong coordination. We show that polar codes are able to achieve the established inner bound to the strong noisy coordination capacity region and thus provide a constructive alternative to a random coding proof. Our polar coding scheme also offers a constructive solution to a channel simulation problem where a DMC and shared randomness are employed together to simulate another DMC.},

  abstract     = {Achievable error exponents for the one-way with noisy feedback and two-way AWGN channels are derived for the transmission of a finite number of messages M under almost sure (AS) and expected block (EXP) transmit power constraints. In the one-way setting under noisy AWGN feedback, under an AS power constraint, known linear and non-linear passive schemes are modified to incorporate AS constraints in the feedback link as well. In addition, a new active feedback scheme is presented in which the receiver feeds back the most likely pair of codewords, and the transmitter re-transmits which of these two was originally sent. This active feedback scheme outperforms one of the passive feedback schemes for all channel parameters; the linear scheme outperforms the others for low feedback noise variance. Under the EXP constraint, a known achievable error exponent for the transmission of two messages is generalized to any arbitrary but finite number of messages M through the use of simplex codes and erasure decoding. In the two-way AWGN setting, each user has its own message to send in addition to (possibly) aiding in the transmission of feedback for the opposite direction. Two-way error exponent regions are defined and achievable error exponent regions are derived for the first time under both AS and EXP power constraints. For the presented achievability schemes, feedback or interaction leads to error exponent gains in one direction, possibly at the expense of a decrease in the error exponents attained in the other direction. The relationship between M and n supported by our achievable strategies is explored.},

The finite-blocklength fundamental limits of the best achievable performance are defined, in two different versions of the problem: Reference-based compression, when a single side information string is used repeatedly in compressing different source messages, and pair-based compression, where a different side information string is used for each source message. General achievability and converse theorems are established for arbitrary source-side information pairs. Nonasymptotic normal approximation expansions are proved for the optimal rate in both the reference-based and pair-based settings, for memoryless sources. These are stated in terms of explicit, finite-blocklength bounds, that are tight up to third-order terms. Extensions that go significantly beyond the class of memoryless sources are obtained. The relevant source dispersion is identified and its relationship with the conditional varentropy rate is established. Interestingly, the dispersion is different in reference-based and pair-based compression, and it is proved that the reference-based dispersion is in general smaller.},

In our setting, the encoding and decoding are asynchronous, i.e., there is a certain relative delay between the two sources. Neither the source parameters nor the relative delay are known to the encoders and the decoder. Since we assume that both encoders implement standard random binning, which does not require such knowledge anyway, the focus of this work is on the decoder. Our main contribution is in proposing a universal decoder, that independent of the unknown source parameters and the relative delay, and at the same time, is asymptotically as good as the optimal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder in the sense of the random coding error exponent achieved. Consequently, the achievable rate region is also the same as if the source parameters and the delay were known to the decoder.},

Concretely, we consider Kolmogorov-optimal approximation through deep neural networks with the guiding theme being a relation between the complexity of the function (class) to be approximated and the complexity of the approximating network in terms of connectivity and memory requirements for storing the network topology and the associated quantized weights. The theory we develop establishes that deep networks are Kolmogorov-optimal approximants for markedly different function classes, such as unit balls in Besov spaces and modulation spaces. In addition, deep networks provide exponential approximation accuracy-i.e., the approximation error decays exponentially in the number of nonzero weights in the network-of the multiplication operation, polynomials, sinusoidal functions, and certain smooth functions. Moreover, this holds true even for one-dimensional oscillatory textures and the Weierstrass function-a fractal function, neither of which has previously known methods achieving exponential approximation accuracy. We also show that in the approximation of sufficiently smooth functions finite-width deep networks require strictly smaller connectivity than finite-depth wide networks.},

A novel Bayesian theory is developed for detecting a change in the distribution of an i.p.i.d. process. It is shown that the Bayesian change point problem can be expressed as an optimal control problem of a Markov decision process (MDP) with periodic transition and cost structures. An optimal control theory is developed for periodic MDPs for discounted and undiscounted total cost criteria. A fixed-point equation is obtained that is satisfied by the optimal cost function. It is shown that a nonstationary but periodic policy is optimal. A value iteration algorithm is obtained to compute the optimal cost function. The results from the MDP theory are then applied to detect a change in the distribution of an i.p.i.d. process. It is shown that while a stopping rule based on a periodic sequence of thresholds is exactly optimal, a single-threshold policy is asymptotically optimal, as the probability of false alarm goes to zero. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the asymptotically optimal policy is not strictly optimal.},

We provide a time-varying achievable strategy to stabilize the system in a second-moment sense with fixed, finite R. While our previous result provided a strategy to stabilize this system using a variable-rate code, this work provides an achievable strategy using a fixed-rate code. The strategy we employ to achieve this is time-varying and takes different actions depending on the value of the state. It proceeds in two modes: a normal mode (or zoom-in), where the realization of A n is typical, and an emergency mode (or zoom-out), where the realization of A n is exceptionally large. To analyze the performance of the scheme we construct an auxiliary sequence that bounds the state X n , and then bound auxiliary sequence in both the zoom-in and zoom-out modes.},

  abstract     = {A central issue of many statistical learning problems is to select an appropriate model from a set of candidate models. Large models tend to inflate the variance (or overfitting), while small models tend to cause biases (or underfitting) for a given fixed dataset. In this work, we address the critical challenge of model selection to strike a balance between model fitting and model complexity, thus gaining reliable predictive power. We consider the task of approaching the theoretical limit of statistical learning, meaning that the selected model has the predictive performance that is as good as the best possible model given a class of potentially misspecified candidate models. We propose a generalized notion of Takeuchi&#39;s information criterion and prove that the proposed method can asymptotically achieve the optimal out-sample prediction loss under reasonable assumptions. It is the first proof of the asymptotic property of Takeuchi&#39;s information criterion to our best knowledge. Our proof applies to a wide variety of nonlinear models, loss functions, and high dimensionality (in the sense that the models&#39; complexity can grow with sample size). The proposed method can be used as a computationally efficient surrogate for leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, for modeling streaming data, we propose an online algorithm that sequentially expands the model complexity to enhance selection stability and reduce computation cost. Experimental studies show that the proposed method has desirable predictive power and significantly less computational cost than some popular methods.},

  abstract     = {The bandwidth of a bandlimited signal is an important number that is relevant in many applications and concepts. For example, according to the Shannon sampling theorem, the bandwidth determines the minimum sampling rate that is required for a perfect reconstruction. In this paper we consider bandlimited signals with finite energy and bandlimited signals that are absolutely integrable and analyze whether the bandwidth of these signals can be determined algorithmically. We employ the concept of Turing computability, a theoretical model that describes the fundamental limits of what can be solved algorithmically on a digital hardware, and ask if, for a given computable bandlimited signal, it is possible to compute its bandwidth on a Turing machine. We show that this is not possible in general, because there exist computable bandlimited signals for which the bandwidth is a non-computable real number. Even the weaker question if the bandwidth of a given signal is smaller than a predefined value cannot be always answered algorithmically. Further, we prove that in the case where the bandwidth in not computable, it is even impossible to algorithmically determine a sequence of upper bounds that converges to the actual bandwidth of the signal. As a positive result, we show that the set of signals whose bandwidth is larger than some given value is semi-decidable.},

We apply the new estimation bound to find the dispersion for lossy compression of nonstationary Gauss-Markov sources. We show that the dispersion is given by the same integral formula that we derived previously for the asymptotically stationary Gauss-Markov sources, i.e., |a|&lt;;1. New ideas in the nonstationary case include separately bounding the maximum eigenvalue (which scales exponentially) and the other eigenvalues (which are bounded by constants that depend only on a) of the covariance matrix of the source sequence, and new techniques in the derivation of our estimation error bound.},

  abstract     = {We study “active” decision making over sensor networks where the sensors&#39; sequential probing actions are actively chosen by continuously learning from past observations. We consider two network settings: with and without central coordination. In the first case, the network nodes interact with each other through a central entity, which plays the role of a fusion center. In the second case, the network nodes interact in a fully distributed fashion. In both of these scenarios, we propose sequential and adaptive hypothesis tests extending the classic Chernoff test. We compare the performance of the proposed tests to the optimal sequential test. In the presence of a fusion center, our test achieves the same asymptotic optimality of the Chernoff test, minimizing the risk, expressed by the expected cost required to reach a decision plus the expected cost of making a wrong decision, when the observation cost per unit time tends to zero. The test is also asymptotically optimal in the higher moments of the time required to reach a decision. Additionally, the test is parsimonious in terms of communications, and the expected number of channel uses per network node tends to a small constant. In the distributed setup, our test achieves the same asymptotic optimality of Chernoff&#39;s test, up to a multiplicative constant in terms of both risk and the higher moments of the decision time. Additionally, the test is parsimonious in terms of communications in comparison to state-of-the-art schemes proposed in the literature. The analysis of these tests is also extended to account for message quantization and communication over channels with random erasures.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a secure multi-party computation problem (MPC), where the goal is to offload the computation of an arbitrary polynomial function of some massive private matrices (inputs) to a cluster of workers. The workers are not reliable. Some of them may collude to gain information about the input data (semi-honest workers). The system is initialized by sharing a (randomized) function of each input matrix to each server. Since the input matrices are massive, each share&#39;s size is assumed to be at most 1/k fraction of the input matrix, for some k ∈ \mathbb N. The objective is to minimize the number of workers needed to perform the computation task correctly, such that even if an arbitrary subset of t-1 workers, for some t ∈ \mathbb N, collude, they cannot gain any information about the input matrices. We propose a sharing scheme, called polynomial sharing, and show that it admits basic operations such as adding and multiplication of matrices and transposing a matrix. By concatenating the procedures for basic operations, we show that any polynomial function of the input matrices can be calculated, subject to the problem constraints. We show that the proposed scheme can offer order-wise gain in terms of the number of workers needed, compared to the approaches formed by the concatenation of job splitting and conventional MPC approaches.},

  abstract     = {Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) in 2014 showed that coded caching in single bottleneck-link broadcast networks allows serving an arbitrarily large number of cache-equipped users with a total link load (bits per unit time) that does not scale with the number of users. Since then, the general topic of coded caching has generated enormous interest both from the information theoretic and (network) coding theoretic viewpoint, and from the viewpoint of applications. Building on the MAN work, this paper considers a particular network topology referred to as cache-aided Fog Radio Access Network (Fog-RAN), that includes a Macro-cell Base Station (MBS) co-located with the content server, several cache-equipped Small-cell Base Stations (SBSs), and many users without caches. Some users are served directly by the MBS broadcast downlink, while other users are served by the SBSs. The SBSs can also exchange data via rounds of direct communication via a side channel, referred to as “sidelink”. For this novel Fog-RAN model, the fundamental tradeoff among (a) the amount of cache memory at the SBSs, (b) the load on the downlink (from MBS to directly served users and SBSs), and (c) the aggregate load on the sidelink is studied, under the standard worst-case demand scenario. We propose a converse bound whose key novelty is to jointly bound the downlink load an the sidelink load. For the achievability, by leveraging the network topology, we propose two classes of memory-loads point, where the SBS sidelink load is minimum and the MBS downlink load is minimum, respectively. By memory-sharing between these two classes of memory-loads points, some exact or order optimality results are obtained. Several existing models (e.g., Device-to-Device coded caching, single bottleneck-link coded caching with shared caches, single bottleneck-link caching coded caching with cache-less users) are recovered as special cases of this network model and by-product results of independent interest are given. Finally, the role of topology-aware versus topology-agnostic caching is discussed.},

The result is supported by a new converse and a new scheme. In the proposed scheme, the helper sends a cooperative jamming signal at a specific power level and direction. In this way, it minimizes the penalty in GDoF incurred by the secrecy constraint. In the secure rate analysis, the techniques of noise removal and signal separation are used.},

  abstract     = {In communication networks secrecy constraints usually incur an extra limit in capacity or generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF), in the sense that a penalty in capacity or GDoF is incurred due to the secrecy constraints. Over the past decades a significant amount of effort has been made by the researchers to understand the limits of secrecy constraints in communication networks. In this work, we focus on how to remove the secrecy penalty in communication networks, i.e., how to remove the GDoF penalty due to secrecy constraints. We begin with three basic settings: a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference channel with confidential messages, a symmetric Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper, and a two-user symmetric Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel. Interestingly, in this work we show that adding common randomness at the transmitters can totally remove the penalty in GDoF or GDoF region of the three settings considered here. The results reveal that adding common randomness at the transmitters is a powerful way to remove the secrecy penalty in communication networks in terms of GDoF performance. Common randomness can be generated offline before the real-time message communication. The role of the common randomness is to jam the information signal at the eavesdroppers, without causing too much interference at the legitimate receivers. To accomplish this role, a new method of Markov chain-based interference neutralization is proposed in the achievability schemes utilizing common randomness. From the practical point of view, we need to minimize the amount of common randomness used for removing the secrecy penalty in terms of GDoF performance. With this motivation, for most of the cases we characterize the minimal GDoF of common randomness to remove secrecy penalty, based on our derived converses and achievability.},

We develop a novel technique to employ this result to find both finite blocklength and exponential strong converse bounds for the tasks of quantum source coding with compressed classical side information, and distributed quantum hypothesis testing with communication constraints for a classical-quantum state. In the classical setting, these two problems can be reformulated in a unified framework in terms of the so-called image-size characterization problem, which we extend to the classical-quantum setting. We also use this technique to establish analogous strong converse bounds in broadcast communication scenarios. In particular, we consider the transmission of classical information through a degraded broadcast channel, whose outputs are two quantum systems, with the state of one being a degraded version of the other. In establishing this last result, we prove a second-order Fano-type inequality, which is of independent interest. Our method to study strong converses has potential applications in other important tasks of quantum network information theory.},

In this paper, we show that the limits of time-invariant SC-LDPC codes can be overcome by transforming them into time-varying SC-LDPC codes with very small period. In particular, we show that periodically time-varying SC-LDPC codes with small period may exhibit significantly better girth properties than the corresponding time-invariant codes by exploiting a larger number of degrees of freedom in the code design, which however scale at most linearly with the product of the code period and the size of the considered base matrix.},

The localized deletions model is a generalization of the bursty model, in which all the deleted bits are consecutive. In this paper, we construct new explicit codes for the localized model, based on the family of Guess &amp; Check codes which was previously introduced by the authors. The codes that we construct can correct, with high probability, δ ≤ w deletions that are localized in a single window of size w, where w grows with the block length.

  abstract     = {To achieve various tradeoffs between storage and repair bandwidth, this article proposes to construct exact repair codes by grafting two codes C 1 and C 2 . By replacing certain nonzero entries in the generator matrix of C 1 by zero, the repair bandwidth of the resulting grafting part decreases. However, it may no longer keep the maximum-distance-separable (MDS) property. As a result, the grafted code C 2 takes these nonzero entries into account such that the entire graftage code can keep the MDS property. The relationship between the bandwidth reduction of C 1 and the file size of C 2 is derived to optimize graftage codes. Our analysis indicates that these graftage codes may provide better tradeoffs than space-sharing.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial technique for integrated circuits (IC) test response compaction, X-compact employs a special kind of codes called X-codes for reliable compressions of the test response in the presence of unknown logic values (Xs). From a combinatorial view point, Fujiwara and Colbourn introduced an equivalent definition of X-codes and studied X-codes of small weights that have good detectability and X-tolerance. An ( m , n , d , x ) X-code is an m× n binary matrix with column vectors as its codewords. The parameters d , x correspond to the test quality of the code. In this paper, bounds and constructions for constant weighted X-codes are investigated. First, we obtain a general result on the maximum number of codewords n for an ( m , n , d , x ) X-code of weight w, and we further improve this lower bound for the case with x=2 and w=3 through the probabilistic method. Then, using tools from additive combinatorics and finite fields, we present some explicit constructions for constant weighted X-codes with d=3,7 and x=2, which are optimal for the case when d=3, w=4 and nearly optimal for the case when d=3, w=3. We also consider a special class of X-codes introduced by Fujiwara and Colbourn and improve the best known lower bound on the maximum number of codewords for this kind of X-codes.},

To build MDS codes with small sub-packetization level, existing constructions and theoretical bounds imply that one may sacrifice the optimality of the repair bandwidth. Partly motivated by the work of Tamo et al. (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 59(3), 1597-1616, 2013), in this paper, we present a transformation that can greatly reduce the sub-packetization level of MDS codes with the optimal repair bandwidth with respect to the same code length n. As applications of the transformation, four high-rate MDS codes having both small sub-packetization level and near-optimal repair bandwidth can be obtained, where three of them are explicit and the required field sizes are around or even smaller than the code length n. Additionally, we propose another explicit MDS code which has a similar structure as that of the first resultant code obtained by the generic transformation, but can be built on a smaller finite field.},

  abstract     = {Entropy and relative or cross entropy measures are two very fundamental concepts in information theory and are also widely used for statistical inference across disciplines. The related optimization problems, in particular the maximization of the entropy and the minimization of the cross entropy or relative entropy (divergence), are essential for general logical inference in our physical world. In this paper, we discuss a two parameter generalization of the popular Rényi entropy and associated optimization problems. We derive the desired entropic characteristics of the new generalized entropy measure including its positivity, expandability, extensivity and generalized (sub-)additivity. More importantly, when considered over the class of sub-probabilities, our new family turns out to be scale-invariant; this property does not hold for most existing generalized entropy measures. We also propose the corresponding cross entropy and relative entropy measures and discuss their geometric properties including generalized Pythagorean results over β-convex sets. The maximization of the new entropy and the minimization of the corresponding cross or relative entropy measures are carried out explicitly under the non-extensive (`third-choice&#39;) constraints given by the Tsallis&#39; normalized q-expectations which also correspond to the β-linear family of probability distributions. Important properties of the associated forward and reverse projection rules are discussed along with their existence and uniqueness. In this context, we have come up with, for the first time, a class of entropy measures - a subfamily of our two-parameter generalization - that leads to the classical (extensive) exponential family of MaxEnt distributions under the non-extensive constraints; this discovery has been illustrated through the useful concept of escort distributions and can potentially be important for future research in information theory. Other members of the new entropy family, however, lead to the power-law type generalized q-exponential MaxEnt distributions which is in conformity with Tsallis&#39; nonextensive theory. Therefore, our new family indeed provides a wide range of entropy and associated measures combining both the extensive and nonextensive MaxEnt theories under one umbrella.},

  abstract     = {Consider a random access communication scenario over a channel whose operation is defined for any number of possible transmitters. As in the model recently introduced by Polyanskiy for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a fixed, known number of transmitters, the channel is assumed to be invariant to permutations on its inputs, and all active transmitters employ identical encoders. Unlike the Polyanskiy model, in the proposed scenario, neither the transmitters nor the receiver knows which transmitters are active. We refer to this agnostic communication setup as the Random Access Channel (RAC). Scheduled feedback of a finite number of bits is used to synchronize the transmitters. The decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number of active transmitters, k, and their messages but not which transmitter sent which message. The decoding procedure occurs at a time n t depending on the decoder&#39;s estimate, t, of the number of active transmitters, k, thereby achieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters. Single-bit feedback at each time n i , i ≤ t, enables all transmitters to determine the end of one coding epoch and the start of the next. The central result of this work demonstrates the achievability on a RAC of performance that is first-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch. While prior multiple access schemes for a fixed number of transmitters require 2 k - 1 simultaneous threshold rules, the proposed scheme uses a single threshold rule and achieves the same dispersion.},

These include random linear and generalized estimation, sparse superposition codes, and low-rank matrix / tensor estimation. For all these systems, the adaptive interpolation method directly proves that the replica-symmetric prediction is exact, in a simple and unified manner. When the underlying factor graph of the inference problem is sparse the replica prediction is considerably more complicated, and rigorous results are often lacking or obtained by rather complicated methods. In this work we show how to extend the adaptive path interpolation method to sparse systems. We concentrate on a censored block model, where hidden variables are measured through a binary erasure channel, for which we fully prove the replica prediction.},

The exponential decay rate or error exponent of the type-II error probability is used as the asymptotic performance metric, and an optimal test achieves the maximum rate subject to a constant level constraint on the type-I error probability. With Sanov&#39;s theorem, we derive a sufficient condition for one-sample tests to achieve the optimal error exponent in the universal setting, i.e., for any distribution defining the alternative hypothesis. We then show that two classes of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) based tests attain the optimal type-II error exponent on \mathbb R d , while the quadratic-time Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD) based tests achieve this optimality with an asymptotic level constraint. For general two-sample testing, however, Sanov&#39;s theorem is insufficient to obtain a similar sufficient condition. We proceed to establish an extended version of Sanov&#39;s theorem and derive an exact error exponent for the quadratic-time MMD based two-sample tests. The obtained error exponent is further shown to be optimal among all two-sample tests satisfying a given level constraint. Our work hence provides an achievability result for optimal nonparametric one- and two-sample testing in the universal setting.

Inspired by the relationship between the 20 questions problem and the channel coding problem, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on the minimal achievable resolution to estimate the target location. Furthermore, applying the Berry-Esseen theorem to our non-asymptotic bounds, we obtain a second-order asymptotic approximation to the achievable resolution of optimal non-adaptive query procedures with a finite number of queries subject to the excess-resolution probability constraint. We specialize our second-order results to measurement-dependent versions of several channel models including the binary symmetric, the binary erasure and the binary Z- channels. As a complement, we establish a second-order asymptotic achievability bound for adaptive querying and use this to bound the benefit of adaptive querying.},

This paper studies the sum-rate of the Han-Kobayashi scheme with Gaussian inputs and fully characterizes the maximum achievable sum-rate, when no time sharing is used. The optimal power-splitting variables and the corresponding maximum achievable sum-rate are explicitly expressed in closed forms. With the same approach, the maximum weighted sum-rate is expressed that characterizes the boundary of the Han-Kobayashi region without time sharing.

We also can handle infinite hypothesis classes H by relaxing to (ε, δ)-differential privacy. We apply our hypothesis selection algorithm to give learning algorithms for a number of natural distribution classes, including Gaussians, product distributions, sums of independent random variables, piecewise polynomials, and mixture classes. Our hypothesis selection procedure allows us to generically convert a cover for a class to a learning algorithm, complementing known learning lower bounds which are in terms of the size of the packing number of the class. As the covering and packing numbers are often closely related, for constant α, our algorithms achieve the optimal sample complexity for many classes of interest.

Specifically, we develop a mathematical framework to characterize the learning errors between the maximal correlation functions computed from the true distribution, and the functions estimated from the ACE algorithm. For both supervised and semi-supervised learning scenarios, we establish the analytical expressions for the error exponents of the learning errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for large datasets, the upper bounds for the sample complexity of learning the HGR maximal correlation functions by the ACE algorithm can be expressed using the established error exponents. Moreover, with our theoretical results, we investigate the sampling strategy for different types of samples in semi-supervised learning with a total sampling budget constraint, and an optimal sampling strategy is developed to maximize the error exponent of the learning error.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of recovering low-rank matrices from random rank-one measurements, which spans numerous applications including covariance sketching, phase retrieval, quantum state tomography, and learning shallow polynomial neural networks, among others. Our approach is to directly estimate the low-rank factor by minimizing a nonconvex least-squares loss function via vanilla gradient descent, following a tailored spectral initialization. When the true rank is bounded by a constant, this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth (up to global ambiguity) with near-optimal sample complexity and computational complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first guarantee that achieves near-optimality in both metrics. In particular, the key enabler of near-optimal computational guarantees is an implicit regularization phenomenon: without explicit regularization, both spectral initialization and the gradient descent iterates automatically stay within a region incoherent with the measurement vectors. This feature allows one to employ much more aggressive step sizes compared with the ones suggested in prior literature, without the need of sample splitting.},

The main contribution is a robust phase retrieval counterpart to the seminal paper by Candes and Tao on compressed sensing (ℓ 1 regression) [Decoding by linear programming. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 51(12):4203-4215, 2005]. The analysis depends on a key new property of the coding matrix called the Absolute Range Property (ARP) which is the analogue to the Null Space Property (NSP) in compressed sensing. When the residuals are computed using squared magnitudes, we show that ARP follows from a standard Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). However, when the residuals are computed using absolute magnitudes, a different kind of RIP or growth property is required. We conclude by showing that the robust phase retrieval objectives are sharp with respect to their minimizers with high probability.},

The unknown parameters in the pre-attack and post-attack models, namely the desired parameter to be estimated and the injected malicious data at the attacked sensors pose a significant challenge for designing a computationally efficient scheme for each sensor to detect the occurrence of attacks by only using local communication with neighboring sensors. The generalized Cumulative Sum (GCUSUM) algorithm is considered, which replaces the unknown parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates in the CUSUM test statistic. For the problem under consideration, a sufficient condition is provided under which the expected false alarm period of the GCUSUM can be guaranteed to be larger than any given value. Next, we consider the distributed implementation of the GCUSUM. We first propose an alternative test statistic which is asymptotically equivalent to that of GCUSUM. Then based on the proposed alternative test statistic and running consensus algorithms, we propose a distributed approximate GCUSUM algorithm which significantly reduce the prohibitively high computational complexity of the centralized GCUSUM. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed approximate GCUSUM algorithm can provide a performance that is comparable to the centralized GCUSUM.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the sequential detection of false data injection attacks (FDIAs) in a dynamic smart grid, we consider a more general problem of sequentially detecting a time-varying change in a dynamic linear regression model. To be specific, when the change occurs, a time-varying unknown vector is added in the linear regression model. The parameter vector of the linear regression model is also assumed to be unknown and time-varying. Thus, the pre- and post-change distributions are both unknown and time-varying. This imposes a significant challenge for designing a computationally efficient sequential detector. We first propose two Cumulative-Sum-type algorithms to address this challenge. One is called generalized Cumulative-Sum (GCUSUM) algorithm, and the other one is called relaxed generalized Cumulative-Sum (RGCUSUM) algorithm, which is a modified version of the GCUSUM. It can be shown that the computational complexity of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm scales linearly with the number of observations. Next, considering Lordon&#39;s setup, for any given constraint on the expected false alarm period, a lower bound on the threshold employed in the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm is derived, which provides a useful guideline for the design of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm to achieve any prescribed performance requirement in practice. In addition, for any given threshold employed in the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm, an upper bound on the expected detection delay is also provided. The performance of the proposed RGCUSUM algorithm is numerically studied in the context of an IEEE standard power system under FDIAs. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RGCUSUM in computational efficiency.},

For each channel, an attempted transmission is successful with an unknown probability. The transmitter&#39;s objective is to quickly identify the best channel to minimize the number of packets in the queue over T time slots. To analyze system performance, we introduce queue length regret, which is the expected difference between the total queue length of a learning policy and a controller that knows the rates, a priori. One approach to designing a transmission policy would be to apply algorithms from the literature that solve the closely-related stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. These policies would focus on maximizing the number of successful frame transmissions over time. However, we show that these methods have Ω(log T) queue length regret. On the other hand, we show that there exists a set of queue-length based policies that can obtain order optimal O(1) queue length regret.

In order to prove this result, we consider two special cases of the m server system, namely, a single server system with last come first served with preemptive service and an infinite server system. In both these cases, we derive sufficient conditions to show that three heavy tailed service time distributions, namely Pareto, log-normal, and Weibull, asymptotically minimize the average AoI as their tail gets heavier, and establish the age-delay tradeoff results.

  abstract     = {Coded caching systems have been widely studied to reduce the data transmission during the peak traffic time. In practice, two important parameters of a coded caching system should be considered, i.e., the transmission rate which is the maximum amount of the data transmission during the peak traffic time, and the subpacketization level, the number of divided packets of each file when we implement a coded caching scheme. Although there exists a tradeoff between transmission rate and subpacketization, we prefer to design a scheme with transmission rate and subpacketization as small as possible since they reflect the transmission efficiency and complexity of the caching scheme, respectively. In this paper, we first characterize a coded caching scheme from the viewpoint of linear algebra and show that designing a linear coded caching scheme is equivalent to constructing three classes of matrices satisfying some rank conditions. Then based on the invariant subspaces in linear algebra and combinatorial design theory, a new class of coded caching schemes over F 2 is obtained by constructing these three classes of matrices. It turns out that the transmission rate of our new scheme is the same as the scheme construct by Yan et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63, 5821-5833, 2017), but the subpacketization is significantly reduced. Finally by means of these matrices, we show that the minimum storage regenerating codes can also be used to construct coded caching schemes.},

First, the strong interference class is examined, and it is proved that if transmitters&#39; powers satisfy certain conditions, successive decoding is optimal and achieves the sum-capacity. The number of the required splits, the amount of power allocated to each split, and the order of decoding at receivers are explicitly determined. Second, the weak interference class is examined. A novel rate-splitting scheme is proposed that does not use joint decoding. The number of required splits and the amount of power allocated to each split are expressed in closed forms. It is shown that, for a wide range of transmitters&#39; powers, this scheme achieves the sum-rate of the Gaussian Han-Kobayashi scheme.

In [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 41(1):26-34, 1995], Csiszár has shown that for classical discrete memoryless channels there is a distinguished such quantity that has an operational interpretation as a generalized cutoff rate for constant composition channel coding. We show that the analogous notion of Rényi capacity, defined in terms of the sandwiched quantum Rényi divergences, has the same operational interpretation in the strong converse problem of constant composition classical-quantum channel coding.},

We begin by showing that it is sometimes possible to construct multiple ETFs for the same space that are “mutually unbiased” in a way that is analogous to the quantum-information-theoretic concept of mutually unbiased bases. We then show that taking certain tensor products of these mutually unbiased ETFs with other ETFs sometimes yields infinite families of new complex ETFs.},

Since FR codes are based on graphs or set systems, our MinVar model is characterized by the property that the variance among the sums of block-labels incident to a fixed vertex is minimized. This characterization is different from Dau and Milenkovic&#39;s MaxMinSum model, while the minimum sum of labels is maximized. We show that our MinVar model is meaningful by distinguishing labelings with different variances but with the same MaxMin value for some FR codes. By reformulating the MinVar model to an equivalent vertex-labeling problem of graphs, we find several families of optimal FR codes with balanced access frequency, and provide fundamental results for both problems. It is interesting that MinVar model is closely related to the concept of magic-labeling in graph theory.},

This work mainly studies results on Maximum distance separable (MDS) pomset codes and perfect codes over $\mathbb {Z}_{{m}}$ . If I is an ideal in a poset, the concept of I -perfect codes that was introduced to study MDS poset codes is now extended to the study of MDS pomset codes as well. But, unlike the ideals in posets, here the ideals in pomsets are considered as those with full count and those with partial count. In fact, the I -balls are no more linear when the ideal I is with partial count. This makes the investigation of the relationship of I -perfect codes with MDS pomset codes little different from that with MDS poset codes. We thoroughly study the I -balls where I is with partial count. Singleton type bound is established for codes with pomset metric and the connection of MDS codes with I -perfect codes is investigated upon. Then, we prove the duality theorem for codes with chain pomset. Finally, we determine the weight distribution of MDS pomset codes when the pomset is a chain.},

[14] for tolerating multiple failed nodes in distributed storage systems, which was a generalization of the concept of r-LRCs produced by Gopalan et al. [5]. An (r, δ)-LRC is said to be optimal if it achieves the Singleton-like bound. Recently, Chen et al. [2] generalized the construction of cyclic r-LRCs proposed by Tamo et al. [19], [20] and constructed several classes of optimal (r, δ)-LRCs of length n for n (q-1) or n (q+1), respectively in terms of a union of the set of zeros controlling the minimum distance and the set of zeros ensuring the locality. Following the work of [2], [3], this paper first characterizes (r, δ)-locality of a cyclic code via its zeros. Then we construct several classes of optimal cyclic (r, δ)-LRCs of length n for n (q - 1) or n (q+1), respectively from the product of two sets of zeros. Our constructions include all optimal cyclic (r, δ)-LRCs proposed in [2], [3], and our method seems more convenient to obtain optimal cyclic (r, δ)-LRCs with flexible parameters. Moreover, many optimal cyclic (r, δ)-LRCs of length n for n (q - 1) or n (q + 1), respectively with (r + δ - 1) n can be obtained from our method.},

The corresponding decoding radius is derived and the asymptotic behavior is analyzed. A general list-decoding algorithm for LRCs that achieves this radius is proposed along with an explicit realization for LRCs that are subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes (such as, e.g., Tamo-Barg LRCs). Further, a probabilistic algorithm of low complexity for unique decoding of LRCs is given and its success probability is analyzed. The second part of this work considers error decoding of LRCs and partial maximum distance separable (PMDS) codes through interleaved decoding. For a specific class of LRCs the success probability of interleaved decoding is investigated. For PMDS codes, it is shown that there is a wide range of parameters for which interleaved decoding can increase their decoding radius beyond the minimum distance such that the probability of successful decoding approaches 1 when the code length goes to infinity.},

While rigorous group testing algorithms have long been known with runtime at least linear in the number of items, a recent line of works has sought to reduce the runtime to poly(k log n), where n is the number of items and k is the number of defectives. In this paper, we present such an algorithm for non-adaptive group testing termed bit mixing coding (BMC), which builds on techniques that encode item indices in the test matrix, while incorporating novel ideas based on erasure-correction coding. We show that BMC achieves asymptotically vanishing error probability with O(k log n) tests and O(k 2 · log k · log n) runtime, in the limit as n → ∞ (with k having an arbitrary dependence on n). This closes an open problem of simultaneously achieving poly(k log n) decoding time using O(k log n) tests without any assumptions on k. In addition, we show that the same scaling laws can be attained in a commonly-considered noisy setting, in which each test outcome is flipped with constant probability.},

In this work, we show that such codes are (p, H(p)/∈ + 2)list-decodable with high probability, for any p ∈ (0, 1/2) and ∈ &gt; 0. In addition to improving the constant in known list-size bounds, our argument-which is quite simple-works simultaneously for all values of p, while previous works obtaining L = O(1/∈) patched together different arguments to cover different parameter regimes. Our approach is to strengthen an existential argument of (Guruswami, Håstad, Sudan and Zuckerman, IEEE Trans. IT, 2002) to hold with high probability. To complement our upper bound for random linear codes, we also improve an argument of (Guruswami, Narayanan, IEEE Trans. IT, 2014) to obtain an essentially tight lower bound of 1/∈ on the list size of uniformly random codes; this implies that random linear codes are in fact more list-decodable than uniformly random codes, in the sense that the list sizes are strictly smaller. To demonstrate the applicability of these techniques, we use them to (a) obtain more information about the distribution of list sizes of random linear codes and (b) to prove a similar result for random linear rank-metric codes.},

  abstract     = {Resistive memories store information in a crossbar arrangement of two-terminal devices that can be programmed to patterns of high or low resistance. While extremely compact, this technology suffers from the “sneak-path” problem: certain information patterns cannot be recovered, as multiple low resistances in parallel make a high resistance indistinguishable from a low resistance. In this paper, a multi-layer device is considered, and the number of bits it can store is derived exactly and asymptotic bounds are developed. The information density of a series of isolated arrays with extreme aspect ratios is derived in the single- and multi-layer cases with and without peripheral selection circuitry. This density is shown to be non-zero in the limit, unlike that of the arrays with moderate aspect ratios previously considered. A simple encoding scheme that achieves capacity asymptotically is presented.},

  abstract     = {In many information-theoretic channel coding problems, adding an input cost constraint to the operational setup amounts to restricting the optimization domain in the capacity formula. This paper shows that, in contrast to common belief, such a simple modification does not hold for the cost-constrained (CC) wiretap channel (WTC). The secrecy-capacity of the discrete memoryless (DM) WTC without cost constraints is described by a single auxiliary random variable. For the CC DM-WTC, however, we show that two auxiliaries are necessary to achieve capacity. Specifically, we first derive the secrecy-capacity formula, proving the direct part via superposition coding. Then, we provide an example of a CC DM-WTC whose secrecy-capacity cannot be achieved using a single auxiliary. This establishes the fundamental role of superposition coding over CC WTCs.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to characterize the capacity limits of a wireless cellular network with a full-duplex (FD) base-station (BS) and half-duplex user terminals, in which three independent messages are communicated: the uplink message m 1 from the uplink user to the BS, the downlink message m 2 from the BS to the downlink user, and the device-to-device (D2D) message m 3 from the uplink user to the downlink user. From an information theoretical perspective, the overall network can be viewed as a generalization of the FD relay broadcast channel with a side message transmitted from the relay to the destination. We begin with a simpler case that involves the uplink and downlink transmissions of (m 1 , m 2 ) only, and propose an achievable rate region based on a novel strategy that uses the BS as a FD relay to facilitate the interference cancellation at the downlink user. We also prove a new converse, which is strictly tighter than the cut-set bound, and characterize the capacity region of the scalar Gaussian FD network without a D2D message to within a constant gap. This paper further studies a general setup wherein (m 1 , m 2 , m 3 ) are communicated simultaneously. To account for the D2D message, we incorporate Marton&#39;s broadcast coding into the previous scheme to obtain a larger achievable rate region than the existing ones in the literature. We also improve the cut-set bound by means of genie and show that by using one of the two simple rate-splitting schemes, the capacity region of the scalar Gaussian FD network with a D2D message can already be reached to within a constant gap. Finally, a generalization to the vector Gaussian channel case is discussed. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of using the BS as relay in enhancing the throughput of the FD cellular network.},

  abstract     = {Most information storage devices write data by modifying the local state of matter, in the hope that sub-atomic local interactions stabilize the state for sufficiently long time, thereby allowing later recovery. Motivated to explore how temporal evolution of physical states in magnetic storage media affects their capacity, this work initiates the study of information retention in locally-interacting particle systems. The system dynamics follow the stochastic Ising model (SIM) over a 2-dimensional √(n) × √(n) grid. The initial spin configuration X 0 serves as the user-controlled input. The output configuration Xt is produced by running t steps of Glauber dynamics. Our main goal is to evaluate the information capacity I n (t) := max px 0 I(X 0 ; X t ) when time t scales with the system&#39;s size n. While the positive (but low) temperature regime is our main interest, we start by exploring the simpler zero-temperature dynamics. We first show that at zero temperature, order of √(n) bits can be stored in the system indefinitely by coding over stable, striped configurations. While √(n) is order optimal for infinite time, backing off to t n (t) are achievable. First, via linear coding arguments imply we show that I n (t) = Θ(n) for t = O(n). To go beyond the linear scale, we develop a droplet-based achievability scheme that reliably stores Ω (n/ log n) for t = O(n log n) time (log n can be replaced with any o(n) function). Moving to the positive but low temperature regime, two main results are provided. First, we show that an initial configuration drawn from the Gibbs measure cannot retain more than a single bit for t ≥ exp(Cβn 1/4+c ) time. On the other hand, when scaling time with the inverse temperature β, the stripe-based coding scheme (that stores for infinite time at zero temperature) is shown to retain its bits for e cβ .},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate effective sketching schemes via sparsification for high dimensional multilinear arrays or tensors. More specifically, we propose a novel tensor sparsification algorithm that retains a subset of the entries of a tensor in a judicious way, and prove that it can attain a given level of approximation accuracy in terms of tensor spectral norm with a much smaller sample complexity when compared with existing approaches. In particular, we show that for a k th order $ {d}\times \cdots \times {d}$ cubic tensor of stable rank $ {r}_{ {s}}$ , the sample size requirement for achieving a relative error $\varepsilon $ is, up to a logarithmic factor, of the order $ {r}_{ {s}}^{1/2} {d}^{ {k}/2} /\varepsilon $ when $\varepsilon $ is relatively large, and $ {r}_{ {s}} {d} /\varepsilon ^{2}$ and essentially optimal when $\varepsilon $ is sufficiently small. It is especially noteworthy that the sample size requirement for achieving a high accuracy is of an order independent of k . To further demonstrate the utility of our techniques, we also study how higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of large tensors can be efficiently approximated via sparsification.},

Spectral method is widely used for initialization in many phase retrieval algorithms. The quality of spectral initialization can have a major impact on the overall algorithm. In this paper, we focus on the model where $ {A}=[ {a}_{1},\ldots, {a}_{ {m}}]^{ \mathsf {H}}$ has orthonormal columns, and study the spectral initialization under the asymptotic setting $ {m}, {n}\to \infty $ with $ {m}/ {n}\to \delta \in (1,\infty)$ . We use the expectation propagation framework to characterize the performance of spectral initialization for Haar distributed matrices. Our numerical results confirm that the predictions of the EP method are accurate for not-only Haar distributed matrices, but also for realistic Fourier based models (e.g. the coded diffraction model). The main findings of this paper are the following: 1) There exists a threshold on $\delta $ (denoted as $\delta _{ \mathrm {weak}}$ ) below which the spectral method cannot produce a meaningful estimate. We show that $\delta _{ \mathrm {weak}}=2$ for the column-orthonormal model. In contrast, previous results by Mondelli and Montanari show that $\delta _{ \mathrm {weak}}=1$ for the i.i.d. Gaussian model. 2) The optimal design for the spectral method coincides with that for the i.i.d. Gaussian model, where the latter was recently introduced by Luo, Alghamdi and Lu.},

We characterize the global optimization geometry of the nonconvex factored problem and show that the corresponding objective function satisfies the robust strict saddle property as long as the original objective function f satisfies restricted strong convexity and smoothness properties, ensuring global convergence of many local search algorithms (such as noisy gradient descent) in polynomial time for solving the factored problem. We also provide a comprehensive analysis for the optimization geometry of a matrix factorization problem where we aim to find ${n}\times {r}$ and ${m}\times {r}$ matrices $ {U}$ and $ {V}$ such that $ {U} {V} ^{\mathrm {T}}$ approximates a given matrix $ {X}^\star $ . Aside from the robust strict saddle property, we show that the objective function of the matrix factorization problem has no spurious local minima and obeys the strict saddle property not only for the exact-parameterization case where $\mathrm {rank}( {X}^\star) = {r}$ , but also for the over-parameterization case where $\mathrm {rank}( {X}^\star) &amp;lt; {r}$ and the under-parameterization case where $\mathrm {rank}( {X}^\star) &amp;gt; {r}$ .

  abstract     = {Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) relies on sparse regression for accurate neighbor identification. Inspired by recent progress in compressive sensing, this paper proposes a new sparse regression scheme for SSC via two-step reweighted $\ell _{1} $ -minimization, which also generalizes a two-step $\ell _{1} $ -minimization algorithm introduced by E. J. Candès et al. in [ The Annals of Statistics , vol. 42, no. 2, pp. 669–699, 2014] without incurring extra algorithmic complexity. To fully exploit the prior information offered by the computed sparse representation vector in the first step, our approach places a weight on each component of the regression vector, and solves a weighted LASSO in the second step. We propose a data weighting rule suitable for enhancing neighbor identification accuracy. Then, under the formulation of the dual problem of weighted LASSO, we study in depth the theoretical neighbor recovery rates of the proposed scheme. Specifically, an interesting connection between the locations of nonzeros of the optimal sparse solution to the weighted LASSO and the indexes of the active constraints of the dual problem is established. Afterwards, under the semi-random model, analytic probability lower/upper bounds for various neighbor recovery events are derived. Our analytic results confirm that, with the aid of data weighting and if the prior neighbor information is accurate enough, the proposed scheme with a higher probability can produce many correct neighbors and few incorrect neighbors as compared to the solution without data weighting. Computer simulations are provided to validate our analytic study and evidence the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Our bounds are equivalent, up to constant and logarithmic factors, to state of the art bounds for complete and uniform missing observations. Furthermore, for the more general non uniform and dependent cases, the proposed bounds are new or improve upon previous results.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the sparse linear regression problem under the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) model. We first show that polynomial dependency on the dimensionality $p$ of the space is unavoidable for the estimation error in both non-interactive and sequential interactive local models, if the privacy of the whole dataset needs to be preserved. Similar limitations also exist for other types of error measurements and in the relaxed local models. This indicates that differential privacy in high dimensional space is unlikely achievable for the problem. With the understanding of this limitation, we then present two algorithmic results. The first one is a sequential interactive LDP algorithm for the low dimensional sparse case, called Locally Differentially Private Iterative Hard Thresholding (LDP-IHT), which achieves a near optimal upper bound. This algorithm is actually rather general and can be used to solve quite a few other problems, such as (Local) DP-ERM with sparsity constraints and sparse regression with non-linear measurements. The second one is for the restricted (high dimensional) case where only the privacy of the responses (labels) needs to be preserved. For this case, we show that the optimal rate of the error estimation can be made logarithmically dependent on $p$ (i.e., $\log p$ ) in the local model, where an upper bound is obtained by a label-privacy version of LDP-IHT. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets confirm our theoretical analysis.},

We establish a rigorous expression for the performance of the Bayes-optimal estimator in the high-dimensional regime, and identify the statistical threshold for weak-recovery of the spike. Next, we derive a message-passing algorithm taking into account the latent structure of the spike, and show that its performance is asymptotically optimal for natural choices of the generative network architecture. The absence of an algorithmic gap in this case is in stark contrast to known results for sparse spikes, another popular prior for modelling low-dimensional signals, and for which no algorithm is known to achieve the optimal statistical threshold. Finally, we show that linearising our message passing algorithm yields a simple spectral method also achieving the optimal threshold for reconstruction. We conclude with an experiment on a real data set showing that our bespoke spectral method outperforms vanilla PCA.},

  abstract     = {Source coding is the canonical problem of data compression in information theory. In a locally encodable source coding, each compressed bit depends on only few bits of the input. In this paper, we show that a recently popular model of semisupervised clustering is equivalent to locally encodable source coding. In this model, the task is to perform multiclass labeling of unlabeled elements. At the beginning, we can ask in parallel a set of simple queries to an oracle who provides (possibly erroneous) binary answers to the queries. The queries cannot involve more than two (or a fixed constant number of) elements. Now the labeling of all the elements (or clustering) must be performed based on the noisy query answers. The goal is to recover all the correct labelings while minimizing the number of such queries. The equivalence to locally encodable source codes leads us to find lower bounds on the number of queries required in variety of scenarios. We provide querying schemes based on pairwise ‘same cluster’ queries - and pairwise AND queries, and show provable performance guarantees for each of the schemes.},

  abstract     = {We study distributed optimization in the presence of Byzantine adversaries, where both data and computation are distributed among $m$ worker machines, $t$ of which may be corrupt. The compromised nodes may collaboratively and arbitrarily deviate from their pre-specified programs, and a designated (master) node iteratively computes the model/parameter vector for generalized linear models . In this work, we primarily focus on two iterative algorithms: Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) and Coordinate Descent (CD). Gradient descent (GD) is a special case of these algorithms. PGD is typically used in the data-parallel setting, where data is partitioned across different samples, whereas, CD is used in the model-parallelism setting, where data is partitioned across the parameter space. At the core of our solutions to both these algorithms is a method for Byzantine-resilient matrix-vector (MV) multiplication; and for that, we propose a method based on data encoding and error correction over real numbers to combat adversarial attacks. We can tolerate up to $t\leq \lfloor \frac {m-1}{2}\rfloor $ corrupt worker nodes, which is information-theoretically optimal. We give deterministic guarantees, and our method does not assume any probability distribution on the data. We develop a sparse encoding scheme which enables computationally efficient data encoding and decoding. We demonstrate a trade-off between the corruption threshold and the resource requirements (storage, computational, and communication complexity). As an example, for $t\leq \frac {m}{3}$ , our scheme incurs only a constant overhead on these resources, over that required by the plain distributed PGD/CD algorithms which provide no adversarial protection. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that connects MV multiplication with CD and designs a specific encoding matrix for MV multiplication whose structure we can leverage to make CD secure against adversarial attacks. Our encoding scheme extends efficiently to (i) the data streaming model, in which data samples come in an online fashion and are encoded as they arrive, and (ii) making stochastic gradient descent (SGD) Byzantine-resilient. In the end, we give experimental results to show the efficacy of our proposed schemes.},

It is also demonstrated that the projection asymptotically coincides with the plugin density with the posterior mean of the expectation parameter of the exponential family, which we refer to as the Bayes extended estimator. Information-geometric correspondence indicates that the Bayesian predictive density can be represented as the posterior mean of the infinite-dimensional exponential family. The Kullback–Leibler risk performance of the approximation is demonstrated by numerical simulations and it indicates that the posterior mean of the expectation parameter approaches the Bayesian predictive density as the dimension of the exponential family increases. It also suggests that approximation by projection onto an exponential family of reasonable size is practically advantageous with respect to risk performance and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an automatic tool to search for optimal differential and linear trails in ARX ciphers. It’s shown that a modulo addition can be divided into sequential small modulo additions with carry bit, which turns an ARX cipher into an S-box-like cipher. From this insight, we introduce the concepts of carry-bit-dependent difference distribution table (CDDT) and carry-bit-dependent linear approximation table (CLAT). Based on them, we give efficient methods to trace all possible output differences and linear masks of a big modulo addition, with returning their differential probabilities and linear correlations simultaneously. Then an adapted Matsui’s algorithm is introduced, which can find the optimal differential and linear trails in ARX ciphers. Besides, the superiority of our tool’s potency is also confirmed by experimental results for round-reduced versions of HIGHT and SPECK. More specifically, we find the optimal differential trails for up to 10 rounds of HIGHT, reported for the first time. We also find the optimal differential trails for 10, 12, 16, 8 and 8 rounds of SPECK32/48/64/96/128, and report the provably optimal differential trails for SPECK48 and SPECK64 for the first time. The optimal linear trails for up to 9 rounds of HIGHT are reported for the first time, and the optimal linear trails for 22, 13, 15, 9 and 9 rounds of SPECK32/48/64/96/128 are also found respectively. These results evaluate the security of HIGHT and SPECK against differential and linear cryptanalysis. Also, our tool is useful to estimate the security in the design of ARX ciphers.},

  abstract     = {The first and the third authors recently introduced a spectral construction of plateaued and of 5-value spectrum functions. In particular, the design of the latter class requires a specification of integers ${W(u):u\in \mathbb {F}^{n}_{2}}$ , where $W(u)\in \left{{0, \pm 2^{\frac {n+s_{1}}{2}}, \pm 2^{\frac {n+s_{2}}{2}}}\right}$ , so that the sequence ${W(u):u\in \mathbb {F}^{n}_{2}}$ is a valid spectrum of a Boolean function (recovered using the inverse Walsh transform). Technically, this is done by allocating a suitable Walsh support $S=S^{[{1}]}\cup S^{[{2}]}\subset \mathbb {F}^{n}_{2}$ , where $S^{[i]}$ corresponds to those $u \in \mathbb {F} _{2}^{n}$ for which $W(u)=\pm 2^{\frac {n+s_{i}}{2}}$ . In addition, two dual functions $g_{[i]}:S^{[i]}\rightarrow \mathbb {F}_{2}$ (with $\#S^{[i]}=2^{\lambda _{i}}$ ) are employed to specify the signs through $W(u)=2^{\frac {n+s_{i}}{2}}(-1)^{g_{[i]}(u)}$ for $u\in S^{[i]}$ whereas $W(u)=0$ for $u\not \in S$ . In this work, two closely related problems are considered. Firstly, the specification of plateaued functions (duals) $g_{[i]}$ , which additionally satisfy the so-called totally disjoint spectra property, is fully characterized (so that $W(u)$ is a spectrum of a Boolean function) when the Walsh support $S$ is given as a union of two disjoint affine subspaces $S^{[i]}$ . Especially, when plateaued dual functions $g_{[i]}$ themselves have affine Walsh supports, an efficient spectral design that utilizes arbitrary bent functions (as duals of $g_{[i]}$ ) on the corresponding ambient spaces is given. The problem of specifying affine inequivalent 5-value spectra functions is also addressed and an efficient construction method that ensures the inequivalence property is derived (sufficient condition being a selection of affine inequivalent duals). In the second part of this work, we investigate duals of plateaued functions with affine Walsh supports. For a given such plateaued function, we show that different orderings of its Walsh support which are employing the Sylvester-Hadamard recursion actually induce bent duals which are affine equivalent.},

Further, we show that extended-affine inequivalent Boolean bent functions in $n$ variables, whose translation designs are isomorphic, exist for all $n\ge 6$ . This implies, that isomorphism of translation designs for Boolean bent functions is a coarser equivalence relation than extended-affine equivalence. However, we do not observe the same phenomenon for vectorial bent functions in a small number of variables. We classify and enumerate all vectorial bent functions in six variables and show, that in contrast to the Boolean case, one cannot exhibit isomorphic translation designs from extended-affine inequivalent vectorial $(6,m)$ -bent functions with $m\in { 2,3 }$ .},

  abstract     = {Shannon’s entropy is a clear lower bound for statistical compression. The situation is not so well understood for dictionary-based compression. A plausible lower bound is $\boldsymbol {b}$ , the least number of phrases of a general bidirectional parse of a text, where phrases can be copied from anywhere else in the text. Since computing $\boldsymbol {b}$ is NP-complete, a popular gold standard is $\boldsymbol {z}$ , the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse of the text, which is computed in linear time and yields the least number of phrases when those can be copied only from the left. Almost nothing has been known for decades about the approximation ratio of $\boldsymbol {z}$ with respect to $\boldsymbol {b}$ . In this paper we prove that $z=O(b\log (n/b))$ , where $n$ is the text length. We also show that the bound is tight as a function of $n$ , by exhibiting a text family where $z = \Omega (b\log n)$ . Our upper bound is obtained by building a run-length context-free grammar based on a locally consistent parsing of the text. Our lower bound is obtained by relating $\boldsymbol {b}$ with $r$ , the number of equal-letter runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform of the text. We continue by observing that Lempel-Ziv is just one particular case of greedy parses–meaning that it obtains the smallest parse by scanning the text and maximizing the phrase length at each step–, and of ordered parses–meaning that phrases are larger than their sources under some order. As a new example of ordered greedy parses, we introduce lexicographical parses, where phrases can only be copied from lexicographically smaller text locations. We prove that the size $v$ of the optimal lexicographical parse is also obtained greedily in $O(n)$ time, that $v=O(b\log (n/b))$ , and that there exists a text family where $v = \Omega (b\log n)$ . Interestingly, we also show that $v = O(r)$ because $r$ also induces a lexicographical parse, whereas $z = \Omega (r\log n)$ holds on some text families. We obtain some results on parsing complexity and size that hold on some general classes of greedy ordered parses. In our way, we also prove other relevant bounds between compressibility measures, especially with those related to smallest grammars of various types generating (only) the text.},

  abstract     = {The problem of channel gain estimation in visible light communications and positioning is considered in this article. Pilot sequences are designed for simultaneously estimating the channel gains of multiple transmitters in a light system and satisfying the average and maximum transmit power constraint due to illumination purpose. This article illustrates how to design the optimal pilot sequences that minimise the noise variance experienced by a receiver although the optimisation problem is non-convex. Lower bounds on the noise variance are derived for systems with ambient light and systems without ambient light. These bounds reveal the relationship between noise variance, the average transmit power, the maximum transmit power, the number of light sources and pilot length. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the bounds to hold with equality are derived. These conditions establish a bridge between block design theory and channel estimation in visible light systems. Optimal pilot designs which achieve the lower bounds on noise variance can be obtained from balanced block designs and pairwise balanced designs. This article also shows how to optimise the average transmit power of a pilot design for minimising noise variance.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new model for wireless relay networks referred to as “1-2-1 network”, where two nodes can communicate only if they point “beams” at each other, otherwise no signal can be exchanged or interference can be generated. This model is motivated by millimeter wave communications where, due to the high path loss, a link between two nodes can exist only if beamforming gain at both sides is established, while in the absence of beamforming gain the signal is received well below the thermal noise floor. The main contributions in this paper include: (a) the development of a constant gap approximation for the unicast and multicast capacities of the proposed network model, i.e., a characterization of the network unicast and multicast capacities to within an additive gap, which only depends on the number of nodes and is independent of the channel coefficients and operating SNR; and (b) the design of algorithms that run in polynomial time in the number of nodes and compute the approximate unicast and multicast capacities, as well as their corresponding optimal beam scheduling strategies. These results are derived both for full-duplex and half-duplex modes of operation at the relays: while in full-duplex the transmit and receive beams at a relay can be simultaneously active, in half-duplex only one can be active at each point in time. The relation between the approximate multicast capacity and minimum unicast capacity is explored in full-duplex 1-2-1 networks and shown to be dependent on the network structure and the number of destinations, unlike in classical wireless (i.e., without 1-2-1 constraints) full-duplex networks. Finally, network simplification results are proved for the 1-2-1 network model by exploiting the structure of the linear program that represents the approximate capacity.},

While decoding algorithms have been proposed for the 3D toric code on a cubic lattice, there have been very few studies on the decoding of 3D toric codes over arbitrary lattices. Color codes in 3D can be mapped to toric codes. However, the resulting toric codes are not defined on cubic lattice. They are arbitrary lattices with triangular faces. Decoding toric codes over an arbitrary lattice will help in studying the performance of color codes. Furthermore, gauge color codes can also be decoded via 3D toric codes. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient algorithm to decode 3D toric codes on arbitrary lattices (with and without boundaries).},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we analyze classical data compression with quantum side information (also known as the classical-quantum Slepian–Wolf protocol) in the so-called large and moderate deviation regimes. In the non-asymptotic setting, the protocol involves compressing classical sequences of finite length $n$ and decoding them with the assistance of quantum side information. In the large deviation regime, the compression rate is fixed, and we obtain bounds on the error exponent function, which characterizes the minimal probability of error as a function of the rate. Devetak and Winter showed that the asymptotic data compression limit for this protocol is given by a conditional entropy. For any protocol with a rate below this quantity, the probability of error converges to one asymptotically and its speed of convergence is given by the strong converse exponent function. We obtain finite blocklength bounds on this function, and determine exactly its asymptotic value. In the moderate deviation regime for the compression rate, the latter is no longer considered to be fixed. It is allowed to depend on the blocklength $n$ , but assumed to decay slowly to the asymptotic data compression limit. Starting from a rate above this limit, we determine the speed of convergence of the error probability to zero and show that it is given in terms of the conditional information variance.},

We provide a single-letter condition under which such a simulation is asymptotically possible with a vanishing KL divergence. Our condition is nontrivial only in the case where the Gàcs-Körner (GK) common information between $U$ and $V$ is nonzero, and we conjecture that only scalar Markov chains $X-U-V-Y$ can be simulated otherwise. Motivated by this conjecture, we further examine the case where both $p_{UV}$ and $p_{XY}$ are doubly symmetric binary sources with parameters $p,q\leq 1/2$ respectively. While it is trivial that in this case $p\leq q$ is both necessary and sufficient, we use Fourier analytic tools to show that when $p$ is close to $q$ then any successful simulation is close to being scalar in the total variation sense.},

Using the functional-entropic duality and the reverse hypercontractivity of the transposition semigroup, we lower bound the error probability for each joint type. Then by averaging the error probability over types, we lower bound the c-dispersion (which characterizes the second-order behavior of the weighted sum of the rates of the two compressors when a nonvanishing error probability is small) as the variance of the gradient of $\inf _{ {P}_{ {U}| {X}}}{{ { cH}}( {Y}| {U})+ {I}( {U}; {X})}$ with respect to $ {Q}_{{{ XY}}}$ , the per-letter side information and source distribution. In comparison, using standard achievability arguments based on the method of types, we upper-bound the c-dispersion as the variance of $ {c}\imath _{ {Y}| {U}}( {Y}| {U})+\imath _{ {U}; {X}}( {U}; {X})$ , which improves the existing upper bounds but has a gap to the aforementioned lower bound. Our converse analysis should be immediately extendable to other distributed source-type problems, such as distributed source coding, common randomness generation, and hypothesis testing with communication constraints. We further present improved bounds for the general image-size problem via our semigroup technique.},

The principal technical contributions are decomposition bounds that allow the representation of a random variable $X$ as a deterministic function of $({S},{Z})$ , where $S$ is a given fixed random variable and $Z$ is constructed to be independent of $S$ . Using the problems of privacy and lossless compression as examples, the utility cost of applying secrecy by design is investigated. Privacy is studied in the setting of the privacy funnel function previously introduced in the literature and new bounds for the regime of zero information leakage are derived. For the problem of lossless compression, it is shown that strong information-theoretic guarantees can be achieved using a reduced secret key size and a quantifiable penalty on the compression rate. The fundamental limits for both problems are characterized with matching lower and upper bounds when the secret $S$ is a deterministic function of the information source $X$ .},

Motivated by the GWAS problem, in this paper we introduce the information-theoretic problem of associated subsequence retrieval , where a dataset of N (possibly high-dimensional) sequences of length G, and their corresponding observable (binary) characteristics is given. The sequences are chosen independently and uniformly at random from $\mathcal {X}^{\text {G}}$ , where $\mathcal {X}$ is a finite alphabet. The observable (binary) characteristic is only related to a specific unknown subsequence of length $L$ of the sequences, called associated subsequence . For each sequence, if the associated subsequence of it belongs to a universal finite set, then it is more likely to display the observable characteristic (i.e., it is more likely that the observable characteristic is one). The goal is to retrieve the associated subsequence using a dataset of N sequences and their observable characteristics. We demonstrate that as the parameters N, G, and L grow, a threshold effect appears in the curve of probability of error versus the rate which is defined as ${{\it\text { Gh}}(\text {L}/\text {G})}/{\text {N}}$ , where $\text {h}(\cdot )$ is the binary entropy function. This effect allows us to define the capacity of associated subsequence retrieval. We develop an achievable scheme and a matching converse for this problem, and thus characterize its capacity in two scenarios: the zero-error-rate and the $\epsilon $ -error-rate.},

Our codes are constructed by evaluations of rational functions at all rational places (including the place of “infinity”) of the rational function field. Compared to the rational algebraic geometry codes, the main difference is that we allow rational functions to be evaluated at pole places. After evaluating rational functions from a union of Riemann-Roch spaces, we obtain a family of nonlinear codes with length $q+1$ over the alphabet $\mathbb {F}_{q}\cup {\infty }$ . As a result, our codes have reasonable parameters as they are rather close to the Singleton bound. Furthermore, our codes have better parameters than those obtained from MDS codes via code alphabet restriction or extension. Amazingly, an efficient decoding algorithm can be provided for our codes.},

  abstract     = {In distributed computing systems slow working nodes, known as stragglers, can greatly extend finishing times. Coded computing is a technique that enables straggler-resistant computation. Most coded computing techniques presented to date provide robustness by ensuring that the time to finish depends only on a set of the fastest nodes. However, while stragglers do compute less work than non-stragglers, in real-world commercial cloud computing systems (e.g., Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)) the distinction is often a soft one. In this paper, we develop hierarchical coded computing that exploits the work completed by all nodes, both fast and slow, automatically integrating the potential contribution of each. We first present a conceptual framework to represent the division of work amongst nodes in coded matrix multiplication as a cuboid partitioning problem. This framework allows us to unify existing methods and motivates new techniques. We then develop three methods of hierarchical coded computing that we term bit-interleaved coded computation (BICC), multilevel coded computation (MLCC), and hybrid hierarchical coded computation (HHCC). In this paradigm, each worker is tasked with completing a sequence (a hierarchy) of ordered subtasks. The sequence of subtasks, and the complexity of each, is designed so that partial work completed by stragglers can be used, rather than ignored. We note that our methods can be used in conjunction with any coded computing method. We illustrate this by showing how we can use our methods to accelerate all previously developed coded computing techniques by enabling them to exploit stragglers. Under a widely studied statistical model of completion time, our approach realizes a 66\% improvement in the expected finishing time. On Amazon EC2, the gain was 27\% when stragglers are simulated.},

  abstract     = {Lifted Reed-Solomon Codes (Guo, Kopparty, Sudan 2013) were introduced in the context of locally correctable and testable codes. They are multivariate polynomials whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a Reed-Solomon code. We consider a generalization of their construction, which we call lifted multiplicity codes . These are multivariate polynomial codes whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a multiplicity code (Kopparty, Saraf, Yekhanin 2014). We show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and a notion of locality called the $t$ -disjoint-repair-group property than previously known constructions. As a corollary, they also give better tradeoffs for PIR codes in the same parameter regimes. More precisely, we show that, for $t\le \sqrt {N}$ , lifted multiplicity codes with length $N$ and redundancy $O(t^{0.585} \sqrt {N})$ have the property that any symbol of a codeword can be reconstructed in $t$ different ways, each using a disjoint subset of the other coordinates. This gives the best known trade-off for this problem for any super-constant $t &amp;lt; \sqrt {N}$ . We also give an alternative analysis of lifted Reed-Solomon codes using dual codes, which may be of independent interest.},

It applies SCL encoding for the source coding part, and SCL decoding with a properly defined CRC for the channel coding part. The scheme shows improved performance compared to the existing method. A known issue with nested polar codes for binary dirty paper is the existence of frozen channel code bits that are not frozen in the source code. These bits need to be retransmitted in a second phase of the scheme, thus reducing the rate and increasing the required blocklength. We provide an improved bound on the size of this set, and on its scaling with respect to the blocklength, when the Bhattacharyya parameter of the test channel used for source coding is sufficiently large, or the Bhattacharyya parameter of the channel seen at the decoder is sufficiently small. The result is formulated for an arbitrary binary-input memoryless GP problem, since unlike the previous results, it does not require degradedness of the two channels mentioned above. Finally, we present simulation results for binary dirty paper and noisy write once memory codes.},

In each round, each network node proposes a linear predictor, with the objective of fitting the network-wide data.

The predictions made at a given node are assessed through the notion of regret, defined as the difference between their cumulative network-wide square errors and those of the best off-line network-wide linear predictor. Various scenarios are investigated, depending on the nature of the local feedback (full information or bandit feedback), on the set of available predictors (the decision set), and the way data is generated (by an oblivious or adaptive adversary). We propose simple and natural distributed regression algorithms, involving, at each node and in each round, a local gradient descent step and a communication and averaging step where nodes aim at aligning their predictors to those of their neighbors. We establish regret upper bounds typically in O(T 3/4 ) when the decision set is unbounded and in O(√T) in case of bounded decision set.},

Using tools from large deviation theory, we calculate the exact learning rates for these strategies and demonstrate regimes where the low-effort strategy outperforms the high-effort strategy.

  abstract     = {An impurity measures I : R d → R + is a function that assigns a d-dimensional vector v to a non-negative value I(v) so that the more homogeneous v, with respect to the values of its coordinates, the larger its impurity. A well known example of impurity measures is the entropy impurity. We study the problem of clustering based on the entropy impurity measures. Let V be a collection of n many d-dimensional vectors with non-negative components. Given V and an impurity measure I, the goal is to find a partition n of V into k groups V 1 , . . . , V k so as to minimize the sum of the impurities of the groups in P, i.e., I(P) = Σ i=1 k I (Σ v∈Vi v). Impurity minimization has been widely used as quality assessment measure in probability distribution clustering (KL-divergence) as well as in categorical clustering. However, in contrast to the case of metric based clustering, the current knowledge of impurity measure based clustering in terms of approximation and in approximability results is very limited. Here, we contribute to change this scenario by proving that the problem of finding a clustering that minimizes the Entropy impurity measure is APX-hard, i.e., there exists a constant ε &gt; 0 such that no polynomial time algorithm can guarantee (1 + ε)-approximation under the standard complexity hypothesis P ≠ N P . The in approximability holds even when all vectors have the same 11 norm. This result provides theoretical limitations on the computational efficiency that can be achievable in the quantization of discrete memoryless channels, a problem that has recently attracted significant attention in the signal processing community. In addition, it also solve a question that remained open in previous work on this topic [Chaudhuri and McGregor COLT 08; Ackermann et. al. ECCC 11].},

In many of these cases, such as in the policy evaluation problem encountered in reinforcement learning, the goal is to estimate the long-term value function of such a process without access to the underlying population transition and reward functions. Working with samples generated under the synchronous model, we study the problem of estimating the value function of an infinite-horizon discounted MRP with finite state space in the ℓ ∞ -norm. We analyze both the standard plug-in approach to this problem and a more robust variant, and establish non-asymptotic bounds that depend on the (unknown) problem instance, as well as data-dependent bounds that can be evaluated based on the observations of state-transitions and rewards. We show that these approaches are minimax-optimal up to constant factors over natural sub-classes of MRPs. Our analysis makes use of a leave-one-out decoupling argument tailored to the policy evaluation problem, one which may be of independent interest.},

For the KL-divergence as well as for some other uncertainty classes, such as the α-divergences, the joint stochastic boundedness property, which is the fundamental rule to prove minimax robustness, fails to hold. This raises a natural question whether a solution to minimax robust decentralized detection problem can be given if the uncertainty classes do not own this property. An answer to this question has been shown to be positive, which leads to a generalization of an existing work. Moreover, it is shown that for Huber&#39;s extended uncertainty classes quantization functions at the sensors are not required to be monotone in order to claim minimax robustness. A possible generalization of the theory to minimax- and Neyman-Pearson formulations, repeated observations, imperfect reporting channels and different network topologies have been discussed. Simulation examples are provided considering clipped- and censored likelihood ratio tests.},

  abstract     = {SLOPE is a relatively new convex optimization procedure for high-dimensional linear regression via the sorted ℓ 1 penalty: the larger the rank of the fitted coefficient, the larger the penalty. This non-separable penalty renders many existing techniques invalid or inconclusive in analyzing the SLOPE solution. In this paper, we develop an asymptotically exact characterization of the SLOPE solution under Gaussian random designs through solving the SLOPE problem using approximate message passing (AMP). This algorithmic approach allows us to approximate the SLOPE solution via the much more amenable AMP iterates. Explicitly, we characterize the asymptotic dynamics of the AMP iterates relying on a recently developed state evolution analysis for non-separable penalties, thereby overcoming the difficulty caused by the sorted ℓ 1 penalty. Moreover, we prove that the AMP iterates converge to the SLOPE solution in an asymptotic sense, and numerical simulations show that the convergence is surprisingly fast. Our proof rests on a novel technique that specifically leverages the SLOPE problem. In contrast to prior literature, our work not only yields an asymptotically sharp analysis but also offers an algorithmic, flexible, and constructive approach to understanding the SLOPE problem.},

We investigate theoretical properties of a weighted Shiryayev-Roberts-Pollak (SRP) change point detection rule in state space models. By making use of a Markov chain representation for the likelihood function, exponential embedding of the induced Markovian transition operator, nonlinear Markov renewal theory, and sequential hypothesis testing theory for Markov random walks, we show that the weighted SRP procedure is second-order asymptotically optimal. To this end, we derive an asymptotic approximation for the expected stopping time of such a stopping scheme when the change time w = 1. To illustrate our method we apply the results to two types of state space models: general state Markov chains and linear state space models. Simulation study is given to illustrate the method.},

One reason conditional mutual information is not more widely used for these tasks is the lack of estimators which can handle combinations of continuous and discrete random variables, common in applications. This article develops a new method for estimating mutual and conditional mutual information for data samples containing a mix of discrete and continuous variables.

The QPIR capacity is defined as the maximum rate of the file size over the whole dimension of the downloaded quantum systems. When the servers are assumed to share prior entanglement, we prove that the QPIR capacity with multiple servers is 1 regardless of the number of servers and files. We construct a rate-one protocol only with two servers. This capacity-achieving protocol outperforms its classical counterpart in the sense of the capacity, server secrecy, and upload cost.

We introduce the asymptotic spectrum of graphs with respect to quantum and entanglement-assisted homomorphisms, and we introduce the asymptotic spectrum of non-commutative graphs with respect to entanglement-assisted homomorphisms. We apply Strassen&#39;s spectral theorem (J. Reine Angew. Math., 1988) in order to obtain dual characterizations of the corresponding Shannon capacities and asymptotic preorders in terms of their asymptotic spectra. This work extends the study of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs initiated by Zuiddam (Combinatorica, 2019) to the quantum domain. We then exhibit spectral points in the new quantum asymptotic spectra and discuss their relations with the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. In particular, we prove that the (fractional) real and complex Haemers bounds upper bound the quantum Shannon capacity, which is defined as the regularization of the quantum independence number (Mančinska and Roberson, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2016), and that the fractional real and complex Haemers bounds are elements in the quantum asymptotic spectrum of graphs. This is in contrast to the Haemers bounds defined over certain finite fields, which can be strictly smaller than the quantum Shannon capacity. Moreover, since the Haemers bound can be strictly smaller than the Lovász theta function (Haemers, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 1979), we find that the quantum Shannon capacity and the Lovász theta function do not coincide. As a consequence, two well-known conjectures in quantum information theory, namely: 1) the entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity of a classical channel is equal to the Lovász theta function and 2) maximally entangled states and projective measurements are sufficient to achieve the entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity, cannot both be true.},

Quantum anticliques coincide with error-correcting codes, while quantum cliques satisfy a dual property. In this paper we study the quantum graphs of mixed-unitary channels generated by tensor products of Pauli operators, which we call Pauli channels. We show that most quantum graphs arising from Pauli channels have non-trivial quantum cliques or quantum anti-cliques which are stabilizer codes. However, a reformulation of the quantum Ramsey theorem in terms of stabilizer codes and Pauli channels fails. Specifically, for every positive integer n, there exists an n-qubit Pauli channel for which any non-trivial quantum clique or quantum anti-clique fails to be a stabilizer code. We also show that this example is essentially unique, and hence most n-qubit Pauli channels have non-trivial quantum cliques or quantum anti-cliques which are stabilizer codes.},

  abstract     = {Caching is an efficient way to reduce network traffic congestion during peak hours by storing some content at the user&#39;s local cache memory without knowledge of later demands. For the shared-link caching model, Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) proposed a two-phase (placement and delivery) coded caching strategy, which is order optimal within a constant factor. However, in the MAN coded caching scheme, each user can obtain the information about the demands of other users, i.e., the MAN coded caching scheme is inherently prone to tampering and spying the activity/demands of other users. In this paper, we formulate an information-theoretic shared-link caching model with private demands, where there are K cache-aided users (which can cache up to M files) connected to a central server with access to N files. Each user requests L files. Our objective is to design a two-phase private caching scheme with minimum load while preserving the information-theoretic privacy of the demands of each user with respect to other users. A trivial solution is the uncoded caching scheme which lets each user recover all the N files, referred to as baseline scheme. For this problem we propose two novel schemes which achieve the information-theoretic privacy of the users&#39; demands while also achieving a non-trivial caching gain over the baseline scheme. The general underlying idea is to satisfy the users&#39; requests by generating a set of coded multicast messages that is symmetric with respect to the library files, such that for each user k, the mutual information between these messages and the demands of all other users given the cache content and the demand of user k is zero. In the first scheme, referred to as virtual-user scheme, we introduce a number of virtual users such that each L-subset of files is demanded by K real or virtual (effective) users and use the MAN delivery to generate multicast messages. From the viewpoint of each user, the set of multicast messages is symmetric over all files even if each single multicast message is not. This scheme incurs in an extremely large sub-packetization. Then, we propose a second scheme, referred to as MDS-based scheme, based on a novel MDS-coded cache placement. In this case, we generate multicast messages where each multicast message contains one MDS-coded symbol from each file in the library and thus is again symmetric over all the files from the viewpoint of each user. The sub-packetization level of the MDS-based scheme is exponentially smaller than that needed by the virtual-user scheme. Compared with the existing shared-link coded caching converse bounds without privacy, the virtual-user scheme is proved to be order optimal with a constant factor when N ≤ LK, or when N ≥ LK and M ≥ N/K. In addition, when M ≥ N/2, both of the virtual-user scheme and the MDS-based scheme are order optimal within a factor of 2.},

  abstract     = {We continue the study of list recovery properties of high-rate tensor codes, initiated by Hemenway, Ron-Zewi, and Wootters (FOCS&#39;17). In that work it was shown that the tensor product of an efficient (poly-time) high-rate globally list recoverable code is approximately locally list recoverable, as well as globally list recoverable in probabilistic near-linear time. This was used in turn to give the first capacity-achieving list decodable codes with (1) local list decoding algorithms, and with (2) probabilistic near-linear time global list decoding algorithms. This also yielded constant-rate codes approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with probabilistic near-linear time global unique decoding algorithms. In the current work we obtain the following results: 1) The tensor product of an efficient (poly-time) high-rate globally list recoverable code is globally list recoverable in deterministic near-linear time. This yields in turn the first capacity-achieving list decodable codes with deterministic near-linear time global list decoding algorithms. It also gives constant-rate codes approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with deterministic near-linear time global unique decoding algorithms. 2) If the base code is additionally locally correctable, then the tensor product is (genuinely) locally list recoverable. This yields in turn (non-explicit) constant-rate codes approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound that are locally correctable with query complexity and running time N o (1). This improves over prior work by Gopi et. al. (SODA&#39;17; IEEE Transactions on Information Theory&#39;18) that only gave query complexity NE with rate that is exponentially small in 1/ε. 3) A nearly-tight combinatori allower bound on output list size for list recovering high-rate tensor codes. This bound implies in turn a nearly-tight lower bound of N Ω(1/ log log N) on the product of query complexity and output list size for locally list recovering high-rate tensor codes.},

  abstract     = {Flash memory devices are winning the competition for storage density against magnetic recording devices. This outcome results from advances in physics that allow storage of more than one bit per cell, coupled with advances in signal processing that reduce the effect of physical instabilities. Constrained codes are used in storage to avoid problematic patterns, and thus prevent errors from happening. Recently, we introduced binary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes) for data storage and data transmission. LOCO codes are capacity-achieving, simple, and can be easily reconfigured. This paper introduces simple constrained codes that support non-binary physical gates in multi, triple, quad, and the currently-in-development penta-level cell (M/T/Q/P-LC) Flash memories. The new codes can be easily modified if problematic patterns change with time. These codes are designed to mitigate inter-cell interference, which is a critical source of error in Flash devices. The occurrence of errors is a consequence of parasitic capacitances in and across floating-gate transistors, resulting in charge propagation from cells being programmed to the highest charge level to neighboring cells being programmed to lower levels or unprogrammed/erased. This asymmetric nature of error-prone patterns distinguishes Flash memories. The new codes are called $q$ -ary asymmetric LOCO codes (QA-LOCO codes), and the construction subsumes codes previously designed for single-level cell (SLC) Flash devices (A-LOCO codes). QA-LOCO codes work for a Flash device with any number, $q$ , of levels per cell. For $q \geq 4$ , we show that QA-LOCO codes can achieve rates greater than $0.95 \log _{2} \!q$ input bits per coded symbol. The complexity of encoding and decoding is modest, and reconfiguring a code is as easy as reprogramming an adder. Capacity-achieving rates, affordable encoding-decoding complexity, and ease of reconfigurability support the growing improvement of M/T/Q/P-LC Flash memory devices, as well as lifecycle management as the characteristics of these devices change with time, which increases their lifetime.},

  abstract     = {Repair locality has been an important metric in a distributed storage system (DSS). Erasure codes with small locality are more popular in a DSS, which means fewer available nodes participating in the repair process of failed nodes. Locally repairable codes (LRCs) as a new coding scheme have given more rise to the system performance and attracted a lot of interest in the theoretical research in coding theory. The particular concern among the research problems is the bounds and optimal constructions of LRCs. The problem of optimal constructions of LRCs includes the most important case of Singleton-optimal LRCs whose minimum distance achieves the Singleton-like bound, which is the core consideration in this paper. In this work, we first of all derive an improved and general upper bound on the code length of Singleton-optimal LRCs with minimum distance d = 5, 6, some known constructions are shown to exactly achieve our new bound, which verifies its tightness. For locality r = 2 and distance d = 6, we construct three newSingleton-optimal LRCs whose code length n = 3(q + 1), n = 3(q + √q + 1) and n = 3(2q - 4), respectively. Moreover, we obtain a complete characterization for Singletonoptimal LRCs with r = 2 and d = 6. Such characterization has established an important connection between the existence of Singleton-optimal LRCs and that of a special subset of lines of finite projective plane P G(2, q), thus provides a methodology for constructing LRCs with longer length based on any advance on finite projective plane P G(2, q). In the end, we employ the well-known line-point incidence matrix and Johnson bounds for constant weight codes to derive tighter upper bounds on the code length. These new bounds further help us to prove that some of the previous Singleton-optimal constructions or their extensions achieve the longest possible code length for q = 3, 4, 5, 7. It&#39;s worth noting that all of our Singleton-optimal constructions possess small locality r = 2, which are attractive in a DSS.},

Each user is given access to a certain subset of storage nodes, where it can download the stored data. The dealer wants to securely convey a specific secret s j to user j via storage nodes, for j=1,2, ..., m. More specifically, two secrecy conditions are considered in this multi-user context. The weak secrecy condition is that each user does not get any information about the individual secrets of other users, while the perfect secrecy condition implies that a user does not get any information about the collection of all other users&#39; secrets. In this system, the dealer encodes secrets into several secret shares and loads them into the storage nodes. Given a certain number of storage nodes we find the maximum number of users that can be served in such a system and construct schemes that achieve this with perfect secrecy. We further define two major properties for such distributed secret sharing systems; communication complexity is defined as the total amount of data that users need to download in order to reconstruct their secrets; and storage overhead is defined as the total size of data loaded by the dealer into the storage nodes normalized by the total size of secrets. Lower bounds on the minimum communication complexity and the storage overhead are characterized given any n and m. We construct distributed secret sharing protocols, under certain conditions on the system parameters, that attain the lower bound on the communication complexity while providing perfect secrecy. Furthermore, we construct protocols, again under certain conditions, that simultaneously attain the lower bounds on the communication complexity and the storage overhead while providing weak secrecy, thereby demonstrating schemes that are optimal in terms of both parameters. It is shown how to modify the proposed protocols in order to construct schemes with balanced storage load and communication complexity.},

  abstract     = {Block-fading channel (BF) is a useful model for various wireless communication channels in both indoor and outdoor environments. Frequency-hopping schemes and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can conveniently be modelled as BF channels. Applying lattices in this type of channel entails dividing a lattice point into multiple blocks such that fading is constant within a block but changes, independently, across blocks. The design of lattices for BF channels offers a challenging problem, which differs greatly from its counterparts like AWGN channels. Recently, the original binary Construction A for lattices, due to Forney, has been generalized to a lattice construction from totally real and complex multiplication (CM) fields. This generalized algebraic Construction A of lattices provides signal space diversity, intrinsically, which is the main requirement for the signal sets designed for fading channels. In this paper, we construct full-diversity algebraic lattices for BF channels using Construction A over totally real number fields. We propose two new decoding methods for these family of lattices which have complexity that grows linearly in the dimension of the lattice. The first decoder is proposed for full-diversity algebraic LDPC lattices which are generalized Construction A lattices with a binary LDPC code as underlying code. This decoding method contains iterative and non-iterative phases. In order to implement the iterative phase of our decoding algorithm, we propose the definition of a parity-check matrix and Tanner graph for full-diversity algebraic Construction A lattices. We also prove that using an underlying LDPC code that achieves the outage probability limit over one-block-fading channel, the constructed algebraic LDPC lattices together with the proposed decoding method admit diversity order $n$ over an $n$ -block-fading channel. Then, we modify the proposed algorithm by removing its iterative phase which enables full-diversity practical decoding of all generalized Construction A lattices without any assumption about their underlying code. In contrast with the known results on AWGN channels in which non-binary Construction A lattices always outperform the binary ones, we provide some instances showing that algebraic Construction A lattices obtained from binary codes outperform the ones based on non-binary codes in block fading channels. Since available lattice construction methods from totally real and complex multiplication (CM) fields do not provide diversity in the binary case, we generalize algebraic Construction A lattices over a wider family of number fields namely monogenic number fields.},

  abstract     = {Low degree Reed-Muller codes are known to satisfy local decoding properties which find applications in private information retrieval (PIR) protocols, for instance. However, their practical instantiation encounters a first barrier due to their poor information rate in the low degree regime. This lead the community to design codes with similar local properties but larger dimension, namely the lifted Reed-Solomon codes. However, a second practical barrier appears when one requires that the PIR protocol resists collusion of servers. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by considering weighted Reed-Muller codes. We prove that such codes allow us to build PIR protocols with optimal computation complexity and resisting to a small number of colluding servers. In order to improve the dimension of the codes, we then introduce an analogue of the lifting process for weighted degrees. With a careful analysis of their degree sets, we notably show that the weighted lifting of Reed-Solomon codes produces families of codes with remarkable asymptotic parameters.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a secure one-helper distributed source coding system, with action-dependent side information. Specifically, the main encoder observes an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) source X n and wishes to compress this source to the decoder. The helper compresses the correlated source Y n to the decoder. The eavesdropper, having access to the information bits sent by the main encoder, can observe side information Z n as well. Besides, side information Z n and correlated source Y n can be influenced by a cost-constrained action sequence taken by the decoder. This class of problems can be seen as an nontrivial extension of the secure one-helper source coding with additional cost-constrained actions. The purpose of this article is to study the impact of the helper on achievable rate-distortion-cost-leakage. An inner bound of the achievable rate-distortion-cost-leakage is provided for the discrete memoryless setting. This inner bound is further shown to be tight when Y n is required to be reconstructed losslessly, and equivalent to the inner bound of Villard et al. when there is no action taken at the decoder. Numerical examples on binary symmetric sources are also discussed in this article.},

As consequences, we give new capacity bounds for additive noise channels with symmetric log-concave noises, as well as for timing channels involving positive signal and noise where the noise has a decreasing log-concave density. In particular, we show that the capacity of an additive noise channel with symmetric, log-concave noise under an average power constraint is at most 0.254 bits per channel use greater than the capacity of an additive Gaussian noise channel with the same noise power. Consequences for reverse entropy power inequalities and connections to the slicing problem in convex geometry are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {A novel type of functions called biregular irreducible functions is introduced and applied as security components (instead of, e.g., universal hash functions) in seeded modular wiretap coding schemes, whose second component is an error-correcting code. These schemes are called modular BRI schemes. An upper bound on the semantic security information leakage of modular BRI schemes in a one-shot setting is derived which separates the effects of the biregular irreducible function on the one hand and the error-correcting code plus the channel on the other hand. The effect of the biregular irreducible function is described by the second-largest eigenvalue of an associated stochastic matrix. A characterization of biregular irreducible functions is given in terms of connected edge-disjoint biregular graphs. It allows for the construction of new biregular irreducible functions from families of edge-disjoint Ramanujan graphs, which are shown to exist. A concrete and frequently used arithmetic universal hash function can be converted into a biregular irreducible function for certain parameters. Sequences of Ramanujan biregular irreducible functions are constructed which exhibit an optimal trade-off between the size of the regularity set and the rate of decrease of the associated second-largest eigenvalue. Together with the one-shot bound on the information leakage, the existence of these sequences implies an asymptotic coding result for modular BRI schemes applied to discrete and Gaussian wiretap channels. It shows that the separation of error correction and security as done in a modular BRI scheme is secrecy capacity-achieving for every discrete and Gaussian wiretap channel. The same holds for a derived construction where the seed is generated locally by the sender and reused several times. It is shown that the optimal sequences of biregular irreducible functions used in the above constructions must be nearly Ramanujan.},

  abstract     = {We study the role of coded side information in single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR). An instance of the single-server PIR problem includes a server that stores a database of K independently and uniformly distributed messages, and a user who wants to retrieve one of these messages from the server. We consider settings in which the user initially has access to a coded side information which includes a linear combination of a subset of M messages in the database. We assume that the identities of the M messages that form the support set of the coded side information as well as the coding coefficients are initially unknown to the server. We consider two different models, depending on whether the support set of the coded side information includes the requested message or not. We also consider the following two privacy requirements: (i) the identities of both the demand and the support set of the coded side information need to be protected, or (ii) only the identity of the demand needs to be protected. For each model and for each of the privacy requirements, we consider the problem of designing a protocol for generating the user&#39;s query and the server&#39;s answer that enables the user to decode the message they need while satisfying the privacy requirement. We characterize the (scalar-linear) capacity of each setting, defined as the ratio of the number of information bits in a message to the minimum number of information bits downloaded from the server over all (scalar-linear) protocols that satisfy the privacy condition. Our converse proofs rely on new information-theoretic arguments-tailored to the setting of single-server PIR and different from the commonly-used techniques in multi-server PIR settings. We also present novel capacity-achieving scalar-linear protocols for each of the settings being considered.},

For the Hamming-distance similarity measure, and when guaranteed perfect reconstruction is required, we present two contributions to the solution of this problem. One result shows that when a set of potential reference vectors is available to the encoder, lower compression rates can be achieved when the set satisfies a certain clustering property. Another result reduces the best known decoding complexity from exponential in the vector length $n$ to $O(n^{1.5})$ by generalized concatenation of inner coset codes and outer error-correcting codes.
