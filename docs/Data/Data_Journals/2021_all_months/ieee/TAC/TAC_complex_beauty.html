The eigenvalues of the network model are classified into the following two groups based on the subsystem structure:network-invariant modes, which have very high multiplicity regardless of the network’s topology; and special-repeat modes, which have bounded multiplicity. In this article, we demonstrate that models with network-invariant modes are uncontrollable unless a sufficient fraction of the subsystems are actuated in any weakly connected partition, subject to a diagonalizability condition on the network matrix. Meanwhile, the controllability reduces to a purely graph-theoretic condition when the network model has only special-repeat modes. This characterization also differentiates the controllability of built networks with fixed interconnections from multiagent systems with designable protocols.},

  abstract     = {Due to the nonsymmetric property of the associated Laplacian matrix and the existence of uncertainties in the agent dynamics, the leaderless consensus problem of uncertain multiagent systems under general directed graphs is challenging. Motivated by the classical model reference adaptive control, in this article, we propose a simple yet efficient scheme, called the model reference adaptive consensus, by arranging each agent a reference output to track, where the output is generated by a linear reference model with the relative state measurements as input. We consider two typical agent dynamics, namely, the general linear dynamics with matching uncertainties and the second-order dynamics with extended matching uncertainties. Different linear reference models are designed for the above uncertain agent dynamics. For the first one, dynamical consensus is achieved under a fixed directed graph containing a directed spanning tree. For the latter one, position consensus is achieved under switching uniformly jointly connected graphs. In the proposed algorithms, only the relative states are interacted among the agents and there is no requirement on the communication of virtual signals.},

We design a new algorithm, binary online gradient descent ( bOGD ) and bound its expected dynamic regret. We provide a regret bound that holds for any time horizon and a specialized bound for finite time horizons. First, we present the regret as the sum of the relaxed, continuous round optimum tracking error, and the rounding error of our update in which the former asymptomatically decreases with time under certain conditions. Then, we derive a finite-time bound that is sublinear in time and linear in the cumulative variation of the relaxed, continuous round optima. We apply bOGD to demand response with thermostatically controlled loads, in which binary constraints model discrete on/off settings. We also model uncertainty and varying load availability, which depend on temperature deadbands, lockout of cooling units and manual overrides. We test the performance of bOGD in several simulations based on demand response. The simulations corroborate that the use of randomization in bOGD does not significantly degrade performance while making the problem more tractable.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new class of nonsmooth extremum seeking controllers (ESCs) with convergence bounds given by class- $\mathcal {K}\mathcal {L}$ functions that have a uniformly bounded settling time. These ESCs are characterized by nominal average systems that render uniformly globally fixed-time stable (UGFxTS), the set of minimizers of the response map of a stable nonlinear plant. Given that, under suitable tuning of the parameters of the controllers, the ESCs inherit the convergence properties of their average systems, the proposed dynamics can achieve a better transient performance compared to the traditional ESCs based on gradient descent or Newton flows. Moreover, for the case when the plant is a static map, the convergence time of the proposed algorithms can be prescribed a priori by the users for all initial conditions without the need of retuning the gain of the learning dynamics of the ESC. Since autonomous feedback controllers with fixed-time convergence properties are necessarily non-Lipschitz continuous, standard averaging and singular perturbation tools, traditionally used in ESC, are not applicable anymore. We address this issue by using averaging and singular perturbation tools for nonsmooth and set-valued systems, which further allows us to consider ESCs modeled by discontinuous vector fields that are typical in fixed-time and finite-time optimization problems.},

While several efficient algorithms with provable optimality bounds have been developed for maximizing a single submodular function, the more computationally challenging problem of maximizing the minimum of a set of submodular functions (robust submodular maximization) has received less research attention. In this article, we investigate robust submodular maximization when the objective functions are correlated, i.e., the marginal benefits of adding elements to each function are within a given ratio of each other. We propose two modified greedy algorithms that exploit our defined correlation ratio to achieve the provable optimality bounds under matroid and cardinality constraints. As a case study, we consider minimization of graph effective resistance, and derive bounds on the correlation ratio using the graph spectrum. Our results are evaluated through numerical study.},

We then introduce the concept of the generalized complement graph , and obtain another condition on the node strength by using the incremental $\infty$ -norm. Under these two conditions, regions of attraction for partial phase cohesiveness are estimated in the forms of the incremental two- and $\infty$ -norms, respectively. Our result based on the incremental $\infty$ -norm is the first known criterion that applies to noncomplete graphs. Numerical simulations are performed on a two-level network to illustrate our theoretical results; more importantly, we use real anatomical brain network data to show how our results may contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between anatomical structure and empirical patterns of synchrony.},

  abstract     = {In actual network transmission, data loss due to network congestion and power shortage is unavoidable. However, this phenomenon has not been considered in Boolean networks (BNs) analysis so far. The loss of data is usually random, so BNs with missing data are modeled by introducing Bernoulli distribution sequences. A novel augmented system is constructed to deal with the randomly missing data. The initial states of the BNs are supposed to be chosen from the whole space or only part of it, which leads to the global and local stable problems. Some necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for both problems. Two algorithms are developed to check the asymptotic stability of BNs. An illustrative example is also given to show the effectiveness of the derived results.},

This quantizer is based on spherical polar coordinates and has a desired relation between the quantized vector and the corresponding quantization error. Utilizing the proposed quantizer with infinite data rate, the quadratic stabilization problems of linear systems via state feedback under quantization can be converted, respectively, to the same problems of the corresponding robust control systems with sector bound uncertainties. From a practical point of view, we are more concerned with quantized feedback control with finite data rate, so a quantizer with finite data rate is proposed for the abovementioned problems. Different from the quantizer with infinite data rate, a time-varying bounded quantization region needs to be determined to contain the quantized vector as the system evolves. Under this circumstance, the vector needed to be quantized cannot be quantized directly, so we give a quantization method to solve this problem.},

A system property required for exactness is normality. In the absence of normality, control set approximations and system dynamic perturbations are introduced so that normality holds. The results hold for linear dynamical systems and nonlinear systems affine in the control. It is shown that the convex relaxations enable the efficient solution of problems in aerospace engineering, sparsity-promoting optimization, overactuated systems, and multiplexing systems.

  abstract     = {This article presents a problem on model uncertainties in stochastic control, in which an agent assumes a best case scenario on one risk and at the same time a worst case scenario on another risk. Particularly, the agent maximizes its view on a Brownian motion, simultaneously minimizing its view on another Brownian motion in choice of a probability measure. This selection method of a probability measure generalizes an approach to model uncertainties in which one considers the worst case scenarios for the views on Brownian motions, such as in the robust control. Specifically, we newly formulate and solve this problem based on a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) approach as a sup-inf (resp., inf-sup) optimal control problem on choice of a probability measure with the control domains dependent on stochastic processes. Concretely, we show that under certain conditions, the sup-inf and inf-sup problems are equivalent and these are solved by finding a solution of a BSDE with a stochastic Lipschitz driver. Then, we investigate two cases in which the optimal probability measure is explicitly obtained. The expression of the optimal probability measure includes signs of the diffusion terms of the value process, which are hard to determine in general. In these cases, we show two methods of determining the signs:the first one is by comparison theorems, and the second one is to predetermine the signs a priori and confirm them afterward by explicitly solving the corresponding equations.},

We consider a set of populations, each managed by a population coordinator (PC), of selfish agents playing a global noncooperative game, whose cost functions are affected by an aggregate term across all agents from all populations. In particular, we impose that the agents cannot exchange information between themselves directly; instead, only a PC can gather information on its own population and exchange local aggregate information with the neighboring PCs. To seek an equilibrium of the resulting (partial-information) game, we propose an iterative algorithm where each PC broadcasts a mean-field signal, namely, an estimate of the overall aggregative term, to its own population only. In turn, we let the local agents react with the best response and the PCs cooperate for estimating the aggregative term. Our main technical contributions are to cast the proposed scheme as a fixed-point iteration with errors, namely, the interconnection of a Krasnoselskij–Mann iteration and a linear consensus protocol, and, under a nonexpansiveness condition, to show convergence towards an $\varepsilon$ -Nash equilibrium, where $\varepsilon$ is inversely proportional to the population size.},

We first design a switch on/off boundary control and show that the diffusion coefficient can be uniquely determined by the boundary observation.

In this article, similar impossibility results are obtained for the scenarios where the control input is probabilistically constrained and the support of the noise distribution is not necessarily unbounded. In particular, control policies that have bounded time-averaged second moments are considered. It is shown that for such control policies, there are critical average moment bounds, below which second moment stabilization of a linear stochastic system is not possible, and moreover, second moment of the state diverges regardless of the choice of control policy and the initial state distribution. Nonnegative-definite Hermitian matrices are exploited to extract sufficient instability conditions that can be assessed by using the eigenstructure of the system matrix and the distribution of the noise. The results indicate that in certain networked control system settings with noise, designing stabilizing constrained controllers is an impossible task, if the probability of successful transmissions of control commands over the network is known to be too small in average.},

A local dynamic linearization is proposed to transfer the original nonaffined nonlinear system into a nonlinear system affine to control input such that the open problem of selecting a control gain in the feedback control law of ADRC is solved. Furthermore, both a parameter updating law and an adaptive extended state observer are designed to estimate control gains and total uncertainty, respectively. The stability of ADRC for nonlinear nonaffine discrete-time processes is analyzed rigorously for the first time with the aid of contraction mapping principle. The proposed adaptive feedback controller considers desired reference trajectory, parameter adaption, error feedback, and the compensation of total uncertainties caused by parameter estimation error and unknown nonlinearity simultaneously to achieve better control performance. The proposed method is nearly data driven since no other model information is needed except for the globally Lipschitz condition and the nonzero property of the partial derivative of the nonlinear system with respect to the control input.

We achieve the same by extending the lock-in probability (i.e., the probability of convergence of the iterates to a specific attractor of the limiting ordinary differential equation (o.d.e.) given that the iterates are in its domain of attraction after a sufficiently large number of iterations (say) $n_0$ ) framework to such recursions. Specifically, with the more restrictive assumption of Markov iterate-dependent noise supported on a bounded subset of the Euclidean space, we give a lower bound for the lock-in probability . We use these results to prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to the specified attractor when the iterates satisfy an asymptotic tightness condition. The novelty of our approach is that if the state space of the Markov process is compact, we prove almost sure convergence under much weaker assumptions compared to the work by Andrieu et al. , which solves the general state-space case under much restrictive assumptions by providing sufficient conditions for stability of the iterates. We also extend our single-timescale results to the case where there are two separate recursions over two different timescales. This, in turn, is shown to be useful in analyzing the tracking ability of general adaptive algorithms. Additionally, we show that our results can be used to derive a sample complexity estimate of such recursions, which then can be used for step-size selection.},

In this article, we address this problem by providing a finite-sample analysis for decentralized batch MARL. Specifically, we consider a type of mixed MARL setting with both cooperative and competitive agents, where two teams of agents compete in a zero-sum game setting, while the agents within each team collaborate by communicating over a time-varying network. This setting covers many conventional MARL settings in the literature. We then develop batch MARL algorithms that can be implemented in a decentralized fashion, and quantify the finite-sample errors of the estimated action-value functions. Our error analysis captures how the function class, the number of samples within each iteration, and the number of iterations determine the statistical accuracy of the proposed algorithms. Our results, compared to the finite-sample bounds for single-agent reinforcement learning, involve additional error terms caused by decentralized computation, which is inherent in our decentralized MARL setting. This article provides the first finite-sample analysis for batch MARL, a step toward rigorous theoretical understanding of general MARL algorithms in the finite-sample regime.},

The proposed approach explicitly considers more than two time scales, it does not require modeling multiple time scales via scalar time constants, and provides analytic bounds that make ad-hoc time-scale separation arguments rigorous. Motivated by the technical results, we develop a novel control strategy for a grid-forming power converter that consists of an inner cascaded two-degree-of-freedom controller and dispatchable virtual oscillator control as a reference model. The resulting closed-loop converter-based ac power system is in the form of a nested system with multiple time scales. We apply our technical results to obtain explicit bounds on the controller set points, branch powers, and control gains that guarantee almost global asymptotic stability of the multiconverter ac power system with respect to a prespecified solution of the ac power flow equations. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed control structure in a case study using a high-fidelity simulation with detailed hardware validated converter models.},

How should a fusion center dynamically incentivize the social sensors for acquiring information about the underlying state ? This article presents five results. First, sufficient conditions on the model parameters are provided, under which the optimal policy for the fusion center has a threshold structure. The optimal policy is determined in a closed form, and is such that it switches between two exactly specified incentive policies at the threshold. Second, it is shown that the optimal incentive sequence is a submartingale , i.e., the optimal incentives increase on average over time. Third, it is shown that it is possible for the fusion center to learn the true state asymptotically by employing a suboptimal policy; in other words, controlled information fusion with social sensors can be consistent. Fourth, uniform bounds on the average additional cost incurred by the fusion center for employing a suboptimal policy are provided. This characterizes the tradeoff between the cost of information acquisition and consistency for the fusion center. Finally, uniform bounds on the budget saved by employing policies that guarantee state estimation in finite time are provided.},

We show that PQIs arise naturally from passivity-shortage characteristics of an EIPS system, and the set of their solutions can be explicitly expressed. We leverage this connection to build an input–output mapping that transforms the steady-state input–output relation to a monotone relation, and show that the same mapping passivizes the EIPS system. We show that the proposed transformation can be implemented through a combination of feedback, feedthrough, post- and premultiplication gains. Furthermore, we consider an application of the presented passivation scheme for the analysis of networks comprised of EIPS systems.

We propose FaSTrack, Fast and Safe Tracking, a framework that achieves both real-time replanning and guaranteed safety. In this framework, real-time computation is achieved by allowing any trajectory planner to use a simplified planning model of the system. The plan is tracked by the system, represented by a more realistic, higher dimensional tracking model . We precompute the tracking error bound (TEB) due to mismatch between the two models and due to external disturbances. We also obtain the corresponding tracking controller used to stay within the TEB. The precomputation does not require prior knowledge of the environment.

As no computationally efficient methods are known to solve such combinatorial set function optimization problems, two greedy algorithms, forward and reverse, are proposed to obtain approximate solutions. We first show that the constraint sets these algorithms explore can be characterized by matroids. We then obtain performance guarantees for the forward and reverse greedy algorithms applied to the general class of matroid optimization problems by exploiting properties of the objective function such as the submodularity ratio and the curvature. Finally, we propose feasibility check methods for both algorithms based on maximum flow problems on certain auxiliary graphs originating from the network graph.

When a path is planned to accomplish a mission, it is possible for a robot to fail to complete the mission or collide with obstacles due to noises and disturbances in the system. Hence, we need to find a robust path against possible disturbances. We introduce a robust path planning algorithm, which maximizes the probability of success in accomplishing a given mission by considering disturbances, while minimizing the moving distance of a robot. The proposed method can guarantee the safety of the planned trajectory by incorporating an LTL formula and chance constraints in a hierarchical manner. A high-level planner generates a discrete plan satisfying the mission requirements specified in LTL. A low-level planner builds a sampling-based rapidly exploring random tree search tree to minimize both the mission failure probability and the moving distance while guaranteeing the probability of collision with obstacles to be below a specified threshold.

  abstract     = {Opacity is a security notion that focuses on determining whether a given system&#39;s behavior is kept secret to intruders. Various notions of opacity have received significant attention during the last decade including current state opacity and initial state opacity, which have been studied for deterministic and probabilistic systems in untimed contexts. In timed systems, opacity requirements may vary with time and one could also be interested in knowing the time duration for which opacity requirements are violated or preserved. The main contribution of this article is to introduce and analyze opacity exposure and opacity revelation times as measures of vulnerability in timed discrete event system (DES) that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., at any given time, all enabled events are independent and distributed in time with exponential probability density functions). Labeled stochastic Petri nets (LSPNs) are used to model timed stochastic DESs, and appropriate constructions (involving current and initial state observers) are used to evaluate exposure and revelation times for a given LSPN.},

  abstract     = {Network reconstruction of dynamical continuous-time (CT) systems is motivated by applications in many fields. Due to experimental limitations, especially in biology, data can be sampled at low frequencies, leading to significant challenges in network inference. We introduce the concept of “system aliasing” and characterize the minimal sampling frequency that allows reconstruction of CT systems from low sampled data. A test criterion is also proposed to detect the presence of system aliasing. With no system aliasing, this article provides an algorithm to reconstruct dynamic networks from full-state measurements in the presence of noise. With system aliasing, we add additional prior information such as sparsity to overcome the lack of identifiability. This article opens new directions in modeling of network systems where samples have significant costs. Such tools are essential to process available data in applications subject to experimental limitations.},

We investigate the effectiveness of a taxation mechanism in controlling the utilization of the resource at the Nash equilibrium when the decision-makers have behavioral risk preferences, captured by prospect theory . We first observe that heterogeneous prospect-theoretic risk preferences can lead to counter-intuitive outcomes. In particular, for resources that exhibit network effects, utilization can increase under taxation and there may not exist a tax rate that achieves the socially optimal level of utilization. We identify conditions under which utilization is monotone and continuous, and then characterize the range of utilizations that can be achieved by a suitable choice of tax rate. We further show that resource utilization is higher when players are charged differentiated tax rates compared to the case when all players are charged an identical tax rate, under suitable assumptions.},

  abstract     = {We present mean-nonovershooting tracking control designs for stochastic strict-feedback nonlinear systems. Compared with the existing stochastic nonlinear tracking designs, the advantage of our design is that arbitrary reference trajectories can be tracked “from below.” We first consider a special class of stochastic nonlinear systems where the diffusion terms satisfy the linear growth condition and the drift terms are in special triangular forms. A new controller is designed to guarantee that the mean of the system output can asymptotically track a given trajectory without overshooting while keeping all of the states mean-square bounded. In this case, an appealing feature in our design is that strict mean-nonovershooting tracking is achieved while the existing results on nonlinear systems with deterministic disturbance can only achieve practical nonovershooting tracking. Then, we design a new controller for general stochastic strict-feedback nonlinear systems to ensure that the mean of overshoot can be tuned to be arbitrarily small while all the states of the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability. In this case, the new design ingredient is that our control gains are independent of the initial conditions of system states, and the initial conditions of derivatives of the reference trajectory. This is in contrast with the existing results on corresponding deterministic systems whose control gains heavily rely on these initial conditions. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the stochastic nonlinear nonovershooting tracking designs.},

  abstract     = {In the traditional game-theoretic set up, where agents select actions and experience corresponding utilities, a Nash equilibrium is a configuration where no agent can improve their utility by unilaterally switching to a different action. In this article, we introduce the novel notion of inertial Nash equilibrium to account for the fact that in many practical situations switching action does not come for free. Specifically, we consider a population game and introduce the coefficients $c_{ij}$ describing the cost an agent incurs by switching from action $i$ to action $j$ . We define an inertial Nash equilibrium as a distribution over the action space where no agent benefits in switching to a different action, while taking into account the cost of such switch. First, we show that the set of inertial Nash equilibria contains all the Nash equilibria, is in general nonconvex, and can be characterized as a solution to a variational inequality. We then argue that classical algorithms for computing Nash equilibria cannot be used in the presence of switching costs. Finally, we propose a better-response dynamics algorithm and prove its convergence to an inertial Nash equilibrium. We apply our results to study the taxi drivers’ distribution in Hong Kong.},

Because of external cyber-attacks, some agents are assumed to be malicious and not following a desired cooperative behavior. Thus, the objective consists in designing a control strategy for the healthy agents to reach consensus upon their state vectors, whereas due to interaction among the agents, the malicious agents try to prevent them to achieve consensus. Although this problem has been investigated by some researchers, under the existing approaches in the literature, achieving consensus is only guaranteed when the information exchange among the agents is deterministic. Based on this motivation, the main contribution of this article is on almost sure resilient consensus control of a network of healthy agents in the presence of stochastic links failure and communication noises. We design a discrete-time protocol for the set of the healthy agents, and we show that under some probabilistic conditions on interaction among the agents, achieving almost sure consensus among the healthy agents can be guaranteed.

A time-varying entrapping formation with a prescribed shape, which is elastic and rotational with respect to the target is adopted. Such a formation allows agents to move even in restricted areas while still entrapping the target as a whole. To achieve the entrapping formation based on bearing measurements, a leader-follower structure is adopted, and a design framework integrating formation shape observers, relative position estimators, and distributed controllers is proposed. The rigorous stability analysis of the overall system is also given. It is shown that the stability of the closed loop system is guaranteed if its bearing observability is satisfied. Since the desired formation is determined by the trajectories of the leaders, we characterize the sufficient conditions on the trajectories of the leaders such that the bearing observability of the closed loop system is always satisfied, and the estimation errors and the formation tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

We prove the data rate theorem, which shows that the invariance entropy is a tight lower bound of the data rate of any coder controller that achieves invariance in the closed loop. We analyze uncertain linear control systems and derive a universal lower bound of the invariance feedback entropy. The lower bound depends on the absolute value of the determinant of the system matrix and a ratio involving the volume of the invariant set and the set of uncertainties. Furthermore, we derive a lower bound of the data rate of any static, memoryless coder controller. Both lower bounds are intimately related and for certain cases it is possible to bound the performance loss due to the restriction to static coder controllers by 1 bit/time unit.

The interaction of the agent (defender) with the adversary is modeled as a partially observable stochastic game. The goal is to generate a defender policy to maximize satisfaction of a given temporal logic specification under any adversary policy. The search for policies is limited to the space of finite-state controllers, which leads to a tractable approach to determine policies. We relate the satisfaction of the specification to reaching (a subset of) recurrent states of a Markov chain. We present an algorithm to determine a set of defender and adversary finite-state controllers of fixed sizes that will satisfy the temporal logic specification and prove that it is sound. We then propose a value-iteration algorithm to maximize the probability of satisfying the temporal logic specification under finite-state controllers of fixed sizes. Finally, we extend this setting to the scenario where the size of the finite-state controller of the defender can be increased to improve the satisfaction probability.

Unlike previously proposed distributed algorithms that required bidirectional communication between pairs of nodes that share an edge in the flow network, the algorithm we propose can operate over any communication network, assuming the corresponding digraph that describes it is strongly connected. The proposed algorithm allows the nodes to asymptotically compute (with a geometric rate that depends on the specifics of the given flow network and communication topology) a solution to the feasible circulation problem, as long as such a solution exists.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of cooperative adaptive containment control for multiagent systems, which specifies the objective of jointly achieving containment control and accurate adaptive learning/identification of unknown system parameters. We consider a class of linear uncertain multiagent systems with multiple leaders subject to bounded unmeasurable inputs and multiple followers subject to unknown system dynamics. A novel cooperative adaptive containment control architecture is proposed, which consists of a discontinuous nonlinear state-feedback control law and a filter-based cooperative adaptation law. This new control architecture is compelling in the sense that exponential convergence of both containment tracking errors to zero and adaptation parameters to their true values can be achieved simultaneously under a mild cooperative finite-time excitation condition. This condition significantly relaxes existing ones (e.g., persistent excitation and finite-time excitation) for parameter identification in adaptive control systems. Effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated through both rigorous analysis and a case study.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel method for the global stochastic stability analysis of aperiodic sampled-data Boolean control networks (BCNs) is introduced. In our article, the sampling instants of aperiodic sampled-data control (ASDC) are uncertain and only the activation frequencies of the sampling interval are known. Using the semitensor product of matrices, a BCN under ASDC can be transformed into a Boolean network (BN) with stochastic delays. Specifically, the ASDC is represented as a delayed control. Here, the time-varying delay is a random variable generated by a Markov chain and its transition probability matrix can be obtained by the activation frequencies of the sampling interval. Notably, the value of the time-varying delay is less than the upper bound of the sampling interval and when its present value is given, there are only two possible values that can be taken at the next moment. Subsequently, by using the Lyapunov function and augmented method, a sufficient condition for the global stochastic stability of BCNs under ASDC is provided. In particular, the aforementioned results are applicable to the sampled-data control with constant sampling interval. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate our results.},

The event-triggering conditions only rely on the states of virtual systems and allow agents to transmit virtual states only at some discrete time instants. Under the proposed strategy, the control objective can be accomplished with lower communication and measurement costs. Second, we consider the time delay effects in each information channel with event-triggered communication. For the proposed event-triggered scheme, the Zeno triggering is excluded.

  abstract     = {In this article, a distributed constrained optimization problem is studied with nonconvex input constraints, nonuniform convex state constraints, and nonuniform step sizes for single-integrator multiagent systems. Due to the existence of nonconvex input constraints, the edge weights between agents are equivalently multiplied with different time-varying scaling factors, and thus, the real interaction relationship cannot be kept balanced, even if the original communication graphs are kept balanced. Due to the existence of nonuniform convex state constraints and nonuniform step sizes, the system contains strong nonlinearities, which are coupled with the unbalance of the real interaction relationship, making existing analysis approaches hard to apply in this article. The main idea of the analysis approach is to fully explore the angles between the vectors from the agent states to their own projections on the intersection set of the convex state constraint sets so as to show that the distances from the agents to the intersection set diminish to zero as time evolves. By combining the analysis approaches in this article and our previous works, all agents are proved to converge to a common point and simultaneously solve the given optimization problem as long as the union of the communication graphs is strongly connected and balanced among each time interval of certain length. Numerical examples are given to show the obtained theoretical results.},

It is shown that a set of stabilizing decentralized controller gains for the uncertain system is parameterized in a convex set through appropriate convex restriction, and then an approximated conic optimization problem is constructed. This facilitates the use of the symmetric Gauss–Seidel (sGS) semi-proximal augmented Lagrangian method (ALM), which attains high computational effectiveness.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with practical stabilization of nonlinear systems by means of inf-convolution-based sample-and-hold control. It is a fairly general stabilization technique based on a generic nonsmooth control Lyapunov function (CLF) and robust to actuator uncertainty, measurement noise, etc. The stabilization technique itself involves computation of descent directions of the CLF. It turns out that nonexact realization of this computation leads not just to a quantitative, but also qualitative obstruction in the sense that the result of the computation might fail to be a descent direction altogether and there is also no straightforward way to relate it to a descent direction. Disturbance, primarily measurement noise, complicate the described issue even more. This article suggests a modified inf-convolution-based control that is robust w.r.t system and measurement noise, as well as computational uncertainty. The assumptions on the CLF are mild, as, e.g., any piece-wise smooth function, which often results from a numerical LF/CLF construction, satisfies them. A computational study with a three-wheel robot with dynamical steering and throttle under various tolerances w. r. t. computational uncertainty demonstrates the relevance of the addressed issue and the necessity of modifying the used stabilization technique. Similar analyses may be extended to other methods which involve optimization, such as Dini aiming or steepest descent.},

We formulate the scheduling problem as a dynamic program so as to minimize the expected total cost, the sum of processing costs, and the noncompletion penalty (incurred when a task is not fully processed by its deadline). Under mild assumptions, we characterize an optimal index-based priority rule: Tasks with less laxity should be processed first, and for two tasks with the same laxity, the task with a later deadline has the priority. Based on the established optimal control policy characterizations (on resource allocation among multitasks and storage operation), we propose to apply data-driven reinforcement learning (RL) methods to make energy procurement decisions. Numerical results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing RL methods combined with the earliest deadline first priority rule (by reducing 26\%–32\% of system cost).},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of controlling discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with parametric uncertainties in the presence of hard state and input constraints. A suitably designed gradient-descent-based indirect adaptive controller, used to handle parametric uncertainties, is combined with a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm, which guarantees constraint satisfaction. An estimated model of the actual uncertain plant is used for predictions of the future states. The parameters of the estimated model are updated using a gradient-descent-based adaptive update law. The errors arising due to the model mismatch between the estimated plant model and the actual uncertain plant are accounted for using a constraint tightening method in the MPC algorithm. The proposed adaptive MPC strategy is proved to be recursively feasible and the closed-loop system is proved to be bounded at all instants and asymptotically converging to the origin.},

The approximation is analytical, meaning that it requires neither numerical integrations nor sampling-based probability approximations. Under mild assumptions, the approximation is a standard nonlinear program. We compare this new safe approximation to another analytical safe approximation for joint chance-constrained programming based on Boole&#39;s inequality and to a scenario approach through two numerical examples representing the constrained control of linear Gauss–Markov models.

The system that we consider is assumed to possess a globally defined normal form, in which appropriate invertibility conditions are fulfilled, and to be strongly minimum phase. Asymptotic output regulation is achieved by means of a controller consisting of a preprocessing internal model and of a robust stabilizer. For the design of the latter, a recently developed method is proposed, consisting of interlaced design of dynamic extensions and extended observers that provides a robust version of standard stabilization methods based on feedback-linearization. The method does not presume the knowledge of an accurate model of the plant and only needs access to the regulated variables.},

Since it is proven that ERD is stable using the proposed definitions, ERD is able to confine trajectories of the state vector in regions defined by upper and lower boundaries which can be, but are not required to be, nonnegative. From an engineering application perspective, these proposed escort functions are convenient since they allow to extend replicatorlike dynamics applications to engineering problems with feasible regions more general than the standard simplex or the nonnegative orthant. From a population dynamics perspective the proposed escort functions are useful to represent upper and lower limits on the share of a population that is allowed to play a given pure strategy of the underlying symmetric game.},

However, in such an approach, the initial condition needs to be assumed absolutely continuous with a square integrable weak derivative.

  abstract     = {Modal participation factors are widely used in the power industry and other applied areas. Hashlamoun, Hassouneh, and Abed (2009) observed that the definition of state-in-mode participation factors (SIMPFs) commonly used in the modal analysis of linear systems could lead to inadequate results. Accordingly, they proposed an alternative definition of SIMPFs. This article uncovered a weakness in their formulation in that it yields results highly sensitive to varying eigenvector normalizations for complex eigenvalues. Thus, we present a modified well-defined formulation and interpretation of SIMPFs in this article. The proposed approach combines the framework of averaging over an uncertain set of initial conditions, introduced by Hashlamoun, Hassouneh, and Abed, with the novel concept of modal energy. Following this approach, an alternative definition for mode-in-state participation factors was discovered, which differs from the conventional definition. Simple examples are used to show that new definitions provide more accurate measures of state-in-mode and mode-in-state participations compared to conventional participation factors in the case of an arbitrary distribution of initial conditions over state variables.

We introduce the notion of an optimality model, and show that the existence of an optimality model is sufficient to reduce the OSS control problem to a stabilization problem. This yields a design framework for OSS control that unifies and extends existing design methods in the literature. We illustrate the approach via an application to optimal frequency control of power networks, where our methodology recovers centralized and distributed controllers reported in the recent literature.},

To deal with fast distributed learning of Nash equilibria under such settings, we introduce a so called augmented game mapping and provide conditions under which this mapping is strongly monotone. We consider a distributed gradient play algorithm for determining a Nash equilibrium (GRANE). The algorithm involves every player performing a gradient step to minimize her own cost function while sharing and retrieving information locally among her neighbors in the network. Using the reformulation of the Nash equilibrium problem based on the strong monotone augmented game mapping, we prove the convergence of this algorithm to a Nash equilibrium with a geometric rate. Furthermore, we introduce the Nesterov type acceleration for the gradient play algorithm. We demonstrate that, similarly to the accelerated algorithms in centralized optimization and variational inequality problems, our accelerated algorithm outperforms GRANE in the convergence rate. Moreover, to relax assumptions required to guarantee the strongly monotone augmented mapping, we analyze the restricted strongly monotone property of this mapping and prove geometric convergence of the distributed gradient play under milder assumptions.},

A supervisor enforcing a set of GMECs and deadlock-freeness on an underlying untimed Petri net system is assumed to be available. By exploiting timing information and mathematical programming, a control function is designed to restrict the firing intervals of transitions such that a TPN system can avoid entering forbidden states. The key idea behind the proposed approach is the online computation of a graph, called reduced modified state class graph (RMSCG), that is an extension of the partial modified state class graph recently introduced by the authors. Based on the RMSCG, an online control synthesis procedure is developed, which can enforce the originally given GMECs and deadlock-freeness in a maximally permissive way.},

These results assumed that data are perfectly measured. However, real-world data are subject to many corruptions, such as inaccurate time-stamps, noise, and data loss. We show that identifying the structure of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using corrupt measurements results in the inference of erroneous links. We provide an exact characterization and prove that such erroneous links are restricted to the neighborhood of the perturbed node. We extend the analysis of LTI systems to the case of Markov random fields with corrupt measurements. We show that data corruption in Markov random fields results in spurious probabilistic relationships in precisely the locations, where spurious links arise in LTI systems.},

The first limitation regards the high conservativeness of deterministic detection thresholds, against which a novel family of set-based thresholds is proposed. Such set-based thresholds are defined in a way to guarantee robustness in a user-defined probabilistic sense, rather than a deterministic sense. They are obtained by solving a chance-constrained optimization problem, thanks to a randomization technique based on the Scenario Approach. The second limitation regards the requirement, in distributed anomaly detection architectures, for different parties to regularly communicate local measurements. In settings where these parties want to preserve their privacy, communication may be undesirable. In order to preserve privacy and still allow for distributed detection to be implemented, a novel privacy-preserving mechanism is proposed and a so-called privatized communication protocol is introduced. Theoretical guarantees on the achievable level of privacy, along with a characterization of the robustness properties of the proposed distributed threshold set design, taking into account the privatized communication scheme, are provided. Finally, simulation studies are included to illustrate our theoretical developments.},

In contrast with nearly all recent work in this area, we consider multiplicative noise models, which are increasingly relevant because they explicitly incorporate inherent uncertainty and variation in the system dynamics and thereby improve robustness properties of the controller. Robustness is a critical and poorly understood issue in reinforcement learning; existing methods which do not account for uncertainty can converge to fragile policies or fail to converge at all. Additionally, intentional injection of multiplicative noise into learning algorithms can enhance robustness of policies, as observed in ad hoc work on domain randomization. Although policy gradient algorithms require optimization of a nonconvex cost function, we show that the multiplicative noise LQR cost has a special property called gradient domination , which is exploited to prove global convergence of policy gradient algorithms to the globally optimum control policy with polynomial dependence on problem parameters. Results are provided both in the model-known and model-unknown settings where samples of system trajectories are used to estimate policy gradients},

It is motivated by the curious extent in which the use of LTL can be strengthened and differentiated in control theory development. Over a fair DES model, a marker-progressive supervisory control problem is formulated in LTL. The problem formulation admits a more flexible specification of multiple markers to distinguish different DES tasks, and seeks to find a supervisor—a passive control function by convention for specified temporal safety—such that a fair DES under its control is guaranteed to make constant progress to these markers. The problem is studied in terms of DES marker-controllability—a new controllability concept formulation of temporal safety for constant marker progress. This new formulation sheds light on how event fairness in DESs coachieves such marker progress with supervision that exists. It is shown that a solution supervisor may be found by canonical LTL verification. Three examples are provided for illustration.},

We present the framework in the context of two learning dynamics: Log-linear learning (LLL) and Metropolis learning (ML). Although both of these dynamics lead to the same steady-state behavior, they correspond to different behavioral models for decision making. In this article, we propose multiple criteria to analyze and quantify the differences in the short and medium-run behaviors of stochastic dynamics. We derive upper bounds on the expected hitting time of the set of Nash equilibria for both LLL and ML. For the medium to long-run behavior, we identify a set of tools from the theory of perturbed Markov chains that result in a hierarchical decomposition of the state space into collections of states called cycles. We compare LLL and ML based on the proposed criteria and develop invaluable insights into the behavior of the two dynamics.},

The conditions typically reflect the selection of a set of node signals that are taken as predictor inputs in an multiple-input-single-output (MISO) identification setup. In this paper an extension is made to arrive at an identification setup for the situation that process noises on the different node signals can be correlated with each other. In this situation the local module may need to be embedded in an multiple-input--multiple-output (MIMO) identification setup for arriving at a consistent estimate with maximum likelihood properties. This requires the proper treatment of confounding variables. The result is a set of algorithms that, based on the given network topology and disturbance correlation structure, selects an appropriate set of node signals as predictor inputs and outputs in an MISO or MIMO identification setup. Three algorithms are presented that differ in their approach of selecting measured node signals. Either a maximum or a minimum number of measured node signals can be considered, as well as a preselected set of measured nodes.},

This leads to an indefinite LQ mean field control problem, which may still be well-posed due to deep nature of multiplicative noise. We first obtain a set of forward–backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) from variational analysis, and construct a feedback control by decoupling the FBSDEs. By virtue of solutions to two Riccati equations, we design a set of decentralized control laws, which is further shown to be asymptotically social optimal. Some equivalent conditions are given for uniform stabilization of the systems with the help of linear matrix inequalities.

First, we derive a constrained version of the Youla parameterization that characterizes all retrofit controllers for a single subcontroller, defined as an add-on-type subcontroller that manages a subsystem. The resultant feedback system is kept robustly stable for any variation in the neighboring subsystems, other than the subsystem of interest, provided that the original system is stable prior to implementing the retrofit control. Subsequently, we find out a unique internal structure of the retrofit controllers, assuming that the interaction input signal from the neighboring subsystems is measurable. Furthermore, we show that the simultaneous implementation of multiple retrofit controllers, designed by individual subcontroller designers, can improve the upper bound of the overall control performance. Finally, the practical significance of the method is demonstrated via an illustrative example of frequency regulation using the IEEE 68-bus power system model.},

  abstract     = {Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a modeling framework for a variety of sequential decision making under uncertainty scenarios in artificial intelligence (AI). Since the states are not directly observable in a POMDP, decision making has to be performed based on the output of a Bayesian filter (continuous beliefs); hence, making POMDPs intractable to solve and analyze. To overcome the complexity challenge of POMDPs, we apply techniques from the control theory. Our contributions are fourfold. 1) We begin by casting the problem of analyzing a POMDP into analyzing the behavior of a discrete-time switched system. 2) Then, in order to estimate the reachable belief space of a POMDP, i.e., the set of all possible evolutions given an initial belief distribution over the states and a set of actions and observations, we find overapproximations in terms of sublevel sets of Lyapunov-like functions. 3) Furthermore, in order to verify safety and performance requirements of a given POMDP, we formulate a barrier certificate theorem, wherein we show that if there exists a barrier certificate satisfying a set of inequalities along the solutions to the belief update equation of the POMDP, the safety and performance properties are guaranteed to hold. In both cases 2) and 3), the calculations can be decomposed and solved in parallel. 4) Finally, we show that the conditions we formulate can be computationally implemented as a set of sum-of-squares programs. We illustrate the applicability of our method by addressing two problems in active ad scheduling and machine teaching.},

To escape such local optima, we propose a systematic approach based on the concept of boosting functions . The underlying idea is to temporarily transform the gradient at a local optimum into a boosted gradient with a nonzero magnitude. We develop a distributed boosting scheme based on a gradient-based optimization algorithm using a novel optimal variable step size mechanism so as to guarantee convergence. Even though our motivation is based on the coverage control problem setting, our analysis applies to a broad class of multiagent problems. Simulation results are provided to compare the performance of different boosting functions families and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the boosting function approach in attaining improved (still generally local) optima.},

  abstract     = {Robotic systems have been proposed as a solution to a wide array of problems, from autonomous warehousing to precision agriculture. Yet these systems typically require satisfaction of multiple constraints, such as collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance, while completing their primary objectives. Many such problems may be decomposed into stability and invariance criteria (e.g., monitor crop patches while avoiding collisions), and this article utilizes Lyapunov and barrier functions to encode stability and invariance, respectively. Barrier functions provide constraint-satisfaction guarantees, and prior results have established a Boolean composition and controller-synthesis framework for these objects via nonsmooth analysis. However, this past work has yet to address Boolean composition of Lyapunov functions directly and does not apply to all Boolean expressions. This article resolves these issues by providing a general method to encode Boolean expressions of Lyapunov or barrier functions. Moreover, this article develops an associated controller-synthesis algorithm that yields discontinuous yet validating controllers with respect to these Boolean expressions. Experimental results show the efficacy of this article in a precision-agriculture scenario, where a robot swarm must visit crop patches while avoiding collisions.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the recursive filtering problem is studied for a class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems subject to fading measurements. In order to facilitate the data transmission in a resource-constrained communication network, the multiple description coding scheme is adopted to encode the fading measurements into two descriptions with the identical importance. Two independent Bernoulli distributed random variables are introduced to govern the occurrences of the packet dropouts in two channels from the encoders to the decoders. The channel fading phenomenon is characterized by the $M$ th-order Rice fading model whose coefficients are mutually independent random variables obeying certain probability distributions. The purpose of the problem addressed is to design a recursive filter, such that in the simultaneous presence of the stochastic noises, the channel fading and the data coding–decoding mechanism, an upper bound of the filtering error variance is obtained and then minimized at each time step. In virtue of the Riccati difference equation technique and the stochastic analysis approach, the explicit form of the desired filter parameters is derived by solving a sequence of coupled algebraic Riccati-like difference equations. Finally, a simulation experiment is provided to show the applicability of the developed filtering scheme.},

The concept of weak observability reflects the information of the limiting behavior of state trajectories hidden in the zero locus of the output. In the context of switched NLTV systems, weak observability can be explored using the recently established framework of limiting zeroing-output solutions. Adding to this, a new approach to show uniform global attractivity of a closed set (without assuming uniform Lyapunov stability or dwell-time conditions) is proposed. A further extension of the generalized LaSalle invariance principle allows the consideration of cascaded switched NLTV systems, which is used to characterize how consensus in a leaderless swarm of nonholonomic robots allowing for switching communication topologies may be established.},

  abstract     = {This article presents scalable controller synthesis methods for heterogeneous and partially heterogeneous systems. First, heterogeneous systems composed of different subsystems that are interconnected over a directed graph are considered. Techniques from robust and gain-scheduled controller synthesis are employed, in particular, the full-block S-procedure, to deal with the decentralized system part in a nominal condition and with the interconnection part in a multiplier condition. Under some structural assumptions, we can decompose the synthesis conditions into conditions that are the size of the individual subsystems. To solve these decomposed synthesis conditions that are coupled only over neighboring subsystems, we propose a distributed method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It only requires nearest-neighbor communication and no central coordination is needed. Then, a new classification of systems is introduced that consists of groups of homogeneous subsystems with different interconnection types. This classification includes heterogeneous systems as the most general and homogeneous systems as the most specific case. Based on this classification, we show how the interconnected system model and the decomposed synthesis conditions can be formulated in a more compact way. The computational scalability of the presented methods with respect to a growing number of subsystems and interconnections is analyzed, and the results are demonstrated in numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to its versatility, its simplicity, and its fast convergence, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is among the most widely used approaches for solving a convex problem in distributed form. However, making it running efficiently is an art that requires a fine tuning of system parameters according to the specific application scenario, and which ultimately calls for a thorough understanding of the hidden mechanisms that control the convergence behavior. In this framework, we aim at providing new theoretical insights on the convergence process and specifically on some constituent matrices of ADMM whose eigenstructure provides a close link with the algorithm&#39;s convergence speed. One of the key techniques that we develop allows to effectively locate the eigenvalues of a (symmetric) matrix product, thus being able to estimate the contraction properties of ADMM. In the comparison with the results available from the literature, we are able to strengthen the precision of our speed estimate thanks to the fact that we are solving a joint problem (i.e., we are identifying the spectral radius of the product of two matrices) in place of two separate problems (the product of two matrix norms).},

To ensure sustainable resource behavior, we introduce a novel method to steer the agents toward a stable population state, fulfilling the given coupled resource constraints. The proposed method is a decentralized resource pricing method based on the resource loads resulting from the augmentation of the game&#39;s Lagrangian. Assuming that the online learning agents have only noisy first-order utility feedback, we show that for a polynomially decaying agents step size/learning rate, the population&#39;s dynamic will almost surely converge to generalized Nash equilibrium. A particular consequence of the latter is the fulfillment of resource constraints in the asymptotic limit. Moreover, we investigate the finite-time quality of the proposed algorithm by giving a nonasymptotic time decaying bound for the expected amount of resource constraint violation.},

The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed by developing bounds on its dynamic regret in terms of the cumulative path length of the time-varying optimum. It is shown that as compared to the centralized case, the dynamic regret incurred by the proposed algorithm over $T$ time slots is worse by a factor of $\log (T)$ only, despite the disconnected and time-varying network topology.

We first consider the scenario of delayed function feedback, in which the complete information of the loss/constraint functions is revealed to the decision maker with delays. We develop a modified online saddle point algorithm suitable for constrained OCO with feedback delays. Sublinear regret and sublinear constraint violation bounds are established for the algorithm in terms of the delays. In practice, the complete information (functional forms) of the loss/constraint functions may not be revealed to the decision maker. Thus, we further examine the scenario of delayed bandit feedback, where only the values of the loss/constraint functions at two random points close to the chosen action are revealed to the decision maker with delays. A delayed version of the bandit online saddle point algorithm is proposed by utilizing stochastic gradient estimates of the loss/constraint functions based on delayed bandit feedback. We also establish sublinear regret and sublinear constraint violation bounds for this bandit optimization algorithm in terms of the delays.

  abstract     = {We consider a class of restless multiarmed bandit (RMAB) problems with unknown arm dynamics. At each time, a player chooses an arm out of $N$ arms to play, referred to as an active arm, and receives a random reward from a finite set of reward states. The reward state of the active arm transits according to an unknown Markovian dynamics. The reward state of passive arms (which are not chosen to play at time $t$ ) evolves according to an arbitrary unknown random process. The objective is an arm-selection policy that minimizes the regret, defined as the reward loss with respect to a player that always plays the most rewarding arm. This class of RMAB problems has been studied recently in the context of communication networks and financial investment applications. We develop a strategy that selects arms to be played in a consecutive manner, dubbed adaptive sequencing rules (ASR) algorithm. The sequencing rules for selecting arms under the ASR algorithm are adaptively updated and controlled by the current sample reward means. By designing judiciously the adaptive sequencing rules, we show that the ASR algorithm achieves a logarithmic regret order with time, and a finite-sample bound on the regret is established. Although existing methods have shown a logarithmic regret order with time in this RMAB setting, the theoretical analysis shows a significant improvement in the regret scaling with respect to the system parameters under ASR. Extensive simulation results support the theoretical study and demonstrate a strong performance of the algorithm as compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {A novel and original distributed reputation mechanism is here proposed for a class of networked systems characterized by two distinct groups of nodes: user agents and service providers (servers/resources). The proposed methodology is in charge of intercepting those resources that have the highest quality of service (QoS) on the basis of their reputation (trust) shared among agents. Such a reputation may change over the time mainly influenced by changing performance indexes and other events. As a result, it is shown that the trust evolution can be modeled as the output of a positive switching linear system. This model straightforwardly allows one to prove trust boundedness and other relevant steady-state properties. To illustrate the benefits of this approach, a sensors selection problem for state estimation is outlined and addressed within the proposed framework. In particular, it is formally proved that the resulting estimation scheme ensures, over the time, the selection of the sensor with the current best perceived QoS in a finite time.},

  abstract     = {An intermittent feedback-based control policy is proposed for rejecting bounded disturbance signals in a continuous, linear time-invariant (LTI) system with distinct and rational eigenvalues. The proposed policy maximizes the average feedback-off time while retaining the state trajectory inside a prespecified safe region. To achieve this, the feedback link is alternatively turned on and off. During feedback-on intervals, the state trajectory is steered to the origin in min–max time and then feedback is turned off for some maximal precomputed duration. The largest subset of the safe region that is invariant under the proposed policy is characterized. The feedback control and the open-loop control in the proposed policy, which are applied during feedback-on and feedback-off intervals, respectively, are obtained by solving certain min–max and max–min time-optimal control problems. It is shown that the proposed policy achieves the abovementioned objective of maximizing the average feedback-off time. An interesting additional feature of this policy is that the optimal control problems in it need to be solved only once offline and, hence, they do not increase the burden of real-time computation.},

In particular, we introduce an observability analysis tool for the attitude dynamics when only accelerometer and gyroscope measurements are available, as in several robotics applications. In various scenarios, in fact, the measurement of the magnetic field via a magnetometer is unreliable, due to magnetic interferences. Herein, we first focus on a formal observability analysis, which reveals that the target dynamics is weakly locally observable , but not first-order observable. The lack of first-order observability prevents standard observers from achieving global convergence. Therefore, we discuss a more suitable approach for observer design to deal with this problem. The proposed approach is validated by providing numerical and experimental results. The former show that the proposed approach is able to achieve convergence (final error 0.004 $\%$ ). Experiments validate our inference about observability and show the improvements brought by the proposed approach concerning the error convergence (final error 0.15 $\%$ ).},

Especially, we assume that the model contains two kinds of delays. One of them is contained in the nonlocal boundary condition, which expresses the latent period of infection. The other is an observation delay, which corresponds to the time needed for counting the number of infected people at an infection elapsed time. The element of time lags can be expressed by a transport equation. As a result, the system with two delays is equivalently written by a $3\times 3$ hyperbolic system. In this article, we construct observers with three gain functions, using a backstepping method of PDEs. Then, the triple of the designed gain belongs to the domain of the generator governing the state evolution of the error system. Furthermore, based on this fact and the semigroup theory, it is shown that the error system is $L^2$ -stable in the Hilbert space.},

It turns out that, with a suitably designed feedback matrix, exponential consensus can be realized globally and uniformly if and only if a jointly $(\delta,T)$ -connected condition and an observability condition relying only on system and input matrices are satisfied. A lower bound of the convergence rate is also provided. We figure out the proof by applying matrix analysis and linear functional analysis.

In contrast with existing results, our solution achieves convergence in finite time, without injection of high gain, and imposes very weak assumptions on the communication graph—namely, the existence of an open Hamiltonian walk. It is shown that this assumption is strictly weaker than the usual strong connectivity requirement. The scheme is shown to be robust vis-á-vis external disturbances and communication delays.},

For regular or nondescriptor systems, this problem can be solved via the event-triggered control law. But this control law may be ineffective for the same problem of descriptor systems. The reason is that the discontinuity of the event-triggered controller will cause sudden failure of the algegbraic part of descriptor systems at each triggering instant. From the perspective of mathematics, the algebraic equation will have no solution at each triggering instant. To address this problem, a novel hybrid control scheme is introduced. The main characteristic of this control scheme is that it consists of an event-triggered controller and an impulsive controller. It is shown that the impulsive controller plays an extremely important role in adjusting system states to satisfy the algebraic equation. Based on this hybrid control scheme, some improved results are proposed compared with the existing ones. Finally, an example about circuit systems is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.},

Second, the cooperative excitation condition introduced and used in this article for the convergence of the distributed LS estimate is the weakest possible one, which shows that even if any individual sensor cannot estimate the unknown parameter by the traditional LS, the whole network can still fulfill the estimation task by the distributed LS.},

Contrary to some existing finite-time consensus tracking schemes, the control input constraint is taken into account by utilizing hyperbolic tangent saturation function to reduce the risk of the actuator saturation.

  abstract     = {In this article, an anti-disturbance control design is presented for nonlinear systems based on a hybrid disturbance estimation scheme. This scheme features the capability of making full use of the incomplete knowledge on disturbance dynamics. By embedding the known information, the disturbance interval observer is developed to generate boundaries to cover individually each element of external disturbances. Through synthesizing a tangent barrier Lyapunov function-based estimation switching mechanism, the modified disturbance observer is proposed to take appropriate values between the boundaries as the estimation. By using this estimation, the anti-disturbance control compensates for external disturbances. It is proved that the system states stay within a specified region and converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the numerical simulation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and benefits of the estimation scheme and the control design.},

By making use of a special kind of a left generalized inverse $P(s)_{\alpha }^{\oplus }$ of $P(s)$ , we define and examine the equivalent relation $\mathcal {R}$ relating $P(s)$ with the members of the equivalence class $[P(s)]_{R}$ of the closed loop-transfer function matrices $P_{C}(s)$ obtainable from $P(s)$ by the use of a proper compensator $C(s)$ in the feedback path. For $\mathcal {R}$ , we establish a set of complete invariants and a canonical form. These results give rise to a simple algorithmic procedure for the computation of proper internally stabilizing and denominator assigning compensators $C(s)$ for the class of plants with $p=m$ and having no zeros in the closed right half complex plane: $\mathbb {C}^{+}$ and in the case when $p&amp;gt;m$ plants characterized by right polynomial matrix fraction descriptions with a polynomial matrix numerator having at least one subset of $m$ rows that give rise to a nonsingular polynomial matrix with no zeros in $\mathbb {C}^{+}$ .},

By using the $\ell _{1}$ penalty function, we prove that the equilibrium of a differential inclusion is a normalized Nash equilibrium of the original generalized noncooperative game, and the centralized differential inclusion exponentially converges to the unique normalized Nash equilibrium of a strongly monotone game. Suppose that the players can communicate with their neighboring players only and the communication topology can be represented by a connected undirected graph. Based on a leader-following consensus scheme and singular perturbation techniques, we propose distributed algorithms by using the exact $\ell _{1}$ penalty function and the continuously differentiable squared $\ell _{2}$ penalty function, respectively. The squared $\ell _{2}$ penalty function method works for games with smooth constraints and the exact $\ell _{1}$ penalty function works for certain scenarios. The proposed two distributed algorithms converge to an $\eta$ -neighborhood of the unique normalized Nash equilibrium and an $\eta$ -neighborhood of an approximated Nash equilibrium, respectively, with $\eta$ being a positive constant. For each $\eta &amp;gt;0$ and each initial condition, there exists an $\varepsilon ^*$ such that for each $0&amp;lt; \varepsilon &amp;lt; \varepsilon ^*$ , the convergence can be guaranteed where $\varepsilon$ is a parameter in the algorithm.},

The model is parametrized by characteristics of the corresponding time-varying input–output delay. Uncertainty in the relationship between the timing of zero-order-hold update events at the output and the possibly aperiodic sampling events at the input means that the delay does not always reset to a fixed value. This is distinct from the well-studied synchronous case in which the delay intermittently resets to zero at output update times. The main result provides a family of integral quadratic constraints that covers the proposed model. To demonstrate an application of this result, stability and performance certificates are devised for an asynchronous sampled-data implementation of the feedback loop around given linear time-invariant continuous-time open-loop dynamics.

The filter parameters are obtained from the bounded real lemma of descriptor systems. The developed approach unifies the design of functional, reduced-order, and full-order filters. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the problem are obtained in terms of a set of bilinear matrix inequalities. Under certain conditions these inequalities can be transformed to a set of linear matrix inequalities.

In many applications, the main goal is to identify not only the hidden state, but also additional unknown model parameters (e.g., AR coefficients or unknown dynamics). We show how to efficiently optimize over model parameters in SSM that use smooth process and measurement losses. Our approach is to project out state variables, obtaining a value function that only depends on the parameters of interest, and derive analytical formulas for first and second derivatives that can be used by many types of optimization methods. We illustrate this by implementing Newton, Gauss–Newton, and quasi-Newton algorithms on a numerical example. The approach can be used with smooth robust penalties such as Hybrid and the Student&#39;s T, in addition to classic least squares. We use the approach to estimate robust AR models and long-run unemployment rates with sudden changes.},

Then, the concept of induced equations is proposed for an MC, and the corresponding criterion is subsequently derived for asymptotic set stability of an MC by utilizing the solutions of induced equations. This criterion can be, respectively, examined by either a linear programming algorithm or a graphical algorithm. With regards to the stabilization of MJBNs, the time complexity is reduced to a certain extent. Furthermore, all time-optimal signal-based state feedback controllers are designed to stabilize an MJBN towards a given target state.

Based on the integration of the presented lemma and the theory of matrix polynomials, two tractable sufficient conditions are developed. For comparison of conservatism, the reachable set estimation is achieved through optimizing the ellipsoidal bounding region. Four sets of constraints with different conservatism are derived and compared. The effectiveness and superiority of the Bernstein polynomial approach in reachable set estimation are demonstrated via an illustrative example. The results show that the proposed approach enables lower conservatism in reachable set estimation, providing an intuitive route to tackle time-varying parameter products with high powers.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the stabilization of highly nonlinear stochastic coupled systems (HNSCSs) with time delay via periodically intermittent control. This article is motivated by that known differential inequalities to deal with periodically intermittent control do not work for HNSCSs, since the coefficients of the system do not satisfy the linear growth condition. In order to cope with this problem, a novel Halanay-type inequality is established to handle periodically intermittent control, which generalizes previous results. Then, based on this differential inequality, the graph theory, and the Lyapunov method, two main theorems are shown, whose conditions indicate how the control duration, the control gain, and the coupling strength affect the realization of the stability. Then, the theoretical results are applied to the modified van der Pol–Duffing oscillators. Finally, corresponding simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

We derive tight upper and lower bounds on the structural robustness of networks based on the average distance between nodes and the average node degree. Using the proposed bounds, we characterize the networks with different types of robustness scaling under increasing size. Furthermore, we present a fundamental tradeoff between the structural robustness and the average degree of networks. While this tradeoff implies that a desired level of structural robustness can only be achieved by graphs with a sufficiently large average degree, we also show that there exist dense graphs with poor structural robustness. We then show that random $k$ -regular graphs (the degree of each node is $k$ ) with $n$ nodes typically have near-optimal structural robustness among all the graphs with size $n$ and average degree $k$ for sufficiently large $n$ and $k$ . We also show that when $k$ increases properly with $n$ , random $k$ -regular graphs maintain a structural robustness within a constant factor of the complete graph&#39;s while also having the minimum average degree required for such robustness.},

A transport partial differential equation is employed to model the dynamics of the delay state, and a filter with adaptive control gains is proposed using the available relative output information of neighboring nodes. Based on the state of the filter, the estimation delay state, and the delay estimation, we propose two distributed adaptive output feedback consensus protocols. The first one employs a delay-adaptive predictor and guarantees local consensus, whereas the second one, replacing the delay estimation by a constant, is proven to be a global consensus controller provided that the delay mismatch is in a small compact set.

To design the robust filter, we transform the 2-D switched system into an equivalent difference-algebraic representation form. Using the equivalent representation and the parameter-dependent Lyapunov function approach, sufficient conditions are established for system stability, and 2-D stationary discrete-time linear filters are designed to ensure the prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ or $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ performance for all admissible uncertain parameters.

Its innovation lies in computing the control input by an optimal contraction metric, which greedily minimizes an upper bound of the steady-state mean squared tracking error of the system trajectories. Although the problem of minimizing the bound is nonconvex, its equivalent convex formulation is proposed utilizing SDC parameterizations of the nonlinear system equation. It is shown using stochastic incremental contraction analysis that the CV-STEM provides a sufficient guarantee for exponential boundedness of the error for all time with ${\bf \mathcal {L}_2}$ -robustness properties. For the sake of its sampling-based implementation, we present discrete-time stochastic contraction analysis with respect to a state- and time-dependent metric along with its explicit connection to continuous-time cases.

However, the interaction between CAVs and non-CAVs may limit the practically attainable improvement due to platooning. To better understand and address this limitation, we introduce a new fluid model of mixed-autonomy traffic flow and use this model to analyze and design platoon coordination strategies. We propose a tandem-link fluid model that considers randomly arriving platoons sharing highway capacity with non-CAVs. We derive verifiable conditions for stability of the fluid model by analyzing an underlying M/D/1 queuing process and establishing a Foster–Lyapunov drift condition for the fluid model. These stability conditions enable a quantitative analysis of highway throughput under various scenarios. The model is useful for designing platoon coordination strategies that maximize throughput and minimize delay. Such coordination strategies are provably optimal in the fluid model and are practically relevant. We also validate our results using standard macroscopic (cell transmission model) and microscopic (simulation for urban mobility) simulation models.},

Two popular scenarios in the first-order multiagent systems with model-based event-triggered controllers are considered. One is that the event trigger in each agent samples the absolute information, and decides when to broadcast the information to its neighbors, and the other is that the update of control signals is only scheduled by the local event triggers via directly using the (combined) relative information. The events are triggered when the measurement error between the agent, and model states violates a given threshold function. Both cases are studied, where the threshold is generated by the agent state or by the model state. Then, sufficient conditions on the existence of Zeno behavior in event-triggered finite-time consensus of multiagent systems are provided. For the triggering conditions with the thresholds given by agent states, the system must exhibit Zeno behavior; while in the case of using model states, the existence of Zeno behavior is influenced by the properties of the communication topology, and the threshold functions. Finally, several simulations, and examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Both diagonal and block decoupling is considered. The earliest known investigation of system decoupling dates back to 1934 and all past stable solutions were obtained under restrictive assumptions on system, block structure, or on a particular form of the control law. Most often, the results were limited to regular state feedback. The present formulation avoids restrictive hypotheses. The system is stabilized first and then decoupled while preserving stability. The existence of decoupling feedback is conditioned by system invariants with respect to the group of stability-preserving decoupling transformations. Since nonregular state feedback is authorized, some well-known results of regular decoupling are not retained. In particular, the presence of interconnection zeros does not prevent a stable decoupling to be achievable.},

The actuation and sensing appears through these ODEs resulting in a challenging control problem. For this setup a systematic backstepping approach is proposed, in order to determine a state feedback controller and an observer. In particular, the state feedback loop and the observer error dynamics are mapped into stable ODE–PDE–ODE cascades by making use of a sequence of transformations. With this, the design can be traced back to the solution of kernel equations already found in the literature as well as initial and boundary value problems, that can be solved numerically. Exponential stability of the closed-loop system is verified, wherein the decay rate can be directly specified in the design. The results of the article are illustrated by the output feedback control of an unstable ODE–PDE–ODE system with two coupled parabolic PDEs.},

Computation of the solution to the associated Bellman equations is challenging in most practical cases of interest. A popular class of approximation techniques, known as temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms, are an important subclass of general reinforcement learning methods. The algorithms introduced in this article are intended to resolve two well-known issues with TD-learning algorithms. Their slow convergence due to very high central limit theorem variance, and the fact that, for the problem of computing the relative value function, consistent algorithms exist only in special cases. First we show that the gradients of these value functions admit a representation that lends itself to algorithm design. Based on this result, a new class of differential TD-learning algorithms is introduced. For Markovian models on Euclidean space with smooth dynamics, the algorithms are shown to be consistent under general conditions. Numerical results show dramatic variance reduction in comparison to standard methods.},

  abstract     = {Distributed bandit online convex optimization with time-varying coupled inequality constraints is considered, motivated by a repeated game between a group of learners and an adversary. The learners attempt to minimize a sequence of global loss functions and at the same time satisfy a sequence of coupled constraint functions, where the constraints are coupled across the distributed learners at each round. The global loss and the coupled constraint functions are the sum of local convex loss and constraint functions, respectively, which are adaptively generated by the adversary. The local loss and constraint functions are revealed in a bandit manner, i.e., only the values of loss and constraint functions are revealed to the learners at the sampling instance, and the revealed function values are held privately by each learner. Both one- and two-point bandit feedback are studied with the two corresponding distributed bandit online algorithms used by the learners. We show that sublinear expected regret and constraint violation are achieved by these two algorithms, if the accumulated variation of the comparator sequence also grows sublinearly. In particular, we show that $\mathcal {O}(T^{\theta })$ expected static regret and $\mathcal {O}(T^{7/4-\theta })$ constraint violation are achieved in the one-point bandit feedback setting, and $\mathcal {O}(T^{\max \lbrace \kappa,1-\kappa \rbrace })$ expected static regret and $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-\kappa /2})$ constraint violation in the two-point bandit feedback setting, where $\theta \in (3/4,5/6]$ and $\kappa \in (0,1)$ are user-defined tradeoff parameters. Finally, the tightness of the theoretical results is illustrated by numerical simulations of a simple power grid example, which also compares the proposed algorithms to algorithms existing in the literature.},

This partitioned setting arises in several applications of practical interest. We propose what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first distributed, asynchronous algorithm with rate guarantees for this class of problems. When the objective function is nonconvex, the algorithm provably converges to a stationary solution at a sublinear rate whereas linear rate is achieved under the renowned Luo-Tseng error bound condition (which is less stringent than strong convexity). Numerical results on matrix completion and LASSO problems show the effectiveness of our method.},

We design a robust “linear-plus-noise” signaling strategy in order to persuade the attacker to take actions that lead to minimum damage with respect to the system&#39;s objective. The specific model we adopt is a Gauss–Markov process driven by a controller with a (partially) “unknown” malicious/benign control objective. We seek to defend against the worst possible distribution over control objectives in a robust way under the solution concept of Stackelberg equilibrium, where the sensor is the leader. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition on the covariance matrix of the posterior belief is a certain linear matrix inequality. This enables us to formulate an equivalent tractable problem, indeed a semidefinite program, to compute the robust sensor design strategies “globally” even though the original optimization problem is nonconvex and highly nonlinear. We also extend this result to scenarios where the sensor makes noisy or partial measurements.},

However, existing theory focuses on attack detection and not on the use of watermarking in conjunction with attack mitigation strategies. In this article, we study the problem of switching between two sets of sensors: One set of sensors has high accuracy but is vulnerable to attack, whereas the second set of sensors has low accuracy but cannot be attacked. The problem is to design a sensor switching strategy based on attack detection by dynamic watermarking. This requires new theory because existing results are not adequate to control or bound the behavior of sensor switching strategies that use finite data. To overcome this, we develop new finite sample hypothesis tests for dynamic watermarking in the case of bounded disturbances, using the modern theory of concentration of measure for random matrices. Our resulting switching strategy is validated with a simulation analysis in an autonomous driving setting, which demonstrates the strong performance of our proposed policy.},

The analysis builds upon a new metric inspired by positional system representations, which characterizes the dynamics of information exchange over the network, and on a novel step-size rule. Building on this result, a novel distributed algorithm is proposed that solves the average consensus problem over digraphs, using, at each timeslot, finite rate simplex communications between adjacent nodes—some bits for the weight-balancing problem and others for the average consensus. Convergence of the proposed quantized consensus algorithm to the average of the node&#39;s unquantized initial values is established, both almost surely and in the moment generating function of the error; and a sublinear convergence rate is proved for sufficiently large step-sizes.

In this article, we develop a general method based on ergodic theory and probability to derive fundamental bounds on information transmission requirements leading to stabilization. Through this method, we develop a new notion of entropy which is tailored to derive lower bounds for AMS for both noise-free and noisy channels. The bounds obtained through probabilistic and ergodic-theoretic analysis are more refined in comparison with the bounds obtained earlier via information-theoretic methods. Moreover, our approach is more versatile in view of the models considered and allows for finer lower bounds when the AMS measure is known to admit further properties, such as moment bounds.},

Such a problem (involving totally four free parameters) is of theoretical as well as practical importance, but, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it has not been fully explored. First, we will develop an algebraic algorithm to solve the complete stability problem w.r.t. $\tau$ . Consequently, for any given PID controller vector $(k_P, k_I, k_D)$ , the distribution of ${NU}(\tau)$ ( ${NU}(\tau)$ denotes the number of characteristic roots in the right-half plane, as a function of $\tau$ ) can be accurately obtained and the exhaustive stability range of $\tau$ may be automatically calculated. Next, a global understanding of the distribution of ${NU}(\tau)$ over the whole $(k_P, k_I, k_D)$ -space may be achieved and all structural changes regarding the ${NU}(\tau)$ distribution can be analytically determined. To achieve such a goal, a complete positive real root classification (for some appropriate auxiliary characteristic equation) will be explicitly proposed.

For linear quadratic control, an event-triggered learning framework is proposed that automatically detects inaccurate models and triggers the learning of a new process model when needed. This is achieved by analyzing the probability distribution of the linear quadratic cost and designing a learning trigger that leverages Chernoff bounds. In particular, whenever empirically observed cost signals are located outside the derived confidence intervals, we can provably guarantee that this is with high probability due to a model mismatch. With the aid of numerical and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed bounds are tight and that the event-triggered learning algorithm effectively distinguishes between inaccurate models and probabilistic effects, such as process noise. Thus, a structured approach is obtained that decides when model learning is beneficial.},

This algorithm can be interpreted as a distributed variant of a two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm. We then study the convergence and derive upper bounds on the rates of convergence of the proposed method as a function of the bandwidth available between the nodes and the underlying network topology for both convex and strongly convex objective functions. Our results complement existing literature, where such convergence and explicit formulas of the convergence rates are missing. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to compare the convergence properties of the distributed gradient methods with and without quantization for solving the well-known regression problems over networks, for both quadratic and absolute loss functions.},

  abstract     = {This article studies a distributed average tracking (DAT) problem, in which a collection of agents work collaboratively, subject to local communication, to track the average of a set of reference signals, each of which is available to a single agent. Our primary objective is to seek a design methodology for DAT under possibly weight-unbalanced directed networks-the most general and thus most challenging case from the network topology perspective, which has few results in the literature. For this purpose, we propose a distributed algorithm based on a chain of two integrators that are coupled with a distributed estimator. It is found that the convergence depends on not only the network topology but also the deviations among the reference signal accelerations. Another primary interest of this article stems from the dynamics perspective-a point perceived as a main source of control design difficulty for multiagent systems. Indeed, we devise a nonlinear algorithm that is capable of achieving DAT under weight-unbalanced directed networks for agents subject to high-order integrator dynamics. The results show that the convergence to the vicinity of the average of the reference signals is guaranteed as long as the signals&#39; states and control inputs are all bounded. Both algorithms are robust to initialization errors, i.e., DAT is insured even if the agents are not correctly initialized, enabling the potential applications in a wider spectrum of application domains.},

A new integral TSM manifold is constructed in a recursive manner by modifying the tool of adding a power of integrator instead of exploring nonrecursive design directly. A super-twisting like reaching law is designed to achieve continuous control action without sacrificing disturbance rejection specification as that in boundary-layer approaches. By the new Lyapunov-based design, the proposed control method admits the following new features: first, rather than imposing some existence condition for nonrecursive design, the proposed method admits the certainty for chosen fractional power to guarantee the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system; second, an explicit Lyapunov function approach is proposed to establish finite-time stability of the closed-loop system; and, third, the proposed method is shown to be tunable to exhibit desired transient performance and control energy restriction.},

More specifically, from the measured output, the switched filter has the role of providing essential information for the switching function, which must assure global practical stability of a desired equilibrium point. The design conditions are based on a general quadratic Lyapunov function and are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, whenever the system is quadratically detectable, the solution to the output feedback problem coincides with the one for the state feedback case and the associated filter admits the observer form. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first time that the dynamic output feedback control problem is treated in the context of discrete-time switched affine systems. The results can be used to cope with sampled-data control and have the property of assuring global asymptotic stability when the sampling period tends to zero. A practical application concerning the velocity control of a dc motor driven by a buck-boost converter illustrates the theoretical results.},

Prescribed performance means that the output tracking errors should converge to a prescribed maximum residual set in fixed time, exhibiting a predefined maximum overshoot. The controller we propose is of low complexity and is designed according to the philosophy of the prescribed performance control (PPC) methodology. However, significant modifications on the standard PPC design are provided to successfully handle the presence of discontinuities in the reference. Key characteristic is the incorporation of impulsive dynamics in the control design, leading to an impulsive closed-loop system. Knowledge of neither the future values of the reference signal nor the time instants of the reference discontinuities is required. Simulation results clarify and verify theoretical findings.},

We deduce the controller design and the stability proof by introducing a two-step backstepping transformation. The first transformation recasts the original system into a coupled 2×2 first-order hyperbolic system with spatially varying coefficients cascading into a nonlinear ODE. The second transformation is used in the design of a compensator for the resulting cascaded system. Our design offers a global stability result that is guaranteed assuming that the spatially varying propagation speed is continuously differentiable and positive. Moreover, for nonlinear systems, our result is the first contribution enabling actual compensation of actuator delays governed by a coupled first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) induced by a wave PDE dynamics with a spatially varying propagation speed.

In this article, we study a distributed Lagrangian method for such problems. By utilizing the so-called distributed subgradient methods to solve the dual problem, our approach eliminates the need for central coordination in updating the dual variables, which is often required in classic Lagrangian methods. Our focus is to understand the performance of this distributed algorithm when the number of resources is unknown and may be time-varying. In particular, we obtain an upper bound on the convergence rate of the algorithm to the optimal value, in expectation, as a function of network topology.

Contrarily to the main stream of the linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based robust stabilization methods available in the literature, where the product between the Lyapunov (or slack variable) and control gain matrices is transformed in a new variable, this article proposes a change of paradigm, avoiding the standard change of variables and providing synthesis conditions that deal directly with the control gain as an optimization variable. The design procedure is formulated in terms of a locally convergent iterative algorithm based on LMIs, having as main novelties the following points: Both the Lyapunov and the closed-loop dynamic matrices appear affinely in the conditions; the iterative scheme involves the slack variables only, avoiding the classic alternation between the Lyapunov matrix and the control gain; an extra degree of freedom is created in terms of an additional scalar variable, which also appears affinely in the conditions and represents a scaling on the closed-loop dynamic matrix; a smart termination for the algorithm through a stability analysis condition. Numerical experiments based on exhaustive simulations show that all these features combined provide a robust stabilization technique capable to outperform the best available methods in the literature in terms of effectiveness, being specially suitable to address static output-feedback and decentralized control problems.},

An important role in the controller design is played by the controller weight matrix. This is a rectangular input transformation chosen such that in the resulting system, the zero dynamics, which are assumed to be uniformly exponentially stable, are independent of the new input.

In particular, a unified fully probabilistic control framework is established to develop the solution to the MRAC, where the controller is the minimizer of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the actual and desired joint probability density functions of the tracking error and the controller. The developed framework is quite general, where all the components within this framework, including the controller and system tracking error, are modeled using probabilistic models. The general solution for arbitrary probabilistic models of the framework components is first obtained and then demonstrated on a class of linear Gaussian systems with time delay in the main control input, thus obtaining the desired results. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we develop a fully probabilistic design framework for MRAC, referred to as model reference fully probabilistic design, for stochastic dynamical systems. Second, we establish a systematic pedagogic procedure that is based on deriving explicit forms for the required predictive distributions for obtaining the causal form of the randomized controller when input delays are present.},

With the help of nonlinear encoding/decoding components, the proposed structure can detect stealthy attacks and preserve the nominal performance without considering attacks. Meanwhile, for avoiding the eavesdropping of transmitted signals used to synchronize encoding/decoding components between the physical and cyber layers, the chaotic oscillators are employed for the secure communication. The resilience against the malicious attacks and the robustness under the time delay and nonlinear components of the proposed CPS structure are investigated in view of input-to-state stable framework. Simulations for quadruple-tank process are performed to validate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the distributed asynchronous consensus problem for nonlinear multiagent systems with switching topologies. Different from the existing results, we consider the detection delay of topology modes and some topologies having no directed spanning tree with leader as the root. In these conditions, the distributed asynchronous switched observer is first developed for each follower to accurately estimate the state information of the leader. Then, an output feedback distributed controller is designed for each follower by means of the switched observer. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved strictly that the controller can guarantee all agents achieving a consensus if the topologies are switched by the switching signal fulfilling a general rule. Moreover, the switching rule compared with the one satisfying average dwell-time condition can render the number of topology switches growing faster on any time interval. Finally, the numerical simulation is presented to verify the effectiveness of proposed theoretical results.},

A new method for determining the admissible region-switching paths between adjacent time instants is proposed for both the plant state and the estimator state, so that both the computation cost and the conservatism of the theoretical results are reduced. To analyze the mean-square stability of the observation error system, a novel piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed, which depends on the current mode and the region indices of both the system and observer states. As the partitions of the state space are different for different modes, the region indices are dependent on the system mode. Then, mode-dependent PWA observers are designed by means of S -procedure and ellipsoidal outer approximation such that the observation error system is mean-square stable. The proposed observation strategy is demonstrated via an illustrative example.},

The motion of each agent is governed by the gradient descent flow of a disagreement function that is a sum of (squared) distances between pairs of communicating agents. Two metrics are considered: geodesic distances and chordal distances for manifolds that are embedded in an ambient Euclidean space. We show that networks that, roughly speaking, are dominated by a large cycle yield multistable systems if the manifold is multiply connected or contains a closed geodesic that is of locally minimum length in a space of closed curves. This result summarizes previous results on the stability of splay or twist state equilibria of the Kuramoto model on S 1 and its generalization, the quantum sync model on SO(n). It also extends them to the Lohe model on U(n).},

Due to the cost constraints of attacks, it is reasonable to consider that the number of maximum continuous DoS attacks in both the S-C and the C-A channels is bounded. Then, to defend the two-channel DoS attacks, an active security control strategy that makes full use of the unattacked intervals is designed to ensure that the control inputs are updated timely in each period. Meanwhile, a security controller that contains both the current and future control inputs is designed. Under the active security control strategy and the security controller, the addressed CPS under two-channel DoS attacks can be asymptotically stable without losing the control performance.

Precisely, network features are formulated in terms of stochastic allowable transmission interval (SATI), which is a concept well suited for the time-triggered control of wireless network control systems (WNCS). Given SATI parameters, we provide sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities, under which we can design a static output feedback controller that stabilizes the closed-loop WNCS in mean square sense. Moreover, we guarantee that a quadratic control cost is less than a given bound.

They are powerful tools due to their scalability. However, the agent-wise local design methods are incapable of maximizing the overall system performance through, for example, decay rate assignment. On the other hand, design methods, which are predicated on a global condition, leads to nonconvex optimization problems. This article considers a global design of an internal model-based distributed dynamic state feedback control law for the linear cooperative output regulation problem. We present a convex formulation of this global design problem based on a structured Lyapunov inequality. Then, the existence of solutions to the structured Lyapunov inequality is investigated. Specifically, we analytically show that the solutions exist for the systems satisfying the agent-wise local sufficient condition. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the agent-wise local design method through numerical examples in terms of conservatism, performance maximization, graph dependency, and scalability.},

And the plant is modeled using a transfer function that as follows: first, is Hurwitz stable, second, is proper, third, has a positive real zero, andfourth, has a positive dc gain. We analyze this RFS using a state-space description, with closed-form expressions for the state trajectory from one switching time to the next. We prove that the state transformation from one switching time to the next, first, has a Schur stable linearization, and first, is a contraction mapping. Then using the Banach contraction mapping theorem, we prove that all trajectories of this RFS converge asymptotically to a unique limit cycle. This limit cycle is symmetric, and is unimodal as it has exactly two relay switches per period. This result helps understand the behavior of the relay autotuning method, when applied to second-order plants with no time delay. We also treat the case where the plant either has no finite zero, or has exactly one zero that is negative.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an adaptive consensus tracking control scheme is proposed for a class of high-order nonlinear multiagent systems with unknown control directions. Different from the existing results, the unknown control directions are not required to be identical and also unknown time-varying actuator faults are taken into account simultaneously. We design some novel Nussbaum functions and construct a monotonously increasing sequence in which the effects of our multiple Nussbaum functions reinforce rather than counteract each other. Moreover, some integrable auxiliary signals and a novel contradiction argument are introduced in the design and analysis. With these efforts, the obstacle jointly caused by the unknown control directions and actuator faults are circumvented, and the global stability of the overall closed-loop system and asymptotic convergence to zero of tracking errors are successfully achieved. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

An unknown diagonal matrix is employed to characterize the multiplicative loss of actuator effectiveness for each node. The proposed filter utilizes the information from only the local node and the neighboring nodes. Since there is no need to have a center node receiving global information from every node, the developed FD algorithm is truly distributed. In the presence of gain variations, a time-varying filter is constructed to jointly estimate the system state and the loss of actuator effectiveness at each node. An upper bound of the filtering error covariance is calculated and then minimized via appropriately determining the filter gains. The filter is designed by solving two sets of recursive matrix equations, thereby meriting the suitability of online applications. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the exponential boundedness in mean square of the filtering error, and the monotonicity of the estimation error covariance with respect to the coupling strength is also investigated. An illustrative example is provided to show the usefulness of our FD strategy.},

Large performance gains have been reported for many applications and closed-loop stability has been recently investigated. However, computational performance still remains an open issue and only few contributions have proposed real-time algorithms tailored to EMPC. We perform a step towards computationally cheap algorithms for EMPC by proposing a new positive-definite Hessian approximation which does not hinder fast convergence and is suitable for being used within the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme.

We consider dynamic feedback control protocol in the form of proportional and derivative (PD) control, and seek to determine the delay consensus margin (DCM) achievable by PD feedback protocols, whereas the DCM is a robustness measure that defines the maximal range of delay within which robust consensus can be achieved despite the uncertainty in the delay. With an undirected graph, we show that the DCM can be determined exactly by solving a unimodal concave optimization problem, which is one of univariate convex optimization and can be solved using convex optimization or gradient-based numerical methods. The results show how unstable agent dynamics and graph connectivity may limit the range of delay tolerable, so that consensus can or cannot be maintained in the presence of delay variations.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to enlarge the applicability of event-triggered control for stochastic systems, and is particularly concerned with event-triggered stabilization for stochastic systems with control-dependent diffusion term. Roughly treating stochastic noises as unfavorable factors for system stability, the related works are based on Lyapunov-type conditions for ISS property with respect to sampling error as those in the nonstochastic context. The conditions imply the existence of a twice-differentiable Lyapunov function with negative-definite infinitesimal under continuous-time control, and indeed exclude many familiar stochastic systems with control-dependent diffusion term which are continuously stabilizable while no such Lyapunov function exists. As the main contribution of this article, an enlarged framework of event-triggered stabilization is established for stochastic systems with control-dependent diffusion term, starting from the system stability under continuous-time control, rather than from Lyapunov-type conditions for ISS property. Specifically, with moment exponential stability assumed under continuous-time control, elementary event-triggering mechanisms are proposed with an enforced minimum inter-execution interval, under which the event-triggered controller can render the system exponentially stable both in the sense of expectation and in the almost sure sense. Particularly, a distinctive analysis of closed-loop stability is performed via delicate comparison between the solutions under the event-triggered, and continuous-time controls. Within the framework, inclusive Lyapunov-type conditions incorporating the underlying positive effects of stochastic noises are presented for event-triggered exponential stabilization of the stochastic systems, where the candidate Lyapunov function involved is weakened to be nondifferentiable at the origin and, even, to allow non-negative infinitesimal under continuous-time control.},

Based on this IFP framework, convergence conditions of a suitable coupling gain are derived over weight-balanced and uniformly jointly strongly connected topologies. It is also shown that the IFP-based algorithm converges exponentially when the topology is strongly connected. Second, a novel distributed derivative feedback algorithm is proposed based on the passivation of IFP systems. While most works on directed topologies require knowledge of eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian, the derivative feedback algorithm is fully distributed, namely, it is robust against randomly changing weight-balanced digraphs with any positive coupling gain and without knowing any global information.

Especially, a strict class of all realizable coordination tasks is characterized with an orbit associated with the transformation matrix group on measurement. Next, we show that the network topology required to coordination is the clique rigidity. Then, the clique rigidity for concrete coordination tasks is associated with conventional connectivity, e.g., connectedness and rigidity. Moreover, an intuitive condition is derived as a connectivity condition of the intersection graph of the maximal cliques (i.e., complete subgraphs). Finally, the new method is applied to formation control with unknown, heterogeneous scale factors and its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations for both 2-D and 3-D spaces.},

Under standard assumptions on the observation model and the network structure, we establish that each agent learns the truth asymptotically almost surely. As our main contribution, we prove that with probability 1, each false hypothesis is ruled out by every agent exponentially fast, at a network-independent rate that is strictly larger than existing rates.

In order to design a distributed controller to compensate the spatially varying delay, we first introduce an implicit backstepping transformation, which contains the state of the target system on both sides of the definition and then derive an additional backstepping transformation by a successive integration approach to arrive at a target system that is a distributed cascade of a 2-D transport PDE into a 1-D reaction-diffusion PDE. The resulting delay-compensated controller includes spatially weighted state feedback and feedback of the earlier inputs in four differential spatial regions, which avoids the need for feedback of future inputs, whereas the future input feedback would result if the conventional backstepping transformation was applied. The inverse transformation is also derived, to prove L 2 exponential stability. The applicability and performance of the controller is evaluated in simulation studies.},

Stability conditions are a priori specified in the linear program, which removes the necessity for a posteriori verification of closed-loop stability. We illustrate the developed methods via two application-inspired examples considering the stabilization of an inverted pendulum and the stabilization of a healthy equilibrium of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.},

Sparse polynomial zonotopes can represent nonconvex sets and are generalizations of zonotopes, polytopes, and Taylor models. Operations like Minkowski sum, quadratic mapping, and reduction of the representation size can be computed with polynomial complexity w.r.t. the dimension of the system. In particular, for reachability analysis of nonlinear systems, the wrapping effect is substantially reduced using sparse polynomial zonotopes, as demonstrated by numerical examples. In addition, we can significantly reduce the computation time compared to zonotopes when dealing with nonlinear dynamics.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a new fast and robust algorithm that provides fuel-optimal impulsive control input sequences that drive a linear time-variant system to a desired state at a specified time. This algorithm is applicable to a broad class of problems where the cost is expressed as a time-varying norm-like function of the control input, enabling inclusion of complex operational constraints in the control planning problem. First, it is shown that the reachable sets for this problem have identical properties to those in prior works using constant cost functions, enabling use of existing algorithms in conjunction with newly derived contact and support functions. By reformulating the optimal control problem as a semi-infinite convex program, it is also demonstrated that the semi-infinite component of the commonly studied primer vector is an outward normal vector to the reachable set at the target state. Using this formulation, a fast and robust algorithm that provides globally optimal impulsive control input sequences is proposed. The algorithm iteratively refines estimates of an outward normal vector to the reachable set at the target state and a minimal set of control input times until the optimality criteria are satisfied to within a user-specified tolerance. Next, optimal control inputs are computed by solving a quadratic program. The algorithm is validated through simulations of challenging example problems based on the recently proposed miniaturized distributed occulter/telescope small satellite mission, which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges several times faster than comparable algorithms in the literature.},

To assess the quality of scenario-based solutions a posteriori, validation tests based on Bernoulli trials have been widely adopted in practice. However, to reach a theoretically reliable judgment of risk, one typically needs to collect massive validation samples. In this article, we propose new a posteriori bounds for convex scenario programs with validation tests, which are dependent on both realizations of support constraints, and performance on out-of-sample validation data. The proposed bounds enjoy wide generality in that many existing theoretical results can be incorporated as particular cases. To facilitate practical use, a systematic approach for parameterizing a posteriori probability bounds is also developed, which is shown to possess a variety of desirable properties allowing for easy implementations and clear interpretations. By synthesizing comprehensive information about support constraints and validation tests, improved risk evaluation can be achieved for randomized solutions in comparison with existing a posteriori bounds. Case studies on controller design of aircraft lateral motion are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed a posteriori bounds.},

In the addressed set-up, the dimension of the decision variable can be extremely high and the objective function can be nonsmooth. The general algorithm consists of two main steps: a consensus step and an update on a single block of the optimization variable, which is then broadcast to neighbors. Three special instances of the proposed method, involving particular problem structures, are then presented. In the general case, the convergence of a dynamic consensus algorithm over random row stochastic matrices is shown. Then, the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal cost is proven in expected value. Exact convergence is achieved when using diminishing (local) stepsizes, whereas approximate convergence is attained when constant stepsizes are employed. The convergence rate is shown to be sublinear and an explicit rate is provided in the case of constant stepsizes. Finally, the algorithm is tested on a distributed classification problem, first on synthetic data and, then, on a real, high-dimensional, text dataset.},

To counter Bellman&#39;s curse of dimensionality, such algorithms are coupled with function approximations. Although the learning/control problem becomes more tractable, function approximations affect stability and convergence. In this article, we present verifiable sufficient conditions for stability and convergence of asynchronous SAs with biased approximation errors. The theory developed herein is used to analyze policy gradient methods and noisy value iteration schemes. Specifically, we analyze the asynchronous approximate counterparts of the policy gradient (A2PG) and value iteration (A2VI) schemes. It is shown that the stability of these algorithms is unaffected by biased approximation errors, provided that they are asymptotically bounded. With respect to convergence (of A2VI and A2PG), a relationship between the limiting set and the approximation errors is established. Finally, experimental results that support the theory are presented.},

We model the dynamics of the slung-load system and put it into canonical form, i.e., a form which is independent of the system&#39;s physical parameters. Following a backstepping strategy, we design a dynamic control law for the canonical system that contains four estimators, since each of the two wind disturbances has two separate effects: an effect on the linear acceleration and another on the angular acceleration. Loosely speaking, the difference between the wind forces is an input-additive disturbance, while the wind force on the load is not, which makes removing the wind force on the load nontrivial. We identify conditions on the desired position trajectory and on the wind on the load, which guarantee that a well-defined equilibrium trajectory exists. The designed controller guarantees simultaneously that the latter trajectory is asymptotically tracked and the cable remains taut, provided that the system is initialized in a suitable set. Simulations illustrate our results.},

Unlike the case of centralized linear systems, for which the separation principle holds, the above practical assumption prevents the separate design of observers, and controller because each of the nodes does not necessarily have access to the control inputs generated at all the other nodes. We derive a linear distributed Luenberger observer, and a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee ultimate boundedness of the estimation error, and system state vectors, with bounds that depend on the L ∞ norm of the noise signals, and the number of bits used in the transmissions.

  abstract     = {The problem of maximally permissive deadlock avoidance for sequential resource allocation systems (RAS) is a well-defined problem in the current controls literature. The corresponding supervisor is known as the maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policy (DAP), and it can be perceived as a classifier effecting the dichotomy of the underlying state space into its “safe” and “unsafe” subspaces. In the deployment of the maximally permissive DAP, an important issue is the selection of an effective and computationally efficient representation of the aforementioned dichotomy. A popular such representation is the “linear classifier,” where the admissibility of any given RAS state is resolved based on its ability to satisfy a given set of linear inequalities. However, linear classifiers cannot provide effective representation of the maximally permissive DAP for all RAS instantiations. Hence, this article provides a methodology for synthesizing linear DAPs for any given RAS instance that might not be maximally permissive in the original sense of this term, but observe a more relaxed notion of “maximality” that is defined within the particular space of the DAPs that admit a linear representation. The presented developments formally define this new DAP class, and provide the necessary algorithms for the synthesis or the systematic approximation of maximal linear DAPs for any given RAS instance.},

In particular, the principal&#39;s objective depends on data from strategic decision makers (agents) whose decision-making process is unknown a priori. We consider both the cases where agents play best response to one another (Nash) and where they employ myopic update rules. By parametrizing the agents&#39; utility functions and the incentives offered, we develop an algorithm that the principal can employ to learn the agents&#39; decision-making processes while simultaneously designing incentives to change their response to one that is more desirable. We provide convergence results for this algorithm both in the noise-free and noisy cases and present illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Standard stochastic control methods assume that the probability distribution of uncertain variables is available. Unfortunately, in practice, obtaining accurate distribution information is a challenging task. To resolve this issue, in this article we investigate the problem of designing a control policy that is robust against errors in the empirical distribution obtained from data. This problem can be formulated as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game problem, where the action space of the adversarial player is a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical distribution. A dynamic programming solution is provided exploiting the reformulation techniques for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization. We show that the contraction property of associated Bellman operators extends a single-stage out-of-sample performance guarantee, obtained using a measure concentration inequality, to the corresponding multistage guarantee without any degradation in the confidence level. Furthermore, we characterize an explicit form of the optimal control policy and the worst-case distribution policy for linear-quadratic problems with Wasserstein penalty.},

The proposed learning law generalizes existing optimal PD-type learning laws and the resulting optimal learning operator turns out to be the solution of the noncausal Wiener–Hopf equation. The proposed solution can be interpreted as a systematic dual to traditional norm-optimal ILC schemes with superior asymptotic properties under stochastic perturbations. While the fully optimal solution is inherently iteration-varying, a simpler suboptimal learning operator with less computational effort is introduced. Moreover, a numerically very efficient strategy based on the fast Fourier transform is presented to obtain numerical solutions of the learning operator. By avoiding the need of spectral factorizations or solutions to Riccati equations, this approach is directly applicable to a certain class of distributed-parameter systems. Finally, the Wiener-filter-based ILC algorithm is demonstrated on finite- and infinite-dimensional example problems.},

Recently, we have investigated the capability of the classical PID control for second-order nonlinear uncertain systems, and provided some analytic design methods for the choices of PID parameters, where the system is assumed to be in the form of cascade integrators. In this article, we will consider the natural extension of the classical PID control for high-order affine-nonlinear uncertain systems. In contrast to most of the literature on controller design of nonlinear systems, we do not require such special system structures as normal or triangular forms, thanks to the strong robustness of the extend PID controller. To be specific, we will show that under some suitable conditions on nonlinearity, and uncertainty of the systems, the extended PID controller can semiglobally stabilize the nonlinear uncertain systems, and at the same time the regulation error converges to zero exponentially fast, as long as the control parameters are chosen from an open unbounded parameter manifold constructed in this article.},

Then, second-order integrator-type systems are further considered. In this case, a centralized seeking strategy is first proposed without considering the boundedness of the control inputs, followed by a distributed counterpart. By further adapting a saturation function into the distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy, the boundedness of the control input is addressed. In the proposed distributed strategies, consensus protocols are included for information sharing and the saturation functions are utilized to construct bounded control inputs. The convergence results are analytically studied by Lyapunov stability analysis.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with developing a novel distributed Kalman filtering algorithm over wireless sensor networks based on randomized consensus strategy. Compared with centralized algorithm, distributed filtering techniques require less computation per sensor and lead to more robust estimation since they simply use the information from the neighboring nodes in the network. However, poor local sensor estimation caused by limited observability and network topology changes, which interfere the global consensus, are challenging issues. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel randomized gossip based distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. Information exchange and computation in the proposed algorithm can be carried out in an arbitrarily connected network of sensors. In addition, the computational burden can be distributed for a sensor, which communicates with a stochastically selected neighbor at each clock step under schemes of gossip algorithm. In this case, the error covariance matrix changes stochastically at every clock step; thus, the convergence is considered in a probabilistic sense. We provide the mean square convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. Under a sufficient condition, we show that the proposed algorithm is quite appealing as it achieves better mean square error performance theoretically than the noncooperative decentralized Kalman filtering algorithm. Examples and simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

We establish that, under certain conditions on the structure of the signed network that corresponds to the so-called structural balance property, the opinions in the network polarize. Compared to other models in the literature, our model displays a richer and perhaps more intuitive behavior of the opinions when the social network does not satisfy structural balance.

Next, optimal controls are in general nonunique which naturally leads to an optimal set-valued function. Finally, a viable control law can be seen, in general, as a selector. It is known that selector theorems are nonconstructive, and so selectors cannot always be extracted. In this article, we analyze under which particular conditions selectors are constructively extractable. An algorithm is derived from the theorem, and applied in a computational study with a three-wheel robot model.},

This class of hybrid systems encompasses periodic event-triggered control, self-triggered control, and networked control systems including time-varying communication delays. New notions on the stability, and contractivity ( L 2 -gain strictly smaller than 1) from the beginning of the flow, and from the end of the flow are introduced, and formal relationships are derived between these notions, revealing that some are stronger than others. Inspired by ideas from lifting, it is shown that the internal stability, and contractivity in L 2 -sense of a continuous-time hybrid system in the framework is equivalent to the stability, and contractivity in l 2 -sense (meaning the l 2 -gain is smaller than 1) of an appropriate time-varying discrete-time nonlinear system. These results recover existing works in the literature as special cases, and indicate that analysing different discrete-time nonlinear systems (of the same level of complexity) than in existing works yield stronger conclusions on the L 2 -gain.},

A time-domain interpretation of the proposed LMI-based condition is given in terms of a quadratic integral Lyapunov functional, which allows us to reveal relations with an existing result. The LMI condition can easily be reformulated in a form where the dependence on the coefficients of the delay-difference equation is affine, which is instrumental to establishing a sufficient LMI condition for robust strong stability of delay-difference equations with norm-bounded uncertainty.

  abstract     = {Due to its broad applicability in machine learning, resource allocation, and control, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been extensively studied in the literature. The message exchange of the ADMM in multiagent optimization may reveal sensitive information of agents, which can be overheard by malicious attackers. This drawback hinders the application of the ADMM to privacy-aware multiagent systems. In this article, we consider consensus optimization with regularization, in which the cost function of each agent contains private sensitive information, e.g., private data in machine learning, and private usage patterns in resource allocation. We develop a variant of the ADMM that can preserve agents&#39; differential privacy by injecting noise into the public signals broadcast to the agents. We derive conditions on the magnitudes of the added noise under which the designated level of differential privacy can be achieved. Furthermore, the convergence properties of the proposed differentially private ADMM are analyzed under the assumption that the cost functions are strongly convex with Lipschitz continuous gradients, and the regularizer has smooth gradients or bounded subgradients. We find that to attain the best convergence performance given a certain privacy level, the magnitude of the injected noise should decrease as the algorithm progresses. Additionally, the choice of the number of iterations should balance the tradeoff between the convergence, and the privacy leakage of the ADMM, which is explicitly characterized by the derived upper bounds on convergence performance. Finally, numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. In particular, we apply the proposed algorithm to multiagent linear-quadratic control with private information to showcase its merit in control applications.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the challenging formation stabilization problem for mobile robotic teams wherein no distance or relative position measurements are available but each robot can only measure some of relative angles with respect to its neighbors in its local coordinate frame, we develop the notion of “angle rigidity” for a multipoint framework, named “angularity”, consisting of a set of nodes embedded in a Euclidean space, and a set of angle constraints among them. Different from bearings or angles defined in a global frame, the angles we use do not rely on the knowledge of a global frame, and are signed according to the counter-clockwise direction. Here, angle rigidity refers to the property specifying that under proper angle constraints, the angularity can only translate, rotate, or scale as a whole when one or more of its nodes are perturbed locally. We first demonstrate that this angle rigidity property, in sharp comparison to bearing rigidity or other reported rigidity related to angles of frameworks in the literature, is not a global property since an angle rigid angularity may allow flex ambiguity. We then construct necessary and sufficient conditions for infinitesimal angle rigidity by checking the rank of an angularity&#39;s rigidity matrix. We develop a combinatorial necessary condition for infinitesimal minimal angle rigidity. Using the developed theories, a formation stabilization algorithm is designed for a robotic team to achieve an angle rigid formation, in which only angle measurements are needed. Simulation examples demonstrate the advantages of the proposed angle-only formation control approach.},

While the potential of RL is now well established, many critical aspects still need to be tackled, including safety and stability issues. These issues, while secondary for the RL community, are central to the control community that has been widely investigating them. Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful control techniques because, among others, of its ability to provide such guarantees even for uncertain constrained systems. Since MPC is an optimization-based technique, optimality has also often been claimed. Unfortunately, the performance of MPC is highly dependent on the accuracy of the model used for predictions. In this article, we propose to combine RL and MPC in order to exploit the advantages of both, and therefore, obtain a controller that is optimal and safe.

The main idea of the self-triggered mechanism is to select a sampling interval so that a rapid decrease in the predicted costs associated with optimal predicted control inputs is guaranteed. This allows for a reduction in the required computation without compromising performance. By using a constraint tightening technique and exploring the nature of the open-loop control between sampling instants, a set of minimally conservative constraints is imposed on nominal states to ensure robust constraint satisfaction. A multistep open-loop MPC optimization problem is formulated, which ensures recursive feasibility for all possible realizations of the disturbance. The closed-loop system is guaranteed to satisfy a mean-square stability condition. To further reduce the computational load, when states reach a predetermined neighborhood of the origin, the control law of the robust self-triggered MPC algorithm switches to a self-triggered local controller. A compact set in the state space is shown to be robustly asymptotically stabilized. Numerical comparisons are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the marking prediction problem in labeled Petri nets. Marking prediction aims to recognize a priori that the plant will inevitably reach a given set of alert markings in finite future steps. Specifically, we require that a marking prediction procedure should have the following properties: i) no missed alarm, i.e., an alarm can always be issued before reaching an alert marking; and ii) no false alarm, i.e., once an alarm is issued, the plant will eventually reach an alert marking in the future. To this end, the notion of marking predictability is proposed as a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of the marking prediction problem. A fundamental marking estimation problem in a labeled Petri net is first solved using minimal explanations and basis reachability graphs. Then, we propose two notions of basis markings called boundary basis markings and basis indicators, and prove that a plant is predictable with respect to a set of alert markings if all basis markings confusable with boundary basis markings are basis indicators. By properly selecting a set of explicit transitions, the set of basis indicators can be efficiently computed by structural analysis of the corresponding basis reachability graph.

  abstract     = {Defending against malicious attacks has become increasingly important in various cyber-physical systems. This article presents an encryption-based countermeasure against stealthy attacks on remote state estimation. Smart sensors transmit data to a remote estimator through a wireless communication network, in which data packets can be intercepted and compromised by attackers. The remote end is equipped with a false data detector that monitors the system. To avoid being detected, the attack should follow the stealthiness constraint. A linear encryption scheme is proposed to reduce the influence of potential stealthy attacks. For arbitrary linear encryption, the worst-case linear attack that yields the largest estimation error is derived. Accordingly, the optimal linear encryption, which minimizes the worst-case estimation error, is designed based on the Stackelberg game analysis. The above optimal strategies are considered in both the complete and partial measurement information scenarios for the attacker. Moreover, the generalization to nonlinear encryption strategies is also discussed. Comparisons of attack and encryption strategies through numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

In this problem, the cost function at each time step is the sum of local cost functions with each of them being gradually revealed to its corresponding agent, and meanwhile only local functions in coupled inequality constraints are accessible to each agent. To address this problem, a modified primal-dual algorithm, called distributed online primal-dual push-sum algorithm, is developed in this article, which does not rest on any assumption on parameter boundedness and is applicable to unbalanced networks. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is sublinear for both the dynamic regret and the violation of coupled inequality constraints.

It is shown that the optimal initial condition of the costate variable must be a fixed-point, for any time, of the composition of the forward and backward flows of the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics. Such an abstract property is then translated into a constructive condition by relying on a sequence of repeated Lie brackets involving the Hamiltonian dynamics and evaluated at a single point in the state space. This leads to a system of algebraic equations in the unknown initial optimal costate that allows achieving a desired degree of accuracy of the approximation while always consisting of a number of equations equal to the dimension of the state of the underlying system, regardless of the achieved accuracy. A dual characterization of the optimal terminal value of the state is also discussed, together with a few computational aspects of the proposed strategy.},

Most existing results rely heavily on some global condition such as the Lipschitz condition, which has limitations in describing the strong nonlinearity of most real systems. Dealing with strong nonlinearity in the field of FTS is still a challenging problem. In this article, the FTS problem of impulsive dynamical networks with general nonlinearity (especially strong nonlinearity) is considered. In virtue of the concept of nonlinearity strength that quantizes the network nonlinearity, local FTS criteria are established, where the range of the admissible initial values and the settling time are solved. For the networks with weak nonlinearity, global FTS criteria that unify synchronizing, inactive, and desynchronizing impulses are derived. Differing from most existing studies on FTS, the node system here does not have to satisfy the global Lipschitz condition, therefore covering more situations that are practical. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A widely embraced approach to mitigate the dynamic degradation in low-inertia power systems is to mimic generation response using grid-connected inverters to restore the stiffness of the grid. In this article, we seek to challenge this approach and advocate for a principled design based on a systematic analysis of the performance trade-offs of inverter-based frequency control. With this aim, we perform a qualitative and quantitative study comparing the effect of conventional control strategies-droop control (DC) and virtual inertia (VI)-on several performance metrics induced by L 2 and L ∞ signal norms. By extending a recently proposed modal decomposition method, we capture the effect of step and stochastic power disturbances, and frequency measurement noise, on the overall transient and steady-state behavior of the system. Our analysis unveils several limitations of these solutions, such as the inability of DC to improve dynamic frequency response without increasing steady-state control effort, or the large frequency variance that VI introduces in the presence of measurement noise. We further propose a novel dynam-i-c droop controller (iDroop) that overcomes the limitations of DC and VI. More precisely, we show that iDroop can be tuned to achieve high noise rejection, fast system-wide synchronization, or frequency overshoot (Nadir) elimination without affecting the steady-state control effort share, and propose a tuning recommendation that strikes a balance among these objectives. Extensive numerical experimentation shows that the proposed tuning is effective even when our proportionality assumption is not valid, and that the particular tuning used for Nadir elimination strikes a good trade-off among various performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals, and then play them back to the system can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI models are sufficient for some applications, other CPS, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This article develops a linear time-varying (LTV) extension to previous dynamic watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using an LTV vehicle model.},

The ratio between these two costs is defined as the price of causality . It captures the additional cost of not knowing the future values of the uncertain demand signal. We consider two application contexts: Procuring energy reserves from a forward capacity market, and purchasing virtual machine instances from a cloud service. An upper bound on the price of causality is obtained, and the exact price of causality is computed for some special cases. The algorithmic basis for all these computations is set containment linear programming. A mechanism is proposed to allocate the procurement cost to consumers who in aggregate produce the demand signal. We show that the proposed cost allocation is fair, budget-balanced, and respects the cost causation principle. The results are validated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In anticoordination social contexts such as stock selection, resource allocation, and crowd dispersion, an individual earns more if the opponents adopt her opposite strategy. Based on their experience and available information, individuals may either evaluate all available options and decide on the most profitable one, or simply mimic successful others. These two types of decision-makers are known as best-responders and imitators, respectively. Previous studies have shown that in anticoordination social contexts, a population of best-responders reaches an equilibrium state, where every individual is satisfied with her decision, but a population of imitators is quite likely to never settle and undergo perpetual fluctuations. Most real-world populations, however, consist of both types of individuals, and it remains an open problem whether such mixed-populations eventually reach an equilibrium state. We provide a sharp, yet simple answer to this question: the population almost surely reaches an equilibrium if and only if it admits one. More specifically, we study a well-mixed population of both best-responders and imitators playing anticoordination games with two available strategies, cooperation and defection, and earning according to payoff matrices that can be unique to each player, resulting in a heterogeneous population. The individuals update their strategies asynchronously accordingly to their types: best-responders choose the strategy that maximizes their payoffs against the population and imitators copy the strategy of the individual earning the highest payoff. We find the necessary and sufficient condition for the population dynamics to admit an equilibrium, identify all possible equilibria, investigate their stability and perform convergence analysis.},

These opportunities also increase the complexity of controlling such systems optimally, which typically requires fast exploration of an increasingly large number of alternative operation strategies. Simulation and stochastic models have been particularly successful to support control and optimization of production systems, and methods have been developed to exploit them separately. Herein, we argue that the simultaneous use of these models can allow for better control and optimization by balancing the simulation accuracy, and related high computational costs, with the computational efficiency and lower accuracy of stochastic models. In this article, we assume that high fidelity models have higher accuracy and computational costs, and we present a novel multifidelity approach, which utilizes several models at different levels of fidelity to efficiently and effectively estimate and optimize the performance of asynchronous serial production lines with machines suffering from multiple failure types. Experimental results show that the multifidelity approach leads to better estimations, requiring less computational effort for optimization compared with the use of only high fidelity simulations.},

Furthermore, we develop an iterative projected gradient descent algorithm to obtain local solutions for the sparse MGEAP using a parameterization based on the Sylvester equation. We present a heuristic algorithm to compute the projections, which also provides a novel method to solve the sparse eigenvalue/pole assignment problem. Also, a relaxed version of the sparse MGEAP is presented and an algorithm is developed to obtain approximately sparse local solutions to the MGEAP.

To learn the optimal policy, we introduce a stochastic policy gradient ascent algorithm with the following three unique novel features. First, the stochastic estimates of policy gradients are unbiased. Second, the variance of stochastic gradients is reduced by drawing on ideas from numerical differentiation. Four, policy complexity is controlled using sparse RKHS representations. Novel feature, first, is instrumental in proving convergence to a stationary point of the expected cumulative reward. Novel feature, second, facilitates reasonable convergence times. Novel feature, third, is a necessity in practical implementations, which we show can be done in a way that does not eliminate convergence guarantees.

Many of the earliest versions of these works conclude asymptotic stability without proving that Zeno behavior, or deadlocks, do not occur along the trajectories of the system. More recent works that resolve this issue either: propose the use of a dwell time that forces interevent times to be lower bounded away from zero but sacrifice asymptotic convergence in exchange for practical convergence (or convergence to a neighborhood); guarantee non-Zeno behaviors and asymptotic convergence but do not provide a positive minimum interevent time guarantee; or are not fully distributed. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of these works provide no form of robustness analysis on the event-triggering strategy. More specifically, if arbitrarily small disturbances can remove the non-Zeno property then the theoretically correct algorithm may not actually be implementable. Instead, this article for the first time presents a fully distributed, robust, dynamic event-triggered algorithm, for general directed communication networks, for which a desired positive minimum interevent time can be chosen by each agent in a distributed fashion.

  abstract     = {Proportional-integral (PI) control/loop has been widely used in numerous industrial processes. This article focuses on integrating uncertainty estimator into PI controller for better robustness and transient performance against uncertain nonlinear coupling dynamics and time-varying disturbances. First, the descriptions for the sizes of three kinds of uncertainties in a class of multi-input-multi-output nonlinear systems are discussed. Then, the tuning laws of the typical uncertainty estimator, i.e., extended state observer (ESO), are quantitatively presented to ensure the stability of closed-loop systems. More importantly, it is shown that the desired transient performance of tracking error can be ensured by tuning the bandwidth of ESO. In addition, it is proven that much stronger disturbance rejection at low frequency can be achieved by integrating the uncertainty estimator module. The simulation results for calibration-free robotic eye-hand coordination system show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article is about a real-time model predictive control algorithm for large-scale, structured linear systems with polytopic control constraints. The proposed controller receives the current state measurement as an input, and computes a suboptimal control reaction by evaluating a finite number of piecewise affine functions that correspond to the explicit solution maps of small-scale parametric quadratic programming (QP) problems. We provide asymptotic stability guarantees, which can be verified offline. The feedback controller is computing approximations of the optimal input, because we are enforcing real-time requirements assuming that it is not possible to solve the given large-scale QP in the given amount of time. Here, a key contribution of this article is that we provide a bound on the suboptimality of the controller. The approach is illustrated by benchmark case studies.},

A novel distributed optimization algorithm called the push-sum dual gradient (PSDG) algorithm is proposed to solve the dual problem of the DMPC optimization problem in a fully distributed way. We prove that the sequences of the primal, and dual variables converge to their optimal values. Furthermore, to solve the implementation issues, stopping criteria are designed to allow early termination of the PSDG Algorithm, and the gossip-based push-sum algorithm is proposed to check the stopping criteria in a distributed manner. It is shown that the optimization problem is iteratively feasible, and the closed-loop system is exponentially stable.

Output feedback controlled-invariant (OFCI) polyhedra are used to ensure that state and input constraints are satisfied even in the presence of additive disturbances and measurement noise. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a polyhedral set to be OFCI are presented. A dynamic output feedback compensator is proposed through the construction of an OFCI set for an augmented system. Based on the measured output and on the compensator state, which constitutes an estimate of the system state, a suitable control sequence is computed via linear programming to enforce the constraints. The uncertainty on the state is progressively reduced using the contraction of an invariant set associated to the estimator. With our approach, as illustrated through numerical examples, by embedding the estimator in the compensator structure and using the OFCI concept, it is possible to obtain solutions with larger sets of admissible initial states and admissible initial estimation errors, compared to approaches available in the literature.},

In fact, we demonstrate that the displacement-consensus-based formation control is a particular case of our more general method. We then uncover robustness issues with undesired steady-state motions and resultant distorted shapes in undirected displacement-consensus-based formation control. In particular, these issues are triggered when neighboring agents mismeasure their relative positions, e.g., their onboard sensors are misaligned and have different scale factors. We will show that if all the sensing is close to perfect but different among the agents, then the stability of the system is compromised. Explicit expressions for the eventual nondesired velocity and shape&#39;s distortion are given as functions of the scale factors and misalignments for formations based on tree graphs.},

The restrictive repetitive conditions are relaxed by taking the LLC nonlinear nonaffine systems with iteratively variant initial states, reference trajectories, and exogenous disturbances into consideration. A new convergence analysis method is proposed by incorporating the mathematical induction with the contraction mapping principle (MI-CMP) to prove the boundedness of system variables, and bounded convergence of tracking error for a finite iteration as the first step. Then, the mathematical proof by contradiction is utilized along with the MI-CMP to further prove the robust convergence of the tracking error in any iteration to an error bound related to the bounds of the iteration-varying uncertainties and the sampling period. It is also shown that the tracking error converges to a smaller bound if the iteration-varying uncertainties disappear, even to zero if the sampling period approaches zero. In addition, an algorithm is provided to optimize the learning operator under the convergence condition. Theoretical results are further verified by simulations.},

This accounts for those situations in which some but not all of the state entries are uncertain at the initial, $t=0$ , and final time, $t=T$ . This problem entails nontrivial technical challenges, as the singularity of terminal state covariance causes the control to grow unbounded at the final time $T$ . Consequently, the entropic interpolation ( Schrödinger bridge ) is provided by a diffusion process, which is not finite energy , thereby placing this case outside of most of the current theory. In this article, we show that a feasible interpolation can be derived as a limiting case of earlier results for nondegenerate cases, and that it can be expressed in closed form. Moreover, we show that such interpolation belongs to the same reciprocal class of the uncontrolled evolution. By doing so, we also highlight a time symmetry of the problem, contrasting dual formulations in the forward and reverse time directions, where in each, the control grows unbounded as time approaches the endpoint (in the forward and reverse time direction, respectively).},

The network units can be classified into leaders and followers. This article focuses on characterizing the energy-related controllability in signed networks (i.e., the energy incurred by the leaders in the control of a network). To this end, controllability Gramian-based measures are exploited to quantify the difficulty of the control problem on signed networks in terms of the required control energy. Fundamental relationships between these measures and network topology are developed via graph Laplacian to characterize energy-related controllability. It is revealed that, for structurally unbalanced signed graphs, the energy-related controllability is closely related to the diagonal entries of the inverse of the graph Laplacian. It is also discovered that structurally balanced signed graphs and their corresponding unsigned graphs have the same energy-related controllability.},

To start with, we design the novel distributed high-gain observer and a high-gain K-filter for each follower, which are utilized to reconstruct the state of the leader and the follower, respectively. Subsequently, the consensus problem is transformed into the stability problem by introducing appropriate state transformation. By using the backstepping control method, the distributed output-feedback controller with an adaptive law is designed for each follower with the help of a Nussbaum-type function.

  abstract     = {A new approach for trajectory optimization of musculoskeletal dynamic models is introduced. The model combines rigid-body and muscle dynamics described with a Hill-type model driven by neural control inputs. The objective is to find input and state trajectories that are optimal with respect to a minimum-effort objective and meet constraints associated with musculoskeletal models. The measure of effort is given by the integral of pairwise average forces of the agonist-antagonist muscles. The concepts of flat parameterization of nonlinear systems and sum-of-squares optimization are combined to yield a method that eliminates the numerous set of dynamic constraints present in collocation methods. With terminal equilibrium, optimization reduces to a feasible linear program, and a recursive feasibility proof is given for more general polynomial optimization cases. The methods of the article can be used as a basis for fast, and efficient solvers for hierarchical, and receding-horizon control schemes. Two simulation examples are included to illustrate the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Network inference has been attracting increasing attention in several fields, notably systems biology and biomedicine. Indeed, one of our biggest challenges is to uncover and understand complex molecular networks behind cells and organisms. A network is mainly characterized by its topology and internal dynamics. In particular, sparse topologies with stable dynamics are properties present in most real-world networks. Moreover, experiments typically measure a partial set of nodes. Linear systems have been used as approximations of complex nonlinear systems in a wide range of applications. Although they exhibit simpler dynamics, they can easily model unmeasured nodes, e.g., via transfer functions, which is not possible for nonlinear systems. This article explores these properties and considers general linear network models. It develops a method, based on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, to estimate the confidence of all links and produce the most likely topology. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that our approach consistently produces more accurate networks compared with other state-of-the-art methods, including kernel-based methods, nonlinear ordinary-differential-equation-based methods (iCheMA), and machine-learning-based methods (dynGINIE3). We show that this is also true on a well-known biological nonlinear model. The proposed method can be used in a wide range of applications, such as systems biology and biomedicine, and fault detection and diagnosis.},

The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a filter capable of guaranteeing both the finite-horizon H ∞ performance index and the probability-guaranteed envelope-constraint.

To achieve this goal, controls at both the discrete-event level and the continuous-variable level are used. Control at the discrete-event level can force some forcible events, and disable some controllable events. For the case that all events are controllable and forcible, and the graph of the automaton is strongly connected, a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability is obtained, using some existing results on controllability of switched linear systems. For three other cases, sufficient conditions are derived. If a hybrid system is not controllable, we design a supervisor to control the discrete-event part to ensure that the system becomes controllable after some finite transitions if possible. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for such a discrete-event control to exist.},

First, different kinds of linearization of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems are presented. Then, the considered linearized model around any equilibrium is shown to be well-posed. Moreover, by using a Lyapunov-based approach, exponential stability is addressed. In the case when the reactor can exhibit only one equilibrium, it is shown that the latter is always exponentially stable. When three equilibrium profiles are exhibited, bistability is established, i.e. the stability pattern “(exponentially) stable-unstable-stable” is proven for the linearized model.

Specifically, controllability Gramian-based metrics, including average controllability and volumetric control energy, are characterized based on the Cartesian graph product, which reveals how the energy-related controllability of a composite network can be inferred from the spectral properties of the local factor systems. These results are then extended to layered control networks, a special, yet widely used, network structure in many man-made systems.

The problem is nontrivial in the setting of nonlinear and nonparametric system identification. Difficulties lie in the lack of structural information of the unknown system, unknown underlying probabilistic distributions, and unknown nonlinear correlations of variables. In this article, we present a way to rank variables according to goodness of fit (GoF). Asymptotic results are established, and numerical algorithms are proposed. The problem is cast in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that allows us to deal with nonparametric nature of the unknown system, to avoid making strong conditions on the unknown distributions, to link GoFs to computable conditional covariance operators on RKHS, and to develop computationally friendly numerical algorithms. Numerical simulations support the theoretical developments.},

  abstract     = {Structural balance is a classic property of signed graphs satisfying Heider&#39;s seminal axioms. Mathematical sociologists have studied balance theory since its inception in the 1940s. Recent research has focused on the development of dynamic models explaining the emergence of structural balance. In this article, we introduce a novel class of parsimonious dynamic models for structural balance based on an interpersonal influence process. Our proposed models are gradient flows of an energy function, called the dissonance function, which captures the cognitive dissonance arising from the violations of Heider&#39;s axioms. Thus, we build a new connection with the literature on energy landscape minimization. This gradient-flow characterization allows us to study the transient and asymptotic behaviors of our model. We provide mathematical and numerical results describing the critical points of the dissonance function.},

We study the perfect Bayesian equilibria of the game and identify a class of “near-piecewise-linear equilibria” when leader cares much more about being close to the follower than the state, and the state is highly volatile.

We design iterative algorithms to compute the PCIS within a given set. For systems with discrete spaces, the computations of the finite-, and infinite-horizon PCISs at each iteration are based on linear programming, and mixed integer linear programming, respectively. The algorithms are computationally tractable, and terminate in a finite number of steps. For systems with continuous spaces, we show how to discretize the spaces, and prove the convergence of the approximation when computing the finite-horizon PCISs. In addition, it is shown that an infinite-horizon PCIS can be computed by the stochastic backward reachable set from the RCIS contained in it. These PCIS algorithms are applicable to practical control systems. Simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results for motion planning.},

We propose a constrained cross-entropy-based method to solve this problem. The key idea is to transform the original constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one with a surrogate objective. The method explicitly tracks its performance with respect to constraint satisfaction and thus is well suited for safety-critical applications. We show that the asymptotic behavior of the proposed algorithm can be almost-surely described by that of an ordinary differential equation. Then, we give sufficient conditions on the properties of this differential equation for the convergence of the proposed algorithm. At last, we show the performance of the proposed algorithm in two simulation examples. In a constrained linear-quadratic regulator example, we observe that the algorithm converges to the global optimum with high probability. In a 2-D navigation example, we find that the algorithm effectively learns feasible policies without assumptions on the feasibility of initial policies, even with non-Markovian objective functions and constraint functions.},

In particular, our approach decomposes the given specification into simpler reachability tasks based on its automata representation. We, then, propose the use of so-called control barrier certificate to solve those simpler reachability tasks along with computing the corresponding controllers and probability bounds. Finally, we combine those controllers to obtain a hybrid control policy solving the considered problem. Under some assumptions, we also provide two systematic approaches for uncountable and finite input sets to search for control barrier certificates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a room temperature control and lane keeping of a vehicle modeled as a four-dimensional single-track kinematic model.

The derived sufficient conditions for the existence of the invariant manifold provide a tradeoff between the natural frequencies of the oscillators, coupling plasticity parameters, and the interconnection structure of the network. Furthermore, we study the robustness of the invariant manifold with respect to the perturbations of the interconnection topology, and establish structural, and quantitative constraints on the perturbation adjacency matrix preserving the invariant manifold.

  abstract     = {Controlled interacting particle systems such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the feedback particle filter (FPF) are numerical algorithms to approximate the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem in continuous time. The distinguishing feature of these algorithms is that the Bayesian update step is implemented using a feedback control law. It has been noted in the literature that the control law is not unique. This is the main problem addressed in this article. To obtain a unique control law, the filtering problem is formulated here as an optimal transportation problem. An explicit formula for the (mean-field type) optimal control law is derived in the linear Gaussian setting. Comparisons are made with the control laws for different types of EnKF algorithms described in the literature. Via empirical approximation of the mean-field control law, a finite-N controlled interacting particle algorithm is obtained. For this algorithm, the equations for empirical mean and covariance are derived and shown to be identical to the Kalman filter. This allows strong conclusions on convergence and error properties based on the classical filter stability theory for the Kalman filter. It is shown that, under certain technical conditions, the mean squared error converges to zero even with a finite number of particles. A detailed propagation of chaos analysis is carried out for the finite-N algorithm. The analysis is used to prove weak convergence of the empirical distribution as N→ ∞. For a certain simplified filtering problem, analytical comparison of the mse with the importance sampling-based algorithms is described. The analysis helps explain the favorable scaling properties of the control-based algorithms reported in several numerical studies in recent literature.},

This article explores the construction of Wasserstein ambiguity sets in dynamic scenarios, where data are collected progressively and may only reveal partial information about the unknown random variable. For random variables evolving according to known dynamics, we leverage assimilated samples to make inferences about their unknown distribution at the end of the sampling horizon. Under exact knowledge of the flow map, we provide sufficient conditions that relate the growth of the trajectories with the sampling rate to establish a reduction of the ambiguity set size as the horizon increases. Furthermore, we characterize the exploitable sample history that results in a guaranteed reduction of ambiguity sets under errors in the computation of the flow and when the dynamics is subject to bounded unknown disturbances. Our treatment deals with both full- and partial-state measurements and, in the latter case, exploits the sampled-data observability properties of linear time-varying systems under irregular sampling. Simulations on an unmanned aerial vehicle detection application show the superior performance resulting from the proposed dynamic ambiguity sets.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of verifying discrete-time stochastic systems against omega-regular specifications using finite-state abstractions. Omega-regular properties allow specifying complex behavior and encompass, for example, linear temporal logic. We focus on a class of systems with mixed monotone dynamics. This class is shown to be amenable to efficient reachable set computation and models a wide range of physically relevant systems. In general, finite-state abstractions of continuous state stochastic systems give rise to augmented Markov chains wherein the probabilities of transition between states are restricted to an interval. We present a procedure to compute a finite-state interval-valued Markov chain (IMC) abstraction of discrete-time, mixed monotone stochastic systems subject to affine disturbances given a rectangular partition of the state space. Then, we suggest an algorithm for performing verification against omega-regular properties in IMCs. Specifically, we aim to compute bounds on the probability of satisfying a specification from any initial state in the IMC. This is achieved by solving a reachability problem on the sets of so-called winning and losing components in the Cartesian product between the IMC and a Rabin automaton representing the specification. Next, the verification of IMCs may yield a set of states whose acceptance status is undecided with respect to the specification, requiring a refinement of the abstraction. We describe a specification-guided approach that compares the best and worst case behaviors of accepting paths in the IMC and targets the appropriate states accordingly. Finally, we show a case study.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the decentralized optimization problem where a group of agents with coupled private objective functions work together to exactly optimize the summation of local interests. Upon modeling the decentralized problem as an equality-constrained centralized one, we leverage the linearized augmented Lagrangian method to design an event-triggered decentralized algorithm that only requires light local computation at generic time instants and peer-to-peer communication at sporadic triggering time instants. The triggering time instants for each agent are locally determined by comparing the deviation between true and broadcast primal variables with certain triggering thresholds. Provided that the threshold is summable over time, we establish a new upper bound for the effect of triggering behavior on the primal-dual residual. Based on this, the same convergence rate O(1/k) with periodic algorithms is secured for nonsmooth convex problems. Stronger convergence results are obtained for strongly convex and smooth problems, that is, the iterates linearly converge with exponentially decaying triggering thresholds. Finally, the developed strategy is examined with two common optimization problems; comparison results illustrate its performance and superiority in exploiting communication resources.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of convergence to a saddle point of a concave-convex function via gradient dynamics. Since first introduced by Arrow, Hurwicz, and Uzawa, such dynamics have been extensively used in diverse areas; there are, however, features that render their analysis nontrivial. These include the lack of convergence guarantees when the concave-convex function considered does not satisfy additional strictness properties and also the nonsmoothness of subgradient dynamics. Our aim in this two-part article is to provide an explicit characterization to the asymptotic behavior of general gradient and subgradient dynamics applied to a general concave-convex function in C 2 . We show that despite the nonlinearity and nonsmoothness of these dynamics, their ω-limit set is comprised of trajectories that solve only explicit linear ODEs characterized within this article. More precisely, in part I, an exact characterization is provided to the asymptotic behavior of unconstrained gradient dynamics. We also show that when convergence to a saddle point is not guaranteed, then the system behavior can be problematic, with arbitrarily small noise leading to an unbounded second moment for the magnitude of the state vector. In part II, we consider a general class of subgradient dynamics that restrict trajectories in an arbitrary convex domain, and show that when an equilibrium point exists, the limiting trajectories belong to a class of dynamics characterized in part I as linear ODEs. These results are used to formulate corresponding convergence criteria and are demonstrated with examples.},

General arrival processes and general discrete stochastic service time are assumed. An infinite-horizon Markov decision process model is proposed to maximize the expected total discounted net reward comprising admission revenues and overcapacity costs. Through formal proofs, the optimal quota control which makes decisions before knowing demand information is found to be equivalent to the optimal classical admission control which makes decisions after knowing such information when the service time is deterministic or no more than two periods. This equivalence is shown numerically when the service time is no more than four periods. Furthermore, structural properties of the optimal quota control and bounds of the optimal quota are established. Finally, several heuristic policies are proposed and compared by numerical experiments.},

The MATR of T-APIC is estimated and the criteria of stabilization to ISS via T-APIC are derived. Moreover, the state dependent E-APIC is proposed to reduce the conservativeness in time-triggered APIC. The algorithm and MATR are given for E-APIC to achieve the stabilization. Finally, one example with numerical simulations is given. It is shown that E-APIC has best performances with least number of control actions and lowest activation time rate than the periodic intermittent control (PIC) and T-APIC, and T-APIC has also better performance than PIC.},

By the performance analysis, it can be found that the CF has a better performance than the distributed fusion with feedback, especially at the beginning of the estimation. Moreover, the performance of the local estimator can be improved by receiving the fused estimate from the fusion center, which is different from the fusion estimation in linear systems.

The problem is reduced to a restricted form of an exterior algebra problem (decomposability of multivectors), which is referred to as partial decomposability problem. We study this problem and in case that this problem has no solution, we examine the problem of approximate partial decomposability. We treat the problem of exact or partial decomposability into a vector and a multivector of lower dimension. If this procedure is repeated then this results in an approximation of the initial multivector into a decomposable vector. The approximation of a vector by an optimal decomposable multivector is a nonlinear procedure and has been solved completely using the power method. The method developed in this article, although it produces a suboptimal solution, can be used alternatively for the solution of DAP or the approximate DAP, as a shorter and easier approach, because it is based on known tools as the singular value decomposition. We apply these results to treat the restricted approximate decomposability problem, which leads to approximate solutions to the pole placement and zero assignment problems.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear systems with time delays have been object of intense investigation in the last decades for their ability of capturing the behavior of many natural and engineering systems, including ecological, biomedical, industrial, robotic, and networked systems. In this article, a method for the event-triggered stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense of nonlinear time-delay systems with time-varying state delays is presented. The approach exploits control Lyapunov-Razumikhin functions and a spline-based approximation of the functional state feedback, resulting in a finite-memory controller that avoids (by construction) continuous-state monitoring while ensuring also that the minimal interevent time is strictly positive. Examples of application of the illustrated technique highlight the potential of the approach taken.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the problem of formulating an adaptive model-predictive control strategy for constrained uncertain systems. We consider a linear system in the presence of bounded time-varying additive uncertainty. The uncertainty is decoupled as the sum of a process noise with known bounds and a time-varying offset that we wish to identify. The time-varying offset uncertainty is assumed unknown pointwise in time. Its domain, called the feasible parameter set, and its maximum rate of change are known to the control designer. As new data become available, we refine the feasible parameter set with a set-membership-method-based approach, using the known bounds on process noise. We consider the case of probabilistic constraints on system states, with hard constraints on actuator inputs. We robustly satisfy the imposed constraints for all possible values of the offset uncertainty in the feasible parameter set. By imposing adequate terminal conditions, we prove recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated with a detailed numerical example.},

The state sampling is implemented by an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) and the sampled data are transmitted through a limited-bandwidth digital channel. The main challenge of such a work comes from the quantizer saturation and quantization error in the SMC design with finite-level quantization and the mismatched control caused by the switch and event-triggered sampling. To solve the above problem, we at first present an ETM and a limited-information-based SMC law. Then, a new discrete-time level-sets method is proposed to develop the dynamic quantization policy (DQP). If the disturbance bound is known, the DQP can avoid the quantizer saturation without the need of online detection. A switching law and quantization parameter conditions are provided to ensure the convergence of the state trajectory. At last, the result is generalized to the unknown bound of disturbance. The limited-information control problem of a single-link manipulator is taken as a potential application of the proposed method.},

The new approach is based on a two degrees of freedom control scheme where the output r(k) of a feedforward input estimator is used as input forcing the closed-loop system Σ f . This latter is given by the feedback connection of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) plant with a dynamic output controller. The task of the controller is to guarantee the stability of Σ f , as well as the fulfillment of hard constraints for any r(k) satisfying an “a priori” determined admissibility condition. The input r(k) is computed through the online minimization of a quadratic cost functional and is applied to Σ f according to the usual MPC strategy. To simplify the constrained optimization problem, the input r(k) forcing Σ f is assumed to be given by a B-spline function. This greatly decreases the number of decision variables of the online optimization procedure because B-splines are universal approximators which admit a parsimonious parametric representation. Moreover such parameterization allows us to reformulate the minimization of the cost functional as a box Constrained Least Squares (CLS) problem. It is shown that stability and recursive feasibility of the adopted MPC strategy are guaranteed in advance, regardless the chosen prediction horizon.},

  abstract     = {In order to deal with issues caused by the increasing penetration of renewable resources in power systems, this article proposes a novel distributed frequency control algorithm for each generating unit and controllable load in a transmission network to replace the conventional automatic generation control. The targets of the proposed control algorithm are twofold. First, it is to restore the nominal frequency and scheduled net interarea power exchanges after an active power mismatch between generation and demand. Second, it is to optimally coordinate the active powers of all controllable units in a distributed manner. The designed controller only relies on local information, computation, and peer-to-peer communication between cyber-connected buses, and it is also robust against uncertain system parameters. Asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system under the designed algorithm is analyzed by using a nonlinear structure-preserving model including the first-order turbine-governor dynamics. Finally, case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The interest is motivated by the study of several complex systems arising in social sciences, where a population of agents interacts according to a communication graph. These dynamics over networks often exhibit an oscillatory behavior, given the stochastic effects or the random nature of the local interactions process. Inspired by recent results on estimation of vector autoregressive processes, we propose a method to estimate the social network topology and the strength of the interconnections starting from partial observations of the interactions, when the whole sample path cannot be observed due to limitations of the observation process. Besides the design of the method, our main contributions include a rigorous proof of the convergence of the proposed estimators and the evaluation of the performance in terms of complexity and number of sample. Extensive simulations on randomly generated networks show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

We use this to study inefficiency due to selfish routing and bound the price of anarchy (PoA), the maximum ratio between total delay experienced by selfish users and the minimum possible total delay. To do so, we establish two road capacity models, each corresponding to an assumption regarding the platooning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Using these, we develop a class of road delay functions, parameterized by the road capacity, that are polynomial with respect to vehicle flow. We then bound the PoA and the bicriteria, another measure of the inefficiency due to selfish routing, for general networks with multiple source-destination pairs. We find these bounds depend on: the degree of the polynomial in the road delay function; and the degree of asymmetry, the difference in how human-driven and autonomous traffic affect road delay. We demonstrate that these bounds recover the classical bounds when no asymmetry exists. We show the bounds are tight in certain cases and that the PoA bound is order optimal with respect to the degree of asymmetry.},

Furthermore, we investigate the conditions under which positive gain can be assured within the GSLS setup for both deterministic stock price evolution and geometric Brownian motion. In contrast to existing literature in this area (which places less emphasis on the practical application of SLS strategies), we suggest optimization procedures for selecting the control parameters based on historical data, and we extensively test these procedures across a large number of real stock price trajectories (495 in total). We find that the implementation of such optimization procedures greatly improves the performance compared with fixing control parameters, and, indeed, the GSLS strategy outperforms the simpler SLS strategy in general.},

However, the control problem over fading channels is far from resolved. In this article, we investigate learning control over fading channels to gradually improve tracking performance. We observe that the effect of fading on input transmission greatly compromises tracking ability in practical implementations. We examine three average techniques: moving average, general average with all historical information, and forgetting-based average. The results reveal a tradeoff between learning ability and tracking ability for learning control algorithms, where learning ability refers to the convergence rate of a proposed learning algorithm, and tracking ability refers to the final tracking precision of the output to the desired reference. The convergence results for the three schemes with these averaging techniques are strictly proved. The results demonstrate that the forgetting-based average operator-based scheme can connect the other two schemes by tuning the forgetting factor. We also provide extensions of several general scenarios to expand the application range. Illustrative simulations verify the theoretical results.},

By exploiting results from operator theory, we are able to prove the almost sure convergence of the proposed algorithm under general assumptions on the distribution of communication loss and node activation events. By further assuming the cost functions to be strongly convex, we prove the linear convergence of the algorithm in mean to a neighborhood of the optimal solution and provide an upper bound to the convergence rate.

First, we consider systems with global Lipschitz continuous coefficients and show that when the original stochastic system without delay is pth moment exponentially stable, the system with small delays is still pth moment exponentially stable. In particular, when the pth moment exponential stability is based on Lyapunov conditions, we can obtain explicit delay bounds for moment exponential stability. Then, we consider a class of stochastic systems with nonglobal Lipschitz conditions and find a delay bound for almost sure and mean square exponential stability.

Then, necessary and sufficient conditions for network localizability are given. Finally, a distributed network localization protocol is proposed, which can globally estimate the locations of all the free nodes of a network if the network is infinitesimally angle-displacement rigid.

The original measurement data are finally reconstructed by a watermark remover. To allow the detection of replay attacks, the watermarking filters are devised as hybrid switching systems, whose parameters are assumed to be unknown to the adversary. Design rules are provided, guaranteeing that the nominal closed-loop performance is not deteriorated by the watermarking scheme and ensuring robust stability with mismatched filter parameters. Moreover, we design a switching protocol with no communication overhead to allow the watermarking filters to synchronously update their parameters.

In virtually all papers that use this framework, bounds in terms of the maximal allowable transmission interval (MATI) are provided to guarantee stability, and performance properties of the NCS. However, having only such a MATI condition is rather restrictive, and unrealistic in practice due to various network effects such as packet losses, leading to conservative bounds. In this article, we therefore consider an alternative condition on the communication instants to better capture the time-varying properties of the transmission intervals. In particular, we propose, in addition to the existence of a MATI, to also impose a bound on the average allowable transmission interval, expressed in terms of a reverse average dwell-time condition on the transmission intervals. We demonstrate by means of a novel Lyapunov-based analysis that stability of the NCS can still be guaranteed under this different condition on the transmission intervals, which can, in addition, lead to a significant improvement of the MATI. The strengths of these new results will be illustrated on a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {In this article the problem of ellipsoidal bounding of convex set-valued data, where the convex set is obtained by the p-sum of finitely many ellipsoids, for any real p ≥ 1 is studied. The notion of p-sum appears in the Brunn-Minkowski-Firey theory in convex analysis, and generalizes several well-known set-valued operations, such as the Minkowski sum of the summand convex sets (here, ellipsoids). We derive an outer ellipsoidal parameterization for the p-sum of a given set of ellipsoids, and compute the tightest such parameterization for two optimality criteria: minimum trace and minimum volume. For such optimal parameterizations, several known results in the system-control literature are recovered as special cases of our general formula. For the minimum volume criterion, our analysis leads to a fixed point recursion over a scalar that parameterizes the shape matrix of the outer ellipsoid. This recursion is proved to be contractive, and found to converge fast in practice. We apply these results to compute the forward reach sets for a linear control system subject to different convex set-valued uncertainty models for the initial condition and control, generated by varying p ∈ [1,∞]. Our numerical results show that the proposed fixed point algorithm offers more than two orders of magnitude speed-up in computational time for p=1, compared to the existing semidefinite programming approach without significant effect on the numerical accuracy. For p &gt; 1, the reach set computation results reported here are novel. Our results are expected to be useful in real-time safety critical applications, such as decision making, for collision avoidance of autonomous vehicles, where the computational time scale for reach set calculation needs to be much smaller than the vehicular dynamics time scale.},

  abstract     = {Discrete-time stochastic systems are an essential modeling tool for many engineering systems. We consider stochastic control systems that are evolving over continuous spaces. For this class of models, methods for the formal verification and synthesis of control strategies are computationally hard and generally rely on the use of approximate abstractions. Building on approximate abstractions, we compute control strategies with lower- and upper-bounds for satisfying unbounded temporal logic specifications. First, robust dynamic programming mappings over the abstract system are introduced to solve the control synthesis and verification problem. These mappings yield a control strategy and a unique lower bound on the satisfaction probability for temporal logic specifications that is robust to the incurred approximation errors. Second, upper-bounds on the satisfaction probability are quantified, and properties of the mappings are analyzed and discussed. Finally, we show the implications of these results to continuous state space of linear stochastic dynamic systems. This abstraction-based synthesis framework is shown to be able to handle infinite-horizon properties. Approximation errors expressed as deviations in the outputs of the models and as deviations in the probabilistic transitions are allowed and are quantified using approximate stochastic simulation relations.},

Specifically, for unconstrained, smooth, strongly convex optimization problems, we examine the mean-squared error in the optimization variable when the iterates are perturbed by additive white noise. This type of uncertainty may arise in situations where an approximation of the gradient is sought through measurements of a real system or in a distributed computation over a network. Even though the underlying dynamics of first-order algorithms for this class of problems are nonlinear, we establish upper bounds on the mean-squared deviation from the optimal solution that are tight up to constant factors. Our analysis quantifies fundamental tradeoffs between noise amplification and convergence rates obtained via any acceleration scheme similar to Nesterov&#39;s or heavy-ball methods. To gain additional analytical insight, for strongly convex quadratic problems, we explicitly evaluate the steady-state variance of the optimization variable in terms of the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the objective function. We demonstrate that the entire spectrum of the Hessian, rather than just the extreme eigenvalues, influences robustness of noisy algorithms. We specialize this result to the problem of distributed averaging over undirected networks and examine the role of network size and topology on the robustness of noisy accelerated algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In hybrid model predictive control (MPC), a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) is solved at each sampling time to compute the optimal control action. Although these optimizations are generally very demanding, in MPC, we expect consecutive problem instances to be nearly identical. This article addresses the question of how computations performed at one time step can be reused to accelerate (warm start) the solution of subsequent MIQPs. Reoptimization is not a rare practice in integer programming: for small variations of certain problem data, the branch-and-bound algorithm allows an efficient reuse of its search tree and the dual bounds of its leaf nodes. In this article, we extend these ideas to the receding-horizon settings of MPC. The warm-start algorithm we propose copes naturally with arbitrary model errors, has a negligible computational cost, and frequently enables an a priori pruning of most of the search space. Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence show that the proposed method tends to reduce the combinatorial complexity of the hybrid MPC problem to that of a one-step look-ahead optimization, greatly easing the online computation burden.},

For an acyclic graph under the condition of diagonal dominance, the algorithm is shown to converge to the correct solution in a finite number of iterations, equaling the graph diameter. For a loopy graph, the algorithm is shown to converge to the correct solution asymptotically.

A sensor collects measurements of a physical plant, and transmits the data to a remote estimator as a secondary user (SU) in the shared network. The existence of the primal users (PUs) brings exogenous uncertainties into the transmission scheduling process, and how to design an event-based scheduling scheme considering these uncertainties has not been addressed in the literature. In this article, we start from the formulation of a discrete-time remote estimation process in the CRSN, and then analyze the hidden information contained in the absence of data transmission. In order to achieve a better tradeoff between estimation performance and communication consumption, we propose both open-loop and closed-loop schedules using the hidden information under a Bayesian setting. The open-loop schedule does not rely on any feedback signal but only works for stable plants. For unstable plants, a closed-loop schedule is designed based on feedback signals. The parameter design problems in both schedules are efficiently solved by convex programming. Numerical simulations are included to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Rigorous analysis shows that, if there almost surely (i.e., with probability 1) exists a policy that satisfies the relaxed product MDP, any algorithm that optimizes the expected utility is guaranteed to find such a policy.

Using the notion of passivity and the idea of small bounded feedback, we present a discrete-time adaptive controller that globally adaptively stabilizes a class of nonaffine systems with unknown parameters, under the assumptions that the unforced dynamics are stable and the controllabilitylike rank conditions hold. The latter is shown to be characterizable by the vector fields f(x,0,θ) and ∂f/∂u(x, 0, θ), together with their “Lie derivatives” and “Lie brackets” in discrete time.},

A representative measure of performance is employed and the Value function of the attendant game is obtained. It is shown that the Value function is continuously differentiable and that it satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation-the curse of dimensionality is overcome and the optimal strategies are obtained. The cases of N=M and N &gt; M are considered. In the latter case, cooperative guidance strategies are also developed in order for the pursuers to exploit their numerical advantage.

We consider a setup where the reference signal (also known as setpoint) is generated by a control center remotely located with respect to a standard feedback controller. In this scenario, an attacker with sufficient resources can exploit the communication channel to alter the setpoint signal and ultimately affect the tracking performance of the control system. With respect to this problem, we propose a novel distributed control architecture that, taking advantage of peculiar capabilities of the command governor control paradigm, enables the detection of reference attacks. We formally prove that for constrained linear systems such detector exists. Moreover, by limiting the attacker&#39;s disclosure resources with superimposed cryptographically secure pseudorandom signals, we show that the absence of advanced stealthy attacks is also ensured. Finally, a solid numerical simulation investigating setpoint attacks on the flight control system of a single-engine fighter is presented to provide tangible evidence of the features of the presented methodology.},

Focusing on discrete-time evolutions of scalar agents, we provide a novel theoretical framework to study the dynamical properties of OMASs. Specifically, we propose a suitable notion of stability and derive sufficient conditions for it. Our analysis regards the arrival/departure of agents as a disturbance; consistently, our stability conditions require the effect of arrivals/departures to be bounded (in a precise sense) and the OMASs to be contractive in the absence of arrivals/departures. In order to provide an example of application for this theory, we reformulate the well-known proportional dynamic consensus for OMASs, and we study the stability properties of the resulting open proportional dynamic consensus algorithm.},

Note that the risk-neutral stochastic optimal control problem corresponds to the BSDE objective functional with linear growth coefficient, which can be viewed as a special case of the article. We obtain the generalized risk-sensitive dynamic programming principle for the value function via the backward semigroup associated with the BSDE. Then we show that the corresponding value function is a viscosity solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Under an additional parameter condition, the viscosity solution is unique, which implies that the solution characterizes the value function.

In order for the problem to be well post, two compression protocols are introduced. One requires that the last event is always kept. The other requires that, for any loop substring, at least one event is kept. We say a compressed string is recoverable if we can uniquely determine the source string based on the knowledge of the given discrete event system. We first construct an automaton to present all the possible source strings for a given compressed string. Based on the automaton, an algorithm is proposed to check whether the given compressed string is recoverable or not. We then propose an algorithm to calculate a minimal recoverable compressed string for a source string. The compressed string satisfies monotonicity which can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. Finally, we use a practical example to illustrate these results.},

In this article, we address the problems of distributed estimation and control of node centrality in undirected graphs with asymmetric weight values. In particular, we focus our attention on α-centrality, which can be seen as a generalization of eigenvector centrality. In this setting, we first consider a distributed protocol where agents compute their α-centrality, focusing on the convergence properties of the method; then, we combine the estimation method with a distributed iteration to achieve a consensus value weighted by the influence of each node in the network. Finally, we formulate an α-centrality control problem, which is naturally decoupled, and thus, suitable for a distributed setting and we apply this formulation to protect the most valuable nodes in a network against a targeted attack, by making every node in the network equally important in terms of α-centrality. Simulations results are provided to corroborate the theoretical findings.},

Given an ordered pair of states of a BCN, we define the set of reachable time steps as the set of positive integer k&#39;s where there exists a control sequence such that the BCN can be steered from one state to the other in exactly k time steps; and the set of unreachable time steps as the set of k&#39;s where there does not exist any control sequence such that the BCN can be steered from one state to the other in exactly k time steps.

Each player can only have access to its own cost function, its own set constraint, and a local block of the inequality constraint, and can only communicate with its neighbors via a connected graph. Moreover, players do not have prior knowledge of their future cost functions. To address this problem, an online distributed algorithm is proposed based on consensus algorithms and a primal-dual strategy. The performance of the algorithm is measured by using dynamic regrets. Under mild assumptions on graphs and cost functions, we prove that if the deviation of the variational GNE sequence increases within a certain rate, then the regrets, as well as the violation of inequality constraint, grow sublinearly.

The infinite horizon control moves are parameterized as the parameter-dependent dynamic output feedback (PDDOF) laws. In contrast to the traditional single-step approach where one PDDOF law is utilized, in this article a periodic approach where a sequence of PDDOF laws, which are invoked periodically in the future predictions, are applied. The regions of attraction for the periodic approach are considerably larger, and the control performance improved, as compared with the single-step approach. The recursive feasibility, and convergence of augmented state and output/input, are guaranteed. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of this approach.},

A fresh insight into this established problem is provided via novel stability conditions that require the solution to a family of differential Lyapunov equations and algebraic Lyapunov equations. The proposed analysis, which leads to a peculiar Lyapunov function that is decreasing in between and at switching instants, enjoys the following properties: it achieves the same dwell time as the well-known result in the research “stability and stabilization of continuous time switched linear systems” by Geromel and Colaneri; it removes the increasing computational complexity of the linear interpolation method; it leads to a straightforward counterpart for discrete-time switched linear systems.We show the application of this methodology to the problem of adaptive control of switched linear systems with parametric uncertainties.},

To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to study Byzantine-resilient optimization where no central coordinating agent exists, and we are the first to characterize the structures of the convex coefficients of the achievable global objectives. Dealing with Byzantine faults is very challenging. For example, in contrast to fault-free networks, reaching Byzantine-resilient agreement even in the simplest setting is far from trivial.

Therefore, we consider enforcing the property of shifted passivity by designing a state feedback, namely, shifted passivity via feedback. This introduced concept brings more insight into the stabilization of pH systems, and a set of partial differential equations is derived such that its solution specifies a state feedback achieving shifted passivity via feedback. Based on the framework of shifted passivity via feedback, a group of sufficient conditions is given such that a proposed proportional control with respect to a designed power shaping output can achieve closed-loop asymptotic stability.

We assume a priori knowledge of the minimal activation time of the plant transitions and the maximum communication delays, and propose an equivalent untimed model that takes into account all possible observation delays and also loss of observations.

  abstract     = {We study distributed optimization problems over a network when the communication between the nodes is constrained, and therefore, information that is exchanged between the nodes must be quantized. Recent advances using the distributed gradient algorithm with a quantization scheme at a fixed resolution have established convergence, but at rates significantly slower than when the communications are unquantized. In this article, we introduce a novel quantization method, which we refer to as adaptive quantization, that allows us to match the convergence rates under perfect communications. Our approach adjusts the quantization scheme used by each node as the algorithm progresses: as we approach the solution, we become more certain about where the state variables are localized and adapt the quantizer codebook accordingly. We bound the convergence rates of the proposed method as a function of the communication bandwidth, the underlying network topology, and structural properties of the constituent objective functions. In particular, we show that if the objective functions are convex or strongly convex, then using adaptive quantization does not affect the rate of convergence of the distributed subgradient methods when the communications are quantized, except for a constant that depends on the resolution of the quantizer. To the best of our knowledge, the rates achieved in this article are better than any existing work in the literature for distributed gradient methods under finite communication bandwidths. We also provide numerical simulations that compare convergence properties of the distributed gradient methods with and without quantization for solving distributed regression problems for both quadratic and absolute loss functions.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of seeking a common fixed point for a finite collection of nonexpansive operators over time-varying multi-agent networks in real Hilbert spaces. Each operator is assumed to be only privately and approximately known to each individual agent, and all agents need to cooperate to solve this problem by local communications over time-varying networks. To handle this problem, inspired by the centralized inexact Krasnoselski i-Mann iteration, we propose a distributed algorithm, called distributed inexact averaged operator algorithm (DIO). It is shown that the DIO can converge weakly to a common fixed point of the family of nonexpansive operators. Moreover, under the assumption that all operators and their own fixed point sets are (boundedly) linearly regular, it is proved that the distributed averaged operator algorithm converges with a rate O(γ log16(4k) ) for some constant γ ∈ (0,1), where k is the iteration number. To reduce computational complexity, a scenario, where only a random part of coordinates of each operator is computed at each iteration, is further considered. In this case, a corresponding algorithm, named distributed block-coordinate inexact averaged operator algorithm, is developed. The algorithm is proved to be weakly convergent to a common fixed point of the group of considered operators almost surely, and, with the extra assumption of (bounded) linear regularity, the distributed block-coordinate averaged operator algorithm is convergent in the mean square sense with a rate O(η log4(4k) ) for some constant η ∈ (0,1). Furthermore, it is shown that the same convergence rates can still be guaranteed under a more relaxed (bounded) power regularity condition. A couple of examples are finally presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Unfortunately, these approaches are generally conservative for most practical problems. For this sake, this article proposes a tube-based MPC consisting of MPC and control contraction metric (CCM) controller. The MPC is utilized as a nominal controller to generate a reference trajectory, while the CCM controller is used as a local ancillary controller to guarantee the actual trajectory to be contained within a robust invariant tube centered along the reference trajectory. Besides, we construct a variational formulation multidimensional Taylor network (MTN) as the basis function to search for the minimal geodesic. With the effective training algorithm, MTN could efficiently approximate the solution with high accuracy. The incremental exponential stability of the considered systems is proved theoretically, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {We consider a model predictive control setting, where we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to exploit problem structure. We take advantage of interacting components in the controlled system by decomposing its dynamics with virtual subsystems and virtual inputs. We introduce subsystem-individual penalty parameters together with optimal selection techniques. Further, we propose a novel measure of system structure, which we call separation tendency. For a sufficiently structured system, the resulting structure-exploiting method has the following characteristics: its computational complexity scales favorably with the problem size; it is highly parallelizable; it is highly adaptable to the problem at hand; and even for a single-thread implementation, it improves the overall performance. We show a simulation study for cascade systems, and compare the new method to conventional ADMM.},

Our interest is on big-data problems in which there is a large number of variables to optimize. If treated by means of standard distributed optimization algorithms, these large-scale problems may be intractable due to the prohibitive local computation and communication burden at each node. We propose a novel distributed solution method where, at each iteration, agents update in an uncoordinated fashion only one block of the entire decision vector. To deal with the nonconvexity of the cost function, the novel scheme hinges on successive convex approximation techniques combined with a novel blockwise perturbed push-sum consensus protocol, which is instrumental to perform local block-averaging operations and tracking of gradient averages. Asymptotic convergence to stationary solutions of the nonconvex problem is established. Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and highlight how the block dimension impacts on the communication overhead and practical convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the design and analysis of multiple moving target defenses for recognizing and isolating attacks on cyber-physical systems. We consider attackers who perform integrity attacks on some set of sensors and actuators in a control system. In such cases, it has been shown that a model aware adversary can carefully design attack vectors to bypass bad data detection and identification filters while causing damage to the control system. To counter such an attacker, we propose the moving target defense which introduces stochastic, time-varying parameters in the control system. The underlying random dynamics of the system limit an attacker&#39;s knowledge of the model and inhibit his or her ability to construct stealthy attack sequences. Moreover, the time-varying nature of the dynamics thwarts adaptive adversaries. We explore three main designs. First, we consider a hybrid system where parameters within the existing plant are switched among multiple modes. We demonstrate how such an approach can enable both the detection and identification of malicious nodes. Next, we investigate the addition of an extended system with dynamics that are coupled to the original plant but do not affect the system performance. Here, an attack on the original system will affect the authenticating subsystem and in turn be revealed by a set of sensors measuring the extended plant. Finally, we propose the use of sensor nonlinearities to enhance the effectiveness of the moving target defense. The nonlinear dynamics act to conceal normal operational behavior from an attacker who has tampered with the system state, further hindering an attacker&#39;s ability to glean information about the time-varying dynamics. In all cases mechanisms for analysis and design are proposed. Finally, we analyze attack detectability for each moving target defense by investigating expected lower bounds on the detection statistic. Our contributions are also tested via simulation.},

This article proposes novel gradient-flow schemes that yield convergence to the optimal point of a convex optimization problem within a fixed time from any given initial condition for unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, and min-max problems. It is shown that the solution of the modified gradient-flow dynamics exists and is unique under certain regularity conditions on the objective function, while fixed-time convergence to the optimal point is shown via Lyapunov-based analysis. The application of the modified gradient flow to unconstrained optimization problems is studied under the assumption of gradient dominance, a relaxation of strong convexity. Then, a modified Newton&#39;s method is presented that exhibits fixed-time convergence under some mild conditions on the objective function. Building upon this method, a novel technique for solving convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints that yields convergence to the optimal point in fixed time is developed. Finally, the general min-max problem is considered, and a modified saddle-point dynamics to obtain the optimal solution in fixed time is developed.},

First, two scalar examples to illustrate how to deal with time-varying parameters in the feedback path and in the input path, respectively, are discussed. The control problem for an $n$ -dimensional lower triangular system via state feedback is then discussed to show how to combine the congelation of variables method with adaptive backstepping techniques. To achieve output regulation problem via output feedback, problem which cannot be solved directly due to the coupling between the input and the time-varying perturbation, the ISS of the inverse dynamics, referred to as strong minimum-phaseness, is exploited. This allows converting such coupling into the coupling between the output and the time-varying perturbation. A set of filters, resulting in ISS state estimation error dynamics, are designed to cope with the unmeasured state variables. Finally, a controller is designed based on a small-gain-like analysis that takes all subsystems into account. Simulation results show that the proposed controller achieves asymptotic output regulation and outperforms the classical adaptive controller, in the presence of time-varying parameters that are neither known nor asymptotically constant.},

We frame this question in the context of graphical coordination games, where the agents in a network choose between two conventions and derive benefits from coordinating neighbors, and system performance is measured in terms of the agents&#39; welfare. In this article, we assess an operator&#39;s ability to mitigate two types of attacks: 1) broad attacks, where the adversary distributes targeted incentives to all agents in the network; and 2) focused attacks, where the adversary can force a selected subset of the agents to commit to a prescribed convention. The system operator can among a class of distributed algorithms that define the local interactions. Our main contribution characterizes the operator&#39;s fundamental tradeoff between security against worst-case broad attacks and vulnerability from focused attacks. We show that this tradeoff significantly improves when the operator selects a decision-making process at random.

This problem can be viewed as an extension of the problem of designing the transition probabilities of a Markov chain so that the process is exponentially stabilized to a target stationary distribution. Alternatively, it can be seen as an extension of the classical control problem of asymptotically stabilizing a discrete-time system to a single point, which corresponds to the Dirac measure in the measure stabilization framework. We assume that the target measure is supported on the entire state space of the system and is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Under the condition that the system is locally controllable at every point in the state space within one time step, we show that the associated measure stabilization problem is well-posed. Given this well-posedness result, we then frame an infinite-dimensional convex optimization problem to construct feedback control laws that stabilize the system to a target invariant measure at a maximized rate of convergence. We validate our optimization approach with numerical simulations of two-dimensional linear and nonlinear discrete-time control systems.},

In this situation, synchronization can be achieved via adaptive protocols (with adaptive feedback gains or adaptive coupling gains, or both). However, as state-of-the-art synchronization methods adopt a distributed observer architecture, they require to communicate extra observer variables among neighbors, in addition to the neighbors&#39; states (or outputs). The distinguishing feature of this article is to show that for heterogeneous and uncertain networks of some classes of linear systems, synchronization is possible without the need for any distributed observer. Such classes are in line with those in model reference adaptive control literature. Lyapunov analysis is used to derive a new adaptive synchronization protocol with the simplest communication architecture, in which both feedback and coupling gains are adapted without any extra communication other than neighbors&#39; states (in the full-state information case) or neighbors&#39; outputs (in the partial-state information case).},

  abstract     = {We consider the distributed weight balancing problem in networks of nodes that are interconnected via directed edges, each of which admits a positive integer weight. A digraph with positive integer weights on its edges is weight balanced if, for each node, the sum of the weights of the incoming edges equals the sum of the weights of the outgoing edges. In this article, we develop a distributed iterative algorithm, which solves the integer weight balancing problem in the presence of arbitrary (time-varying and inhomogeneous) time delays that might affect transmissions at particular links. We assume that each positive weight is constrained to lie within a certain interval, captured by individual lower and upper limits and that communication between neighboring nodes is bidirectional. We show that even when different transmissions on communication links are affected from bounded delays, the proposed distributed algorithm allows nodes to obtain a set of weights that solves the integer weight balancing problem, after a finite number of iterations, as long as a feasible solution exists. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate the operation and performance of the proposed algorithm.},

The results demonstrate that the multiplicity of nonminimum phase (NMP) zeros and unstable poles of the plant can affect the tracking performance limitations. The explicit quantitative relationship is characterized for the tracking performance limitations, which is derived based on NMP zeros, unstable poles of the plant with corresponding multiplicity, as well as the statistical characteristics of the reference noise and communication noise. The admissible infimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also obtained for the tracking system by using a 2DOF controller structure, where the admissible infimal SNR can satisfy the stability conditions while achieving tracking performance limitations.

Two problems have been extensively studied. One is the consentable problem when the current state information is available for the controller. The other is that the state information is delayed for the controller in which we propose a novel predictorlike control protocol. It is obtained that the multiagent system with system matrices $A=B=1$ is mean-square consentable for both problems. In particular, the mean-square consensus value is the average of all agents’ initial states.

The algorithms available in literature are either computationally too expensive or only give an approximation. In this article, we derive an analytic expression for both the expectation and the chance constraint of a MPS function. Both can be written in the form of a piecewise polynomial function in the components of the control variables. The analytic function can be derived offline and can be evaluated online in a quick and efficient way.

We approach this problem via a new functional generalization of stochastic quasi-gradient methods operating in tandem with stochastic sparse subspace projections. The result is an extension of gradient temporal difference learning that yields nonlinearly parameterized value function estimates of the solution to the Bellman evaluation equation. We call this method parsimonious kernel gradient temporal difference learning. Our main contribution is a memory-efficient nonparametric stochastic method guaranteed to converge exactly to the Bellman fixed point with probability 1 with attenuating step-sizes under the hypothesis that it belongs to the RKHS. Further, with constant step-sizes and compression budget, we establish mean convergence to a neighborhood and that the value function estimates have finite complexity. In the Mountain Car domain, we observe faster convergence to lower Bellman error solutions than existing approaches with a fraction of the required memory.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates global practical output tracking via adaptive output feedback for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. Remarkably, the control problem under investigation is in the context of unknown control directions and output feedback, which severely restricts the system nonlinearities. Nevertheless, the growth on the unknown system nonlinearities in this article is extended from polynomial (of output) to arbitrary function, and meanwhile no further a priori information is required on the reference signal to be tracked. Specifically, sufficiently smooth pseudosign and pseudo-dead-zone functions are introduced acting as substitutions of sign and dead-zone functions in the literature, respectively. Typically, based on the pseudo-dead-zone function, a delicate estimate on the unknown system nonlinearities is established and a novel Lyapunov function is proposed. This, together with the elegant system performance analysis, is quite critical to remove the polynomial constraint and overcome the technical obstacle stemming from the essential extension. Additionally owing to the two refined functions, the use of smooth domination/treatment is moderately avoided in control design that enables the established control strategy to be tighter and less conservative. It turns out that under the proposed adaptive output-feedback controller, all the closed-loop system states are globally bounded, while the system tracking error enters a prescribed λ neighborhood of the origin in finite time and remains inside thereafter. A simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article studies online stochastic optimization, where the random parameters follow time-varying distributions. In each time slot, after a control variable is determined, a sample drawn from the current distribution is revealed as feedback information. This form of stochastic optimization has broad applications in online learning and signal processing, where the underlying ground-truth is inherently time-varying, e.g., tracking a moving target. Dynamic optimal points are adopted as the performance benchmark to define the regret of algorithms, as opposed to the static optimal point used in stochastic optimization with fixed distributions. Unconstrained stochastic optimization with time-varying distributions is first examined and a projected stochastic gradient descent algorithm is presented. An upper bound on its regret is established with respect to the drift of the dynamic optima, which measures the temporal variations of the underlying distributions. In particular, the algorithm possesses sublinear regret as long as the drift of the optima is sublinear, i.e., the distributions do not vary too drastically. Further, a stochastic saddle point method involving only iterative closed-form computation is proposed for constrained stochastic optimization with time-varying distributions. Upper bounds on its regret and constraint violation are developed with respect to the drift of the optima. Analogously, sublinear regret and sublinear constraint violation can be ensured provided that the drift of the optima is sublinear. Finally, numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and the derived analytical results.},

We then investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties of the W 2 -MHE against the backdrop of the classical notion of strong local observability. Motivated by applications where the measurement data used by the estimator is to be kept private, we then propose a mechanism to incorporate differential privacy in the estimation method, based on an entropy regularization of the MHE objective functional.

Next, a direct algorithm is proposed to select poles for the rational orthogonal basis functions. Different poles result in different bases and these selections guarantee that better approximations can be reached. For different systems, there are different sequences of poles selected for basis functions, which shows the adaptivity of the proposed algorithms.

  abstract     = {The main challenge for adaptive regulation of linear-quadratic systems is the tradeoff between identification and control. An adaptive policy needs to address both the estimation of unknown dynamics parameters (exploration), as well as the regulation of the underlying system (exploitation). To this end, optimism-based methods that bias the identification in favor of optimistic approximations of the true parameter are employed in the literature. A number of asymptotic results have been established, but their finite-time counterparts are few, with important restrictions. This article establishes results for the worst-case regret of optimism-based adaptive policies. The presented high probability upper bounds are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The nonasymptotic analysis of this article requires the following very mild assumptions: stabilizability of the system&#39;s dynamics, and limiting the degree of heaviness of the noise distribution. To establish such bounds, certain novel techniques are developed to comprehensively address the probabilistic behavior of dependent random matrices with heavy-tailed distributions.},

  abstract     = {Consider a remote estimation problem where a sensor wants to communicate the state of an uncertain source to a remote estimator over a finite-time horizon. The uncertain source is modeled as an autoregressive process with bounded noise. Given that the sensor has a limited communication budget, the sensor must decide when to transmit the state to the estimator who has to produce real-time estimates of the source state. In this article, we consider the problem of finding a scheduling strategy for the sensor and an estimation strategy for the estimator to jointly minimize the worst-case maximum instantaneous estimation error over the time horizon. This leads to a decentralized minimax decision-making problem. We obtain a complete characterization of optimal strategies for this decentralized minimax problem. In particular, we show that an open-loop communication scheduling strategy is optimal and the optimal estimate depends only on the most recently received sensor observation.},

  abstract     = {We consider a decentralized networked control system (DNCS) consisting of a remote controller and a collection of linear plants, each associated with a local controller. Each local controller directly observes the state of its colocated plant and can inform the remote controller of the plant&#39;s state through an unreliable uplink channel. The downlink channels from the remote controller to local controllers were assumed to be perfect. The objective of the local controllers and the remote controller is to cooperatively minimize the infinite horizon time average of expected quadratic cost. The finite horizon version of this problem was solved in our prior work (“Optimal local and remote controllers with unreliable uplink channels,” IEEE, May 2019). The optimal strategies in the finite horizon case were shown to be characterized by coupled Riccati recursions. In this article, we show that if the link failure probabilities are below certain critical thresholds, then the coupled Riccati recursions of the finite horizon solution reach a steady state and the corresponding decentralized strategies are optimal. Above these thresholds, we show that no strategy can achieve finite cost. We exploit a connection between our DNCS Riccati recursions and the coupled Riccati recursions of an auxiliary Markov jump linear system to obtain our results. Our main result in Theorem 1 explicitly identifies the critical thresholds for the link failure probabilities and the optimal decentralized control strategies when all link failure probabilities are below their thresholds.},

In this article, we establish precise relationships between these two systems and their Lyapunov matrices.

The signals are transmitted via noisy network channels and distortions can be caused by channel noises. As such, the binary encoding schemes, which take advantages of the robustness of the binary data, are exploited during the signal transmission. More specifically, under such schemes, the original signals are encoded into a bit string, transmitted via memoryless binary symmetric channels with certain crossover probabilities, and eventually restored by a decoder at the receiver. Novel centralized and decentralized moving-horizon estimators in the presence of the binary encoding schemes are constructed by solving the respective global and local least-square optimization problems. Sufficient conditions are obtained through intensive stochastic analysis to guarantee the stochastically ultimate boundedness of the estimation errors.

In recent years, it has been demonstrated that their robustness can be further enhanced with the use of arbitrary relative degree sliding variables. However, reaching laws using such variables only ensure a good sliding mode performance of the system when the perturbations affecting the plant are matched, which is a very restrictive assumption. To address this issue and to further improve robustness of the plant, in this article, we propose a new model reference approach for strategies with relative degree two sliding variables. In the proposed approach, the reaching law is first used to control the evolution of a disturbance-free model of the plant, and then, the original system state is driven toward that of the model with a secondary controller. It will be shown that the proposed approach ensures better system robustness compared to the conventional reaching law approach and that it does not require the assumption about matched uncertainties.},

As is well known, one of its most serious drawbacks is the presence of chattering. To alleviate this problem, higher order sliding mode (HOSM) approaches have been proposed, which also allow dealing with high relative degree plants. To gain more flexibility in the controller design and to boost performance, switched and variable-gain approaches are being developed for first and second-order sliding mode controllers. This article introduces a conceptual framework to merge the two aspects, providing a general methodology for the design and tuning of high-order sliding mode controllers. The main strength of the method is its generality, in that it accommodates a generic order r sliding mode controller, and it encompasses both continuous and discrete variation of the controller parameters, the latter giving rise to switched strategies. The properties of the closed-loop system are formally analyzed, and the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in simulation on examples of switched and variable gain HOSM controllers.},

For bounded additive output measurement noise, we propose a robust modification of the scheme, including a slack variable with regularization in the cost. We prove that the application of this robust MPC scheme in a multistep fashion leads to practical exponential stability of the closed loop w.r.t. the noise level.

We show that several popular and widely used optimization criteria in the literature belong to this class of controllability metrics. Our main result is to provide a polynomial-time actuator schedule that on average selects only a constant number of actuators at each time step, independent of the dimension, to furnish a guaranteed approximation of the controllability metrics in comparison to when all actuators are in use.

It presents innovative adaptive event-triggered state-feedback protocols with novel composite event-triggering conditions. Two specific designs in terms of different event-triggering conditions and laws of adaption are first discussed for linear MASs on strongly connected directed graphs, which are then extended to general directed graphs that contain a spanning tree. Moreover, another adaptive event-triggered protocol is proposed for solving leader-follower consensus that tracks a leader of a bounded control input. The protocols inherit the merits of both adaptive control and event-triggered control: the protocols can be implemented in a fully distributed way, since the Laplacian is avoided in design, and each agent only needs to know the relative information between neighbors at discrete instants determined by event-triggering conditions. Compared with the existing related results, the proposed protocols are applicable for linear MASs on general directed graphs, and moreover, the time-dependent term in the event-triggering conditions is allowed to be a class of positive L 1 functions. Two numerical examples clearly verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we mainly focus on the persistence of delayed complex balanced systems. We first give the ω-limit set theorem for this kind of system which says that ω-limit set can be the single constant positive equilibrium or the set of constant equilibria on the boundaries. In addition, we derive several sufficient conditions to diagnose the persistence of delayed complex balanced chemical reaction network systems equipped with mass-action kinetics based on the situation of the boundary of stoichiometric compatibility class. Then, we can directly obtain that delayed complex balanced systems with two-dimensional stoichiometric subspace are persistent. Furthermore, we prove the abovementioned systems are globally asymptotically stable at the corresponding positive equilibrium if the trajectory starts from a positive initial function. We illustrate the analysis by two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Opacity is an important information-flow security property in the analysis of cyber-physical systems. It captures the plausible deniability of the system&#39;s secret behavior in the presence of an intruder that may access the information flow. Existing works on opacity only consider nonmetric systems by assuming that the intruder can always distinguish between two different outputs precisely. In this article, we extend the concept of opacity to systems whose output sets are equipped with metrics. Such systems are widely used in the modeling of many real-world systems whose measurements are physical signals. A new concept called approximate opacity is proposed in order to quantitatively evaluate the security guarantee level with respect to the measurement precision of the intruder. Then, we propose a new simulation-type relation, called approximate opacity-preserving simulation relation, which characterizes how close two systems are in terms of the satisfaction of approximate opacity. This allows us to verify approximate opacity for large-scale, or even infinite, systems using their abstractions. We also discuss how to construct approximate opacity-preserving symbolic models for a class of discrete-time control systems. Our results extend the definitions and analysis techniques for opacity from nonmetric systems to metric systems.},

This calls for efficient mechanisms for secure transmission of data since control systems are becoming increasingly distributed over larger geographical areas. Distortion-based security, recently proposed as one candidate for secure transmissions in CPS, is not only more appropriate for these applications but also quite frugal in terms of prior requirements on shared keys. In this article, we propose distortion-based metrics to protect CPS communication and show that it is possible to confuse adversaries with just a few bits of preshared keys.

  abstract     = {The general context of this article is the feedback control of an infinite-dimensional system so that the closed-loop system satisfies a fading-memory property and achieves the setpoint tracking of a given reference signal. More specifically, this article is concerned with the proportional-integral (PI) regulation control of the left Neumann trace of a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation with a delayed right Dirichlet boundary control. In this setting, the studied reaction-diffusion equation might be either open-loop stable or unstable. The proposed control strategy goes as follows. First, a finite-dimensional truncated model that captures the unstable dynamics of the original infinite-dimensional system is obtained via spectral decomposition. The truncated model is then augmented by an integral component on the tracking error of the left Neumann trace. After resorting to the Artstein transformation to handle the control input delay, the PI controller is designed by pole shifting. Stability of the resulting closed-loop infinite-dimensional system, consisting of the original reaction-diffusion equation with the PI controller, is then established, thanks to an adequate Lyapunov function. In the case of a time-varying reference input and a time-varying distributed disturbance, our stability result takes the form of an exponential input-to-state stability (ISS) estimate with fading memory. Finally, another exponential ISS estimate with fading memory is established for the tracking performance of the reference signal by the system output. In particular, these results assess the setpoint regulation of the left Neumann trace in the presence of distributed perturbations that converge to a steady-state value and with a time derivative that converges to zero. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the efficiency of our control strategy.},

The central question is to solve the posterior conditional density function of the states, which satisfies the Kushner or the Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ) equation after suitable change of probability measure. In this article, we shall follow the so-called Yau-Yau&#39;s algorithm to split the solution of the DMZ equation into on- and off-line part, where the off-line part is to solve the forward Kolmogorov equation (FKE) with the initial conditions to be the orthonormal bases in some suitable function space. Instead of the generalized Hermite function investigated by the second and the third author of this article, we shall explore the generalized Legendre polynomials. The Legendre spectral method (LSM) is used to numerically solve the FKE. Under certain conditions, the convergence rate of LSM is twice faster than that of the Hermite spectral method. Two two-dimensional numerical experiments of NLF problems (time-invariant and time-varying cases) have been numerically solved to illustrate the feasibility of our algorithm. Our algorithm outperforms the extended Kalman Filter and particle filter in both real-time manner and accuracy.},

The network approach allows for efficient exploration of the state space and allows all agents to converge to the optimal solution even in situations where neither agent can converge on its own without cooperation. The second scenario is that of multiagent games, in which the state is global and rewards are local. In this scenario, agents collaborate to estimate the value function of a target team policy. The proposed algorithm combines off-policy learning, eligibility traces, and linear function approximation.

The state-dependent multiplicative noise is assumed to occur randomly based on a stochastic variable obeying the Gaussian white distribution. To tackle the difficulties caused by the multiplicative noise, a novel backstepping-based control framework is developed to design both the virtual control laws and the actual control law for the original nonlinear system, and such a framework is fundamentally different from the traditional n-step predictor strategy. The proposed design scheme provides an effective way in establishing the relationship between the system states and the controlled errors, by which a noise-intensity-dependant stability condition is derived to ensure that the closed-loop system is exponentially mean-square stable for exactly known systems. To further cope with nonlinear modeling uncertainties, the radial basis function neural network (NN) is employed as a function approximator. In virtue of the proposed backstepping-based control framework, the ideal controller is characterized as a function of all system states, which is independent of the virtual control laws. Therefore, only one NN is employed in the final step of the backstepping procedure and, subsequently, a novel adaptive neural controller (with modified weight updating laws) is presented to ensure that both the neural weight estimates and the system states are uniformly bounded in the mean-square sense under certain stability conditions. The control performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated through simulation results.},

We focus on the realistic case where the sensing design is selected among a finite set of available sensors, where each sensor is associated with a different cost (e.g., power consumption). We consider two dual problem instances: sensing-constrained LQG control, where one maximizes a control performance subject to a sensor cost budget, and minimum-sensing LQG control, where one minimizes a sensor cost subject to performance constraints. We prove that no polynomial time algorithm guarantees across all problem instances a constant approximation factor from the optimal. Nonetheless, we present the first polynomial time algorithms with per-instance suboptimality guarantees. To this end, we leverage a separation principle, which partially decouples the design of sensing and control. Then, we frame LQG codesign as the optimization of approximately supermodular set functions; we develop novel algorithms to solve the problems; and we prove original results on the performance of the algorithms and establish connections between their suboptimality and control-theoretic quantities.

  abstract     = {This article presents a computational framework to efficiently generate feasible and safe trajectories for multiple autonomous vehicle operations. We formulate the optimal motion planning problem as a continuous-time optimal control problem, and approximate its solutions in a discretized setting using Bernstein polynomials. The latter possess convenient properties that allow to efficiently compute and enforce constraints along the vehicles&#39; trajectories, such as maximum speed and angular rates, minimum distance between trajectories and between the vehicles and known obstacles, etc. Thus, the proposed method is particularly suitable for generating trajectories in real-time for safe operations in complex environments and multiple vehicle missions. We show, using a rigorous mathematical framework, that the solution to the discretized optimal motion planning problem converges to that of the continuous-time one. The advantages of the proposed method are investigated through numerical examples.},

To design the strategy, the phase portrait of the second order system in normal form associated with the formulated sliding mode control problem is studied. A sliding surface switching between arcs of parabolas is conceived to ensure the convergence in a predefined-time to the desired second order sliding mode. Lyapunov-based analysis and the reformulation of LaSalle-Yoshizawa results for nonsmooth systems are used to prove the uniform finite-time stability of the equilibrium consisting in the second order sliding mode enforcement. This in turn allows to prove the asymptotic convergence of the original plant state to the origin in spite of the uncertainties.},

Four types of detectabilities, namely, strong detectability, detectability, strong periodic detectability, and periodic detectability are defined in terms of different requirements for current state estimation. We first construct a deterministic finite state automaton (called observer) over a weighted alphabet and prove that it can be used as the current-state estimator of the studied UWA.

  abstract     = {We develop backstepping state feedback control to stabilize a moving shockwave in a freeway segment under bilateral boundary actuations of traffic flow. A moving shockwave, consisting of light traffic upstream of the shockwave and heavy traffic downstream, is usually caused by changes of local road situations. The density discontinuity travels upstream and drivers caught in the shockwave experience transitions from free to congested traffic. Boundary control design in this article brings the shockwave front to a static setpoint position, hindering the upstream propagation of traffic congestion. The traffic dynamics are described with Lighthil-Whitham-Richard model, leading to a system of two first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Each represents the traffic density of a spatial domain segregated by the moving interface. By Rankine-Hugoniot condition, the interface position is driven by flux discontinuity and thus governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) dependent on the PDE states. The control objective is to stabilize both the PDE states of traffic density and the ODE state of moving shock position to setpoint values. Using delay representation and backstepping method, we design predictor feedback controllers to cooperatively compensate state-dependent input delays to the ODE. From Lyapunov stability analysis, we show local stability of the closed-loop system in H 1 norm with an arbitrarily fast convergence rate. The stabilization result is demonstrated by a numerical simulation and the total travel time of the open-loop system is reduced by 12\% in the closed loop.},

In order to get less conservative stability criteria, a novel stability analysis method called a delay-mode-based LKF (DMBLKF) method is first presented for nonlinear delay systems. Compared with the LKF method, the main advantage of the DMBLKF method lies in relaxing the aforementioned requirement and leading to a less conservative criterion in stability analysis.

Afterwards, based on the partial sums of this series, two different methodologies are introduced to compute over- and under-approximations of reachable sets, using numerical quantifier elimination for the semi-algebraic constraints and remainder estimation of the partial sum, respectively. Some benchmarks are given, including an eight-dimensional nonpolynomial quadrotor model, to show the advantages of our computational methods over some existing methods in the literature.

An observer-based dynamic feedback compensator is constructed for exponential stabilization of the linear PDE. Poincaré–Wirtinger inequality and its variant in $N$ -D spatial domain are presented for the closed-loop stability analysis. By the Lyapunov direct method and Poincaré–Wirtinger inequality and its variant, sufficient conditions on the existence of such feedback compensator of the linear PDE are developed, and presented in term of standard linear matrix inequalities. Well-posedness is also analyzed for both open-loop PDE and resulting closed-loop coupled PDEs within the $C_0$ -semigroup framework.

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of global stabilization of discrete-time linear systems subject to input saturation and time delay. The considered time-delay systems are first transformed into delay-free systems based on prediction technique. Then, by utilizing saturation functions technique, the corresponding global stabilizing controllers are proposed for two special discrete-time linear systems-a chain of integrators and oscillators, and explicit conditions guaranteeing stability are also given. Both current and delayed feedback information are utilized in the controller design, and some free parameters are also introduced into these controllers. These advantages can help improve the control performance significantly. Subsequently, a systematic control design procedure for globally stabilizing general discrete-time linear systems subject to multiple inputs and/or multiple inputs delays is proposed. The design procedure is in an explicit and recursive way with explicit conditions guaranteeing stability being given, and thus is easier to use than the existing one. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approaches are illustrated by three numerical examples.},

Then, by incorporating a piecewise Lyapunov functional and some summation inequalities, a sufficient condition is established by means of linear matrix inequalities under which the closed-loop system is locally exponentially stable. Moreover, the conditions for two special cases with single state delay and single input delay are proposed.

The node importance is characterized by the stationary probabilities of the corresponding nodes in a Markov chain defined over the network, as in Google&#39;s PageRank. Unlike a deterministic network, the transition probabilities in a random network are unknown but can be estimated by sampling. Under a Bayesian learning framework, we apply the first-order Taylor expansion and normal approximation to provide a computationally efficient posterior approximation of the stationary probabilities. In order to maximize the probability of correct selection, we propose a dynamic sampling procedure, which uses not only posterior means and variances of certain interaction parameters between different nodes, but also the sensitivities of the stationary probabilities with respect to each interaction parameter. Numerical experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed sampling procedure.},

To alleviate the serious uncertainties and state constraints, the adaptive backstepping control and barrier Lyapunov function are combined in a unified framework. Then, by applying a function approximation method and the auxiliary system method to deal with input saturation respectively, two adaptive state-feedback controllers are constructed. Based on the proposed stochastic Lyapunov theorem, each constructed controller can guarantee the closed-loop system achieves SGFSP, the system states remain in the defined compact sets and the output tracks the reference signal very well.

The goal of distributed average consensus is for the nodes, each associated with some initial value, to obtain the average (or some value close to the average) of these initial values. In this article, we present and analyze a novel distributed averaging algorithm that operates exclusively on quantized values (specifically, the information stored, processed, and exchanged between neighboring agents is subject to deterministic uniform quantization) and relies on event-driven updates (e.g., to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage). We characterize the properties of the proposed distributed averaging protocol on quantized values and show that its execution, on any time-invariant and strongly connected digraph, will allow all agents to reach, in finite time, a common consensus value (represented as the ratio of two quantized values) that is equal to the exact average.},

The classical quadrature rules used in the sigma-point filters are motivated via polynomial approximation of the integrand; however, in the applied context, these assumptions cannot always be justified. As a result, a quadrature error can introduce bias into estimated moments, for which there is no compensatory mechanism in the classical sigma-point filters. This can lead in turn to estimates and predictions that are poorly calibrated. In this article, we investigate the Bayes-Sard quadrature method in the context of sigma-point filters, which enables uncertainty due to quadrature error to be formalized within a probabilistic model. Our first contribution is to derive the well-known classical quadratures as special cases of the Bayes-Sard quadrature method. Based on this, a general-purpose moment transform is developed and utilized in the design of a novel sigma-point filter, which explicitly accounts for the additional uncertainty due to quadrature error.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we examine a novel generic network cost minimization problem, in which every node has a local decision vector to optimize. Each node incurs a cost associated with its decision vector, while each link incurs a cost related to the decision vectors of its two end nodes. All nodes collaborate to minimize the overall network cost. The formulated network cost minimization problem has broad applications in distributed signal processing and control, in which the notion of link costs often arises. To solve this problem in a decentralized manner, we develop a distributed variant of Newton&#39;s method, which possesses faster convergence than alternative first-order optimization methods such as gradient descent and alternating direction method of multipliers. The proposed method is based on an appropriate splitting of the Hessian matrix and an approximation of its inverse, which is used to determine the Newton step. Global linear convergence of the proposed algorithm is established under several standard technical assumptions on the local cost functions. Furthermore, analogous to classical centralized Newton&#39;s method, a quadratic convergence phase of the algorithm over a certain time interval is identified. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its superiority over other first-order methods, especially when the cost functions are ill-conditioned. Complexity issues of the proposed distributed Newton&#39;s method and alternative first-order methods are also discussed.},

In this article, we will remove this restriction by employing a more general class of distributed control laws which includes a set of weight coefficients. By introducing the average radius for a switched matrix which is determined by the Laplacian matrix of the switching digraph of the multiagent system and the set of the weight coefficients, we show that the leader-following consensus problem is solvable if the product of this average radius and the spectral radius of the system matrix is less than unity. Since this average radius can be made less than unity by appropriately choosing the weight coefficients, our result applies to systems containing certain exponentially unstable modes. As a byproduct, the upper bound of the convergence rate can also be specified. Moreover, for the case where the switching digraph is acyclic jointly connected, we prove that the average radius can be made zero by a set of weight coefficients, and, hence, the leader-following consensus can always be achieved regardless of the system mode. Interestingly, the tracking error in this case vanishes in finite time.},

  abstract     = {In genetic regulatory networks (GRNs), gene mutations often occur in a stochastic manner. As an important model of GRNs, gene mutations of Boolean networks are always described as function perturbations. This article studies the robust stability and stabilization of Boolean networks with stochastic function perturbations. A kind of parameterized set is constructed, and it is revealed that under the stochastic function perturbations, the property of finite-time stability remains unchanged when the perturbed set and the parameterized set are disjoint. In addition, it is proved that the finite-time stability is reduced to stability in distribution when the intersection of perturbed set and complement set of parameterized set is nonempty. As an application, the robust stabilization problem of Boolean control networks with stochastic function perturbations is discussed, and several necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the robustness of feedback stabilizers. Finally, the obtained results are used to study the Drosophila melanogaster segmentation polarity gene network and the lac operon in the bacterium Escherichia coil.},

Robustness is understood as the capability of rejecting the effect of exogenous disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and uncertain couplings between the agents dynamics, by achieving the same emerging behavior as that corresponding to a reference multiagent system (MAS) designed to achieve a given coordination objective in the nominal case. The proposed approach yields a distributed state feedback which can seamlessly be integrated into existing distributed optimization and cooperative control protocols which are usually prone to disturbances and uncertainties corrupting the MAS dynamics. Nonsmooth Lyapunov analysis supports the claimed properties.

Fundamental to the proposed method is a fixed-point characterization of the winning set of the system with respect to a given specification, i.e., the initial states that can be controlled to satisfy the specification. The use of an adaptive partitioning scheme not only guarantees the approximation precision of the winning set but also reduces computational time.

The distribution of radical opinions serves as an infinite-dimensional exogenous input to the FP equation, visibly influencing the steady opinion profile. We establish mathematical properties of the FP equation. In particular, we, first, show the well-posedness of the dynamic equation, second, provide existence result accompanied by a quantitative global estimate for the corresponding stationary solution, and, third, establish an explicit lower bound on the noise level that guarantees exponential convergence of the dynamics to stationary state. Combining the results in second and third readily yields the input-output stability of the system for sufficiently large noises. Next, using Fourier analysis, the structure of opinion clusters under the uniform initial distribution is examined. The results of analysis are validated through several numerical simulations of the continuum-agent model (partial differential equation) and the corresponding discrete-agent model (interacting stochastic differential equations) for a particular distribution of radicals.},

To derive the regions along with their corresponding interevent times, we use approximations of isochronous manifolds , a notion first introduced in Anta and Tabuada (2012). This article addresses some theoretical issues of Anta and Tabuada (2012) and proposes an effective computational approach that generates approximations of isochronous manifolds, thus enabling the region-based STC scheme.

This article investigates the problem of designing observer-based stabilizing controllers for incrementally quadratic nonlinear systems with external disturbances. The nonlinearities considered in the system model satisfy the incremental quadratic constraints, which are characterized by incremental multiplier matrices and encompass many common nonlinearities. The simultaneous search for the observer and the controller gain matrices is formulated as a feasibility problem of linear matrix inequalities, for two parameterizations (i.e., the block diagonal parameterization and the block antitriangular parameterization) of the incremental multiplier matrices, respectively. The closed-loop system implementing the observer-based feedback controller is proven to be input-to-state stable with respect to external disturbances. Using the proposed continuous-time observer-based controllers, event-triggered controllers with time regularization are constructed for globally Lipschitz systems, such that the closed-loop system is Zeno-free and input-to-state practically stable.},

The reverse engineering further reveals a fundamental limitation of the nonincremental voltage control: the convergence condition is restrictive and prevents better voltage regulation at equilibrium. This motivates us to design two incremental local voltage control schemes based on the subgradient and pseudo-gradient algorithms, respectively, for solving the same optimization problem (forward engineering). The new control schemes decouple the dynamical property from the equilibrium property, and have much less restrictive convergence conditions. This article presents another step toward developing a new foundation—network dynamics as optimization algorithms—for distributed real-time control and optimization of future power networks.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on distributed convex optimization problems over an unbalanced directed multiagent (no central coordinator) network with inequality constraints. The goal is to cooperatively minimize the sum of all locally known convex cost functions. Every single agent in the network only knows its local objective function and local inequality constraint, and is constrained to a privately known convex set. Furthermore, we particularly discuss the scenario in which the interactions among agents over the whole network are subjected to possible link failures. To collaboratively solve the optimization problem, we mainly concentrate on an epigraph form of the original constrained optimization to overcome the unbalancedness of directed networks, and propose a new distributed asynchronous broadcast-based optimization algorithm. The algorithm allows that not only the updates of agents are asynchronous in a distributed fashion, but also the step-sizes of all agents are uncoordinated. An important characteristic of the proposed algorithm is to cope with the constrained optimization problem in the case of unbalanced directed networks whose communications are subjected to possible link failures. Under two standard assumptions that the communication network is directly strongly connected and the subgradients of all local objective functions are bounded, we provide an explicit analysis for convergence of the algorithm. Simulation results obtained by three numerical experiments substantiate the feasibility of the algorithm and validate the theoretical findings.},

Under the presence of a symmetry condition, we relax the conditions and this leads to optimal results for a large class of mean-field optimal team problems where the existing results have been limited to person-by-person optimality and not global optimality (under strict decentralization). In particular, we establish the optimality of symmetric (i.e., identical) policies for such problems. As a further condition, this optimality result leads to an existence result for mean-field teams. We consider a number of illustrative examples where the theory is applied to setups with either infinitely many DMs or an infinite-horizon stochastic control problem reduced to a static team.},

More precisely, we consider systems made of components where each component is equipped with a sampled-data controller with its own sampling period, resulting globally in a distributed multiperiodic sampled-data system. Moreover, controllers receive partial information on the state of the other components. We propose a component-based approach to controller synthesis, which relies on the use of abstractions and continuous-time assume-guarantee contracts. The abstractions describe the dynamics of the system from the point of view of each component based on the information structure, whereas assume-guarantee contracts specify guarantees that a component must satisfy if assumptions on the other components are met. We show that our approach makes it possible to decompose a global safety control problem into local ones that can be solved independently. We then show how symbolic control techniques can be used to synthesize controllers that enforce the local control objectives. Illustrative applications in building automation and vehicle platooning are shown.},

  abstract     = {We study synthesis problems with constraints in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), where the objective is to compute a strategy for an agent that is guaranteed to satisfy certain safety and performance specifications. Verification and strategy synthesis for POMDPs are, however, computationally intractable in general. We alleviate this difficulty by focusing on planning applications and exploiting typical structural properties of such scenarios; for instance, we assume that the agent has the ability to observe its own position inside an environment. We propose an abstraction refinement framework, which turns such a POMDP model into a (fully observable) probabilistic two-player game (PG). For the obtained PGs, efficient verification and synthesis tools allow to determine strategies with optimal safety and performance measures, which approximate optimal schedulers on the POMDP. If the approximation is too coarse to satisfy the given specifications, a refinement scheme improves the computed strategies. As a running example, we use planning problems where an agent moves inside an environment with randomly moving obstacles and restricted observability. We demonstrate that the proposed method advances the state of the art by solving problems several orders of magnitude larger than those that can be handled by existing POMDP solvers. Furthermore, this method gives guarantees on safety constraints, which is not supported by the majority of the existing solvers.},

In this article, we introduce a new control synthesis method for descriptor systems which is based on formal abstractions and enables control design over related reduced-order models. We leverage notions of exact and approximate similarity relations, which hold for the algebraic couplings that are inherent to descriptor systems. Using the behavioral framework, we extend a control refinement scheme for classical dynamical systems and develop a corresponding notion for descriptor systems: We show that any given well-posed controller of the abstract (reduced-order) descriptor system can be refined to a controller for the original descriptor system. The resulting controlled system preserves the same controlled output behavior in the case of exact similarity, whereas in the case of approximate similarity, the output behavior of the controlled descriptor system is shown to have a bounded deviation from that of the abstract model where the controller is designed.},

This article proposes a new abstraction characterized as a tradeoff curve between latency, reliability, and rate. Our aim is to understand-do we (control engineers) prefer faster but less reliable communications (with shorter codes), or slower but more reliable communications (with longer codes)? In this article, we examine the tradeoffs between latency and reliability for the problem of estimating dynamical systems over communication channels. Employing different latency-reliability curves derived from practical coding schemes, we develop a cross-layer design methodology, i.e., select the code length depending on the system dynamics to optimize system performance.},

Malicious attacks may prevent the system from satisfying the desired specification. In this article, we introduce a control synthesis method to minimize deviations from the desired specification due to adversaries. We consider the scenario where the adversary has limited capability of observing the controller&#39;s strategy. We synthesize a minimum violation control strategy for a finite-state stochastic game under cosafe linear temporal logic constraints. We formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear program for computing the optimal controller strategy and present two algorithms. First, we propose an exact algorithm that computes the optimal control strategy with probability one but without guarantees on the convergence rate. Second, we present an approximate algorithm that computes a suboptimal control strategy. The approximate algorithm converges faster compared to the exact algorithm; however, it only returns an optimal solution when the adversary has full observation over the controller&#39;s strategy. A numerical case study is presented to evaluate the proposed framework.},

Reach-avoid problems arise in many modern control applications of safety-critical systems, such as autonomous driving and human-robot collaboration. They require us to control all states from a set of initial states in finite time into a final set while guaranteeing the satisfaction of state and input constraints despite the presence of disturbances and uncertain measurements. We optimize over reachable sets, thereby, simultaneously improving the control performance and guaranteeing constraint satisfaction for all solutions. Moreover, our new approach involves a novel combination of state-dependent feedforward and feedback control, which leads to better control performance compared to the existing approaches as demonstrated in several numerical examples. Our algorithm is particularly suited for computing motion primitives used in maneuver automata, which realizes fast and efficient online planning. The online applicability is supported by the simple structure of the resulting controller, which is a time-varying linear tracking controller.},

Part I of this two-part article proposes a new control-theoretic framework, termed hierarchical selective recruitment (HSR), to rigorously explain the emergence of GDSA from the brain&#39;s network structure and dynamics. This part completes the development of HSR by deriving conditions on the joint structure of the hierarchical subnetworks that guarantee top-down recruitment of the task-relevant part of each subnetwork by the subnetwork at the layer immediately above, while inhibiting the activity of task-irrelevant subnetworks at all the hierarchical layers. To further verify the merit and applicability of this framework, we carry out a comprehensive case study of selective listening in rodents and show that a small network with HSR-based structure can explain the data with remarkable accuracy while satisfying the theoretical stability and timescale separation requirements of HSR. Our technical approach relies on the theory of switched systems and provides a novel converse Lyapunov theorem for state-dependent switched affine systems that is of independent interest.},

Despite decades of research in neuroscience, a comprehensive understanding of GDSA is still lacking. We propose a novel framework using concepts and tools from control theory as well as insights and structures from neuroscience. Central to this framework is an information-processing hierarchy with two main components: selective inhibition of task-irrelevant activity and top-down recruitment of task-relevant activity. We analyze the internal dynamics of each layer of the hierarchy described as a network with linear-threshold dynamics and derive conditions on its structure to guarantee existence and uniqueness of equilibria, asymptotic stability, and boundedness of trajectories. We also provide mechanisms that enforce selective inhibition using the biologically inspired schemes of feedforward and feedback inhibition. Despite their differences, both lead to the same conclusion: the intrinsic dynamical properties of the (not-inhibited) task-relevant subnetworks are the sole determiner of the dynamical properties that are achievable under selective inhibition.},

However, due to limited machine precision, this might not be possible in many practical applications. In this article, we analyze the aforementioned problem and show that the typical estimate is just one of the possible infinite solutions that can be leveraged, considering both the supervised and the semisupervised settings. We show under which conditions the infinite solutions are equivalent, and if it is not the case, we provide a bound on the mismatch between two generic solutions.

In the networked system, the multiple outputs of the plant and the controller are independently transmitted via a single shared or multiple channels based on local event-triggering conditions. Regarding the restrictions of physical devices, in the event-checking procedure, an inactive period of time is allowed after each event of data sending. So the Zeno behaviors in events are effectively avoided. In terms of algebraic properties of state-space models and time delays, we present sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability and guaranteed L 2 gain performance and characterize the robustness of the system in a time-delayed networked scenario with independent event-triggered sending of each output. The event-triggered approach provides the potential benefit of reduced number of requests for sending data via networks. A simulation example is given to verify the proposed methods.},

The attacker is both a pursuer (pursues the target) and an evader (evades the defender). Naturally, one wonders when and how the attacker can chase the target and when and how the attacker can evade the defender. In this article, we first analyze the possibility of winning the game for the attacker under the framework of games of kind. Then, we present three different stages and corresponding control strategies, as well as the conditions for switching stages. In addition, the target cooperates with the defender to compose a team as the opponent of the attacker. Different capture radii also affect cooperation between the target and defender. When the capture radius of the defender is less than that of the attacker, the target and defender cooperate to avoid being captured by the attacker or to extend the time to be captured. Conversely, when the capture radius of the attacker is less than that of the defender, the target-defender team can adopt a rendezvous strategy to end the engagement. We derive the initial state under which the target can rendezvous with the defender before the target is captured by the attacker.},

The proposed controller, based on the L 1 adaptive control architecture, is designed using the right interactor matrix and a suitably defined projection matrix. A state-output predictor, a low-pass filter, and adaptive laws are introduced that achieve output tracking of a desired reference signal. It is shown that the proposed control strategy guarantees closed-loop stability with arbitrarily small steady-state errors. The transient performance in the presence of nonzero initialization errors is quantified in terms of decreasing functions. Rigorous mathematical analysis and illustrative examples are provided to validate the theoretical claims.},

A novel value iteration (VI) based off-policy adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is proposed for a general class of CTLP systems, so that approximate optimal solutions can be obtained directly from the collected data, without the exact knowledge of system dynamics. Under mild conditions, the proofs on uniform convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal solutions are given for both the model-based and model-free cases. The VI-based ADP algorithm is able to find suboptimal controllers without assuming the knowledge of an initial stabilizing controller. Application to the optimal control of a triple inverted pendulum subjected to a periodically varying load demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Furthermore, the agents are subject to nonidentical topologies represented by two different signed digraphs that have a strongly connected union. It is shown that when considering signed networks subject to sign-consistent nonidentical topologies, polarization (respectively, neutralization) can be achieved if and only if the union of two signed digraphs is structurally balanced (respectively, unbalanced).

The method of Petrov-Galerkin is then used to approximate the balanced realization of the IDPHS by a finite dimensional port Hamiltonian system and to provide the associated reduced order LQG controller. The main advantages of the proposed method are that, first, both control and reduction are driven by closed-loop performances and that, second, due to the passivity properties of the controller the closed-loop stability is guaranteed when the finite dimensional controller is applied to the infinite dimensional system.},

To show the importance of this condition, we apply it to detect certain attacking schemes which are undetectable using simple statistics.

The agents exchange information with each other through directed graphs that are switched based on a new general switching law. Not all graphs contain a spanning tree with the leader as the root. Under this condition, a novel distributed switched observer is constructed for each follower, and it can accurately estimate the state information of the leader by means of the switching law. Subsequently, a unified distributed controller is designed for each follower with the observer. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is strictly proved that all agents can achieve a consensus with the controller. More importantly, our proposed algorithm can render the number of switches of the graphs to grow faster than an affine function of the length of a time interval, which greatly reduces the conservativeness on graphs switches. Moreover, the consensus algorithm has a wide application prospect in cooperative control. Finally, the effectiveness of theoretical results is illustrated by making numerical simulations.},

Then, a fully distributed event-triggered dynamic output feedback control law is proposed for each agent. Meanwhile, a fully distributed event-triggering mechanism is proposed such that each agent can determine when to broadcast its information to its neighbors. It is shown that with the proposed event-triggered control strategy, the cooperative output regulation problem is solved by intermittent communication in a fully distributed manner in the sense that no global information, such as the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix or the number of the agents, is used. It is also shown that Zeno behavior is excluded for each agent. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered control strategy.},

Moreover, serious parametric uncertainties are present in both PDE and ODE subsystems, which bring obstacles to the traditional methods on this issue. To solve the control problem, an infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation with time-varying matrix-valued kernel functions is adopted to change the original system into a new one. Then, an adaptive state-feedback controller is designed for the new system, which guarantees that all the closed-loop system states are bounded while regulating the original system states to zero.

This approach uses an online constructed tube in order to tighten the nominal (state and input) constraints. To facilitate an efficient online implementation, the shape of the tube is based on an offline computed incremental Lyapunov function with a corresponding (nonlinear) incrementally stabilizing feedback. Crucially, the online optimization only implicitly includes these nonlinear functions in terms of scalar bounds, which enables an efficient implementation. Furthermore, to account for an efficient evaluation of the worst case disturbance, a simple function is constructed offline that upper bounds the possible disturbance realizations in a neighborhood of a given point of the open-loop trajectory. The resulting MPC scheme ensures robust constraint satisfaction and practical asymptotic stability with a moderate increase in the online computational demand compared to a nominal MPC. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in comparison to state-of-the-art robust MPC approaches with a nonlinear benchmark example.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel robust state estimation method for discrete linear time-invariant systems by using the positive system theory and the set theory to overcome the disadvantages of interval observers and set-valued observers to finally achieve an expected balance between computational complexity and robust state estimation conservatism. The proposed method first transforms the system into an equivalent system with its system matrix in the canonical companion form. Then, based on this canonical companion form, we partition the equivalent system into two subsystems, where the first subsystem owns a nonnegative subsystem matrix and the second subsystem has a subsystem matrix including possible negative elements of the system matrix of the equivalent system. In this way, the design of interval observers is divided into two steps. The first step is to design an interval observer for the first subsystem based on the positive system theory. The second step is to design a zonotopic set-valued observer for the second subsystem based on the set theory. Consequently, a so-called set-theoretic interval observer (SIO) of the whole system can be synthesized by integrating the interval estimations and set-valued estimations of the two subsystems together. At the end, a numerical system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed SIO.},

The previous results on the output feedback robust MPC are extended to address the deception attacks. The mean-square quadratic boundedness is defined in order to characterize the closed-loop stability. An optimization problem is proposed, which can be solved by linear matrix inequality techniques. By a simple refreshment of the state estimation error set, the optimization problem is shown to be recursively feasible, and the augmented state converges to the neighborhood of equilibrium point.

Recently, a power analysis has also been used to characterize for every instant the effect of packet losses and channel fading. Here, we propose an equivalent average channel model that preserves the first and second moments of a fading channel output in steady state. The proposed equivalency is stated initially in an open loop, and then, with the assumption of a plant model with a relative degree greater or equal to one, extended to the closed-loop feedback allowing a stationary SNR analysis. As a result, we can compute the fading channel SNR for closed-loop stabilizability limitation, and then consider the presence of disturbance and setpoint signals.},

This problem naturally arises in many real-world applications ranging from wireless sensor networks to signal processing. We propose a class of online distributed optimization algorithms that are based on approximate mirror descent, which utilizes the Bregman divergence as a distance-measuring function that includes the Euclidean distances as a special case. We consider two standard information feedback models when designing the algorithms, that is, full-information feedback and bandit feedback. For the full-information feedback model, the first algorithm attains an average regularized regret of order O(1/√T) with the total number of rounds T. The second algorithm, which only requires the information of the values of the loss function at two predicted points instead of the gradient information, achieves the same average regularized regret as that of the first algorithm. Simulation results of a distributed online regularized linear regression problem are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

One of the earliest and most prominent approaches to this problem is Granger causality. It has been shown that in a network with linear dynamics and strictly causal transfer functions, Granger causality consistently reconstructs the underlying graph of the network. On the other hand, techniques that allow for the presence of direct feedthroughs usually assume there are no feedback loops in the dynamics of the network. In this article, we develop an extension of Granger causality that provides theoretical guarantees for the reconstruction of a network topology even in the presence of direct feedthroughs and feedback loops. The only required assumption is a relatively mild condition of well-posedness named recursiveness, where at least one strictly causal transfer function needs to be present in every feedback loop. The technique is compared with other state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark example specifically designed to include several dynamic configurations that are challenging to reconstruct.},

First, we provide distributed subsystem-level dissipativity analysis conditions whose feasibility is sufficient to guarantee dissipativity of the networked system. We then use these conditions to synthesize controllers locally at the subsystem-level, using only the knowledge of the dynamics of that subsystem, and limited information about the dissipativity of the subsystems to which it is dynamically coupled. We show that the subsystem-level controllers synthesized in this manner are sufficient to guarantee dissipativity of the networked dynamical system. We also provide an approach to make this synthesis compositional, that is, when a new subsystem is added to an existing network, only the dynamics of the new subsystem, and information about the dissipativity of the subsystems in the existing network to which it is coupled are used to design a controller for the new subsystem, while guaranteeing dissipativity of the networked system including the new subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this synthesis in enabling plug-and-play operations of generators in a microgrid by extending our results to networked switched systems.},

  abstract     = {The classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism ensures incentive compatibility, i.e., truth-telling is a dominant strategy for all agents, for a static one-shot game. However, it does not appear to be feasible to construct mechanisms that ensure dominance of dynamic truth-telling for agents comprised of general stochastic dynamic systems. The agents&#39; intertemporal net utilities depend on future controls and payments, and a direct extension of the VCG mechanism does not guarantee incentive compatibility. This article shows that such a stochastic dynamic extension does exist for the special case of linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) agents. In fact, it achieves subgame perfect dominance of truth-telling. This is accomplished through a construction of a sequence of layered payments over time that decouples the intertemporal effect of current bids on future net utilities if system parameters are known and agents are rational. An important motivating example arises in power systems where an independent system operator has to ensure balance of generation and consumption at all times, while ensuring social efficiency, i.e., maximization of the sum of the utilities of all agents. It is also necessary to satisfy budget balance and individual rationality. However, in general, even for static one-shot games, there is no mechanism that simultaneous satisfies these requirements while being incentive compatible and socially efficient. For a power market of LQG agents, we show that there is a modified “Scaled” VCG (SVCG) mechanism that does satisfy incentive compatibility, social efficiency, budget balance, and individual rationality under a certain “market power balance” condition where no agent is too negligible or too dominant. We further show that the SVCG payments converge to the Lagrange payments, defined as the payments that correspond to the true price in the absence of strategic considerations, as the number of agents in the market increases. For LQ but non-Gaussian agents, optimal social welfare over the class of linear control laws is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous optimization refers to the design of feedback controllers that steer a physical system to a steady state that solves a predefined, possibly constrained, optimization problem. As such, no exogenous control inputs such as set points or trajectories are required. Instead, these controllers are modeled after optimization algorithms that take the form of dynamical systems. The interconnection of this type of optimization dynamics with a physical system is however not guaranteed to be stable unless both dynamics act on sufficiently different timescales. In this paper, we quantify the required timescale separation and give prescriptions that can be directly used in the design of this type of feedback controllers. Using ideas from singular perturbation analysis, we derive stability bounds for different feedback laws that are based on common continuous-time optimization schemes. In particular, we consider gradient descent and its variations, including projected gradient, and Newton gradient. We further give stability bounds for momentum methods and saddle-point flows. Finally, we discuss how optimization algorithms such as subgradient and accelerated gradient descent, while well-behaved in offline settings, are unsuitable for autonomous optimization due to their general lack of robustness.},

Epidemic models for large populations and finite populations on networks have been used to understand and control both transient and steady-state behaviors. Typically it is assumed that after recovery from an infection, every agent will either return to its original susceptible state or acquire full immunity to reinfection. We study the network SIRI (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected) model, an epidemic model for the spread of contagious processes on a network of heterogeneous agents that can adapt their susceptibility to reinfection. The model generalizes existing models to accommodate realistic conditions in which agents acquire partial or compromised immunity after first exposure to an infection. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions on model parameters and network structure that distinguish four dynamic regimes: infection-free, epidemic, endemic, and bistable. For the bistable regime, which is not accounted for in traditional models, we show how there can be a rapid resurgent epidemic after what looks like convergence to an infection-free population. We use the model and its predictive capability to show how control strategies can be designed to mitigate problematic contagious behaviors.},

We present a new algorithm that implements the proposed method, establish the convergence and optimality properties of the proposed algorithm, and compare it to optimal feedback control and model predictive control that solve the same optimal control problem along the trajectory predicted by the inexact model.

We assume that the system satisfies stabilizability and detectability properties with respect to the stage cost. Then, a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system is constructed and a uniform semiglobal stability property is ensured, where the adjustable parameters are both the discount factor and the horizon length, which corresponds to the number of iterations for dynamic programming algorithms like value iteration. Stronger stability properties such as global exponential stability are also provided by strengthening the initial assumptions. We give bounds on the discount factor and the horizon length under which stability holds and we provide conditions under which these are less conservative than the bounds of the literature for discounted infinite-horizon cost and undiscounted finite-horizon costs, respectively. In addition, we provide new relationships between the optimal value functions of the discounted, undiscounted, infinite-horizon and finite-horizon costs respectively, which are very different from those available in the approximate dynamic programming literature. These relationships rely on assumptions that are more likely to be satisfied in a control context. Finally, we investigate stability when only a near-optimal sequence of inputs for the discounted finite-horizon cost is available, covering approximate value iteration as a particular case.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing platforms are being increasingly used for closing feedback control loops, especially when computationally expensive algorithms, such as model-predictive control, are used to optimize performance. Outsourcing of control algorithms entails an exchange of data between the control system and the cloud and, naturally, raises concerns about the privacy of the control system&#39;s data (e.g., state trajectory and control objective). Moreover, any attempt at enforcing privacy needs to add minimal computational overhead to avoid degrading control performance. In this article, we propose several transformation-based methods for enforcing data privacy. We also quantify the amount of provided privacy and discuss how much privacy is lost when the adversary has access to side knowledge. We address three different scenarios: 1) the cloud has no knowledge about the system being controlled; 2) the cloud knows what sensors and actuators the system employs but not the system dynamics; and 3) the cloud knows the system dynamics, its sensors, and actuators. In all of these three scenarios, the proposed methods allow for the control over the cloud without compromising private information (which information is considered private depends on the considered scenario).},

Both algorithms are proven to drive the system state to an invariant set that approximates and contains the Wardrop equilibrium, defined as a network state in which no traffic flow over the network paths can improve its routing unilaterally, with the latter achieving a better reconstruction of the Wardrop equilibrium.

Unlike ordinary probabilistic Boolean networks, such an impulsive LDS is not Markovian in general. In this article, an impulsive LDS is described by using a hybrid index model and the sequence of intervals between adjacent impulsive instants is assumed to be independent and identically distributed. Under this assumption, the subsequence of a solution obtained by sampling at impulsive instants is a Markov chain. The initial distribution, the transition probability matrix, and the reachable set of the Markovian subsequence are calculated. Calculations of different invariant subsets are discussed and a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of finite Markov chains to subsets is obtained. Based on these results, necessary conditions for the ASS of impulsive LDSs in the hybrid and time domains, respectively, are obtained. In addition, we prove that the necessary conditions become sufficient if the impulsive intervals and the initial impulsive instant are with bounded expectations and variances. An example is provided to show the application of the proposed results to node synchronization of logic dynamical networks.},

The nonidenticality in agents and the requirement for dynamic spatial reconfiguration make it a challenging task to coordinate different types of agents to maintain an optimized formation shape. In an architecture of event-triggered decision and control, this article investigates how to fulfill dynamic formation by distributively optimizing a team cost function. The basic idea is to design a decision unit for each agent to generate an implicit trajectory as a servo signal, based on which a control unit is designed with a displacement-gradient-based law to achieve the desired local solution. Typical heterogeneous characteristics including different nonlinearities and nonidentical dimensions are dealt with in a unified framework. It is shown that with the proposed triggering mechanisms, the optimal dynamic formation problem can be solved by a distributed control law with only intermittent communication. In theory, the properties of convergence of trajectory tracking errors, optimality of the team solution, and Zeno-freeness of event-triggered mechanisms are proved. Two simulation examples are given to verify the proposed method.},

However, if the rotation speed ω and the current in rotating frame i d are not constantly zero, we prove that there only exist a maximum of six indistinguishable solutions, the resistance being the root of a polynomial of degree six. Besides, in the particular case where ω, i d , and i q are constant, we show that the number of possible solutions is reduced to two, with two well-identified possible values for the resistance. Those two solutions can be dissociated if the sign of i q (namely, the mode of use of the motor) is known. Inspired by the nonlinear Luenberger methodology, this property enables us to propose an estimation algorithm, which relies on a one-dimensional minimization of a criterion involving the voltages and intensities filtered at three distinct sufficiently large frequencies.

  abstract     = {This article studies the contraction properties of nonlinear differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. Such systems typically appear as a singular perturbation reduction of a multiple-time-scale differential system. In addition, a given DAE may result from the reduction of many “synthetic” differential systems. We show that an important property of a contracting DAE system is that the reduced system always contracts faster than any synthetic counterpart. At the same time, there always exists a synthetic system, whose contraction rate is arbitrarily close to that of the DAE. Synthetic systems are useful for the analysis of attraction basins of nonlinear DAE systems. As any rational DAE system can be represented in quadratic form, the Jacobian of the synthetic system can be made affine in the system variables. This allows for scalable techniques to construct attraction basin approximations, based on uniformly negative matrix measure conditions for the synthetic system Jacobian.},

In this article, we present explicit affine mappings among Youla, system-level, and input-output parameterizations. Two direct implications of these affine mappings are: 1) any convex problem in the Youla, system-level, or input-output parameters can be equivalently and convexly formulated in any other one of these frameworks, including the convex system-level synthesis; 2) the condition of quadratic invariance is sufficient and necessary for the classical distributed control problem to admit an equivalent convex reformulation in terms of either Youla, system-level, or input-output parameters.},

Positive systems map the nonnegative orthant to itself (and also the nonpositive orthant to itself). In other words, they map the set of vectors with zero sign variations to itself. In this article, discrete-time linear systems that map the set of vectors with up to k - 1 sign variations to itself are introduced. For the special case k = 1 these reduce to discrete-time positive linear systems. Properties of these systems are analyzed using tools from the theory of sign-regular matrices. In particular, it is shown that almost every solution of such systems converges to the set of vectors with up to k - 1 sign variations. It is also shown that these systems induce a positive dynamics of k-dimensional parallelotopes.},

In contrast to the existing work, the structured systems studied in this article have a so-called zero/nonzero/arbitrary structure, which means that some of the entries are equal to zero, some of the entries are arbitrary but nonzero, and the remaining entries are arbitrary (zero or nonzero). We formalize this in terms of pattern matrices, whose entries are either fixed zero, arbitrary nonzero, or arbitrary. We establish necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for strong structural controllability in terms of full rank tests of certain pattern matrices. We also give a necessary and sufficient graph-theoretic condition for the full rank property of a given pattern matrix. This graph-theoretic condition makes use of a new color change rule that is introduced in this article. Based on these two results, we then establish a necessary and sufficient graph-theoretic condition for strong structural controllability. Moreover, we relate our results to those that exist in the literature and explain how our results generalize previous work.},

The objective functionals of the leader and the follower include conditional expectations of state and control (mean field) variables, and the cost parameters could be general nonexponential discounting depending on the initial time. As stated in the existing literature, these two general settings of the objective functionals induce time inconsistency in the optimal solutions. Given an arbitrary control of the leader, we first obtain the follower&#39;s (time consistent) equilibrium control and its state feedback representation in terms of the nonsymmetric coupled Riccati differential equations (RDEs) and the backward stochastic differential equation (SDE). This provides the rational behavior of the follower, characterized by the forward-backward SDE (FBSDE). We then obtain the leader&#39;s explicit (time consistent) equilibrium control and its state feedback representation in terms of the nonsymmetric coupled RDEs under the FBSDE constraint induced by the follower. With the solvability of the nonsymmetric coupled RDEs, the equilibrium controls of the leader and the follower constitute the time-consistent Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, the numerical examples are provided to check the solvability of the nonsymmetric coupled RDEs.},

We first find the necessary and sufficient condition for the initial configuration of the agents, which ensures ℝ 2 reachability. We show that any desired point can be reached with finite controller gains under basic cyclic pursuit if the initial configuration of agents forms a nonconvex polygon. Next, we employ a control strategy using deviated cyclic pursuit to reach the special configuration mentioned above starting from an arbitrary initial configuration. With a switching between these two strategies we can achieve ℝ 2 reachability with finite gains.

It shows that when the continuous dynamics are ISS and the discrete dynamics that govern the jumps involve multiple impulses, the ISS property can be retained for arbitrary impulse time sequences if the cumulative strength of multiple impulses satisfies some conditions. Conversely, when the continuous dynamics are not ISS, then the multiple impulses that satisfy some conditions can stabilize the system in ISS sense if there are no overly long intervals between impulses.

Quantization in the state measurements and in the input signal are simultaneously considered. Fully nonlinear (i.e., possibly nonaffine in the control) time-delay systems are studied. Sufficient conditions are provided such that suitably fast sampling and accurate quantization of the state feedback at hand yield semiglobal practical stability, with arbitrarily small final target ball of the origin. Nonlinear delay-free systems are addressed as a special case: it is shown that the above sufficient conditions, ensuring the semiglobal practical stability, are satisfied if the continuous-time static state feedback controller is a global stabilizer. The theory of stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense is used. The theoretical results are validated through an example.},

The dynamical model is a 3-D ordinary differential equation (ODE) system that is parameterized by the payoffs of the base game. Instead of routine searches for evolutionarily stable strategies and sets, we expand our analysis to determining the asymptotic behavior of solution trajectories starting from any initial state, and in particular, show that for the full range of payoffs, every trajectory of the system converges to an equilibrium point. What enables us to achieve such comprehensive results is studying the dynamics of two ratios of the state variables, each of which either monotonically increases or decreases in the half-spaces separated by their corresponding planes. The convergence results highlight two findings. First, the inclusion of TFT- and STFT-players, the two types of conditional strategy players in the game, increases the share of cooperators of the overall population compared to the situation when the population consists of only ALLC and ALLD-players. Second, surprisingly enough, regardless of the payoffs, there always exists a set of initial conditions under which ALLC-players do not vanish in the long run, which does not hold for any of the other three types of players.},

Membership in this class of perturbed DDEs is determined by conducting sensitivity analysis of solution mappings with respect to initial states to impose a bound constraint on the time-lag term. The homeomorphism property of solutions to such class of perturbed DDEs enables us to construct over- and underapproximations of reach sets by performing reachability analysis on just the boundaries of their permitted initial sets, thereby permitting an extension of reach set computation methods for ordinary differential equations to perturbed DDEs.

The relax-and-discretize approach brings about flexibility, by allowing the OCPs of ODEs to be solved by the method of choice, such as direct or indirect methods. Conditions are developed for global, local, and suboptimal convergence in terms of the solution of the underlying OCPs. The method is applied to an illustrative example.},

A sensor forward local state estimates to a remote estimator over a network, which may be eavesdropped by an intelligent adversary. Aiming at improving the eavesdropping performance efficiently, the adversary may adaptively alternate between an eavesdropping and an active mode. In contrast to eavesdropping, the active attack enables the adversary to sabotage the data transfer to the estimator, and improve the data reception to itself at the same time. However, launching active attacks may increase the risk of being detected. As a result, a tradeoff between eavesdropping performance and stealthiness arises. We present a generalized framework for active eavesdropping and propose a criterion based on the packet reception rate at the estimator to evaluate the stealthiness of the eavesdropper. Moreover, the tradeoff is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process. After deriving a sufficient condition under which at least one stationary policy satisfies the stealthiness constraint and also bounds the eavesdropping performance, we develop an optimal attack policy for the eavesdropper and focus on the structural analysis of the optimal policy. Furthermore, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the developed results.},

A crucial strategy is to transform the event-triggered control system into an interconnection of multiple input-to-state stable systems, to which the cyclic-small-gain theorem is applied for event-based controller synthesis. It is shown that the cyclic-small-gain-based design scheme leads to Zeno-free event-triggered controllers.

When the dynamics of the process and sensor observations are described by a state-space model and the resource are unlimited, the conventional Kalman filter provides the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates. However, at any given time, restrictions on the available communications bandwidth and computational capabilities and/or power impose a limitation on the number of network nodes, whose observations can be used to compute the estimates. We formulate the problem of selecting the most informative subset of the sensors as a combinatorial problem of maximizing a monotone set function under a uniform matroid constraint. For the MMSE estimation criterion, we show that the maximum elementwise curvature of the objective function satisfies a certain upper-bound constraint and is, therefore, weak submodular. Building upon the work of Mirzasoleiman et al. on submodular maximization, we develop an efficient randomized greedy algorithm for sensor selection and establish guarantees on the estimator&#39;s performance in this setting. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the randomized greedy algorithm compared to state-of-the-art greedy and semidefinite programming relaxation methods.},

The controller structure is decentralized in nature and, therefore, depends only on the relative information available to it. The agent dynamics are transformed into relative dynamics by a change of coordinates where the agent dynamics are coupled. Extended high-gain observers are used to estimate the nonlinear coupling at each agent and then cancel them using feedback control. Therefore, the problem changes to a stabilization problem of N nonlinear systems in the relative coordinates. It is shown that the agents achieve practical synchronization and the synchronization error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the high-gain observer parameter.

We propose an algorithm wherein each agent operates asynchronously and independently of the other agents. When the local functions are strongly convex with Lipschitz-continuous gradients, we show that the iterates at each agent converge to a neighborhood of the global minimum, where the neighborhood size depends on the degree of asynchrony in the multiagent network. When the agents work at the same rate, convergence to the global minimizer is achieved. Numerical experiments demonstrate that asynchronous gradient push can minimize the global objective faster than the state-of-the-art synchronous first-order methods, is more robust to failing or stalling agents, and scales better with the network size.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the minimum data rate problem for linear system stabilization under noiseless communication channels. Previous results indicated that having a data rate very approaching the entropy bound leads to large delays and data buffer sizes. In analogy, the entropy bound in Shannon&#39;s source coding theorem in traditional information theory displays this behavior, where the data rate can be arbitrarily close to the entropy bound but only at the cost of boundlessly enlarging the blocklength. However, in this article, we show the analogy is not strict. We prove that it is possible to stabilize a linear system at a rate equal to the entropy bound with zero delay, i.e., where each system state is encoded and decoded within one time unit. We establish a set of sufficient conditions for guaranteeing zero-delay entropy-achieving codes. Following this, we design an entropy-achieving code with finite blocklength satisfying the set of sufficient conditions, where the codeword length is uniformly bounded.},

  abstract     = {We consider the economic dispatch (ED) for an Energy Internet composed of energy routers (ERs), interconnected microgrids, and main grid. The microgrid consists of several bus nodes associated with distributed generators (DGs) and intelligent control units (ICUs). We propose a distributed ED algorithm for the grid-connected microgrid, where each ICU iterates the estimated electricity price of the distribution system and the estimation for the average power mismatch of the whole microgrid by leader-following and average-consensus algorithms, respectively. The ER iterates the incremental power exchanged with the distribution system. By constructing an auxiliary consensus system, we prove that if the communication topology of the Energy Internet contains a spanning tree with the ER as the root and there is a path from each ICU to the ER, then the estimated electricity price of the distribution system converges to its real value, the power supply and demand achieves balance and the ED achieves optimal asymptotically. Furthermore, we propose an autonomous distributed ED algorithm covering both grid-connected and isolated modes of the microgrid by feeding back the estimated average power mismatch for updating the incremental costs with penalty factor. It is proved that if the communication topology of the microgrid is connected and there exists an ICU bidirectionally neighboring the ER, then the microgrid can switch between the two modes reliably. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Starting from a known, first-order reinforcement learning scheme, we show that convergence to a Nash distribution can be attained in a broader class of games than previously considered in the literature - namely, in games characterized by the monotonicity property of their (negative) payoff vectors. We further exploit passivity techniques to design a class of higher order learning schemes that preserve the convergence properties of their first-order counterparts. Moreover, we show that the higher order schemes improve upon the rate of convergence and can even achieve convergence where the first-order scheme fails. We demonstrate these properties through numerical simulations for several representative games.},

In the studied setting, the boundary control input is subject to a constant delay while the open-loop system might exhibit a finite number of unstable modes. The proposed control design strategy consists of two main steps. First, a finite-dimensional subsystem is obtained by truncation of the original infinite-dimensional system (IDS) via modal decomposition. It includes the unstable components of the IDS and allows the design of a finite-dimensional delay controller by means of the Artstein transformation and the pole-shifting theorem. Second, it is shown via the selection of an adequate Lyapunov function that: 1) the finite-dimensional delay controller successfully stabilizes the original IDS and 2) the closed-loop system is exponentially input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to distributed disturbances. Finally, the obtained ISS property is used to derive a small gain condition ensuring the stability of an IDS-ODE interconnection.},

Building on the first part of this article, which focuses on analysis, in this article, sufficient conditions for generic sets to enjoy such a property are proposed. To construct invariance inducing state-feedback laws, the notion of robust control Lyapunov function for forward invariance is defined. The proposed synthesis results rely on set-valued maps that include all admissible control inputs that keep closed-loop solutions within the set of interest. Results guaranteeing the existence of such state-feedback laws are also presented. Moreover, conditions for the design of continuous state-feedback laws with minimum point-wise norm are provided.

The controller adaptively chooses the number of hypotheses kept by the filter to (sub)optimally seek a tradeoff between filter precision and computational effort. In order to quantify the approximation error due to hypotheses truncation, the controller employs probability divergence measures such as f-divergences and the Wasserstein divergence. The proposed solution is tested on the problem of estimating the states of a networked control system with packet drops on the controller-actuator channel. Theoretical results demonstrate that our strategy leads to a divergence between the true Bayes posterior and the truncated one that remains bounded over time. Numerical results show a good improvement with respect to truncation with a constant number of hypotheses, specially as the number of modes increases and so does the problem dimensionality.},

Since, in practical systems, full-state measurement is seldom available, the proposed method integrates a moving horizon estimator to achieve closed-loop stability and constraint satisfaction despite system disturbances and output measurement noise. In contrast to existing approaches, the worst cost within a single homothetic tube around the solution of the associated nominal system is minimized, which, at the same time, tightens the bound on the set of potential states compatible with past output and input data. We show that the designed optimization problem is recursively feasible and adoption of homothetic tubes leads to less conservative economic performance bounds. Thanks to the use of strict dissipativity of the nominal system with a suitable supply rate, the closed-loop system is shown to be asymptotically stable, in the sense that the state trajectory is driven to an optimal robust invariant set.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the problem of selecting sensors in a large-scale system to minimize the error in estimating its states, more specifically, the state estimation mean-square error (MSE) and worst-case error for Kalman filtering and smoothing. Such selection problems are in general NP-hard, i.e., their solution can only be approximated in practice even for moderately large problems. Due to its low complexity and iterative nature, greedy algorithms are often used to obtain these approximations by selecting one sensor at a time choosing at each step the one that minimizes the estimation performance metric. When this metric is supermodular, this solution is guaranteed to be (1 - 1/e)-optimal. This is, however, not the case for the MSE or the worst-case error. This issue is often circumvented by using supermodular surrogates, such as the log det, despite the fact that minimizing the log det is not equivalent to minimizing the MSE. Here, this issue is addressed by leveraging the concept of approximate supermodularity to derive near-optimality certificates for greedily minimizing the estimation mean-square and worst-case error. In typical application scenarios, these certificates approach the (1 - 1/e) guarantee obtained for supermodular functions, thus demonstrating that no change to the original problem is needed to obtain guaranteed good performance.},

In the latter an inverse problem is solved in order to reconstruct a nominal distribution and to recover the macroscale properties of the group of agents. The proposed method is applicable for several types of multiagent systems, e.g., leader-follower systems. We derive error bounds for the moment trajectories and describe how to take these error bounds into account for computing the moment dynamics. The convergence of the moment dynamics is also analyzed for cases with monomial moments. To illustrate the theory, two numerical examples are given. In the first we consider a multiagent system with interactions and compare the proposed method for several types of moments.

It is hence crucial to be able to formally analyze the behavior of these processes, especially in safety-critical applications. Most of the existing formal methods are not designed for continuous-time processes, and those that are typically suffering from state explosion in practice. This article introduces a theoretical framework and a scalable computational method for formal analysis and control synthesis for switched diffusions, a class of stochastic models with linear dynamics that are continuous in both time and space domains; the focus is on safety with possible extensions to other properties. The proposed framework first constructs a finite abstraction in the form of an uncertain Markov process through discretization of both time and space domains. The errors caused by the discretization in each domain are formally characterized and cast into the abstraction model. Then, a strategy that maximizes the probability of the safety property and is robust against the errors is synthesized over the abstraction model. Finally, this robust strategy is mapped to a switching strategy for the stochastic processes that guarantees the safety property. The framework is demonstrated in three case studies, including one that illustrates the tradeoff of the error contribution by the time and space discretization parameters.},

In order to minimize the sum of the cost functions, we consider new distributed gradient-based methods where each node maintains two estimates, namely an estimate of the optimal decision variable and an estimate of the gradient for the average of the agents&#39; objective functions. From the viewpoint of an agent, the information about the gradients is pushed to the neighbors, whereas the information about the decision variable is pulled from the neighbors, hence giving the name “push-pull gradient methods.” The methods utilize two different graphs for the information exchange among agents and, as such, unify the algorithms with different types of distributed architecture, including decentralized (peer to peer), centralized (master-slave), and semicentralized (leader-follower) architectures. We show that the proposed algorithms and their many variants converge linearly for strongly convex and smooth objective functions over a network (possibly with unidirectional data links) in both synchronous and asynchronous random-gossip settings. In particular, under the random-gossip setting, “push-pull” is the first class of algorithms for distributed optimization over directed graphs. Moreover, we numerically evaluate our proposed algorithms in both scenarios, and show that they outperform other existing linearly convergent schemes, especially for ill-conditioned problems and networks that are not well balanced.},
