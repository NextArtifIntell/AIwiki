  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed serious challenges in multiple perspectives of human life. To diagnose COVID-19, oropharyngeal swab (OP SWAB) sampling is generally applied for viral nucleic acid (VNA) specimen collection. However, manual sampling exposes medical staff to a high risk of infection. Robotic sampling is promising to mitigate this risk to the minimum level, but traditional robot suffers from safety, cost, and control complexity issues for wide-scale deployment. In this work, we present soft robotic technology is promising to achieve robotic OP swab sampling with excellent swab manipulability in a confined oral space and works as dexterous as existing manual approach. This is enabled by a novel Tstone soft (TSS) hand, consisting of a soft wrist and a soft gripper, designed from human sampling observation and bio-inspiration. TSS hand is in a compact size, exerts larger workspace, and achieves comparable dexterity compared to human hand. The soft wrist is capable of agile omnidirectional bending with adjustable stiffness. The terminal soft gripper is effective for disposable swab pinch and replacement. The OP sampling force is easy to be maintained in a safe and comfortable range (throat sampling comfortable region) under a hybrid motion and stiffness virtual fixture-based controller. A dedicated 3 DOFs RCM platform is used for TSS hand global positioning. Design, modeling, and control of the TSS hand are discussed in detail with dedicated experimental validations. A sampling test based on human tele-operation is processed on the oral cavity model with excellent success rate. The proposed TOOS robot demonstrates a highly promising solution for tele-operated, safe, cost-effective, and quick deployable COVID-19 OP swab sampling.},

  abstract     = {Total laryngectomy (TL) affects critical functions such as swallowing, coughing and speaking. An artificial, bioengineered larynx (ABL), operated via myoelectric signals, may improve quality of life for TL patients. To evaluate the efficacy of using surface electromyography (sEMG) as a control signal to predict instances of swallowing, coughing and speaking, sEMG was recorded from submental, intercostal and diaphragm muscles. The cohort included TL and control participants. Swallowing, coughing, speaking and movement actions were recorded, and a range of classifiers were investigated for prediction of these actions. Our algorithm achieved F1-scores of 76.0 ± 4.4% (swallows), 93.8 ± 2.8% (coughs) and 70.5 ± 5.4% (speech) for controls, and 67.7 ± 4.4% (swallows), 71.0 ± 9.1% (coughs) and 78.0 ± 3.8% (speech) for TLs, using a random forest (RF) classifier. 75.1 ± 6.9% of swallows were detected within 500 ms of onset in the controls, and 63.1 ± 6.1% in TLs. sEMG can be used to predict critical larynx movements, although a viable ABL requires improvements. Results are particularly encouraging as they encompass a TL cohort. An ABL could alleviate many challenges faced by laryngectomees. This study represents a promising step toward realising such a device.},

  abstract     = {Exoskeleton technologies have the potential to reduce the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Despite the fast-growing industrial exoskeleton market, several bottlenecks have prevented their wide application, namely the lack of wearability, the amount of assistance they deliver and their usefulness in various working scenarios, outside of those they were specifically designed to perform. In this work we present the design, realization and evaluation of a new wearable shoulder exoskeleton that is kinematically compatible with the glenohumeral joint and features a new passive remote actuation system (pRAS). The latter has a twofold function: it delivers assistance only when needed and allows for a more convenient repositioning of the exoskeleton components, reducing the exoskeleton’s footprint and limiting the weight on the user’s arm. A test bench has been designed to validate the mechanical performance of the shoulder exoskeleton and experiments have been conducted to investigate its effect on users while executing overhead working tasks. Based on the muscle activity monitored in six subjects, we conclude that our exoskeleton reduces anterior deltoid activity by 22% during the execution of overhead work. This preliminary study suggests that our device can successfully provide relief at the level of the shoulder without hindering the subject.},

  abstract     = {Motion estimation plays an important role in motor coordination exploration and optimal control of human-machine interaction. Muscular strength training, such as isokinetic exercise, aims to improve one’s muscular strength and endurance with adjustable resistance at a constant speed. To explore motion estimation and muscle coordination, this paper proposes a sEMG based musculoskeletal model to estimate joint angle trajectory of elbow isokinetic exercise to build the relationship between surface-Electromyography (sEMG) and its related joint movement. A set of motion protocol is designed to evaluate the model, including isokinetic movements under 100% and 50% joint torque levels (TL), and isotonic exercise. sEMG sensors and isokinetic dynamometer are employed in which muscle activations are calculated from sEMG signals as the input of musculoskeletal model. The experiment of three motion protocols is conducted by seven healthy subjects. The synergy patterns indicate the muscle coordination consistency with $\text{R}^{2} {&amp;gt;}$ 0.92. The estimated joint angle trajectory confirms that the musculoskeletal model predicts the isokinetic movement and isotonic movement accurately with $\text{R}^{2} {&amp;gt;}$ 0.90 and the normalized root mean squared deviation NRMSD &lt; 0.18. The research outcome in different levels of muscle forces paves the way for tailoring isokinetic exercise in clinical therapy such as stroke rehabilitation.},

In our previous work, a system comprising a wearable ultrasound probe was developed to estimate the acoustic nonlinearity parameter in vivo by measuring amplitudes of second-harmonic ultrasound. The estimating accuracy was found to be significantly affected by the corruption between echoes due to the limited axial resolution of ultrasound. As both frequency components of the single echo and the extent of corruption are unknown, a method based on a bi-directional deconvolution is proposed in this paper to decompose corrupted echoes, and integrated into the measuring system. Eight subjects were recruited for the in vivo measurement of the biceps brachii acoustic nonlinearity parameter, thickness, and elbow torque. Linear regression between the elbow torque and (1) the estimated acoustic nonlinearity parameter, (2) the thickness demonstrated the correlations, with average coefficients of determinations ( $R^{2}$ ) of 0.861 and 0.633 respectively. This work paves a way for estimating the acoustic nonlinearity parameter of skeletal muscles in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Loss of mobility and/or balance resulting from neural trauma is a critical public health issue. Robotic exoskeletons hold great potential for rehabilitation and assisted movement. However, the synergy of robot operation with human effort remains a problem. In particular, optimal assist-as-needed (AAN) control remains unresolved given pathological variance among patients. We introduce a model predictive control (MPC) architecture for lower limb exoskeletons that achieves on-the-fly transitions between modes of assistance. The architecture implements a fuzzy logic algorithm (FLA) to map key modes of assistance based on human involvement. Three modes are utilised: passive, for human relaxed and robot dominant; active-assist, for human cooperation with the task; and safety, in the case of human resistance to the robot. Electromyography (EMG) signals are further employed to predict the human torque. EMG output is used by the MPC for trajectory following and by the FLA for decision making. Experimental validation using a 1-DOF knee exoskeleton demonstrates the controller tracking a sinusoidal trajectory with relaxed, assistive, and resistive operational modes. Results demonstrate rapid and appropriate transfers among the assistance modes, and satisfactory AAN performance in each case, offering a new level of human-robot synergy for mobility assist and rehabilitation.},

To investigate the effect of different design strategies for achieving kinematic compatibility, we developed two versions of this robot: One version (UDW-C) achieves kinematic compatibility only in the case of perfect alignment between human and robot joints. The second version (UDW-NC) connects the human and robot via passive joints to achieve kinematic compatibility regardless of alignment between human and robot joints. Through characterization experiments, we found that the UDW-NC was more robust to misalignments than the UDW-C: the increase in maximum interaction torque associated with misalignments was greater for the UDW-C than the UDW-NC robot (p = 0.003). However, the UDW-NC displayed greater Coulomb friction (p &lt; 0.001). Further, Coulomb friction increased more for the UDW-NC than the UDW-C in the presence of misalignments between the human and robot axes (p &lt; 0.001). We also found that torque transfer was more accurate in the UDW-C than in the UDW-NC. These results suggest that for the small (10 deg) 2-DOF wrist movements considered, the advantages of the UDW-NC in terms of kinematic compatibility are likely overshadowed by the negative effects in friction and torque transfer accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Surgical skill directly affects surgical procedure outcomes; thus, effective training is needed to ensure satisfactory results. Many objective assessment metrics have been developed that provide the trainee with descriptive feedback about their performance however, these metrics often lack feedback on how to improve performance. The most effective training method is one that is intuitive, easy to understand, personalized, and provided in a timely manner. We propose a framework to enable user-adaptive training using near real-time detection of performance, based on intuitive styles of surgical movements, and design a haptic feedback framework to assist with correcting styles of movement. We evaluate the ability of three types of force feedback (spring, damping, and spring plus damping feedback), computed based on prior user positions to improve different stylistic behaviors of the user during kinematically constrained reaching movement tasks. The results indicate that five out of six styles studied here were improved using at least one of the three types of force feedback. Task performance metrics were compared in the presence of the three types of feedback. Task time was statistically significantly lower when applying spring feedback, compared to the other two types of feedback. Path straightness and targeting error were statistically significantly improved when using spring-damping feedback compared to the other two types of feedback. This study presents a groundwork for adaptive training in robotic surgery based on near real-time human-centric models of surgical behavior.},

In this paper, we present a robotic-assisted scanning solution where a concentric tube robot manipulates an optical ultrasound probe along a consistent trajectory. A torque coil is utilized as a buffer between the curved nitinol tube and the probe to prevent torsion on the probe and maintain the axial orientation of the probe while the tube is rotating. The design and control of the scanning mechanism are presented along with the integration of the mechanism with a fibre-based imaging probe. Trajectory repeatability is assessed using electromagnetic tracking and a technique to calibrate the transformation between imaging and robot coordinates using a known model is presented. Finally, we show example images of 3D printed phantoms generated by collecting multiple OpUS A-scans within the same 3D scene to illustrate how robot-assisted scanning can expand the field of view.},

  abstract     = {Many interventional procedures, e.g., biopsies and tumor ablation, imply the insertion of a needle into soft tissues. The interaction force at the needle tip can convey information important for the accuracy of needle placement and the patient’s safety. This information is essential when feedback from an imaging system is missing or only available at a low rate. To isolate the force exchanged at the needle tip during the insertion, it is necessary to remove other components from the needle-tissue interaction force. In particular, the friction along the needle shaft becomes more and more relevant as the needle penetrates deeper into the tissues. In this paper, we propose a method for the identification of the friction component during needle penetration into a multi-layered target. The proposed online identification procedure allows, at the transition from one tissue layer to the next, to subtract the friction contribution from the previous layers and isolate the force relative to the layer where the needle tip is currently located. We call this an enhanced force signal because it improves the ratio of the useful information about the force at the needle tip to the total force rendered. This result can be used in teleoperated needle insertion schemes, or other robot-assisted architectures, with the aim of facilitating the user perception of variations in tissue properties. In the proposed implementation, the force at the base of the needle can either be measured or estimated by using a model-based approach. An originally developed simulation framework provides a tool for procedure planning and online monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a condition caused by a deformity in the mitral valve leading to the backflow of blood into the left atrium. MR can be treated through a minimally invasive procedure and our lab is currently developing a robot that could potentially be used to treat MR. The robot would carry a clip that latches onto the valve’s leaflets and closes them to minimize leakage. The robot’s accurate localization is needed to navigate the clip to the leaflets successfully. This paper discusses algorithms used to track the clip’s position and orientation under real-time using C-arm fluoroscopy. The positions are found through a deep learning semantic segmentation framework and the pose is found by calculating its bending and rotational angles. The robot’s bending angle and the clip’s rotational angle is found through an equivalent ellipse algorithm and an SVM classifier, respectively, and were validated by comparing orientations obtained from an electromagnetic tracker. The bending angle calculation has an average error of 7.7° and the rotational angle calculation is 76% for classifying them into five classes. Execution times are within 100ms and hence this could be a promising approach in real-time pose estimation.},

  abstract     = {Active wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) based on simultaneous magnetic actuation and localization (SMAL) techniques holds great promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing examination time and relieving operator burden. To date, the rotating magnetic actuation methods have been constrained to use a continuously rotating permanent magnet. In this paper, we first propose the reciprocally rotating magnetic actuation (RRMA) approach for active WCE to enhance patient safety. We first show how to generate a desired reciprocally rotating magnetic field for capsule actuation, and provide a theoretical analysis of the potential risk of causing volvulus due to the capsule motion. Then, an RRMA-based SMAL workflow is presented to automatically propel a capsule in an unknown tubular environment. We validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world experiments to automatically propel a robotic capsule in an ex-vivo pig colon. The experiment results show that our approach can achieve efficient and robust propulsion of the capsule with an average moving speed of $2.48 mm/s$ in the pig colon, and demonstrate the potential of using RRMA to enhance patient safety, reduce the inspection time, and improve the clinical acceptance of this technology.},

Ant mandibles are used as a suturing technique by African tribes and as sources of inspiration for surgical clamps. Both the mosquito fascicle and the wasp ovipositor are sources of inspiration for the design of medical needles. Herein, a new research field called “entomomedical engineering,” is proposed. We define entomomedical engineering as the branch of engineering that uses insects either directly or as a source of inspiration to design and develop medical treatments or instruments. In addition, we want to emphasize the importance of preserving insects because of their function in the ecosystem, medicine, and medical engineering.},

For this reason, advanced management skills are required. High-fidelity simulation represents a valuable training tool for residents that allows to gain experience and confidence thus preserving patient safety. Nevertheless, systems now available on the market and literature prototypes provide poor anatomical and physiological features, thus limiting the realism of the simulation and the training. With the aim to overcome these limitations and allow the training of all aspects of the clinical procedure, an innovative high-fidelity neonatal pneumothorax simulator was realized by exploiting two airtight pressurized chambers coupled together with self-sealing needle insertion areas. The simulator assessment phase was carried out involving both expert neonatologists and residents. Before and after the clinical procedure, surveys were used for collecting subjective evaluations. Finally, procedural time was recorded. Based on the obtained results, neonatologists considered the simulator a valid teaching and retraining tool. Moreover, thanks to a simple setting and the possibility to provide real-time feedback, the simulator proved to be a valid tool for training also in critical conditions of personal distancing, e.g., Covid-19 pandemic, which often requires remote operation.},

We consider medical knowledge about the procedure and sensing of the environment in two concurrent regions of the statecharts to facilitate re-usability and adaptability of the modules. Our approach allows producing a well defined procedural model exploiting the hierarchy capability of the statecharts, while machine learning modules act as soft sensors to trigger state transitions. Integrating data driven and prior knowledge techniques provides a robust, modular, flexible and re-configurable methodology to define a surgical procedure which is comprehensible by both humans and machines. We validate our approach on the three surgical phases of a Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) that directly involve the assistant surgeon: bladder mobilization, bladder neck transection, and vesicourethral anastomosis, all performed on synthetic manikins.},

They have been used in surgical procedures, such as transoral microsurgery, to perform precise incisions in delicate structures that are often difficult to reach with other tools. Unfortunately, the performance of fiber tools is not akin to that of traditional laser systems. Prioritizing miniaturization, these tools typically use no optics and ablate tissue in near-contact mode, which induces significant level of tissue carbonization. To avoid this problem, we have developed a focus control system designed for fiber-coupled laser tools based on a microfabricated varifocal mirror. We have demonstrated the efficiency of the system by adjusting the focusing of a CO2 laser beam when ablating plaster block targets while varying the distance to the target within the range of 10mm to 25mm. The proposed system was able to ablate uniform lines, with an average width of 420 $\mu \text{m}$ and showed higher precision than fixed focus and bare fiber systems.},

  abstract     = {In cancer surgery, the correct localization of cancerous tissue is critical for the success of the surgery. Specifically, the surgical goal is to remove the malignant tissue completely while preserving the maximum amount of healthy tissue. Unfortunately, limited technologies are available for intra-operative assessment of tumor margin in Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS). This work presents a vision-based autonomous robotic scanning system for abnormal tissue detection. A stereo vision system, including dense 3D surface reconstruction and tissue tracking, is used to control the scanning motion to compensate for tissue motion and deformation. A high level control strategy allows to control a robot arm to scan autonomously the tissue by means of a monopolar forceps measuring the Electric Bio-Impedance (EBI) of the tissue. The acquired information is used for discriminating cancerous from healthy tissue in real-time, and this information is presented as an impedance map overlaid on the endoscopic video using Augmented Reality (AR). The proposed system performance is evaluated on ex-vivo animal tissues, through experiments simulating the identification and localization of hepatic cancer for resection surgery. Quantitative results show that the system is able to autonomously scan the area of interest and provide a tissue characterization with an accuracy over 82%.},

  abstract     = {Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an emerging medical imaging modality for luminal organ diagnosis. The non-constant rotation speed of optical components in the OCT catheter tip causes rotational distortion in OCT volumetric scanning. By improving the scanning process, this instability can be partially reduced. To further correct the rotational distortion in the OCT image, a volumetric data stabilization algorithm is proposed. The algorithm first estimates the Non-Uniform Rotational Distortion (NURD) for each B-scan by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A correlation map between two successive B-scans is computed and provided as input to the CNN. To solve the problem of accumulative error in iterative frame stream processing, we deploy an overall rotation estimation between reference orientation and actual OCT image orientation. We train the network with synthetic OCT videos by intentionally adding rotational distortion into real OCT images. As part of this article we discuss the proposed method in two different scanning modes: the first is a conventional pullback mode where the optical components move along the protection sheath, and the second is a self-designed scanning mode where the catheter is globally translated by using an external actuator. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are evaluated with synthetic scans as well as real scans under two scanning modes.},

Coughing, the protective reflex action where air is rapidly expelled from the lungs to clear the airway, is crucial in everyday life. Insufficiency in coughing can lead to serious chest infections. In this research we present a bionic assistive coughing device (RoboCough) to improve coughing efficacy among laryngectomy patients by increasing pressure and flow rate. RoboCough was designed to mimic the function of the glottis and trachea in the upper respiratory system. Experimental results show a significant increase (t(64) = 4.9, p &lt;; 0.0001) in peak cough flow rate and peak cough pressure (t(64) = 12.6, p &lt;; 0.0001) among 33 control participants using RoboCough. A pilot study with a smaller cohort of laryngectomy patients shows improvement in peak cough pressure (p = 0.0159) using RoboCough. Preliminary results also show that post-laryngectomy coughs achieved similar peak cough flow (Z = -0.9933, p = 0.32) to the control group&#39;s natural cough. Coughing capabilities could be improved through using RoboCough. Applications of RoboCough include simulation of vocal folds and respiratory conditions, rehabilitation of ineffective coughs from laryngeal and respiratory diseases and as a test-bed for the development of medical devices for respiratory support.},

Whole-body walking gait data was collected, analyzed, and statistically modeled to evaluate the SBLO and assess control algorithm robustness. Kinetic and kinematic analyses show the SBLO meets critical human leg motion parameters, indicating a partial restoration of limb functionality, and biomechanical simulations suggest the SBLO can reduce patient energy expenditure by more than 30%. Test results from a limb affected by post-polio syndrome show up to 99.84% normalization of eight walking gait characteristics across multiple mobility scenarios when using the SBLO rather than a fixed KAFO, including &gt;75% reductions in gait pathologies. The SBLO is inexpensive yet offers more functionality than state-of-the-art solutions, by providing dynamic motion assistance to aid the wearer during walking.},

Here we compare performance of offline forward prediction systems combining these different sensor modalities. We trained and tested subject-specific classifiers for steady-state and transition steps, with data from 8 able-bodied subjects, 4 able-bodied subjects walking with a powered knee-ankle prosthesis using a bypass socket, and a single transfemoral amputee walking with a knee-ankle prosthesis. Fusing Mechanical, EMG, and Vision features produced the best classification for all subjects, with transition error rates in the range of 1% and steady-state error rates close to 0%. Though generalizability was good across able-bodied subjects, it was poor when training with able-bodied or bypass subjects and testing with our amputee subject, regardless of sensor modality, particularly for transition steps. Therefore, we believe a general classifier will require inclusion of amputee training data. Future work will test more subjects and continue development of a general control system.},

  abstract     = {Ankle exoskeletons hold potential to augment human walking ability, yet their use in free-living environments has been limited by the absence of practical and effective control strategies that can appropriately adapt to variable terrain. To address this challenge, we derived a novel analytical ankle joint moment estimation model using custom wearable sensors and developed an exoskeleton control scheme to adapt assistance proportional to the biological plantar-flexor moment in real-time for unimpaired individuals and individuals with disabilities who are able to ambulate independently. We validated the controller during level, 5° incline and decline walking, each at multiple speeds; stair ascent; stair descent; and 90° turning (88 ± 3% average accuracy, R = 0.96 ± 0.01 average correlation coefficient). This study demonstrates the ability of the controller to accurately adapt assistance in unimpaired individuals across a wide variety of walking conditions without the need for walking condition classification or real-time assessment of muscle activity. Clinical feasibility testing in four individuals with cerebral palsy suggests that this control method holds promise for incline and stair walking in individuals with mild-to-severe impairment. This ankle-moment-adaptive control system can be used to prescribe ankle exoskeleton assistance that adapts in real-time across the tested conditions.},

  abstract     = {Assist-as-needed (AAN) control approaches aim to minimize the intervention of robots in robot-aided rehabilitation therapy when patients are able to perform the task. The existing approaches generally contain a forgiving controller which fails to satisfactorily complete the task when patients stay passive or apply resistive/opposing forces. Task completion in such situations is important since it efficiently trains and guides users on how to perform the exercise during active participation. In this study, we have developed an AAN control scheme that provides significant freedom to users when they can perform the exercise while it provides sufficient support for the precise completion of the task when users are not able to do so. These features have been achieved by modulating the impedance of the robot and designing the controller in the velocity domain. A new velocity tracking controller is proposed which does not utilize velocity measurements, and two methods are considered to measure human inputs: force sensor-based method and disturbance observer-based method. In the first approach, the controller does not require the dynamics of the human-robot system, and in the second approach, partial information of the dynamics is required. The performance of the controller is evaluated on an upper-limb robotic exoskeleton. Note to Practitioners-The classic control methods utilized in rehabilitation robots for the active participation of patients are usually low-gain controllers that allow patients to deviate from the desired motion path. However, this approach results in poor task completion when users are not able to do the task. This paper proposes a control scheme for robotic exoskeletons that simultaneously satisfies the two objectives, namely, the low intervention of the robot when users can perform the task, and precise task completion when users cannot handle it. The proposed controller does not require velocity measurements and the precise dynamic model of the system. The approach needs human intention detection, which can be achieved by using force sensors or a disturbance observer. While the second method reduces the complexity and cost of the mechanical parts, it requires the dynamic model of the robot. The tests conducted on an upper-limb robotic exoskeleton show the satisfactory performance of both methods.},

It can result in functional disability because the tremors obstruct movement. We have developed a soft exosuit to assist essential tremor patients that provides a comfortable, unobtrusive and soft interface to the human body, and evaluated whether it can constrain joint movement and suppress tremors. We developed a prototype cable-driven exosuit based on three-point fixation that restricts joint motion only when necessary. Tremors were simulated in healthy test subjects using functional electrical stimulation. The experimental results show that the tremor intensity obtained with the exosuit in constrained mode was approximately 62% of that obtained in unconstrained mode. These results show that the cable-driven soft exosuit effectively suppressed joint motion in patients with simulated essential tremor. We also demonstrated that the exosuit could switch between constrained and unconstrained modes.},

Benchtop tests demonstrated rise times in frontal and sagittal planes of 44 and 32 ms, respectively, and bandwidths of 14 and 17 Hz, respectively. During walking trials, the emulator demonstrated an average of 1.6 Nm of RMS torque tracking error (7.86% of commanded torque range) across three exoskeleton behaviors.

  abstract     = {Counterbalancing mechanisms considerably reduce the size of actuators in serial robots. However, by limiting the joints&#39; angles, imposing dead-point configurations, adding extra links, and attaching heavy/bulky balancing springs/counterweights, they sacrifice the dexterity of serial robots. Such limitations prevent serial robots from being implemented in significant robotic applications including biomedical robotic tasks. This paper proposes a novel cable-driven mechanism which addresses all of these limitations and simultaneously moves all actuators to the base. Via a kinematic and potential energy analysis, effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is proven. In order to experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, a fully-balanced four-link serial arm is fabricated and tested which shows 81.7% reduction in the average torque of the actuators. In order to provide maximum dexterity level with the minimum number of components in the proposed mechanism, an optimal design approach is proposed and studied. In this approach, the number of links to reach a desired target along a border-collision-free motion is minimized. Via different experimental and simulation examples, effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated.},

During surgery, precise navigation of surgical instruments supports surgeons and allows prevention of adverse events. Here, an augmented reality-based navigation aid with automated segmentation of risk structures and path planning is presented.

The proposed system is experimentally validated in a realistic operating room scenario with expert neurosurgeons to determine its quality of support as well as its potential for clinical translation. The automated segmentation reaches a F1-Score of 95-99%. Paths are planned correctly in 93.4%. The entire process enables navigation aid in under five minutes. Validation shows that the system allows for a puncture success rate of 81.7% with mean accuracy of 4.8 ± 2.5 mm. A control group who performed the standard-of-care procedure reached a rate of 71.7% with 6.5 ± 2.4 mm accuracy. Acceptability analysis shows that 85.7% of the participating surgeons approve of the system’s convenience and 92.9% expect accuracy improvement.

  abstract     = {Catheter-based diagnosis and therapy have grown increasingly in recent years due to their improved clinical outcomes including decreased morbidity, shorter recovery time and minimally invasiveness compared to open surgeries. Although the scalability, customizability, and diversity of soft catheter robots are widely recognized, designers and roboticists still lack comprehensive techniques for modeling and designing them. This difficulty arises due to their continuum nature, which makes characterizing the properties and predicting a soft catheter’s behavior challenging, complicating robot design tasks. In this paper, we propose modeling multi-actuator soft catheters to enable alignment with desired vessel shapes near the target area. We develop mathematical models to simulate the catheter’s positioning due to the moments exerted by multiple pneumatic actuators along the catheter and use those models to compare optimization approaches that can achieve catheter alignment along a desired vessel shape. Specifically, our approach proposes finding the optimal geometric and material properties for a multi-actuator soft catheter robot using a bi-level optimization framework. The upper-level optimization process uses a modified Bayesian technique to seek the optimal geometric and material properties of the soft catheter, which minimize the deviance of the actuated catheter from a desired vessel shape, while the lower-level optimization process uses a gradient-based technique to obtain the actuator moments required to achieve that vessel shape. The results demonstrate the capability of our proposed multi-actuator soft catheter to align with the desired vessel shapes, and show that the proposed framework which is in the context of Bayesian optimization has the potential to expedite the design process.},

Arm joints employ novel rotary rolling-diaphragms that provide stiff and low-friction rotational motion without the need for cables, belts, or gear mechanisms found in other solutions. We perform experiments to characterize the device’s force and position tracking and demonstrate its functionality with path following tasks. Our results find a system roll-off frequency at 20Hz and that teleoperation tasks are performed comparably to holding the output directly.

There are urgent demands on equipping cobots with safe collaboration, immersive teleoperation, affective interaction, and other features (e.g., energy autonomy and self-learning) to make cobots capable of these application scenarios. Robot skin, as a potential enabler, is able to boost the development of cobots to address these distinguishing features from the perspective of multimodal sensing and self-contained actuation. This review introduces the potential applications of cobots for human care together with those demanded features. In addition, the explicit roles of robot skin in satisfying the escalating demands of those features on inherent safety, sensory feedback, natural interaction, and energy autonomy are analyzed. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the recent progress in functionalized robot skin in components level, including proximity, pressure, temperature, sensory feedback, and stiffness tuning, is presented. Results show that the codesign of these sensing and actuation functionalities may enable robot skin to provide improved safety, intuitive feedback, and natural interfaces for future cobots in human care applications.

Recent advances in feedback control for closing the loop in DBS are highlighted, as are cutting edge developments in artificial intelligence (AI) methods that analyse the sensed data to determine the state of disorder. Finally, we critically discuss present issues and future directions of miniaturized closed-loop DBS.},

  abstract     = {In the field of brain-computer interface (BCI) research, the availability of high-quality open-access datasets is essential to benchmark the performance of emerging algorithms. The existing open-access datasets from past competitions mostly deal with healthy individuals&#39; data, while the major application area of BCI is in the clinical domain. Thus the newly proposed algorithms to enhance the performance of BCI technology are very often tested against the healthy subjects&#39; datasets only, which doesn&#39;t guarantee their success on patients&#39; datasets which are more challenging due to the presence of more non-stationarity and altered neurodynamics. In order to partially mitigate this scarcity, Clinical BCI Challenge aimed to provide an open-access rich dataset of stroke patients recorded similar to a neurorehabilitation paradigm. Another key feature of this challenge is that unlike many competitions in the past, it was designed for algorithms in both with-in subject and cross-subject categories as a major thrust area of current BCI technology is to realize calibration-free BCI designs. In this paper, we have discussed the winning algorithms and their performances across both competition categories which may help develop advanced algorithms for reliable BCIs for real-world practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Extrinsically powered prosthetic hands offer the potential to replicate the capabilities of a human hand and thus enable an upper limb amputee to complete activities of daily living. Over the past 20 years however, amputees have consistently indicated that several user needs have not been met. Many of these user needs are related to the hardware of the prosthetic hand, and in particular, its actuators and transmissions. These needs include reduced weight and improved dexterity, hand speed, hand strength, and functionality. To understand why these user needs have not been adequately addressed, we first seek to investigate the state of the art in extrinsically powered prosthetic hands through a comprehensive review of the research, commercial, and open-source literature. This review focuses specifically on actuation of the prosthetic hands because actuation is central to addressing the above user needs. This review, based on actuation strategies, enables a characterization and exploration of the actuation design space. We also compare the performance of the reviewed prosthetic hands with both the human hand and ideal recommendations for prosthetic hands to conclude that existing prosthetic hands do not adequately address user needs. This systematic characterization of the actuation design space helps identify that improvements to transmission pathways are the most promising avenue of further research and innovation to enable future prosthetic hands that adequately address user needs.},

  abstract     = {Wearable robots have become a prevalent method in the field of human augmentation and medical rehabilitation. Typical wearable robots mainly include exoskeletons and prostheses. However, their functions are limited due to dedicated design. In recent years, Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) have become a hot spot in the field of wearable robots. Different from exoskeletons and prostheses, SRLs compensate and strengthen human abilities by providing extra limbs. This advantage allows SRLs to assist users in a novel way, rather than substituting missing limbs or enhancing existing limbs. However, finding a trade-off between wearability, efficiency, and usability of those SRLs is still an issue. This paper presents the state of the art in SRLs and discusses some open questions about SRLs&#39; design and control for further research. This review covers the following areas: (1) Basic concepts and classifications of SRLs; (2) The literature retrieval methodology; (3) Design functions of different types of SRLs, including their positive and negative aspects; (4) Different control strategies of SRLs, including positive and negative aspects, and some improvement methods in applying SRLs; (5) The impact on human body schema while using SRLs; (6) Open challenges and suggestions for future development. This review will help researchers understand the current state of SRLs and provide comprehensive knowledge foundations for them.},

  abstract     = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke are pathologies that often result in the loss of/decrease in hand functionality. Hand function is a critical component of everyday life and therefore, a primary focus of clinical SCI/stroke rehabilitation is hand function recovery/improvement. In recent years, there has been a surge in hand exoskeleton research due to the potential for exoskeletons to improve clinical rehabilitation efficiency through automation. However, there is a disconnect between current clinical practice and exoskeleton research, resulting in a minority of hand exoskeletons being tested on individuals with SCI and/or stroke. This review article provides a comprehensive analysis and review of hand exoskeleton studies based on clinical rehabilitation practices to bridge the knowledge gap between clinical application and laboratory research. The key findings from this paper are: 1) current hand exoskeletons can successfully complete simple ADL tasks but lack the precision for fine motor control, 2) most hand exoskeletons exhibit a low number of degrees-of-freedom compared to the human hand, which may limit movement capability, 3) the majority of hand exoskeletons lack sensing capabilities, restricting viable control methods and user interfaces, and 4) inconsistent evaluation methods across studies do not allow for accurate performance assessment for different exoskeletons. The comparative assessments performed by this survey article show that there remain deficits between clinical hand rehabilitation practices and the current state of hand exoskeletons. By delineating these shortcomings, the information presented in this work can help inform future developments in the field of assistive and rehabilitative hand exoskeletons such that the gap between research and application may be closed.},

  abstract     = {Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy (LDR-BT) is a technique for treating localized prostate cancer by implanting radioactive seeds. In conventional practice, the delivery of seeds is performed using transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) imaging for implant guidance and checked using computed-tomography for post-implant dosimetry. In the case of TRUS, accuracy can be compromised due to sub-optimal imaging. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), however, is known to provide better soft-tissue contrast, therefore, increasing the ability to detect small lesions; for that reason, the integration of intraoperative MRI in BT workflows has been investigated over the last two decades. The fusion of preoperative MR-images during TRUS-brachytherapy is possible. However, the image registration process introduces a source of uncertainty. Manual, real-time intra-operative LDR-BT is challenging under MRI due to confined space and procedural workflows. This motivates the development of MRI-compatible robots for prostate BT, with potential advantages of improved source placement accuracy and final dosimetry. In this paper, the state-of-art of technological components in MRI compatible robots, especially for LDR-BT, has been presented. This systematic review helps us to position an ongoing Cooperative Brachytherapy project, developing a real-time MRI-guided robot for adaptive LDR-BT. The design approach includes integrating separate modules: imaging, dose planning, needles, and robot.},

Robot hands and grippers can vary from rigid and complex designs to soft, inflatable, and lightweight structures. In this paper, we focus on the modeling and development of a pneumatically driven soft robotic gripper with retractable telescopic fingers and finger bases with abduction / adduction capabilities. Both the main fingers and the base actuators use a pre-folded, telescopic structure facilitating passive retraction. The efficiency of the proposed device is experimentally validated through different types of experiments: i) grasping experiments that involve different everyday objects ranging from household objects and fragile items to medical waste and consumables, ii) force exertion experiments that capture the maximum forces that can be exerted by the proposed device when utilizing the different actuators of the gripper, and iii) grasp resistance experiments that focus on the effect of the inflatable structure on resisting environmental uncertainties and disturbances. The proposed gripper is able to grasp a plethora of objects, and can exert more than 14 N of grasping force. The design is so low-cost and modular that the soft fingers and palm pad of the gripper can be used in a disposable manner, facilitating the execution of specialized tasks (e.g., grasping in contaminated environments, handling of medical waste, etc). When it is not inflated, the gripper profile is thin and compact to facilitate storage.},

  abstract     = {For persons with lower extremity (LE) amputation, acquisition of surface electromyography (sEMG) from within the prosthetic socket remains a significant challenge due to the dynamic loads experienced during the gait cycle. However, these signals are critical for both understanding the clinical effects of LE amputation and determining the desired control trajectories of active LE prostheses. Current solutions for collecting within-socket sEMG are generally (i) incompatible with a subject&#39;s prescribed prosthetic socket and liners, (ii) uncomfortable, and (iii) expensive. This study presents an alternative within-socket sEMG acquisition paradigm using a novel flexible and low-profile electrode. First, the practical performance of this Sub-Liner Interface for Prosthetics (SLIP) electrode is compared to that of commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes within a cohort of subjects without amputation. Then, the corresponding SLIP electrode sEMG acquisition paradigm is implemented in a single subject with unilateral transtibial amputation performing unconstrained movements and walking on level ground. Finally, a quantitative questionnaire characterizes subjective comfort for SLIP electrode and commercial Ag/AgCl electrode instrumentation setups. Quantitative analyses suggest comparable signal qualities between SLIP and Ag/AgCl electrodes while qualitative analyses suggest the feasibility of using the SLIP electrode for real-time sEMG data collection from load-bearing, ambulatory subjects with LE amputation.},

  abstract     = {Freezing of gait is an episodic phenomena faced by many patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. It is characterized by episodes during which patients are unable to generate effective forward stepping movements, despite absence of motor deficits. During the onset of the event, the patients are less stable with statistically different stride width, toe in/out angle and center of pressure distance. It has been postulated that the degree of freezing can be reduced by providing external sensory feedback to the patients during the event. However, this intervention could be facilitated by accurate identification of freezing events in real-time. This manuscript presents an Artificial Neural Network model which uses signals recorded by an instrumented footwear to predict if a walking subject is having a freezing episode. Our model presented in this paper is capable of continuously predicting freezing of gait events at a high temporal resolution of 50 Hz, using a 0.5 second window of data recorded by the instrumented shoes, with a sensitivity of 96.0±2.5%, a specificity of 99.6±0.3%, a precision of 89.5±5.9%, and an accuracy of 99.5±0.4%.

To date, a multitude of exoskeletal devices employing distinct technologies have been proposed, making navigating this field a challenging task. To this end, we propose a set of classification criteria to help categorize devices. In this review, a set of 97 publications representing 72 active exoskeletal devices for hand assistance and rehabilitation is analysed. Furthermore, the distribution over the years within each of the criteria is presented. Results show clear trends, such as preferring underactuated devices, electrical transducers with flexible transmission or the more recent uptake of soft technologies. Lastly, the readiness level of hand exoskeleton technology is presented in terms of the whole device and each of the identified sub-classifications. Most of the devices are still in laboratory testing phase, undergoing healthy subject trials or limited clinical trials, with very few having actually reached the market. We hope to provide researchers with a comprehensive analysis of currently employed design choices in hand exoskeletons, highlighting the most developed avenues of research and the latest emerging ones.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasound (US) acquisition in standard clinical procedures requires manual operation of the probe based on the interpretation of the image. A robotic system for autonomous US acquisitions holds great promise to relieve the workload of sonographers, improve access to care, yield more standardized imaging results, and circumvent the need for direct patient contact. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current status of systems and techniques for autonomous robotic US acquisitions in the literature. Specifically, we first present a framework to standardize the increasing levels of autonomy in robotic ultrasonography and briefly discuss the non-autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. Then, we systematically review the existing autonomous robotic systems developed for extracorporeal US acquisitions based on the hardware components, workflow and applications. Besides, we summarize three important topics related with the autonomous US acquisitions, including the scanning path planning, contact force control and image quality optimization, and introduce current methods and techniques proposed on each topic. Finally, we discuss the challenges and provide some potential directions for future research. We believe that the presented efforts in autonomous robotic US acquisitions will pave the way for a promising future of medical care and benefit a broad spectrum of clinical procedures.},

  abstract     = {Full-dimensional natural arm manipulation is a challenging task in the field of model-based control due to its high degree of freedom and unknown dynamics of the given system. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for handling high-dimensional robotics problems. Although impressive results for the arm manipulation task have been reported, it still remains an open problem on how we can create human-like synergetic reaching motion using learning algorithms. In this study, we apply DRL for managing full-dimensional arm manipulation in a simulation study, and verify the relations among motion error, energy, and synergy emergence, to reveal the mechanism of employing motor synergy. Although synergy information has never been encoded into the reward function, the synergy naturally emerges along with feedforward control, leading to a similar situation as human motion learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer study demonstrating the error and energy optimization issue exists behind the motor synergy employment in DRL for reaching tasks. In addition, our proposed feedback-augmented DRL controller shows better capability over DRL in terms of synergy development and the coupled criteria of error-energy index. This implies that feedback control can support the learning process under redundancy by voiding unnecessary random exploration.},

Most prosthetic hands are still devoid of tactile sensors, implying that the user cannot perceive external stimulation nor react in a fine manner. As a consequence, unforeseen events, e.g., slippage, are difficult to manage. This article proposes an algorithm to perform slippage detection with tactile sensors integrated into prosthetic hands. The algorithm is based on the filtering of the tactile sensor output; rectification and envelope follow the filtering. A binary signal, relating to slippage, is finally computed. An electrical circuit has been designed and built to elaborate the tactile signals. These have been embedded in a bioinspired fingertip mounted on a prosthetic hand, which has been interfaced with a robotic arm to assess the algorithm capability to identify slippage. Eight different surfaces have been employed, while three sliding velocities have been tested with a random interaction force between the fingertip and the test surfaces. Finally, experiments in a closed-loop configuration have been conducted to demonstrate the algorithm effectiveness in dynamic manipulation. Results proved the adequacy of the algorithm in terms of slippage detection and short latency between onset of slippage, actual detection and hand reaction.},

In this work, we capture prosthesis-user behavior in the unstructured and familiar environments of the participants own homes. Compact head-mounted video cameras recorded ego-centric views of the hands during self-selected household chores. Over 60 hours of video was recorded from 8 persons with unilateral amputation or limb difference (6 transradial, 1 transhumeral, 1 shoulder). Of this, almost 16 hours of video data was analyzed by human experts using the 22-category `TULIP&#39; custom manipulation taxonomy, producing the type and duration of over 27,000 prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tags on both upper limbs, permitting a level of objective analysis not previously possible with this population. Our analysis included unique observations on non-prehensile manipulations occurrence, determining that 79% of transradial body-powered device manipulations were non-prehensile, compared to 60% for transradial myoelectric devices. Conversely, only 16-19% of intact limb activity was non-prehensile. Additionally, multi-grasp terminal devices did not lead to increased activity compared to 1DOF devices.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies of robotic exoskeletons and prostheses with regenerative actuators have focused on level-ground walking. Here we analyzed the lower-limb joint mechanical power during stand-to-sit movements using inverse dynamics to estimate the biomechanical energy available for electrical regeneration. Nine subjects performed 20 sitting and standing movements while lower-limb kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured. Subject-specific body segment parameters were estimated using parameter identification. Joint mechanical power was calculated from joint torques and rotational velocities and numerically integrated over time to estimate the joint biomechanical energy. The hip absorbed the largest peak negative mechanical power (1.8 ± 0.5 W/kg), followed by the knee (0.8 ± 0.3 W/kg) and ankle (0.2 ± 0.1 W/kg). Negative mechanical work on the hip, knee, and ankle joints per stand-to-sit movement were 0.35 ± 0.06 J/kg, 0.15 ± 0.08 J/kg, and 0.02 ± 0.01 J/kg, respectively. Assuming known regenerative actuator efficiencies (i.e., maximum 63%), robotic exoskeletons and prostheses could regenerate ~26 Joules of electrical energy while sitting down, compared to ~19 Joules per walking stride. Given that these regeneration performance calculations are based on healthy young adults, future research should include seniors and/or rehabilitation patients to better estimate the biomechanical energy available for electrical regeneration.},

Exoskeleton controls research typically focuses on trajectory generation, motion control over the trajectories, and balance and stability. This work focuses on the generalization of people&#39;s joint trajectories climbing a single stair, for an exoskeleton to be developed for people of all leg lengths and be used on variable stair heights. The motion of subjects of different heights, ages, and genders climbing a single stair was collected using motion capture. By using Gaussian mixed regression and Gaussian mixed models, these trajectories were combined to build a model that generalizes individuals with different leg lengths, genders, ages and stair heights. The variability of the subject&#39;s leg length is accounted for by tracking a marker on the toe of the subject and using inverse kinematics to calculate the joint angles. The analysis in this paper shows that joint angles can be generalized to climb various stair heights. In addition, an open-source database of motion capture climbing data and an open-source framework for generating joint trajectories has been made available for public use.},

  abstract     = {Current state-of-the-art locomotion mode classifiers for controlling robotic lower-limb prostheses rely on multiple sensors to achieve high accuracy, prediction performance, and robustness to both speed changes and subject-specific gait patterns. However, multiple sensors placed on different body parts usually entail discomfort and poor usability for the user. This paper presents an intention detection method that relies on the features extracted from an inertial measurement unit worn on the thigh and an online phase estimator. The algorithm classifies the locomotion mode of the upcoming stride among the three modes of ground-level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent. A two-stage classification process first distinguishes between transient and steady-state strides and then classifies the locomotion mode of the impending stride based on directed acyclic graphs of binary classifiers. The classification is performed at 75% or 85% of the previous stride phase, respectively for steady-state and transient strides. Data were gathered from 10 healthy subjects and processed offline. Feature design and selection were based on the data of all subjects, while the classification performance was assessed by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results presented a median recognition accuracy of 98.7% for steady-state strides and 95.6% for transitions, suggesting that the method was inherently robust to variations in gait cadence, since all of the features were phase-based and not dependent on fixed time intervals. These results inform the design of control strategies for active transfemoral prostheses able to predict the user’s locomotion intention during the next stride, using minimum sensors.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive surgery has become the primary treatment of spine disease. It depends on high-precision medical image as guidance. Ultrasound imaging is expected to replace X-ray fluoroscopy as a golden standard scheme of minimally invasive spinal surgeries. Researchers make effort to develop ultrasound imaging for the process of navigation, taking its distinctive advantages of user-friendly and radiation-free. However, it is greatly affected by the contact force and incident angle of the probe, which depends a lot on experienced sonographers. To this end, a flexible ultrasound scanning system (FUSS) is proposed to automatically image the human spine. In mechanics, a flexible fixture, fixed on the end joint of robotic arm, is designed to ensure the ultrasound probe to be pressed against the dorsal skin. Besides, decoupled control strategy is presented which decouples trajectory planning task and force control task into separate joint space. By this means, the possibility of accidental damage could be minimized. Phantom experiments were carried out to validate the hysteresis characteristic of flexible fixture, the capacity to resisting impact, the performance of control system and the quality of reconstruction image. These results show that our system has high safety performance and could keep the probe force stable within the range of 1 N to obtain better reconstruction image than freehand scanning. In summary, it has a great potential on navigation of spine surgery.},

We tested our new metrics on two datasets with different conditions: (1) a dataset of experienced robotic surgeons and nonmedical users performing needle-driving on a dry lab model, and (2) a small dataset of suturing movements performed by surgeons training on a porcine model. We evaluated the performance of our new metrics (angular displacement and the rate of orientation change) alongside the performances of classical metrics (task time and path length). We calculated each metric on different segments of the movement. Our results highlighted the importance of segmentation rather than calculating the metrics on the entire movement. Our new metric, the rate of orientation change, showed statistically significant differences between experienced surgeons and nonmedical users / novice surgeons, which were consistent with the classical task time metric. The rate of orientation change captures technical aspects that are taught during surgeons’ training, and together with classical metrics can lead to a more comprehensive discrimination of skills.},

Early screening and treatment by colonoscopy are critical in reducing both the incidence and mortality rate of CRC. The conventional flexible colonoscope (FC) requires high skills of the physicians and may lead to patient discomfort. Many novel techniques for colonoscopy have been developed, each of which has its own pros and cons. This paper proposes an electromagnetically actuated soft-tethered (EAST) colonoscope system to provide an alternative solution. The EAST colonoscope is competent in achieving complete functions of FC and reducing patient discomfort owing to the gentle interaction between the colonoscope and colon wall. Physical experimentation is conducted with a proof-of-concept actuation prototype to validate the feasibility of the EAST colonoscope. The experimental results show that the orientation can be controlled to follow the desired trajectories with a mean absolute error of 0.302 mm. Moreover, the system is demonstrated to achieve active locomotion and orientation in a colon phantom, while other operations such as insufflation, biopsy, and drug delivery are performed using a porcine colon, which indicates that the EAST colonoscope delivers high potentials in medical application.},

For this purpose, a novel target admittance model is designed in the joint space for hands-on procedures that can be applied in all commercially available general-purpose manipulators with six or more degrees of freedom. It is proved that the joint reference trajectories generated by the proposed target admittance model under the exertion of a human force are stable and satisfy the RCM constraint. The measurements of the human force and the robot’s forward kinematic model are only required. Its use spans all hands-on surgical procedures. The proposed model can be easily extended to achieve additional objectives.

  abstract     = {Endovascular surgery (ES) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat diseases such as stroke, coronary artery disease, and aneurysms. Often, the vascular anatomy exhibits high tortuosity and severe angulation, which requires long procedures and significant expertise, and leads to a risk of vessel dissection. Here we introduce a soft, tip-extending robot—the VINE (Vascular Internal Navigation by Extension) catheter—that extends, or “grows,” from the tip when pressurized with fluid. It acts as an access device, pulling a standard catheter to the target site as it grows. We demonstrate how this movement via tip-extension enables the VINE catheter to easily and safely pass through tight curvatures. We also demonstrate the system’s usability in a patient-specific anatomical model under fluoroscopy, even by novices. Overall the VINE catheter has potential to: (i) increase safety, given its inherent limit to stress that it can apply to vessel walls, and (ii) decrease the time and expertise required to successfully complete complex ES cases. The results serve as a foundation for an entire class of devices capable of gaining access to difficult-to-reach locations via navigation through constrained anatomy and illustrate the potential for the VINE catheter to have a significant impact on a range of procedures.},

  abstract     = {Registration that aligns different views of one interested organ together is an essential technique and outstanding problem in medical robotics and image-guided surgery (IGS). This work introduces a novel rigid point set registration (PSR) approach that aims to accurately map the pre-operative space with the intra-operative space to enable successful image guidance for computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS). The normal vectors and tangent vectors are first extracted from the pre-operative and intra-operative point sets (PSs) respectively, and are further utilized to enhance the registration accuracy and robustness. The contributions of this article are three-folds. First, we propose and formulate a novel distribution that describes the error between one normal vector and the corresponding tangent vector based on the von-Mises Fisher (vMF) distribution. Second, by modelling the anisotropic position localization error with the multi-variate Gaussian distribution, we formulate the PSR considering anisotropic localization error as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and then solve it under the expectation maximization (EM) framework. Third, to facilitate the optimization process, the gradients of the objective function with respect to the desired parameters are computed and presented. Extensive experimental results on the human femur and pelvis models verify that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate potential clinical values for relevant surgical navigation applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the development of a novel and high-precision Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based sensor for the measurement of insertion forces during the needle puncture procedure. The proposed sensor mainly comprises two compact orthogonal planar springs connected in a parallel arrangement, one suspended FBG optical fiber and a hand-held sensor frame. Two orthogonal planar springs with curved limbs have been utilized to design the force-sensitive flexure with an excellent linear force-displacement relationship along the axial direction. The employed optical fiber has been arranged along the flexure’s central line, and it is tightly suspended under a pre-tension force with its two ends glued. This two-point pasting configuration can attain improved sensitivity and resolution and avoid the drawbacks of chirping and low repeatability. Finite element modeling (FEM)-enabled simulation has been implemented for design optimization to further advance the sensor sensitivity and performance investigation. The sensor’s axial sensitivity has been increased in the condition when the radial crosstalk decreased. The proposed sensor has been prototyped and calibrated to achieve a high resolution of 1.5mN within [0, 6N] and an excellent linearity with a small linearity error of 0.5%. This design can be conveniently customized to achieve adjustable measurement range and force sensitivity, which has been validated by the further simulation sensor version with a resolution of 4.9mN within [0, 20N]. In-vitro puncture experiments on silicone phantoms, artificial venipuncture simulation module and eggshell membrane, and ex-vivo puncture experiments on porcine liver and porcine aorta have been implemented to validate the effectiveness of the presented sensor design.},

As this is a relatively young research field, this review aims to provide an insight into the current state of the art in high-fidelity physical organ simulators that are used for training purposes, as educational tools, for biomechanical studies, and for preclinical device testing. Motivated by a paucity of clear definitions and categorization of various simulators, we describe high-fidelity physical organ simulators in terms of their degree of representation of the anatomy, material properties, and physiological behavior of the target organs in the context of their applications. We highlight the traditional approaches for static organ simulators using synthetic materials, and diverse approaches for dynamic organ simulators including soft robotic, ex vivo, and biohybrid strategies to meet the ever-increasing demand for realistic anthropomorphic organ models. Finally, we discuss challenges and potential future avenues in the field of high-fidelity physical organ simulators.},

The primary goal of this study was the realization of electrically conductive silicone vocal folds able to replicate an electroglottography (EGG) signal under pathophysiological conditions, in order to provide a quantitative method for monitoring the vocal folds vibratory characteristics. Both simulators showed an oscillatory behavior similar to human counterpart, thanks to the materials used for their realization. In addition, the synthetic simulators are made conductive by a silicone-based conductive solution applied to the surface of the synthetic vocal folds, in order to acquire an electrical signal to be compared to an EGG signal. Results showed a direct correlation between conductance variation and the occurrence of vocal folds contact, as it happens for the real EGG signal. In addition, results suggested that both simulators are able to replicate the vibratory characteristics of healthy and pathological vocal folds and to reproduce an electrical signal that is comparable to a real EGG. This will represent a powerful tool to characterize and cluster different vocal folds pathologies, which can lead to a significant improvement of prevention programs and an early diagnosis for laryngeal diseases.},

Despite the advancements in neurotechnologies, which allowed investigating the brain complexity with a high level of precision, the use of simplified in vitro brain-on-a-chip models results to be a widespread alternative. In the present work, we used an in vitro brain-regions-on-a-chip model to explore the role of thalamic and hippocampal neurons in modulating the dynamics of cortical ensembles. We recorded the emerging electrophysiological activity by means of Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) paired with ad hoc polymeric structures in order to recreate interconnected heterogeneous networks. We demonstrated that two specific neuronal inputs (thalamic and hippocampal) modulated cortical dynamics differently. The observed variation in the cortical activity was sustained by a specific reorganization of the functional inhibitory connections with respect to the cortical homogeneous controls. In perspective, the possibility to design in vitro specific interconnected brain-regions-on-a-chip and to record their electrophysiological activity could be an alternative approach to investigate neurodegenerative pathologies affecting the connectivity among different neuronal populations.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary Artificial Pancreas (AP) consists of a subcutaneous (SC) glucose sensor, a SC insulin pump and a control algorithm. Even the most advanced systems are far from optimal, in particular due to the non-physiologic nature of SC route. While SC insulin delivery is convenient and minimally invasive, it introduces delays to insulin action that make tight control difficult, particularly during meals. In addition frequent patient interventions are needed, e.g., at mealtime. The intraperitoneal (IP) insulin delivery could address this major challenge since it exhibits a faster pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, hence making easier to quickly respond to glycemic disturbances. A 1-day hospital closed-loop study has shown significant improvements of IP glucose control vs SC AP, and that meal announcement is not necessary. However, the IP AP has not been tested in more realistic everyday life conditions. In this work we have performed an in silico study of 14 days of an IP AP by using the UVA/Padova simulator which includes intra- and inter-day variability of insulin sensitivity and several real life scenarios. We show superiority of IP AP vs SC AP in terms of quality of glucose control (time in range 87% IP vs 80% SC) without the need of a meal announcement.},

Nasal packing devices are often inserted into the patient nostrils to support the nasal septum and to facilitate healing of surgical wounds after surgical treatment. Currently available devices have some limitations and often raise complications, e.g., rather high risk of infections, adhesions between tissues and pain experienced by the patient. This paper describes a novel nasal packing device named RhinoFit, which aims to overcome such limitations. The device is based on a bionic design grounded on a standardized anatomical internal geometry of the natural nasal cavity. The device allows supporting the nasal septum and tamponing the surgical wounds, thanks to the presence of ad hoc designed units. In addition, the proposed system has two key features: (1) a washing/drainage channel to guarantee an easy removal of residual fluids from the nostril and to perform nasal washes, and (2) an internal chamber for the application of an adjustable pressure on the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, which could be adapted depending on the patient&#39;s pain level. The RhinoFit prototype fabrication and testing are reported, demonstrating its suitability as an effective nasal packing device, paving the way to a future clinical translation.},

We propose a low-cost miniature robot that can be easily assembled and remotely controlled. The system includes an active end-effector, a passive positioning arm, and a detachable swab gripper with integrated force sensing capability. The cost of the materials for building this robot is 55 USD and the total weight of the functional part is 0.23kg. The design of the force sensing swab gripper was justified using Finite Element (FE) modeling and the performances of the robot were validated with a simulation phantom and three pig noses. FE analysis indicated a 0.5mm magnitude displacement of the gripper’s sensing beam, which meets the ideal detecting range of the optoelectronic sensor. Studies on both the phantom and the pig nose demonstrated the successful operation of the robot during the collection task. The average forces were found to be 0.35N and 0.68N, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed robot is promising and could be further developed to be used in vivo.},

An operator sends the motion command via a master console, which must convert these into suitable slave instrument actuator inputs for intuitive interaction. However, most master-slave systems available to date use incremental task-space control and clutching, which introduces a discontinuity and orientation misalignment between the master control handle and slave instrument, with a consequent impact on task performance. In this article, we proposed a new master manipulator design to compensate for misalignment mechanically. The modular gimbal consists of a passive decoupling mechanism and a wrist locking feature. After describing the mechanisms and its kinematic configuration, we report on a comparative study under controlled conditions, developed to measure the end effector orientation in both compensated and non-compensated scenarios. The results demonstrate that the compensated master console maintains a near constant end effector orientation over the workspace during clutching, showing great promise as a solution to this outstanding open challenge in master-slave manipulation.},

The multi-tool featured a two degrees of freedom notched nitinol wrist controlled by a joystick. A theoretical range of motion of 90 degrees was intended. The inner lumen of the wrist was designed for suction and irrigation, a miniature camera attached to the tip would provide visualization. During testing, slack in the actuation cables affected the tools workspace and control. A maximum force of 0.45 N was applied through the tip. The simulation model was manufactured from medical grade ABS. It featured a removable nose cartridge for a cost efficient replacement method. A peristaltic pump and a needle tip were used for ICA injury simulation. For future evaluation of the model, a 5 point Likert scale was developed. Despite successful tests, some limitations remained. The tool was affected by slack and did not include illumination. No mucosal layer was included in the simulation model and haemostasis had to be assessed manually.},

  abstract     = {Many have explored the application of continuum robot manipulators for minimally invasive surgery, and have successfully demonstrated the advantages their flexible design provides—with some solutions having reached commercialisation and clinical practice. However, the usual high complexity and closed-nature of such designs has traditionally restricted the shared development of continuum robots across the research area, thus impacting further progress and the solution of open challenges. In order to close this gap, this article introduces ENDO, an open-source 3-segment continuum robot manipulator with control and actuation mechanism, whose focus is on simplicity, affordability, and accessibility. This robotic system is fabricated from low cost off-the-shelf components and rapid prototyping methods, and its information for implementation (and that of future iterations), including CAD files and source code, is available to the public on the Open Source Medical Robots initiative’s repository on GitHub, with the control library also available directly from Arduino. Herein, we present details of the robot design and control, validate functionality by experimentally evaluating its workspace, and discuss possible paths for future development.},

  abstract     = {There is currently a trend towards small tendon-driven robotic devices targeting endoscopic applications. As these robotic systems aim to navigate within narrow tortuous pathways, their joint arrangement must be longitudinal. Additionally, mechanical constraints such as tendon routing limit the joint range which impacts the overall dexterity of the instruments and complicates the use of iterative inverse kinematics solvers. This article investigates the use of reinforcement learning and proximal policy optimization to solve the inverse kinematics problem of endoscopic instruments while considering joint limits, joint velocity, and whole body configuration. The results show that the proposed approach is able to learn the kinematic model of a 5 degrees of freedom endoscopic instrument and performs better than the Damped Least Square iterative approach in terms of computation time, position error, and orientation error.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based methods represent the state of the art in path planning problems. Their performance, however, depend on the number of medical images available for the training. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are unsupervised neural networks that can be exploited to synthesize realistic images avoiding the dependency from the original data. In this article, we propose an innovative type of GAN, Deep Convolutional Refined Auto-Encoding Alpha GAN, able to successfully generate 3D brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from random vectors by learning the data distribution. We combined a Variational Auto-Encoder GAN with a Code Discriminator to solve the common mode collapse problem and reduce the image blurriness. Finally, we inserted a Refiner in series with the Generator Network in order to smooth the shapes of the images and generate more realistic samples. A qualitative comparison between the generated images and the real ones has been used to test our model&#39;s quality. With the use of three indexes, namely the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Metric, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy and the Intersection over Union, we also performed a quantitative analysis. The final results suggest that our model can be a suitable solution to overcome the shortage of medical images needed for learning-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Biopsy of breast lesions only visible on MRI may benefit from patient-specific finite-element modeling of the breast. This requires acquisition of the heterogeneous elasticity distribution. An acoustically transparent pad has been developed which enables strain elastography imaging using ultrasound without need for additional force or pressure sensors. The elasticity of the pad is known a priori while the change in thickness is detectable on ultrasound by edge detection. Based on the calculated pressure distribution across the pad, the pressure in inner tissue can be approximated. The strain is measured using a cross-correlation block matching algorithm and from these measurements the heterogeneous elasticity distribution can be estimated. The ultrasound probe with pad is moved over the breast surface by a robot arm. At sixteen sites on the surface of one phantom the probe with pad performed an inward push movement perpendicular to the breast surface. The ultrasound scans were post-processed to reconstruct a heterogeneous elasticity map in the local imaging plane. While it is challenging to accurately estimate the stress and strain in deeper tissue, certain features such as the skin can be effectively distinguished from the underlying soft tissue which demonstrates the potential of the system.},

To analyse the performance and clinical feasibility of the proposed flexible robot, Finite Element Analysis, workspace analysis, path following accuracy and force test have been performed.

Electrotactile stimulation is one of the non-invasive sensory feedback techniques with a low power, light-weight and relatively easy to control stimulation mechanism to provide the feedback. Currently, there are two electrode setups used in the literature, concentric electrodes and separated electrodes, to apply the electrotactile stimulation to deliver tactile feedback. There is minimal data available in the literature to compare the two electrode setups. This study compares the impact of the electrode arrangements on the dynamic range, just noticeable difference (JND), comfort level, degree of localisation, intensity and type of sensation induced, and the resulting EMG interference from the electrotactile stimulation. The experimental results presented suggest that the concentric electrodes induce a more comfortable and realistic sensation with a reduction in the probability of inducing undesired feeling of pain, pinch or pinprick sensations. Further, the concentric electrodes result in an increased localisation of the induced sensation whilst maintaining a similar dynamic range and JND. EMG interference was shown to be lower for the concentric electrodes.},

  abstract     = {To control the robotic joints of an upper limb prosthesis, most existing approaches rely on decoding the user motor intention from electrophysiological signals produced by the subject, and then executing the desired movement. This suffers from important limitations and requires extended training, particularly when a large number of prosthetic joints have to be controlled. Even when they master the control of their prosthesis, many amputees underuse the prosthetic mobility to the benefit of compensatory body movements, whose generation is less expensive and more natural from a cognitive point of view. Indeed, with an arm prosthesis, hand movements result from a combination of human and robotic joint motions. We propose in this article to use these compensatory motions as an error signal to servo the robotic controller. This approach thus creates a coupling between body compensations and prosthetic movements. To study the feasibility of such a coupling, the concept is tested with ten able-bodied subjects wearing an emulated elbow prosthesis and one congenital arm amputee. The results validate the concept, which allows naive subjects to control the prosthetic joint with no or very short training period.},

Recent advances suggest that, soon, such mechatronic systems will also be used to assist people in their everyday life. In order to reach such target, exoskeletons must become able to perceive the environment. To this purpose, a system for the parametric identification of a staircase is proposed in this article. More precisely, given a staircase of unknown geometry, the system identifies its 3D shape. Furthermore, it also estimates the reciprocal orientation and distance between the exoskeleton and the staircase. Differently from other approaches, this result is achieved by means of low cost devices: an inertial measurement unit, two ranging sensors, and an Arm-Cortex processor. Starting from the ranging sensors acquisitions, the staircase model is identified in real time, during the execution of a step. The proposed procedure is based on an extended recursive total least squares strategy, in order to fully exploit the computational capabilities of the Arm processor, and it is characterized by execution times smaller than 10-3 s. The estimation algorithm has been tested on an actual exoskeleton and the resulting experimental outcomes are compared with the results obtained through alternative methods.},

In this article, a 8-DOF kinematic model of the upper limb complex is derived to evaluate the reachable workspace of the arm during interaction with a planar robot and to serve as the basis for rehabilitation strategies and assistive robotics. Through inverse differential kinematics and by taking account the physical limits of each arm joint, the model determines workspaces where the individual is able to perform tasks and those regions where robotic assistance is required. Next, a learning-from-demonstration strategy via a nonparametric potential field function is derived to teach the robot the required assistance based on demonstrations of functional tasks. This article investigates two applications. First, in the context of rehabilitation, robotic assistance is only provided if the individual is required to move her arm in regions that are not reachable via voluntary motion. Second, in the context of assistive robotics, the demonstrated trajectory is scaled down to match the individual&#39;s voluntary range of motion through a nonlinear workspace mapping. Assistance is provided within that workspace only. Experimental results in 5 different experimental scenarios with a person with cerebral palsy confirm the suitability of the proposed framework.},

In this study, we show that a myoelectric interface on the musculotendinous junctions (MTJs) of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) enables reliable control of a robotic glove with a single EMG sensor by identifying power grasp intentions. We found that the myoelectric signals from the MTJs of the FDS show significantly increased amplitudes exclusively when a power grasp is performed, regardless of the arm posture. We systematically verified that, in identifying power grasp intentions, the proposed single-sensor myoelectric interface even outperforms a five-sensor myoelectric interface around the proximal forearm. By exploiting the unique biological feature of the MTJs, we devised two myoelectric control methods for a robotic glove-Dual-threshold control and Morse-code control-and further showed their performances in practical operations. Dual-threshold control enables direct co-operation between the user and the robotic glove, and Morse-code control provides various command options for the user.},

  abstract     = {The shoulder plays a crucial role in moving the upper limb. It is capable of articulating in three degrees-of-freedom, which enables the arm to perform kinematically complex manipulation actions. Wearable devices targeting the shoulder must be able to emulate its kinematics. Robotic exosuits are an attractive medium to provide shoulder assistance; but current soft robotic actuators feature limited mobility. This work presents a new 2-DOF soft robotic shoulder exosuit that utilizes modular soft actuators that are able to emulate the humerus’ movement. The actuator design enables 3-D bending with insignificant resistance. Powered through separated inflation modules, these actuators are configured as two antagonistic pairs that operate in a parallel configuration. The actuator can reach full bending ( $\mathbf {\mathrm {&amp;gt;}} 360\mathbf {^\circ }$ ) with low pressures ( $\mathbf {\mathrm {\sim }}10$ kPA). The exosuit’s actuators output 11.15N-m of torque at the neutral position, and 4.44 N-m at $90\mathbf {^\circ }$ shoulder elevation. A test performed on healthy subjects showed that use of the exosuit reduces muscle activation by up to 65% when performing shoulder elevation, and up to 34% when rotating the plane of elevation. The reduction in muscle activation highlights the promising ability of robotic exosuits in supporting arm movements through the entire range of their motion.},

While the concept offers good wearability properties, it has never been used in wearable robotics for full support. This work shows that the combination of electro-hydrostatic actuators with a return force and series elastic element offers a good alternative to other actuation types. Custom and small commercial components are used in a design for the knee joint. An experimental setup with a pendulum representing a swinging lower leg was used to show force and angle tracking performance. The results of a maximum zero force (-400-1100 N actuator force range) tracking mean absolute error of 61 N (6.79 Nm joint torque error) at 5.5 Hz excitation and a full swing (70°) within 0.35 s (0.8 m/s actuator velocity), match or exceed current state of the art exoskeleton actuation and control and show that the PREHydrA concept is very well suited for application in exoskeleton technology, especially when the cylinder design is optimized.},

  abstract     = {Physical human-robot interfaces are a challenging aspect of exoskeleton design, mainly due to the fact that interfaces tend to migrate relatively to the body leading to discomfort and power losses. Therefore, the key is to develop interfaces that optimize attachment stiffness, i.e., reduce relative motion, without compromising comfort. To that end, we propose a method to obtain the optimal attachment pressure in terms of connection stiffness and comfort. The method is based on a soft robotic interface capable of actively controlling strapping pressure which is coupled to a cobot. Hereby the effects of strapping pressure on energetic losses, connection stiffness, and perceived comfort are analyzed. Results indicate a trade-off between connection stiffness and perceived comfort for this type of interface. An optimal strapping pressure was found in the 50 to 80 mmHg range. Connection stiffness was found to increase linearly over a pressure range from 0 mmHg (stiffness of 1139 N/m) to 100 mmHg (stiffness of 2232 N/m). And energetic losses were reduced by 42% by increasing connection stiffness. This research highlights the importance of strapping pressure when attaching an exoskeleton to a human and introduces a new adaptive interface to improve the coupling from an exoskeleton to an individual.},

Maximum use time was more than 20.24 hours with 12,609 steps per day. An implemented yielding function to support walking down slopes or stairs was used by all patients.

  abstract     = {Lower-limb gait training exoskeletons are extraordinary tools used to reduce the burden of locomotor impairments in patients with neurological diseases. However, the transparent operation and backdrivability of such systems still needs to be improved. Moreover, it is not completely understood how the mechanical design of the robot can interfere with the user&#39;s gait pattern. Aiming to address these shortcomings, we investigate the required driving torques and mechanical power to move the legs under a wide range of actuator&#39;s mass, inertia and friction and thigh/shank lengths. We used the ExoRoboWalker, a six-degree-of-freedom lower-limb exoskeleton, to build a framework model based on the double-pendulum approach integrated with the actuators&#39; mechanical impedance. Decoupled joint apparent inertia and the Rayleigh&#39;s dissipation function were introduced to the robot&#39;s Lagrangian to consider the effects of gearhead ratio and joint friction in the model. Firstly, it is presented the isolated effect of such variables on the required driving torques of the system. The oscillation frequency for the minimum joint torque was severely affected by variations of inertia, friction, and links length. Secondly, the combined effect of the actuator&#39;s mass, inertia and friction reveled that a heavier exoskeleton with low-ratio transmission required less torque and mechanical power than a lighter one with greater reduction ratio depending on the oscillation frequency, which is remarkable. These findings have important implications for new designs of lower-limb gait training systems.},

  abstract     = {Endovascular interventions are usually guided by intraoperative 2D images, which cannot fully reflect the 3D structure of vessels and sometimes cause ambiguity. Registering preoperative 3D images to intraoperative 2D images can help eliminate this ambiguity. Most existing methods can only converge to a local optimal solution. Similar to POSE [1], we formulate the problem as 2D-3D point set registration, and develop a fast and accurate global registration method. We propose a novel objective function using consensus set between the 3D points and the projection lines of the 2D points in the 3D space, and introduce a new global optimal rotation search algorithm. The translation search problem is tackled by synchronized grid search in the translation space. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm to register 3D vessels to its two projections, which only increases the runtime slightly but improves the 3D registration accuracy significantly. The proposed method is approximately two times faster than POSE. Experiments on real data show that the mean 3D rotation error is reduced from 5.55 degrees of POSE to 1.62 degrees and the mean translation error is reduced from 8.60 mm of POSE to 1.06 mm by the proposed double-plane method.},

An ultrasound video is then parsed through a CNN frame by frame and classified by quality of image: satisfactory, not satisfactory, and partially satisfactory. Partial images, containing a part of the heart, are then used to reposition the ultrasound. The repositioning function analyzes the intensity profile of the average image array and uses it to instruct the arm to make appropriate adjustments to obtain a satisfactory image.

  abstract     = {This article presents a framework for 3D reconstruction of colonic surface using stereo colonoscopic images. Due to the limited overlaps between consecutive frames and the nonexistence of large loop closures during a normal screening colonoscopy, the state-of-art simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms cannot be directly applied to this scenario, thus a colon model segmented from CT scans is used together with the colonosocopic images to achieve the colon 3D reconstruction with high accuracy. The proposed framework includes 3D scan (point cloud with RGB information) reconstruction from stereo images, a visual odometry (VO) based camera pose initialization module, a 3D registration scheme for matching texture scans to the segmented colon model, and a barycentric-based texture rendering module for mapping textures from colonoscopic images to the reconstructed colonic surface. A realistic simulator is developed using Unity to simulate the procedures of colonoscopy and used to provide experimental datasets in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed 3D colonic surface reconstruction method in terms of accuracy and robustness. Currently, the framework requires a pre-operative colon model as the template for colon reconstruction and can reconstruct 3D colon maps when the colon has no large deformation and the colon structure is clearly visible. The datasets used in this article and the developed simulator are made publicly available for other researchers to use (https://github.com/zsustc/colon_reconstruction_dataset).},

This article presents the development, operation, and evaluation of a new, commercial-robot-based, image-guided surgery system that automates the process of bone preparation and polyaxial screw placement. The system is based on the KUKA LBR iiwa 7-axis collaborative robot. Fiducial marker and screw locations are defined on a pre-operative CT image using the 3D Slicer open source image visualization platform. The system uses the robot&#39;s internal localization system for registration, by touching fiducial markers in a hand-guiding mode. A rotary-motor end effector with exchangeable tools is used for both hole-drilling and screw placement. A novel single-motor based mechanism was developed for placing polyaxial pedicle screws. An accuracy test was performed by placing polyaxial screws in synthetic vertebrae which mimic the mechanical properties of human bone. In placing 10 screws, the entry point accuracy was 0.49 ± 0.17 mm and the destination point accuracy was 1.49 ± 0.46 mm. The results compare favorably to evaluations of commercial robotic spine surgery systems.},

The capsule is conceived to provide automatic palpation of non-polypoid colorectal tumours during colonoscopy, since it is characterized by high degree of dysplasia, higher invasiveness and lower detection rates with respect to polyps. A first test was performed employing a silicone phantom that embedded inclusions with variable hardness and curvature. A hardness-based classification was implemented, demonstrating detection robustness to curvature variation. By comparing a set of supervised classification algorithms, a weighted 3-nearest neighbor classifier was selected. A bias force normalization model was introduced in order to make different acquisition sets consistent. Parameters of this model were chosen through a particle swarm optimization method. Additionally, an ex-vivo test was performed to assess the capsule detection performance when magnetically-driven along a colonic tissue. Lumps were identified as voltage peaks with a prominence depending on the total magnetic force applied to the capsule. Accuracy of 94 % in hardness classification was achieved, while a 100 % accuracy is obtained for the lump detection within a tolerance of 5 mm from the central path described by the capsule. In real application scenario, we foresee our device aiding physicians to detect tumorous tissues.},

  abstract     = {In surgical robotics, the ability to achieve high levels of autonomy is often limited by the complexity of the surgical scene. Autonomous interaction with soft tissues requires machines able to examine and understand the endoscopic video streams in real-time and identify the features of interest. In this work, we show the first example of spatio-temporal neural networks, based on the U-Net, aimed at segmenting soft tissues in endoscopic images. The networks, equipped with Long Short-Term Memory and Attention Gate cells, can extract the correlation between consecutive frames in an endoscopic video stream, thus enhancing the segmentation&#39;s accuracy with respect to the standard U-Net. Initially, three configurations of the spatio-temporal layers are compared to select the best architecture. Afterwards, the parameters of the network are optimised and finally the results are compared with the standard U-Net. An accuracy of 83.77% ± 2.18% and a precision of 78.42% ± 7.38% are achieved by implementing both Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) convolutional layers and Attention Gate blocks. The results, although originated in the context of surgical tissue retraction, could benefit many autonomous tasks such as ablation, suturing and debridement.},

  abstract     = {Objective: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is the use of electrophysiological methods during certain high-risk surgeries to assess the functional integrity of nerves in real time and alert the surgeon to prevent damage. However, the efficiency of IONM in current practice is limited by latency of verbal communications, inter-rater variability, and the subjective manner in which electrophysiological signals are described. Methods: In an attempt to address these shortcomings, we investigate automated classification of free-running electromyogram (EMG) waveforms during IONM. We propose a hybrid model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) component and a long short-term memory (LSTM) component to better capture complicated EMG patterns under conditions of both electrical noise and movement artifacts. Moreover, a preprocessing pipeline based on data normalization is used to handle classification of data from multiple subjects. To investigate model robustness, we also analyze models under different methods for processing of artifacts. Results: Compared with several benchmark modeling methods, CNN-LSTM performs best in classification, achieving accuracy of 89.54% and sensitivity of 94.23% in cross-patient evaluation. Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM model shows promise for automated classification of continuous EMG in IONM. Significance: This technique has potential to improve surgical safety by reducing cognitive load and inter-rater variability.},

  abstract     = {The use of intelligent feedback modalities to control and react to interaction forces during surgical procedures is an important factor in enabling safe and precise surgery. We explore the use of a model-mediated telemanipulation framework to enhance a user’s situational awareness using assistive virtual fixtures and semi-automated task execution for safe and intuitive environment interaction during robotic laparoscopic surgery. The framework allows stiffness mapping with semi-autonomous excitation, hybrid position-force control, and model updates during soft geometry contact. A 24-person study was carried out at 3 sites in simulated ablation and palpation of phantom anatomy. Compared to methods lacking intelligent feedback and guidance, the proposed framework improved task execution metrics (force regulation, completion time, path-following error) and reduced user effort.},

Socially assistive robots (SARs) are supportive rehabilitation tools for children with developmental disabilities. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of SARs at engaging children with CP during therapeutic interventions. A search through WoS, IEEE, PubMed, EMBASE, and ACM DL yielded 583 results, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Of the 9 studies, 5 unique SARs were evaluated across 24 participants. In general, the meta-analysis suggested that SARs can be effectively used to engage children in therapeutic interventions. However, there is a clear need for future work so that SAR designs can more accurately meet this population&#39;s needs.},

  abstract     = {Stroke incidence is increasing more rapidly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) than in High-Income Countries (HICs), but LMICs are not well organized to provide adequate post-stroke rehabilitation because of physical, financial and personal barriers. The use of rehabilitation robotics can help bridge in healthcare disparities but they are available in LMICs in limited number due to their high cost and this limits the number of patients that can benefit from them. This article presents a literature review on the affordable robots for upper limb stroke rehabilitation that could be suitable in low-resources clinical settings with a focus on the different techniques implemented to reduce production costs. Different approaches can be carried out: i) developing end-effector and exoskeleton robots for the rehabilitation of proximal and distal joints respectively; ii) reducing the number of degrees of freedom of the robots at minimum (one or two) allowing the rehabilitation in a planar workspace; iii) avoiding the use of conventional materials that could make the robot bulky, expensive and difficult to transport. According to the mechanical properties required by the task, stell or metal alloys could be substituted for wood, aluminum, plastic, 3D-printed materials and by the adaptation of off-the-shelf elements.},

  abstract     = {Effectiveness of computer vision techniques has been demonstrated through a number of applications, both within and outside healthcare. The operating room environment specifically is a setting with rich data sources compatible with computational approaches and high potential for direct patient benefit. The aim of this review is to summarize major topics in computer vision for surgical domains. The major capabilities of computer vision are described as an aid to surgical teams to improve performance and contribute to enhanced patient safety. Literature was identified through leading experts in the fields of surgery, computational analysis and modeling in medicine, and computer vision in healthcare. The literature supports the application of computer vision principles to surgery. Potential applications within surgery include operating room vigilance, endoscopic vigilance, and individual and team-wide behavioral analysis. To advance the field, we recommend collecting and publishing carefully annotated datasets. Doing so will enable the surgery community to collectively define well-specified common objectives for automated systems, spur academic research, mobilize industry, and provide benchmarks with which we can track progress. Leveraging computer vision approaches through interdisciplinary collaboration and advanced approaches to data acquisition, modeling, interpretation, and integration promises a powerful impact on patient safety, public health, and financial costs.},
