  abstract     = {Our perception of the situation in a country or a region is strongly influenced by the reflection of this situation in mass and social media channels. This effect is even more pronounced for geographically and culturally distant regions, for which no firsthand experience is available. To avoid information overload, news outlets typically filter the available news from foreign countries based on the expected interest of the target audiences. Such filtering imposes an inherent bias in the reporting and can create a distorted perception of a region among the consumers of news of other regions. This might lead to misunderstandings between countries and unsubstantiated political and individual decisions (e.g., in the context of migration). In this article, we systematically analyze the bias created in news reports. We consider Europe, or more precisely the European Union (EU) as our zone of concern , and examine its image in the media (news outlets) of other regions, Europe(NON-EU), Africa, Asia, Middle-East, America, and Oceania. An analysis of the year 2018 (January–December 2018) of news published in those regions reveals marked differences in the editorial policies and presented narrative when dealing with EU-related news. We observe a significant variation in the sentiment polarity of the reported EU-related stories between the European and other regional news outlets. We further analyze the polarity variation among different subregions of large geographical areas, such as Africa, Asia, and America. We observe a contrasting difference in their editorial policies. This trend also holds for news related to different topics, such as politics, business, economy, health, and international relation.},

  abstract     = {Depression has become a big problem in our society today. It is also a major reason for suicide, especially among teenagers. In the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the affected countries have recommended social distancing and lockdown measures. Resulting in interpersonal isolation, these measures have raised serious concerns for mental health and depression. Generally, clinical psychologists diagnose depressed people via face-to-face interviews following the clinical depression criteria. However, often patients tend to not consult doctors in their early stages of depression. Nowadays, people are increasingly using social media to express their moods. In this article, we aim to predict depressed users as well as estimate their depression intensity via leveraging social media (Twitter) data, in order to aid in raising an alarm. We model this problem as a supervised learning task. We start with weakly labeling the Twitter data in a self-supervised manner. A rich set of features, including emotional, topical, behavioral, user level, and depression-related &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -gram features, are extracted to represent each user. Using these features, we train a small long short-term memory (LSTM) network using Swish as an activation function, to predict the depression intensities. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We outperform the baseline models for depression intensity estimation by achieving the lowest mean squared error of 1.42 and also outperform the existing state-of-the-art binary classification method by more than 2% of accuracy. We found that the depressed users frequently use negative words such as stress and sad, mostly post during late nights, highly use personal pronouns and sometimes also share personal events.},

  abstract     = {Recommender system (RS) suggests relevant objects to generate personalized service and minimize information overload issue. User-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) plays a dominant role in practical RSs. However, traditional UBCF suffers from a recommendation overfitting problem, i.e., recommendations generated by UBCF usually concentrate on popular items, resulting in lower diversity. In addition, UBCF cannot maintain a reasonable tradeoff between the accuracy and diversity of recommendations because raising the diversity is often accompanied by a decrease in accuracy. In this article, we propose a novel approach, namely link-based collaborative filtering, to enhance the recommendation accuracy and diversity simultaneously without employing additional complex information. First, a user–item bipartite network is constructed based on the user–item rating matrix of RSs. Then, a global–local weighted bipartite modularity is presented to conduct link partition so that links with the same community can not only be relatively denser but also own the same characteristic. Furthermore, redundant links are removed from each community by utilizing a link reduction algorithm so that neighborhood of a target user can be selected according to the more efficient nonredundant links. Finally, rating prediction is executed based on the rating information of neighborhood. Also, items owning the highest predicted rating scores will be recommended to the target user. Experimental results from three real datasets of RSs suggest that, without taking advantage of special additional data, our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art studies and is able to generate personalized recommendations with satisfying accuracy and diversity simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few decades, many research efforts have been dedicated to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate resilience in different domains. As compared with research areas in social science and ecology, the concept of resilience in the engineering domain is relatively new. In the engineering domain, studies on resilience mostly focus on civil infrastructure. It is important to extend the concept of resilience to a broad range of engineering applications. The field environments of complex engineering systems vary with different applications. Even with the same component/system applied in different field environments, the ability, time, and resources required by failure detection, diagnosis, and restoration can be different. Hence, it is critical to introduce a new dimension, random field environment (RFE), into the development of the mathematical model for quantifying resilience. This article first introduces a new definition of resilience and then proposes a general RFE-based multidimensional time-dependent resilience model connecting reliability, vulnerability, and recoverability. Besides, we present a specific RFE-based multidimensional time-dependent resilience model by considering the specified functions of the impact of the RFE on system performance and recovery. Furthermore, we extend the proposed resilience model by incorporating multiple failure paths of complex systems. Finally, we apply the proposed resilience model to vehicular edge computing networks to evaluate the vehicular network resilience with the disruptive events on the communication links.},

Several approaches have been investigated to identify, predict, and recommend scientific collaborators but few have considered to explore a strategy using the game theory. This article investigates the social phenomenon of upstream reciprocity (UR) using a game-theoretical framework. UR occurs when a person who has just received help, in turn, offers help to another. A suitable multiplayer game, the public goods game (PGG), is adopted to model scholarly interactions of coauthorship networks. Experiments are performed on real datasets in which cascades of UR scholars are identified. More importantly, the proposed UR strategy achieves better performance than non-UR scholars as they are found to have a higher publication and citation count. Furthermore, UR behavior is found to replicate throughout the network, which in turn increases the likelihood of others adopting it. Finally, theoretical proof and simulations suggest that UR has the potential to become an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS).},

  abstract     = {The rising usage of social media has motivated to invent different methodologies of anonymous writing, which leads to an increase in malicious and suspicious activities. This anonymity has created difficulty in finding the suspect. Author profiling deals with the characterization of an author through some key attributes such as gender, age, language, dialect region variety, personality, and so on. Identifying the gender of the author of a suspect document is a salient task of author-profiling. The linguistic profile of a user can help in determining his/her demographics. Different social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, are used regularly by users for sharing their daily life activities. Moreover, users often post images along with text on different social media platforms; thus, the usage of multimodal information is very common nowadays. In this article, the task of automatic gender prediction from multimodal Twitter data is posed as a classification problem and an efficient multimodal neural framework is proposed for solving this. The popularly used BERT_base is utilized for learning the encoded representation for the text part of the tweet, and recently introduced EfficientNet is used for extracting the features from images. Finally, a direct product-based fusion strategy is applied for fusing the text and image representations, followed by a fully connected layer for predicting the gender of a Twitter user. Plagiarism detection authorship analysis near end duplicate detection (PAN)-2018 author profiling data are used for evaluating the performance of our proposed approach. Our proposed model achieved accuracies of 82.05%, 86.22%, and 89.53% for pure-image, pure-text, and multimodal setting, respectively; outperforming the previous state-of-the-art works in all the cases. Moreover, a deep analysis is carried out to interpret the produced results; different words that serve as clues for gender classification are identified characterizing different gender classes.

We develop a progressive estimation of the disease transmission rates and the recovering rates based on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data published by John Hopkins University. We determine the fraction of individual who wear masks by a maximum likelihood estimation, which maximizes the transition probability of a stochastic SIR model. The transition probability is numerically difficult to compute whether the number of infected individuals is large. We develop an approximation for the transition probability based on the central limit theorem and mean-field approximation. We show through numerical study that our approximation works well. We develop a bond percolation analysis to predict the eventual fraction of population who are infected, assuming that parameters of the SIR model do not change anymore. The percolation threshold is exactly the basic reproduction number of the epidemic. We predict the outcome of COVID-19 pandemic using our theory.},

  abstract     = {Multidocument summarization problem deals with extracting main information and ideas from a set of related documents. Solution to this problem is to find an extraction strategy that aims at finding a small subset of sentences that is able to cover the most important information about the whole document set. Although a large number of machine-learning-based methods have shown great promise, the lack of high-quality training data poses an inherent obstacle to them. Furthermore, because of the proliferation of low-quality documents on the Internet, the existing summarization strategies, which are merely based on statistical features, get poor performance. In this article, we propose a new two-phase multidocument summarization strategy using content attention-based subtopic detection. First, inspired by distance dynamics-based community detection mechanism, we extract subtopics from the set of documents by having insight into their own content attention and also underlying semantic relations. Instead of complicated neural attention mechanisms, we propose a simple iteration-based content attention method to complete the subtopic detection task. Second, we formulate summarization from different subtopics as a combinatorial optimization problem of minimizing sentence distance and maximizing topic diversity. We prove the submodularity of the above optimization problem, which allows us to propose a new multidocument summarization algorithm based on the greedy mechanism. Finally, we experimentally validate our new algorithms on BBC news summary and wikiHow data. The results show our new algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Online product reviews have become increasingly important in digital consumer markets where they play a crucial role in making purchasing decisions by most consumers. Unfortunately, spammers often take advantage of online reviews by writing fake reviews to promote/demote certain products. Most of the previous studies have focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewer-ids. However, to target a particular product, fake reviewers work collaboratively in groups and/or create multiple fake ids to write reviews and control the sentiments of the product. This article addresses the problem of finding such fake reviewer groups. More specifically, we propose a top-down framework for candidate fake reviewer groups’ detection based on the DeepWalk approach on reviewers’ graph data and a (modified) semisupervised clustering method, which can incorporate partial background knowledge. We validate our proposed framework on a real review dataset from the Google Play Store, which has partial ground-truth information about 2207 fraud reviewer-ids out of all 38 123 reviewer-ids in the dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to identify the candidate spammer groups with reasonable accuracy. The proposed approach can also be extended to detect groups of opinion spammers in social media (e.g. fake comments or fake postings) with temporal affinity, semantic characteristics, and sentiment analysis.},

  abstract     = {The gold market plays a vital role in the world economy. Due to its complex and nonstationary nature, predicting the price of gold is particularly challenging. In this study, a new hybrid forecasting approach named variational mode decomposition (VMD)-iterated cumulative sums of squares (ICSS)-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) is proposed by integrating BiGRU deep learning model, VMD, and iterated cumulative sum of squares algorithm. The forecasting framework is able to extract the inner factors and patterns within the gold futures market movements, decompose its correlation with external markets and detect shifts within market conditions in order to accurately predict price movements in the gold futures market. The experimental results show that the hybrid forecasting approach can improve the prediction performance significantly in comparison to the benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend the proposed hybrid forecasting approach to generate trading strategies and test trading performance of the gold futures market. The testing results over an out-of-sample period of 11 years (2008–2019) indicate that the strategy generated based on the prediction of the proposed approach displays high levels of consistency in generating positive returns and outperforms several other common trading strategies under various market conditions. The approach also shows consistent better results when generalized to the spot gold market, providing practical guidance for minimizing investment risk and hedging strategies in the gold commodity market.},

  abstract     = {Blackhole detection in the opportunistic networks offers an effective means to mitigate the routing performance degradation but faces many challenges from corrupted nodes due to their collusion behaviors. Most existing effort in the literature focuses on the blackhole feature extraction from the message exchange. However, the decay effect of features and the forged features from the corrupted node, which acts as the rational node in performing message exchange, degrade the performance of the detection. In this article, we investigate the evidence construction, i.e., the direct and indirect evidence with the statistical parameters in message exchange. Specifically, we construct behavior classifiers to distinguish the blackhole behaviors from rational ones and design the collusion filtering strategy to improve the detection accuracy by separating corrupted nodes from rational ones, laying a behavior identification foundation. The contact evidence-driven blackhole detection (CEBD) based on machine learning is proposed to improve the routing performance. The soundness of the proposed scheme is verified statistically and the detection accuracy is evaluated based on random waypoint model (RWP) trace and Shanghai taxi trace. Extensive simulations show that our scheme outperforms the benchmarks, including SDBG, Li, and MDS, in terms of the delivery ratio in various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {As a key research issue in mobile crowdsensing (MCS), recent studies on task recommendation have begun to focus on recommending tasks to participants according to the learned participant preferences. The common drawbacks of these studies are that, on the one hand, the factors affecting participant preferences are predefined, which is not practical as the influential factors are quite complex and a full map of participant profiles needs to be preexisted. On the other hand, they do not consider how to update the recommendation dynamically. To overcome these drawbacks, a profile-free and real-time task recommendation method is proposed in this work. First, we apply the recommendation systems to MCS to realize profile-free task recommendations. Second, a participant-task-location tensor is constructed, based on which an improved tensor factorization method is presented to provide task recommendations for participants at a given location. Finally, we design a real-time update algorithm based on the idea of one update at a time to update task recommendation lists for participants in real time. Based on real-world trace data sets, extensive evaluations show that the proposed method has obvious advantages over other baselines in terms of accuracy and time cost.},

Compared with traditional class, grade, and school closure strategies, the DCT-based strategy offers a practical yet much more efficient way of mitigating COVID-19 spreading in the crowded campus. Specifically, the strategy based on DCT can achieve the same level of disease control as rigid school suspensions but with significantly fewer students quarantined. We further explore the necessary conditions to ensure the effectiveness of DCT-based strategy and auxiliary strategies to enhance mitigation effectiveness and make the following recommendation: social distancing should be implemented along with DCT, the adoption rate of DCT devices should be assured, and swift virus tests should be carried out to discover asymptomatic infections and stop their subsequent transmissions. We also argue that primary schools have higher disease transmission risks than high schools and, thereby, should be alerted when considering reopenings.},

With the study and application of intelligent fraud detection technology, scholars found that the representation learning method can reveal more information about fraud patterns, which is also crucial for detection task. Therefore, in this work, we present a novel method for detecting fraud transactions by combining two modules learning hidden information at different levels of data in a unified framework. To address and explore the deep representation of features of transaction behaviors, we propose a two-level attention model to capture them by integrating two data embeddings at the data sample level and the feature level. In particular, the sample-level attention model captures the detailed information more centrally that is difficult to determine; the feature-level attention model extends the information of feature dependences. We further combine them to train a final fraud detection model. Extensive experiments are conducted using a data set provided by a financial company in China and several public financial data sets. The results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method in detecting fraudulent transactions compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Person reidentification, as one of the most important areas in the video surveillance field, is a crucial task in computer vision. It has attracted more and more attention in both academic research and industry due to its extremely high application value. However, the recognition accuracy of person reidentification is subjected to factors, such as illumination, pose, occlusion, and viewpoint. To alleviate the effect of such factors, the multiscale Retinex with color restoration (MSRSC) algorithm is adopted to preprocess the original images so that the color information can be restored and the illumination condition can be improved. To obtain pose-invariant features (PIFs), the convolution pose machine that can generate the body joint points of pedestrians is applied to divide the body into seven parts, the pose transform network is then used to align the body parts, and finally, the PIFs can be obtained from a designed pseudo-Siamese network by using the original and aligned images as the training samples. To further improve recognition accuracy, a reranking method based on bidirectional k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is presented to optimize the ranking list. Experimentally, the proposed method is implemented on three data sets: viewpoint invariant pedestrian recognition (VIPeR), CUHK03, and Market1501. The results demonstrate our method outperforms the other methods, as a result of both the representation of a more discriminative feature descriptor and the introduction of a reranking method.},

More specifically, in the opinion domain, learning the cognitive links and making a proper model for causal relationships between individuals is necessary for both analysis and control purposes. There are several mathematical models for opinion dynamics. However, few of them have been tested to be consistent with real-world data. In this article, a new hybrid model for opinion dynamics is proposed and is put to test with subjective experiments. It is imperative that a realistic model considers two cognitive facts: 1) a person tends to stick to his/her previously shaped opinion and 2) the opinion of a person is affected by others (either reinforced in a positive way or undermined negatively). This article presents a novel mathematical formulation of the proposed opinion dynamics model and proves its stability too. The new model is also extended to support multiple dimensions. In the multidimensional approach, opinions about two or more subjects are considered separately. The rationale behind this is to describe the evolution of agents’ opinions on several topics. To study how the model performs in reality, some real-world experiments are conducted and the influence matrix is learned in each case. In addition, a method is introduced to extract the parameters of the model from the experimental data. It is shown that the new model predictions, after it is trained, chase the real behaviors of participants very well and result in less error compared with the previous models.},

However, the existing studies on MPs do not explain the assortative or disassortative tendencies of STNs due to their omission of the support of the sociological theory, as well as that of network theory. To address this issue, this study investigates the MPs in STNs from the standpoint of social identity theory (SIT). The user trust networks (UTNs) are modeled by a directed multigraph (DMG). Then, the structural properties of homogeneous trust networks and heterogeneous trust networks are explored via measures that include degree centrality, the correlation coefficient (CC), the cumulative distribution of the ratio of trust degree to distrust degree (CDRTD), and the assortativity coefficient. The MPs of homogeneous trust networks and heterogeneous trust networks are explained from the perspective of SIT. An experiential evaluation is conducted in the constructed homogeneous trust networks and heterogeneous trust networks using a real-world data set crawled from Epinions. The research findings indicate that the MPs in homogeneous trust networks tend toward assortative mixing (AM), and those in heterogeneous trust networks tend toward disassortative mixing (DM). The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed approach is superior to that of the state-of-the-art approach to influential user identification.},

  abstract     = {There are several kinds of smart devices, such as smartphones, sensors, and smart wearable devices, included in the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system, but different devices have their own data processing and programming paradigm. Programmers usually need to design the same data processing logic for different devices by using a different programming model. How to mapping the same code to different devices without any change is an emerging topic in the HITL system. Furthermore, the intelligent data processing for the smart CPS sector is experiencing significant growth in data volume, driven by a large number of smart devices that are anticipated in the near further. All these smart devices are expected to improve the overall HITL system performance marvelously. A large number of devices can also outstandingly increase the data volume, which needs to be processed in real time. How to process large-scale data on a smart device in real time is another challenge. Focused on these challenges, this article proposed a computing device-aware HITL CPS data processing framework, named Barge, aiming to map the regular code to the different hardware without any change. In Barge, a semantic model, an architecture-driven programming model, and a graph partition scheme are included. The semantic model is used to express the user-defined graph algorithms by using the domain-specific language. The architecture-driven programming model will execute the graph algorithms on a different device in parallel. Furthermore, the graph partition scheme will partition the large-scale graphs into suitable partitions by aware of the topology to make the partitioned data suitable for kinds of smart devices. We believe that our work would open a wide range of opportunities to improve the performance of large-scale graph processing for HITL systems.},

  abstract     = {Location-aware recommendation is considered as one of human behavior cognitive analyses in the world of human-machine-environment system. The development of 5G technology and ubiquitous mobile devices has led to the emergence of a new online platform, location-based social networks (LBSNs), which allows users to share their locations. The essential feature of LBSNs is to provide users with location recommendations that help them explore new places and also to make LBSNs more prevalent to users. Most of the existing research is focusing on the introduction of new features and how these new features affect the check-in behaviors of the users. In addition, the dependencies between each feature and the probability of a user visiting the site is always a principle to follow. However, a user’s decision could be determined by considering several features at the same time. When a full model is applied by considering all the features, an overfitting problem could be occurred owing to the lack of sufficient data for each individual user. In this article, an intermediate solution was proposed to address all of these problems by fragmenting the model into several partial models, where each partial model is responsible for a few features. An additive strategy was also implemented to support the development of personalized partial models. Furthermore, a partition-based approach was introduced to explore the hidden patterns from the geographically clustered check-in data. The performance of the approaches has been evaluated by using the data sets from Foursquare and it demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression recognition has drawn increasing attention because of its great potential in human behavior analysis. Traditional recognition models usually assume that the training set is sufficient, and the training and testing data sets have the same distribution. However, these two factors are not satisfied in some cases. In this study, a transfer model collaborating metric learning and dictionary learning called TMMLDL is proposed to address the transfer facial expression recognition problem. To reduce the impact of cross-domain distribution variation, the information of global structure and pairwise constraints are utilized among training images in different domains. In particular, a discriminative metric space is learned into dictionary learning procedure such that the dictionary items can well present the discriminative information of different facial expression classes in the metric subspace. The proposed model tunes dictionary and metric space in an alternative optimization algorithm, which is guaranteed to obtain the optimal model parameters simultaneously. The experimental results on nine cross-domain facial expression classification tasks show that the proposed model achieves the satisfactory recognition performance.},

The similarity matrix is often constructed by equally employing all features which may ignore the contribution differences existing among the features. In this study, we also propose a medoid-based fuzzy clustering algorithm feature pattern-driven similarity matrices-reduction based fuzzy clustering (FP-SMR-FC) which is different from the existing ones in the following two aspects. First, multiple similarity matrices are constructed to represent the similarity between objects. Additionally, a feature pattern-driven Shannon entropy which combines nondeterminacy information contained in the similarity matrices and statistical information contained in the features together is used to learn the weight of each similarity matrix. Second, during the clustering processes of FP-SMR-FC, a new schema for eliminating some of the similarity matrices with very few contributions is developed for similarity matrices reduction. The comparison studies in terms of time complexity and clustering accuracy for FP-SMR-FC with various medoid-based clustering algorithms on real-life data sets are done. In addition, FP-SMR-FC is applied to head pose estimation of human behavior analysis. Comparisons, indeed, demonstrate the promising performance of FP-SMR-FC in practice.},

A cognitive computing model based on context-aware data flow is constructed. Classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is used in the data computing layer of the cognitive model. In addition, the clustering effectiveness index based on frequent patterns optimizes the K-means clustering method. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed through simulation experiments. The results show that the CART algorithm requires fewer training data sets while guaranteeing classification accuracy. Also, the algorithm has obvious advantages under large-scale data. In the application of actual data set, on Over, Over+Noise, and Bridge, only the clustering validity index based on frequent pattern (FPCVI) index proposed finds the correct number of clusters.

  abstract     = {As one of the most successful recommendation techniques, neighborhood-based collaborative filtering (CF), which recommends appropriate items to a target user by identifying similar users or similar items, has been widely applied to various recommender systems. Although many neighbor-based CF methods have been put forward, there are still some open issues that have remained unsolved. First, the ever-increasing volume of user–item rating data decreases the recommendation efficiency significantly as a recommender system needs to analyze all the rating data when searching for similar neighbors or similar items. In this situation, users’ requirements on quick response may not be met. Second, in neighbor-based CF methods, more attention is paid to the recommendation accuracy while other key indicators of recommendation performances are often ignored, i.e., recommendation diversity (RD), which probably produces similar or redundant items in the recommended list and decreases users’ satisfaction. Considering these issues, a diversified and scalable recommendation method (called DR_LT) based on locality-sensitive hashing and cover tree is proposed in this article, where the item topic information is used to optimize the final recommended list. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method through a set of experiments on MovieLens data set that clearly shows the feasibility of our proposal in terms of item recommendation accuracy, diversity, and scalability.},

In this article, we will detect the echo chamber effect in real-world data set and measure this effect during the information diffusion process. Any user will be influenced by its neighbors or echo chamber effect. Also, we assume that these activation events from each activated neighbor and from echo chamber effect are independent. In this article, we detect and model the echo chamber effect for the first time. Then, the influence maximization with echo chamber (IMEC) problem aims to select &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; users to propagate information such that the expected number of activated users is maximized.

Then, an improved greedy algorithm is proposed, which is combined metaheuristic strategies.

  abstract     = {In the financial sector, the stock market and its trends are highly volatile in nature. Recent studies have shown that news articles and social media analysis can have an immense impact on investors’ opinion toward financial markets. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between news sentiment and stock market movement using information from different news agencies, business magazines, and financial portals. This study offers an application of the Bayesian structural time (BST) series model that is more transparent and facilitates better handling of uncertainty than the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the vector autoregression (VAR) method by using prior information about the structure of the model. One of the main pitfalls of this model is the presumption of linearity. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model is a nonlinear model that can capture various nonlinear structures present in the data set. We propose a hybrid model, which combines the LSTM model with the BST model along with the regression component that captures information from different news sources to identify market predictors. The proposed model detects unusual behavior or anomalous pattern of the stock price movement, which makes our model superior compared to the traditional methods. Our new hybrid model accumulates error with lower rates (3.5%) and shows a remarkable performance over some of the other existing hybrid models, such as AR-MLP, ARIMA-LSTM, and VAR-LSTM model.},

These factors, however, vary from region to region: consequently, farmers are unable to cultivate similar crops in every region. This is where machine learning (ML) techniques step in to help find the most suitable crops for a particular region, thus assisting farmers a great deal in crop prediction. The feature selection (FS) facet of ML is a major component in the selection of key features for a particular region and keeps the crop prediction process constantly upgraded. This work proposes a novel FS approach called modified recursive feature elimination (MRFE) to select appropriate features from a data set for crop prediction. The proposed MRFE technique selects and ranks salient features using a ranking method. The experimental results show that the MRFE method selects the most accurate features, while the bagging technique helps accurately predict a suitable crop. The performance of proposed MRFE technique is evaluated by various metrics such as accuracy (ACC), precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, area under the curve, mean absolute error, and log loss. From the performance analysis, it is justified that the MRFE technique performs well with 95% ACC than other FS methods.},

Recent literature proposes the concept of NDN-IoT, which maximizes the expansion of IoT applications by deploying NDN in the IoT. In the NDN, the security is built into the network by embedding a public signature in each data package to verify the authenticity and integrity of the content. However, signature schemes in the NDN-IoT environment are facing several challenges, such as signing security challenge for resource-constrained IoT end devices (EDs) and verification efficiency challenge for NDN routers. This article mainly studies the data package authentication scheme in the package-level security mechanism. Based on mobile edge computing (MEC), an efficient certificateless group signature scheme featured with anonymity, unforgeability, traceability, and key escrow resilience is proposed. The regional and edge architecture is utilized to solve the device management problem of IoT, reducing the risks of content pollution attacks from the data source. By offloading signature pressure to MEC servers, the contradiction between heavy overhead and shortage of ED resources is avoided. Moreover, the verification efficiency in NDN router is much improved via batch verification in the proposed scheme. Both security analysis and experimental simulations show that the proposed MEC-based certificateless group signature scheme is provably secure and practical.},

  abstract     = {The flow of information through active users in online social networks (OSNs) plays a major role in forming natural social groups, popularly known as communities . Although structural and topological aspects of the network had been central to most of the community detection approaches, incorporation of information flow for community detection has been an emerging topic in the recent past. Often, the flow of information is studied as a traceable process called information diffusion . The flow of information in the network affects various factors like temporal characteristics, network attributes, or social attributes. The information diffusion process helps to extract this information including where and when information is generated and in what fashion the dispersion occurs. Thus, it has the potential to aid the community detection process in social networks. In this article, the deployment of the information diffusion process for community detection has been studied extensively. The study is mainly focused on how information flow affects various network properties and social facets and explored the possibility of deployment for community detection.

  abstract     = {Although followership has been widely studied in sociology and management, the problem of finding followers has not drawn attention in the field of artificial intelligence. We refer to the problem of finding followers of a given object as followers search. In sociology, followers are close to their leaders, and leaders are superior to their followers. In this article, aimed at finding followers of a given object, we formulate followers on the basis of both superiority and closeness. The former means that the given object should be superior to followers, and the latter means that followers should be close to the given object. We present a followers search algorithm to find the followers of the given object. Furthermore, we apply the ideas of followers to the market basket and recommender system datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the rationality of the discovered followers on the market basket dataset and the improved performance of the TrustPMF algorithm by adopting followership on recommender system datasets, which indicate a promising future for followers search.},

  abstract     = {Concerns regarding the impact of opening daycares and day camps are examined to explore the sensitivity on outbreaks of COVID-19. Overall, while controlling the spread of COVID-19 must be a major concern for all people, society needs to consider various options, including those of alternative reopening strategies to reflect both the impact on children when reopening of daycares/day camps but also the potential impact on viral growth transmittance. Infectivity modeling scenarios are described for the province of Ontario, indicating how the caseloads may reverberate through the population in response to the opening of daycare and summer day camps. An SEIR model, stratified by age, is used to model the primary compartments of the virus. The results show that the spread of COVID-19 reached a peak in April 2020 and steadily declined for Toronto and Peel Public Health Units (PHUs). Furthermore, the model indicates that reducing daycare and day camp capacities by 50% results in more than a 75% reduction in impacts on caseload and deaths, relative to not undertaking due care and diligence to control the virus growth. The findings indicate that combining reduced capacity with effective social distancing parameters is expected to be the most effective in reducing additional caseloads associated with reopening daycare and day camps within Ontario. By reducing capacity and contact rates by 50% through social distancing protocols, additional cases are expected to reduce by 88% for Toronto and 91% for Peel PHUs. These results highlight the importance of both reducing daycare/day camp capacity and managing social distancing protocols that are effective measures to help control the spread of COVID-19 within Ontario.},

Novel coronavirus pneumonia affects people&#39;s lives, and they publish comments on social networks and media, and the underlying information from social networks and Internet media in turn affects people&#39;s attitude to the epidemic and the measures, and strategies taken to fight coronavirus in life. We collect the comments from various social network platforms and network media such as Weibo, WeChat, Chinanews, Sina News, NetEase News, Sohu News, and analyze the overall situation of public opinion on the novel coronavirus pneumonia. We explore the interaction between online public opinion and real life using a variety of algorithms in different stages of the epidemic. We can obtain public attention and key nodes in the dissemination of public opinion by detecting hot events and calculating user&#39;s influence. The analysis of information dissemination path is conducive to the rapid propagation of healthy comments, curbing the spread of bad information. Event-specific details and topics are mined from large amounts of comments by thematic clustering and association relationship detecting, which helps to provide technical support for government response measures. The emotional analysis of Internet users&#39; groups helps to guide the direction of public opinion.

  abstract     = {This article presents a method that detects tweet communities with similar topics and ranks the communities by importance measures . By identifying the tweet communities that have high importance measures, it is possible for users to easily find important information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Specifically, we first construct a community network, whose nodes are tweet communities obtained by applying a community detection method to a tweet network. The community network is constructed based on textual similarities between tweet communities and sizes of tweet communities. Second, we apply algorithms for calculating centrality to the community network. Because the obtained centrality is based on tweet community sizes as well, we call it the importance measure in distinction to conventional centrality. The importance measure can simultaneously evaluate the importance of topics in the entire data set and occupancy (or dominance) of tweet communities in the network structure. We conducted experiments by collecting Japanese tweets about COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020. The results show that the proposed method is able to extract keywords that have a high correlation with the number of people infected with COVID-19 in Japan. Because users can browse the keywords from a small number of central tweet communities, quick and easy understanding of important information becomes feasible.},

In response to the epidemic, a lot of important decisions need to be taken to save communities and economies worldwide. Data clearly play a vital role in effective decision-making. Data-driven decision-making uses data-related evidence and insights to guide the decision-making process and verify the plan of action before it is committed. To better handle the epidemic, governments and policy-making institutes have investigated abundant data originating from COVID-19. These data include those related to medicine, knowledge, media, and so on. Based on these data, many prevention and control policies are made. In this survey article, we summarize the progress of data-driven decision-making in the response to COVID-19, including COVID-19 prevention and control, psychological counseling, financial aid, work resumption, and school reopening. We also propose some current challenges and open issues in data-driven decision-making, including data collection and quality, complex data analysis, and fairness in decision-making.

  abstract     = {Social media (and the world at large) have been awash with news of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the passage of time, news and awareness about COVID-19 spread like the pandemic itself, with an explosion of messages, updates, videos, and posts. Mass hysteria manifest as another concern in addition to the health risk that COVID-19 presented. Predictably, public panic soon followed, mostly due to misconceptions, a lack of information, or sometimes outright misinformation about COVID-19 and its impacts. It is thus timely and important to conduct an ex post facto assessment of the early information flows during the pandemic on social media, as well as a case study of evolving public opinion on social media which is of general interest. This study aims to inform policy that can be applied to social media platforms; for example, determining what degree of moderation is necessary to curtail misinformation on social media. This study also analyzes views concerning COVID-19 by focusing on people who interact and share social media on Twitter. As a platform for our experiments, we present a new large-scale sentiment data set COVIDSENTI, which consists of 90 000 COVID-19-related tweets collected in the early stages of the pandemic, from February to March 2020. The tweets have been labeled into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment classes. We analyzed the collected tweets for sentiment classification using different sets of features and classifiers. Negative opinion played an important role in conditioning public sentiment, for instance, we observed that people favored lockdown earlier in the pandemic; however, as expected, sentiment shifted by mid-March. Our study supports the view that there is a need to develop a proactive and agile public health presence to combat the spread of negative sentiment on social media following a pandemic.},

People are using social media to receive and communicate different types of information on a massive scale during COVID-19 outburst. Mining such content to evaluate people’s sentiments can play a critical role in making decisions to keep the situation under control. The objective of this study is to mine the sentiments of Indian citizens regarding the nationwide lockdown enforced by the Indian government to reduce the rate of spreading of Coronavirus. In this work, the sentiment analysis of tweets posted by Indian citizens has been performed using NLP and machine learning classifiers. From April 5, 2020 to April 17, 2020, a total of 12 741 tweets having the keywords “Indialockdown” are extracted. Data have been extracted from Twitter using Tweepy API, annotated using TextBlob and VADER lexicons, and preprocessed using the natural language tool kit provided by the Python. Eight different classifiers have been used to classify the data. The experiment achieved the highest accuracy of 84.4% with LinearSVC classifier and unigrams. This study concludes that the majority of Indian citizens are supporting the decision of the lockdown implemented by the Indian government during corona outburst.},

We have also witnessed millions of people with increased mental health issues, such as depression, stress, worry, fear, disgust, sadness, and anxiety, which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe health crisis. Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioral, and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This article studies community depression dynamics due to the COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multimodal features from tweets and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multimodal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic, and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities that may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government, such as the state lockdown, also increased depression levels.},

  abstract     = {In December 2019, a pandemic named COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, and in a few weeks, it spread to more than 200 countries worldwide. Every country infected with the disease started taking necessary measures to stop the spread and provide the best possible medical facilities to infected patients and take precautionary measures to control the spread. As the infection spread was exponential, there arose a need to model infection spread patterns to estimate the patient volume computationally. Such patients’ estimation is the key to the necessary actions that local governments may take to counter the spread, control hospital load, and resource allocations. This article has used long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the volume of COVID-19 patients in Pakistan. LSTM is a particular type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used for classification, prediction, and regression tasks. We have trained the RNN model on Covid-19 data (March 2020 to May 2020) of Pakistan and predict the Covid-19 Percentage of Positive Patients for June 2020. Finally, we have calculated the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to find the model’s prediction effectiveness on different LSTM units, batch size, and epochs. Predicted patients are also compared with a prediction model for the same duration, and results revealed that the predicted patients’ count of the proposed model is much closer to the actual patient count.},

Most of the countries are fighting against this virus, and this virus has already claimed way too many lives. In countries such as the United States, Spain, and Italy, the scenario is worse. This article first explores the complete scenario of COVID-19 in India and then discusses its effect on the Indian economy, society, and financial sector, using a mathematical model known as ARMA-autoregressive moving average model. The forecast is that India is also on the verge of facing a worst situation if it is not strictly managed by the Indian government. Of the many sectors affected by the virus, a few are discussed here supported by graphical results. The Results section includes the forecast, which illustrates that the number of infected patients can increase up to 1 400 000 till December 2020. The forecast for daily encountered cases may also go up to approximately 14 000. This article shows the impact of COVID-19 on India in the upcoming months.},

  abstract     = {Social network information is a measure of the number of infections. Understanding the effect of social network information on disease spread can help improve epidemic forecasting and uncover preventive measures. Many driving factors for the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases remain unclear. Some experts believe that redundant information on social media may increase people’s panic to evade the restrictions or refuse to report their symptoms, which increases the actual infection rate. We analyze the engagement in the COVID-19 topics on the Internet and find that the infection rate is not only related to the total amount of information. In our research, information entropy is introduced into the quantification of the impact of social network information. We find that the amount of information with different distributions has different effects on disease transmission. Furthermore, we build a new dynamic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model with information entropy to simulate the epidemic situation in China. Simulation results show that our modified model is effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes.},

  abstract     = {The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread throughout China and worldwide since it was reported in Wuhan city, China in December 2019. 4 589 526 confirmed cases have been caused by the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), by May 18, 2020. At the early stage of the pandemic, the large-scale mobility of humans accelerated the spread of the pandemic. Rapidly and accurately tracking the population inflow from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province is especially critical to assess the potential for sustained pandemic transmission in new areas. In this study, we first analyze the impact of related multisource urban data (such as local temperature, relative humidity, air quality, and inflow rate from Hubei province) on daily new confirmed cases at the early stage of the local pandemic transmission. The results show that the early trend of COVID-19 can be explained well by human mobility from Hubei province around the Chinese Lunar New Year. Different from the commonly-used pandemic models based on transmission dynamics, we propose a simple but effective short-term prediction model for COVID-19 cases, considering the human mobility from Hubei province to the target cities. The performance of our proposed model is validated by several major cities in Guangdong province. For cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou with frequent population flow per day, the values of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$R^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; of daily prediction achieve 0.988 and 0.985.

In this article, we propose a feature-based TSA system in conjunction with improved negation accounting by leveraging different types of features such as lexicon-based, morphological, POS-based, n-gram features, and many more, which would be used for classifier training and have the strong impact on polarity determination. We use three different state-of-the-art classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayesian, and decision tree, and the series of experiments are conducted to determine which classifier works well with which feature group. In addition, this work focuses on investigating a significant linguistic phenomenon called negation which can either change polarity or strength of polarity of opinionated words. To enhance the classification performance, an algorithm is also developed to handle those negation tweets in which the presence of negation does not necessarily mean negation. The proposed feature-based Twitter system with negation accounting is evaluated on the benchmark Twitter data set SemEval-2013 Task 2. The experimental results demonstrate that the SVM classifier outperforms the other classifiers and the state-of-the-art TSA system developed by the NRC Canada winning team of SemEval-2013 Task 2. In addition, extensive experiments are also conducted to demonstrate that the proposed negation strategy with incorporated negation exception rules provides a substantial improvement by preventing misclassification of tweets. Finally, impact of each preprocessing module on classification performance is presented.},

Its goal is to explore the consistent relationship among social entities in the social system, which is conducive to promoting the development of social scene understanding. In a social relationship, consistency is easy to be ignored but is useful for many fields, e.g., natural language processing and computer vision. The social image colocalization aims to utilize the consistent relationship to discover the objects belonging to the same category and locate them by rectangle bounding boxes. The consistency is principally reflected in the category of objects, which can be achieved by a similar appearance or a uniform structure. Currently, state-of-the-art colocalization methods mainly focus on three solving strategies: candidate region proposal selection, saliency maps-based methods, and deep descriptor transformation. In this article, we sort out several kinds of the present mainstream methods and provide a comprehensive review of their fundamentals and performance. We expect that the overview of colocalization would be helpful for the researchers who are new to this area and provide them enlightenments.},

We map the assignment of recommendations in influence networks to a problem of selecting an l -cover of the minimum total cost, which is defined to be a set of assignments such that each user in the OSN is recommended of at least l different items at the minimum defined cost. This corresponds to a special case of the minimum weighted partition set cover problem, which is a generalization of the minimum weighted set cover problem, both of which are proven to be NP-hard. We formulate a corresponding integer programming problem and we apply a linear programming (LP)-based branch and bound (BnB) methodology for its solution. We also propose a greedy algorithm, denoted as CoveR, which we show to be an O((Δ/δ)·H(Δ))-approximation for the l -coverage problem, where Δ and δ are the maximum and minimum degree of an influence network, respectively, and H(Δ) is the Δ th harmonic number. We investigate CoveR&#39;s performance through extensive simulations on both synthetic and real networks, which indicate that the quality of its solution is comparable to the one obtained by the BnB method, while at the same time outperforms other information diffusion-aware recommendation heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Social media is a popular medium for the dissemination of real-time news all over the world. Easy and quick information proliferation is one of the reasons for its popularity. An extensive number of users with different age groups, gender, and societal beliefs are engaged in social media websites. Despite these favorable aspects, a significant disadvantage comes in the form of fake news, as people usually read and share information without caring about its genuineness. Therefore, it is imperative to research methods for the authentication of news. To address this issue, this article proposes a two-phase benchmark model named WELFake based on word embedding (WE) over linguistic features for fake news detection using machine learning classification. The first phase preprocesses the data set and validates the veracity of news content by using linguistic features. The second phase merges the linguistic feature sets with WE and applies voting classification. To validate its approach, this article also carefully designs a novel WELFake data set with approximately 72 000 articles, which incorporates different data sets to generate an unbiased classification output. Experimental results show that the WELFake model categorizes the news in real and fake with a 96.73% which improves the overall accuracy by 1.31% compared to bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) and 4.25% compared to convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Our frequency-based and focused analyzing writing patterns model outperforms predictive-based related works implemented using the Word2vec WE method by up to 1.73%.},

  abstract     = {Different from multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), multimodal MOPs (MMOPs) focus on both decision and objective spaces rather than only objective one. Thus, finding a good Pareto front approximation and finding the maximal number of equivalent Pareto optimal solutions for each objective vector in the Pareto front are two core tasks for them. Although some multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to handle them, they can quickly converge to the easy-to-find equivalent Pareto optimal solutions, thereby losing their ability to improve solution diversity in decision space and performance in objective space. To address the above issues, this work proposes a new information utilization method. Its core idea is to randomly extract a certain amount of decision variable information from the current optimal solutions to construct an information vector, which is, in turn, used to assist the generation of elite solutions. The proposed method can assist any available intelligent optimizers to improve their performance in solving MMOPs. This is confirmed by experimental results obtained from solving 22 such problems from CEC2019 and 12 scalable imbalanced distance minimization problems through a number of optimizers. Finally, we apply the proposed method to credit card fraud detection problems to show its practical significance.},

With data adversarially generated from the artificial systems and collected from sensors all over the area, an optimization model is proposed to find the optimal evacuation plans for emergent evacuation scenarios in the computational experiments. Eventually, the most suitable running strategy of autonomous buses will be selected and carried out based on the parallel execution in accordance with the real scene.

  abstract     = {The way politicians communicate with the electorate and run electoral campaigns was reshaped by the emergence and popularization of contemporary social media (SM), such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram social networks (SNs). Due to the inherent capabilities of SM, such as the large amount of available data accessed in real time, a new research subject has emerged, focusing on using the SM data to predict election outcomes. Despite many studies conducted in the last decade, results are very controversial and many times challenged. In this context, this article aims to investigate and summarize how research on predicting elections based on the SM data has evolved since its beginning, to outline the state of both the art and the practice, and to identify research opportunities within this field. In terms of method, we performed a systematic literature review analyzing the quantity and quality of publications, the electoral context of studies, the main approaches to and characteristics of the successful studies, as well as their main strengths and challenges and compared our results with previous reviews. We identified and analyzed 83 relevant studies, and the challenges were identified in many areas such as process, sampling, modeling, performance evaluation, and scientific rigor. Main findings include the low success of the most-used approach, namely volume and sentiment analysis on Twitter, and the better results with new approaches, such as regression methods trained with traditional polls. Finally, a vision of future research on integrating advances in process definitions, modeling, and evaluation is also discussed, pointing out, among others, the need for better investigating the application of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.},

  abstract     = {As more people flock to social media to connect with others and form virtual communities, it is important to research how members of these groups interact to understand human behavior on the Web. In response to an increase in hate speech, harassment, and other antisocial behaviors, many social media companies have implemented different content and user moderation policies. On Reddit, for example, communities, i.e., subreddits, are occasionally banned for violating these policies. We study the effect of these regulatory actions as well as when a community experiences a significant external event such as a political election or a market crash. Overall, we find that most subreddit bans prompt a small, but statistically significant, number of active users to leave the platform; the effect of external events varies with the type of event. We conclude with a discussion on the effectiveness of the bans and wider implications for online content moderation.},

  abstract     = {Community affiliation of a node plays an important role in determining its contextual position in the network, which may raise privacy concerns when a sensitive node wants to hide its identity in a network. Oftentimes, a target community seeks to protect itself from adversaries so that its constituent members remain hidden inside the network. The current study focuses on hiding such sensitive communities so that the community affiliation of the targeted nodes can be concealed. This leads to the problem of community deception , which investigates the avenues of minimally rewiring nodes in a network so that a given target community maximally hides from a community detection algorithm (CDA). We formalize the problem of community deception and introduce Ne twork deception u sing pe r m a nence l oss ( NEURAL ), a novel method that greedily optimizes a node-centric objective function to determine the rewiring strategy. Theoretical settings pose a restriction on the number of strategies that can be employed to optimize the objective function, which in turn reduces the overhead of choosing the best strategy from multiple options. We also show that our objective function is submodular and monotone . When tested on both synthetic and seven real-world networks, NEURAL is able to deceive six widely used CDAs. We benchmark its performance with respect to four state-of-the-art methods on four evaluation metrics. In addition, our qualitative analysis on three other attributed real-world networks reveals that NEURAL, quite strikingly, captures important metainformation about edges that otherwise could not be inferred by observing only their topological structures.},

This article systematizes the discovery of framing changes through a fully unsupervised computational method that seeks to isolate framing change trends over several years. We demonstrate our approach by isolating framing change periods that correlate with previously known framing changes. We have prepared a new data set, consisting of over 12 000 articles from seven news topics or domains , in which earlier surveys have found framing changes. Finally, our work highlights the predictive utility of framing change detection, by identifying two domains in which framing changes foreshadowed substantial legislative activity, or preceded judicial interest.},

  abstract     = {Profit maximization (PM) is to select a subset of users as seeds for viral marketing in online social networks, which balances between the cost and the profit from influence spread. We extend PM to formulate a continuous PM under the general marketing strategies (CPM-MS) problem, whose domain is on integer lattices. The objective function of our CPM-MS is dr-submodular, but nonmonotone. It is a typical case of unconstrained dr-submodular maximization (UDSM) problem, and taking it as a starting point, we study UDSM systematically in this article, which is very different from those studied by existing researchers. First, we introduce the lattice-based double greedy algorithm, which can obtain a constant approximation guarantee. However, there is a strict and unrealistic condition that requiring the objective value is nonnegative on the whole domain or else no theoretical bounds. Thus, we propose a lattice-based iterative pruning technique. It can shrink the search space effectively, thereby greatly increasing the possibility of satisfying the nonnegative objective function on this smaller domain without losing approximation ratio. Then, to overcome the difficulty to estimate the objective value of CPM-MS, we adopt reverse sampling strategies and combine it with lattice-based double greedy, including pruning, without losing its performance but reducing its running time. The entire process can be considered as a general framework to solve the UDSM problem, especially for applying to social networks. Finally, we conduct experiments on several real data sets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

We employ deep-learning-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract characters and their relationships. The adopted NLP approach can extract 93% and 91% characters that appeared in the two books, respectively. Then, we characterize the social networks and sentiments of the main characters in the historical text and the historical novel. We find that the social network in Romance is more complex and dynamic than that of Records, and the influence of the main characters differs. These findings shed light on the different styles of storytelling in the two literary genres and how the historical novel complicates the social networks of characters to enrich the literariness of the story.},

Physical signal-driven intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) typically lack the ability to capture social behaviors or crowd willingness, and they achieve only information automation for transportation decision support. The crowdsourcing social signals consist of timely, extensive, comprehensive, and rich intelligence that concern urban dynamics, social behaviors, and traffic environments. Such social signals provide a new paradigm for operating ITS with unstructured semantic data, making knowledge automation for decision intelligence a possibility. This article reviews the knowledge automation paradigms for cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) compared with traditional information automation paradigms for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in ITS, from the perspective of data-driven, modeling space, analytical methodologies, and decision support services. To investigate the key methodology in social spaces that enhance information automation into knowledge automation, we summarize the current research into a multisource heterogeneous social signal-based traffic decision knowledge automation framework and further exploit the computational paradigm and applications scenarios of this framework. Finally, we discuss future challenges for designing and realizing knowledge automation on CPSS in transportation.},

Besides all advantages of social networks, the dissemination of rumors becomes a major concern for users, so it is important to find a way to limit the spread of misinformation as much as possible. Influence blocking maximization (IBM) is the problem of finding k nodes in a social graph to minimize the spread of rumor source at the end of a propagation process. In this article, we propose a two-step method called influence blocking maximization using martingale (IBMM) to solve IBM problem under competitive independent cascade model (ICM) with both (1-1/e-ε)-approximation guarantee and practical runtime efficiency. In the proposed method, first we calculate the number of required samples using a set of estimation techniques based on martingale; and then we generate the samples and find top- k savior nodes. We perform extensive experiments on three real-world data sets and three rumor sets with different behaviors. We both experimentally and theoretically show that the effectiveness of IBMM is close to greedy. The results also show that IBMM is very fast, in particular, for a network with 265 214 nodes, 420 045 edges, and a set of 50 high influential nodes as rumor, when k = 50, l=1, and ε = 0.5 IBMM returns the solution within 3.5 s.},

Community detection helps scholars to understand this network topology and find out meaningful communities. Many scholars are therefore actively exploring new community detection algorithms. However, it brings privacy issues such as the disclosure of personal or group information of community members and goes against an individual or group desire to be hidden. Hence, how to hide a target community in a network to resist the community detection algorithms becomes critical. Given this, this article studies the community hiding problem, which has not been extensively focused so far and aims to properly hide a target community into other communities by perturbing a budget limited number of social links. First, we formalize the community hiding problem and design a gain function. Second, we prove the feasibility of link perturbation operations and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the community hiding problem. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on varieties of real small- and large-scale social networks and compare our method with other community deception algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than previously proposed algorithms.},

Without interfering with their private portfolio optimization techniques, we design a recruitment framework that matches financial advisors to investors based on their profiles and features, as well as the previous activities of their peers. Using the database of the crowdsourcing platform, we employ an unsupervised technique to regroup advisors with a high degree of similarities into clusters and, hence, shrink the search space. Afterward, we train a machine learning regression model to predict the matching score that can be achieved if an investor hires a particular advisor. These scores are converted to weights of bipartite graphs to which we apply a double-phased many-to-many maximum weight matching algorithm to determine a suitable investor-advisor combination. In the simulations, we investigate the performance of the proposed recruitment approach and show that, compared with other traditional approaches, higher returns can be reached for both investors and financial advisors.},

The last-mile assignment problem (LMAP) for fresh produce poses a challenge on traditional logistics since fresh produce is difficult to preserve. This article formalizes the LMAP for fresh produce via the group role assignment framework and proposes a role awareness method by using adaptive clustering in spatiotemporal crowdsourcing based on task granularity. The formalization of LMAP makes it easy to find a solution using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package (CPLEX). The proposed method allows one to take the time and space factor into consideration, helps spatiotemporal crowdsourcing assign couriers for efficient delivering daily orders, and improves the quality of service in last-mile logistics. It is verified by simulation experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability of the proposed solutions in this article.},

  abstract     = {In online deliberation, participants argue in support or opposition to one another&#39;s arguments and ideas to advocate their position. Often their stance expressed in their posts is implicit and must be derived from the post&#39;s text. Existing stance detection models predict the polarity of the user&#39;s stance from the text, but do not consider the stance&#39;s intensity. We introduce a new research problem, stance polarity, and intensity prediction in response relationships between posts. This problem seeks to predict both the stance polarity and intensity of a replying post toward its parent post in online deliberation. Using our cyber argumentation platform, we have collected an empirical data set with explicitly labeled stance polarity and intensity relationships. In this work, we create six models: five are adapted from top-performing stance detection models and another novel model that fine-tunes the deep bidirectional transformer model BERT. We train and test these six models on our empirical data set to compare their performance for stance polarity and intensity prediction and stance detection. Our results demonstrate that our method of encoding the stance polarity and intensity labels allows the models to predict stance polarity and intensity without compromising their accuracy for stance detection, making these models more versatile. Our results reveal that a novel split architecture for fine-tuning the BERT model outperforms the other models for stance polarity and intensity prediction by 5% accuracy. This work is the first to train models for predicting both the stance polarity and intensity in one combined task while maintaining good accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection relies on individuals&#39; behavior profiling and works by detecting any deviation from the norm. When used for online banking fraud detection, however, it mainly suffers from three disadvantages. First, for an individual, the historical behavior data are often too limited to profile his/her behavior pattern. Second, due to the heterogeneous nature of transaction data, there lacks a uniform treatment of different kinds of attribute values, which becomes a potential barrier for model development and further usage. Third, the transaction data are highly skewed, and it becomes a challenge to utilize the label information effectively. The three disadvantages result in both poor generalization and high false positive rate of anomaly detection, and we propose a ranking metric embedding based multi-contextual behavior profiling (ReMEMBeR) model to battle them effectively. We solve the original fraud detection problem as a pseudo-recommender system problem, where an individual is treated as a pseudo-user, his/her behavior as a pseudo-item, and the label as the corresponding pseudo-rating. With the idea of collaborative filtering, for an individual, information from other similar individuals can be used to establish his/her behavior profile. In order to obtain a uniform treatment of heterogeneous attributes, we turn to an embedding based method to learn both attribute embedding and individuals&#39; behavior profiles within a common latent space simultaneously. To utilize the label information better, our model is designed to fit pseudo-users&#39; correct preference ranking for pseudo-items. By doing so, it explicitly learns to tell the fraudulent from the legitimate. Last but not least, we propose to identify and distinguish individuals under different contexts and further generalize the behavior profiling model to be a multi-contextual one. The proposed model can, thus, integrate the multi-contextual behavior patterns and allow transactions to be examined under the different contexts. Extensive experiments on a real-world online banking transaction dataset demonstrate that our model not only outperforms benchmarks on all metrics but also can be combined with them to achieve even better performance.},

However, security and privacy are just like the two sides of one coin, hard to see both at the same time, especially by the current mainstream credential- and biometric-based approaches. To this end, we propose WiONE, a safe and privacy-preserving user authentication system leveraging the ubiquitous Wi-Fi infrastructure by exploring “how you behave” rather than “who you are”. The key idea is to apply deep learning to user physical behavior captured by Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) to identify legitimate users while rejecting spoofers. The design of WiONE faces two challenges, namely, how to capture the subtle behavior, such as a keystroke on CSI, and how to mitigate the heavy environment-specific training required by deep learning. For the former, we design a behavior enhancement model based on the Rician fading to highlight the behavior-induced information by suppressing the behavior-unrelated information on channel response. For the latter, we develop a behavior characterization method tailored for the prototypical networks to facilitate the extraction of the domain-independent behavioral features and enable one-shot recognition of a new user in a new environment. Numerous experiments are conducted in several real-world environments, and the results show that WiONE outperforms its state-of-the-art rivals in authentication performance with much less training effort.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a graph neural network (GNN) was proposed to analyze various graphs/networks, which has been proven to outperform many other network analysis methods. However, it is also shown that such state-of-the-art methods suffer from adversarial attacks, i.e., carefully crafted adversarial networks with slight perturbation on clean one may invalid these methods on lots of applications, such as network embedding, node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Adversarial training has been testified as an efficient defense strategy against adversarial attacks in computer vision and graph mining. However, almost all the algorithms based on adversarial training focus on global defense through overall adversarial training. In a more practical scene, certain users would be targeted to attack, i.e., specific labeled users. It is still a challenge to defend against target node attack by existing adversarial training methods. Therefore, we propose smoothing adversarial training (SAT) to improve the robustness of GNNs. In particular, we analytically investigate the robustness of graph convolutional network (GCN), one of the classic GNNs, and propose two smooth defensive strategies: smoothing distillation and smoothing cross-entropy loss function. Both of them smooth the gradients of GCN and, consequently, reduce the amplitude of adversarial gradients, benefiting gradient masking from attackers in both global attack and target label node attack. The comprehensive experiments on five real-world networks testify that the proposed SAT method shows state-of-the-art defensibility against different adversarial attacks on node classification and community detection. Especially, the average attack success rate of different attack methods can be decreased by about 40% by SAT at the cost of tolerable embedding performance decline of the original network.},

Because of the speed and relative anonymity offered by social platforms such as Twitter and Telegram, social media has become a preferred platform for scammers who wish to spread false hype about the cryptocurrency they are trying to pump. In this work, we propose and evaluate a computational approach that can automatically identify pump and dump scams as they unfold by combining information across social media platforms. We also develop a multi-modal approach for predicting whether a particular pump attempt will succeed or not.

In this work, the concept of the FractalNet model has been exploited for steganalytic detection, where the embedded image has been used as input. In a practical scenario, it has been observed that steganalytic detection for test images is increasing if the width of the network can be increased with a certain proportion to the depth. The proposed deep network is designed by repeating a basic fractal block in such a way that a balance between the depth and width of the overall network can be maintained. A comprehensive set of experiments reveals that the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art results.

However, traditional recommendation techniques mainly focus on recommendation accuracy and suffer from a cold-start problem (i.e., new items cannot be recommended). Differing from them, this work designs a multiobjective RS by considering item profit and novelty besides accuracy. Then, a hybrid probabilistic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is proposed to optimize these conflicting metrics. In it, some specifically designed genetic operators are proposed, and two classical MOEA frameworks are adaptively combined such that it owns their complementary advantages.

Because bad air quality brings prominent effects on our daily life, how to forecast future air quality accurately and tenuously has emerged as a priority for guaranteeing the quality of human life in many urban areas worldwide. Existing models usually neglect the influence of wind and do not consider both distance and similarity to select the most related stations, which can provide significant information in prediction. Therefore, we propose a Geographic Self-Organizing Map (GeoSOM) spatiotemporal gated recurrent unit (GRU) model, which clusters all the monitor stations into several clusters by geographical coordinates and time-series features. For each cluster, we build a GRU model and weighted different models with the Gaussian vector weights to predict the target sequence.

  abstract     = {When it comes to pandemics, such as the one caused by the Coronavirus disease COVID-19, various issues and problems have arisen for the healthcare infrastructure and institutions. With increasing number of patients in need of urgent medical care and hospitalizations, the healthcare systems and regional hospitals may approach their maximum service capacity and may face shortage of various parameters, such as supplies including PPE, medications, therapeutic devices, ventilators, beds, and many more. The article at hand describes the development and framework of a simulation model that enables the modeling and evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic progress. To achieve this, the model dynamically mimics and simulates the developments and time-dependent behavior of various crucial parameters of the pandemic, among others, the daily infection numbers and death rate. In addition, the model enables the simulation of single events and scenarios that occur outside of the regular pandemic developments as anomalies, such as holidays. Unlike traditional models, the proposed framework is based on factors and parameters closely derived from reality, such as the contact rate of individuals, which allows for a much more realistic representation. In addition, the real connection enables the assessment of effects of various influences regarding the development and progress of the pandemic, such as hospitalization numbers over time. All the aforementioned points are possible within the simulation framework and do not require awaiting the unfolding of the effects in reality. Thus, the model is capable of dynamically predicting how different scenarios turn out. The abilities of the model are demonstrated, illustrated, and proven in a specific case study that shows the impact of holidays, such as Passover and Easter in New York City when quarantine measures might have been ignored, and an increase in extended family gatherings temporarily occurred. As a result, the simulation showed significant impacts and disproportionate number of patients in need of medical care that could be potentially detrimental in reality. For example, compared to the previous trajectory of the pandemic, for a temporary increase of 50% in the contact rate of individuals, the model showed that the total number of cases would increase by 461 090, the maximum number of required hospitalizations would rise to 79 733, and the total number of fatalities would climb by 19 125 over 90 days. In addition to its function and proven capabilities, the model can and is furthermore planned to be adapted to other areas, not necessarily only metropolitan regions in order to expand the utilization of its predictive power. Such predictions could be used to derive regulatory measures and to test various policies for COVID-19 containment.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) is a futuristic concept, utilized as a tool for modeling real-world applications. Today, healthcare worldwide has drawn the attention of ML, with its ability to analyze huge data sets and convert information into clinical insights that aid physicians in disease diagnosis and treatment planning, leading to low cost, better outcomes, and greater patient satisfaction. One of such medical applications calling for ML interventions is human infertility; an issue addressed by a set of medical procedures termed assisted reproductive technology (ART). The ART success rate, however, is very low because it is affected by a number of variables. ML techniques are now applied to predict ART outcomes to find strategies for an improved success rate. The literature reviewed on the subject shows that most of the available ART models are static. If ML is to have a role in healthcare, it must take an incremental, rather than static, approach. Therefore, this research proposes a dynamic model for ART outcome prediction. The model is built by an ensemble of two incremental classifiers, namely, the instance-based (IB1) learner and averaged one-dependence estimators (A1DEs) updatable learner through voting. The performance of the proposed model is checked with other ensemble models and ART data sets to find that the former shows promise in ART outcome prediction.},

  abstract     = {This article attempts to provide viral marketeers guidance in terms of an investment level that could help capture some desired γ percentage of the market share by some target time t with the desired level of confidence. To do this, we first introduce a generalized diffusion model for social networks. A distance-dependent random graph is then considered as a model for the underlying social network, which we use to analyze the proposed diffusion model. Using the fact that vertices degrees have an almost Poisson distribution in distance-dependent random networks, we then provide a lower bound on the probability of the event that the time it takes for an idea (or a product, campaign, disease, and so on) to dominate a prespecified γ percentage of a social network (denoted by R γ ) is smaller than some preselected target time t &gt; 0, i.e., we find a lower bound on the probability of the event {R γ ≤ t}. Simulation results performed over a wide variety of networks, including random and real world, are then provided to verify that our bound indeed holds in practice. The Kullback-Leibler divergence measure is used to evaluate the performance of our lower bound over these groups of networks, and as expected, we note that for networks that deviate more from the Poisson degree distribution, our lower bound weakens. In the case where absolute/full domination of the market-share is desired, under the linear threshold diffusion model, a particular case of our generalized diffusion model, an upper bound on the size of the seed set is derived, and a selection algorithm is developed to show its tightness. This is also extended to the partial market-share situation.},

The mechanism designed to promote cooperation could suffer from malicious users, while the trust management that only considers the trust dilemma is subjected to denial-of-service attacks. To address these two dilemmas simultaneously, we present a dependable cloud file-sharing scheme-EigenCloud. The main contributions include the following. First, we propose a modified EigenTrust algorithm to calculate the global cooperation value and global trust value of each cloud user based on her/his past behaviors. Second, we propose cooperation and trust-aware worker recommendation mechanism by determining a Pareto front from all cloud users. Thus, a cloud user who adopts the recommendation mechanism by paying an additional fee could have a higher probability of receiving a valid file in one transaction. Last but not least, we use the evolutionary game theory (EGT) to study the acceptance and effectiveness of the proposed EigenCloud by strategically modeling cloud users. The Lyapunov stability theory is employed to mathematically investigate the stability of evolutionary equilibriums of our EigenCloud. Finally, both numerical simulations and simulator-driving experiments illustrate that our EigenCloud has an outstanding performance in promoting cooperation and inhibiting malicious activity.},

Bitcoin-NG is a Byzantine fault-tolerant blockchain protocol robust to extreme churn and shares the same trust model as Bitcoin. Researchers are trying to extend their applications by integrating them with existing technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to high computational power and high consensus delay, current blockchain protocols, such as Bitcoin, are not suitable for working with lightweight IoT devices. Moreover, they are not energy-efficient as the mining of blocks requires dedicated mining machines that consume electricity. However, protocols, such as Bitcoin-NG, are designed to reduce the consensus delay, but they still need high computational power and high energy. This article proposes a new mechanism for blockchain to reduce the consensus delay, reduce energy consumption, and increase the throughput by introducing a new leader election scheme in the blockchain.},

For hosting services, the edge computing (EC) platform for its low-latency resource provisioning is fully explored. However, the mapping between edge servers (ESs) and services affects the service latency. Meanwhile, the real-time dynamic distribution of resource requirements also impairs the load balance. Therefore, how to optimize the load balance of ESs while meeting the latency-critical requests remains challenging. To deal with the above challenge, in this article, we propose a resource pre-allocation (RPA) method for the social media services with cognitive analytics. Technically, the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) is employed to complete the cognitive analytics of resource requests. Then based on the analysis results, the optimal resource allocation (ORA) scheme is designed with multiobjective optimization. Finally, the performance of RPA is evaluated by a real-world resource request data set.},

  abstract     = {Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has been an important task for location-based intelligent services. However, the application of such promising technique is still limited due to the following three challenges: 1) the difficulty of capturing complicated spatiotemporal patterns of user movements; 2) the hardness of modeling fine-grained long-term preferences of users; and 3) the effective learning of interaction between long- and short-term preferences. Motivated by this, we propose a memory augmented hierarchical attention network (MAHAN), which considers both short-term check-in sequences and long-term memories. To capture the complicated interest tendencies of users within a short-term period, we design a spatiotemporal self-attention network (ST-SAN). For long-term preferences modeling, we employ a memory network to maintain fine-grained preferences of users and dynamically operate them based on users&#39; constantly updated check-ins. Moreover, we first employ a coattention network/mechanism to integrate the proposed ST-SAN and memory network, which can fully learn the dynamic interaction between long- and short-term preferences. Our extensive experiments on two publicly available data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MAHAN.},

In such problems, we must hedge against the risk of misapprehension of attacker objectives and resources, which is further complicated in the absence of adversarial training data. We show how to model dynamic agent interaction, on the basis of partially observed or noise-corrupted data, using a partially observable Markov game (POMG) framework. We then propose a threefold heuristic solution procedure that: 1) uses the POMG to generate potential adversarial policies; 2) explicitly incorporates these adversarial policies in the construction of a robust defender policy by solving a robust dynamic program (DP); and 3) employs a probability matching heuristic in partially observable environments.},

  abstract     = {Role-playing games (RPGs) are one of the most exciting and most rapidly expanding genres of online games. Virtual characters that are not controlled by players, have become an integral part, which helps to advance narratives of RPGs. Believable characters can enhance game engagement and further improve player retention. However, game players easily find that most characters&#39; behaviors are limited and improbable, resulting in a less meaningful game experience. In this work, we propose a framework to model game behaviors to learn behavior patterns of human players. Based on the learned behavior patterns, it generates human-like action sequences that can be used for the design of believable virtual characters in RPGs, so as to enhance game engagement. Specifically, considering the influence of game context in behavior patterns, we integrate game context (players&#39; levels and game classes) with actions together to model behaviors. We propose a long-term memory cell on actions and game context to learn the hidden representations. We also introduce an attention mechanism to measure the contribution of the actions previously performed to the next action. Given only one action, our model can generate action sequences by predicting the succeeding action based on the previously generated actions. The model was evaluated on a real-world data set of over 22 000 players and more than 51 million action logs of an RPG game in 21 days. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain can provide a dependable environment for the Internet of Things (IoT), while the high computing power and energy required by blockchain hinder its applications in IoT. Offloading the computation at the resource-limited IoT devices to a cloud/edge computing service provider (CESP) is a feasible solution to the execution of computation-intensive blockchain tasks. The CESP provides computing resources to IoT users with a cloud and multiple edge servers that work collaboratively such that the users are able to perform mobile blockchain services. Resource allocation and pricing of computing resources at the cloud/edges have a significant impact on the revenues of CESP and users. Most of the existing works on the cooperative edge-cloud for computation offloading assumes that a user is mapped to a prespecified edge server or the cloud. However, the CESP may choose a server from either the edge servers or the cloud to run the offloaded tasks by jointly considering the cost and income of the service provisioning. In this article, we formulate a Stackelberg game with CESP as the leader and users as the followers for cloud/edge computing resource management. We prove the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium and analyze the equilibrium. We then model the resource allocation and pricing at the CESP as a mixed-integer programming problem (MIP) with the objective to optimize the CESP&#39;s revenue and propose an efficient iterative greedy-and-search-based resource allocation and pricing algorithm (IGS). The algorithm solves two subproblems comprising the CESP&#39;s revenue optimization problem: resource allocation under a given resource price and resource pricing based on a specified resource allocation scheme. The first subproblem evaluates where to execute the computing tasks via a greedy-and-search-based approach, whereas the second subproblem estimates the resource price through golden section search. We conduct experiments through simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the revenue of both the CESP and the IoT terminals.},

Results of the experiment show that the random forests model with network embedding (RFNE) is effective in identifying excellent employees.

Also worth noting is that there is a fundamental gap between impracticable business requirements and the available value of data reflected. The data holder or data service provider may not have a clear understanding of data interference. The solution to these two problems depends on the capability of predicting the data utility in advance, which raises a fundamental question: to what degree is the data utility predictable? In this work, we present a primary analytical framework for information-theoretic bounds of data utility and utilize the current state-of-the-art and representative algorithms to obtain the achievable lower bounds on a real-world data set.

In these situations, organizations typically collect more personal information than necessary to provide a better service. The consequence is a personal data leakage that violates the data minimization principle stated by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. This article proposes a new approach for allowing individuals to maintain control over the disclosure of their data, deciding which information to disclose and for how long. Our approach is based on the use of social networks, and implementation on Facebook is presented to show that the proposed solution is effective, cheap, friendly, and simple to adopt.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider the joint behavior of an information diffusion process integrated with a recommender system (RecSys) over an online social network (OSN), where the typical users&#39; resilience to information varies, leading to potential information overloads. We assume that each user has a threshold over the information that she can process in a meaningful way, and exceeding it could lead to user dissatisfaction or the user remaining idle. In order to efficiently tackle this issue, while considering complex user constraints, we consider two types of users&#39; capacity to information, that is, capacity for distinct items and capacity for duplicate items. In this setting, we aim to allocate the items in the OSN in order to maximize users&#39; total relevance to the former while ensuring that no user exceeds any type of capacity. We show that this problem is NP-complete and present various heuristic methods to address it. A novel framework, called socially constrained recommendations (SCoRe), is developed for the final assignment of items to users, consisting of a two-step procedure. We present and evaluate two different approaches for each step and discuss the usability of SCoRe for the efficient diffusion of items in the network while respecting the users&#39; constraints.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks (OSNs) have changed the way of how people interact; however, lately, people are questioning more and more their business models. During the last ten years, new solutions based on decentralized architectures have been proposed, namely, decentralized OSNs (DOSNs) and blockchain online social medias (BOSMs). DOSNs were introduced several years ago and their main goal is the preservation of the privacy of the users in such a way that the data and the content of a user are always under their control. BOSMs leverage the usage of blockchain either to enforce the privacy of the users or to redistribute the wealth generated by the platform through a rewarding system. Steemit is the most stable and well-known BOSM with more than 1 million registered users, where users can create their own social network by following other users. To the best of our knowledge, no study exists on the relationship between the economic and social characteristics of BOSMs and on the way the rewarding system affects the social activity. The main goal of this article is to evaluate the characteristics of the Steemit follower-following graph to understand how the social and the economic aspects of BOSMs intertwine and influence each other. We study the properties of the Steemit follower-following graph and a few selected hotspot contents. The analysis shows that users are highly encouraged to be socially active, especially producing content, but the richest users are not also the most social ones, which suggests us that users can get rich without much involvement in the platform, using external mechanisms.},

In this article, the implicit link is regarded as one of the driving factors of users to participate in information dissemination, and then the network topology with the implicit link is established. First, we excavate implicit relationships among users to strengthen friends’ influence in driving information dissemination and then establish a more accurate network topology. Second, we extract the individual and friend driving mechanisms based on the accurate network topology, analyze the causes of two information dynamics, and measure social influence based on a multiple linear regression model. Finally, considering the timeliness and uncertainty of information dissemination in an infectious disease model, we introduce the mean-field theory and obtain an information dissemination model based on social influence. The experimental results show that the implicit link plays an important role in driving user behavior, and the model can well explain the process of information transmission and explore the dynamic factors of information dissemination.},

We exploit bullying tendencies by proposing a robust method for constructing a cyberbullying signed network (SN). We analyze tweets to determine their relation to cyberbullying while considering the context in which the tweets exist in order to optimize their bullying score. We also propose a centrality measure to detect cyberbullies from a cyberbullying SN and show that it outperforms other existing measures. We experiment on a data set of 5.6 million tweets, and our results show that the proposed approach can detect cyberbullies with high accuracy while being scalable with respect to the number of tweets.},

  abstract     = {WeChat has earned more than one billion users worldwide. Research on the geolocation of WeChat users can not only discover the location of malicious users but also verify the validity of user privacy protection strategies. However, existing methods are susceptible to WeChat&#39;s location confusion strategies, resulting in intolerable geolocating errors. In this article, a WeChat user geolocation method based on user missequence state analysis (MSAG) is proposed. Different from the existing methods which usually rely on the relationship between reported and actual distances of nearby users, MSAG utilizes the relation between user order and actual distances to geolocate the target. By statistical analysis of sequence changes of nearby users under different actual distances, the distance range that causes nearby users missequence is determined. During geolocation, the distance range of the target is delimited by checking the missequence state of the target and a user with a known location. Finally, we discuss trilateration strategies for different abnormal situations. Experimental results show that MASG can achieve high-precision geolocation of WeChat users, the average error is less than 50 m, and 72% of geolocating errors are within 60 m; compared with existing typical algorithms, the average error is reduced by 23.7%-50.7%.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of social media has facilitated new ways of communication and social engagement. Political elites and public figures use social media to inform and mobilize users. Discussions appearing around these tweets reflect valuable information from the communities, their interests, and concerns. The majority of the studies on conversational dynamics on social media use the network between users to track the flow of information and impact. In this study, a different approach is introduced in which discussion threads as the network between tweets are considered as the main components of the analysis. Based on this approach, a novel framework is proposed to provide a high-level overview of a Twitter stream. The metric energy is introduced to quantify user engagement in discussions initiated by each tweet and to study the patterns of user-participation overtime. To mine the content of the tweets, some recently developed text analysis methods are integrated into our model to extract the topic of the tweets, the sentiment of the tweets, the stance of tweets toward a controversial topic, and the coherency between the tweet-reply pairs. Three different data sets from politics, healthcare, and sport are collected to be used as case studies. The proposed framework provides a better understanding of how opinions form around a tweet, how different topics to bond together and make the whole discussions, for which topics discussions are more coherent, and which users are able to initiate a cross cutting and coherent conversation over social media.},

In this article, we conducted large-scale empirical studies on social perception and social influence regarding the Trump phenomenon from personal perception, media, and public attention perspectives. We found that there exist obvious correlations between the posting behavior of Trump and the attention of news media. By constructing public attention networks using complex networks based on Google search information, we further reveal that digital platforms could affect social perception and social influence significantly.

In many circles globally, the majority of users choose Twitter when choosing a social media outlet for reliable scientific information and news. However, the Twitter application programming interface (API) limitations do not allow for low-cost data science options for academia. It becomes very expensive for academic researchers to gain the full potential of data analytics available from Twitter using a free API account. In this article, we present our big data analytics platform developed at our DaTALab at Lakehead University, Canada, that allows users to focus on their Twitter search criteria and gain access to large amounts of Twitter data at the touch of a button. The platform supports the collection of social media data and applies many filters for cleaning and further use for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems. Our focus has been primarily on healthcare-related research, which shows the strength of the presented platform. However, the platform itself is malleable to any topic of interest. Data collected and processed are suitable for further AI/ML analysis. We present our platform using a specific healthcare search topic to emphasize the power of our system for future research endeavors in the healthcare field.},

  abstract     = {Although crowdsourcing has emerged as a paradigm for leveraging human intelligence and activity to solve a wide range of tasks, strategic workers will find enticement in their self-interest to free-ride and attack in a crowdsourcing contest dilemma game. Existing incentive mechanisms are not effective to avoid socially undesirable equilibrium due to the following features of competitive crowdsourcing: in the presence of imperfect monitoring, heterogeneous workers with competing interest tend to beat their opponents for larger self-profit, and the fact that they can freely and frequently change their opponents makes the situation much more complicated. Taking these features into consideration, this article proposes a mechanism design problem to enforce cooperation and extort selfish works simultaneously, with the objective of maximizing the requester’s utility. To solve the problem, we integrate binary ratings with differential pricing to develop a novel rating protocol. By establishing a mathematical model for the problem and quantifying necessary and sufficient conditions for a sustainable social norm, we provide design guidelines for optimal rating protocols and design a low-complexity algorithm to select optimal design parameters. Finally, extensive evaluation results demonstrate the performance of our proposed rating protocol and reveal how intrinsic parameters impact on design parameters.},

  abstract     = {In the recent past, deep learning has received remarkable acceptance in real-world applications. Social computing expands the existing notion of cyber space and physical space to a more advance cyber-physical-social system (CPSS). Therefore, deep learning provides a propitious technique for accurate mining of information from CPSS, thus facilitates CPSS to offer services of exceptional quality efficiently. However, most of the current deep learning methods are struggling to keep up with the ever-increasing heterogeneous and highly nonlinear dissemination of data. Furthermore, the advancement of deep learning presents privacy concerns. This article proposes a deep private tensor autoencoder (dPTAE), where tensors are used for data representation, and differential privacy guarantees strong privacy. The core idea of our work is to enforce differential privacy through noise injection into the objective functions instead of the results they produce. In addition, the proposed method preserves the privacy of information shared amongst CPSS in smart environments. We applied dPTAE on three representative data sets. Rigorous experimental evaluations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that dPTAE is significantly effective and efficient.},

  abstract     = {With the ever-increasing maturity and popularization of the Internet of Things (IoT), tremendous business applications developed by distinct enterprises or organizations have been encapsulated into lightweight web services that can easily be accessed or invoked remotely. However, the big volume of candidate web services places a heavy burden on the users&#39; service selection decision-making process. Under the circumstance, a variety of intelligent recommendation solutions have been developed to reduce the high decision-making cost. Traditional resolutions usually challenge in two aspects. First, the recommendation parameters, i.e., the quality of services (QoS), usually relies on user/service location heavily; therefore, low-quality recommended results may be returned to users if user/service location information is overlooked. Second, historical QoS data often contain partial sensitive information of users; therefore, it becomes a necessity to protect the sensitive QoS data while making accurate recommendation decisions. To tackle the above challenges, we introduce the concepts of user/service location information and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in the domain and propose a location-aware recommendation approach with privacy-preservation capability. A wide range of experiments is set up based on the popular WS-DREAM data set, whose results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

Online public opinions may affect the stability or security of the country because of the speed and convenience of information disseminating on the Internet. This article proposes the public opinion cellular automata for situation deduction to predict the possible trending of public events. In the cellular automata, online users are represented by cells, and their eigenvalues are calculated from the user&#39;s historical comment data. The cell and their neighbors form a cellular space, whose topology is a directed graph. We set the state of each cell based on its attributes and initialize the cellular automata. The automata can deduce public opinion and predict the trend of public opinion by following the set evolutionary rules in advance. Experiments with the real data from Sina Weibo online users show that the cells in the cellular automata can accurately simulate users&#39; behavior, and the deduction results are close to the trend of real historical events. The cellular automata-based prediction of the number of participants and emotional trending are more accurate than other methods.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread use of online social networks, billions of pieces of information are generated every day. How to detect new topics quickly and accurately at such data scale plays a vital role in information recommendation and public opinion control. One of the basic research tasks of topic detection is how to represent a topic. The existing topic representation models do not focus on how to select better differentiated words to represent topics, are still computer-centered, and do not effectively combine human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI). To solve these problems, this article proposes a word-distributed sensitive topic representation model (WDS-LDA) based on hybrid human-AI (H-AI). The basic idea is that the distribution of words within a topic or among different topics has a great influence on the selection of topic expression words. If a word is evenly distributed among all documents of a certain topic, it indicates that the word is the common word of all documents in the topic, and it is more suitable to represent this topic. If a word is more evenly distributed among various topics, it indicates that the word is a common word of all topics, and cannot be used for the purpose of distinguishing among topics, becoming less suitable to represent any topic. At the same time, the human cognitive ability and cognitive models are introduced into topic representation based on H-AI. We introduce the user&#39;s modification of topic expression words into the topic model representation so that the topic model can learn human wisdom and become more and more accurate. Therefore, three different weights are introduced: inside weight; outside weight; and manual adjustment weight. The inside weight describes the uniform distribution of a word in the given topic, the outside weight describes the uniform distribution of a word in all topics, and the manual adjustment weight reflects whether a word is suitable as a representative vocabulary in the past manual adjustment. Tests using Sina microblog&#39;s actual data sets show that the WDS-LDA algorithm makes the representative words more important, the distinction among different topic words higher, and effectively improves the precision of subsequent algorithms, such as topic detection and topic evolutionary analysis using the topic model.},

  abstract     = {Depression and anxiety are a couple of pernicious mental states, which may affect lifestyle and quality and even become the primary causes of disability worldwide. Hence, daily monitoring of the mental states is significant for avoiding possible injury. Dynamics of the human blood vascular system convey significant information on recording the emotion and the mental state, which can be monitored via photoplethysmography (PPG). It is one of the best schemes with the advantages of nonintrusiveness and low cost. Conventional approaches for PPG signal analysis usually depend on handcrafted feature extraction and classification, thus resulting in a lack of feature discrimination and difficulties in generalization. In this article, we propose an attentive deep recurrent architecture called Arousal-valence Networks (ArvaNets), which benefits from graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks. Our approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods by automatically extracting the learnable spatial representations from a rigorous custom data set as semantic motifs to infer immediate emotions, which are mapped to a 2-D arousal-valence coordinate system. Finally, we exploit long short-term memory (LSTM) units to output the mental states by incorporating the temporal factor. During the entire inference, we propose a spatiotemporal attention mechanism based on correlation fractal dimensions (CFDs) and time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) to capture and stress the key subtle motifs for performance optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed architecture has enough competitiveness in the tasks of emotion and mental-state recognition for daily monitoring.},

An intelligent router based on deep reinforcement learning framework is designed to generate optimal actions to route across the HHN. An improved random walk with the restart-based algorithm is then developed with the intelligent router, based on the hierarchical influence across network associated with multiple correlations.

Subgraph detection becomes a serious problem when social graphs involve multiple attributes (i.e., multivariate graph). Most existing methods are not capable of handling the feature selection and subgraph detection problems simultaneously on the multivariate graph. In this article, we propose multivariate anomalous subgraph scanning (MASS), a generic model that detects anomalous events on the multivariate social graph. First, we reformulate the traditional nonparametric statistics as a new statistical objective function that simultaneously measures the significance of a vertices subset and an attributes subset to generate an indicator of ongoing or upcoming events. Then, we reformulate the objective function as the difference between two bisubmodular functions and approximate it with a bisubmodular objective function, which can be optimized in linear time, with an analysis of its theoretical properties. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method using two burst event detection and prediction tasks from the real world.},

The organization behavior pattern mining has achieved a series of achievements in the fields of e-commerce and enterprise management. However, the problem of class imbalance and nonconsistent misclassification cost is common in the field of organizational behavior. For this problem, this article compares and analyzes the performance of the organizational behavior prediction model established by four typical cost-sensitive learning methods based on six classifiers, which provides a basis for the appropriate selection of cost-sensitive learning methods in different situations. Among them, the upsampling learning method is a better cost-sensitive learning method. However, there are some shortcomings in the upper sampling method. In order to avoid the possible overfitting problem of the social organization behavior prediction model established by the upper sampling method, this article proposes a new cost-sensitive learning method suitable for the mining of organizational behavior patterns. Based on the cost curve, this article proposes an effective personalized solution to the problem of class disequilibrium and nonconsistent misclassification cost in organizational behavior prediction modeling.},

In this article, we propose an efficient solution for discovering and ranking human behavior patterns based on network motifs by exploring a user’s query in an intelligent way. Our method takes advantage of the semantics provided by a user’s query, which in turn provides the mathematical constraint that is crucial for faster detection. We propose an approach to generate query conditions based on the user’s query. In particular, we use meta paths between the nodes to define target patterns as well as their similarities, leading to efficient motif discovery and ranking at the same time. The proposed method is examined in a real-world academic network using different similarity measures between the nodes. The experiment result demonstrates that our method can identify interesting motifs and is robust to the choice of similarity measures.},

  abstract     = {In the Web 3.0 platforms, enormous amount of information is shared whereby individuals express their thoughts and opinions and learn from others&#39; experiences. Many e-commerce websites provide service of posting opinionated reviews to allow consumers post their opinions using free text. Examples of these e-commerce websites include eBay, Amazon, and Yahoo shopping. Summarizing text is taken as an interesting task of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The proposed work presents a comparative study of different techniques used for opinion summarization. It covers both abstractive and extractive approaches where summary of sentences is achieved by considering aspects. This article highlights the gaps in the previous study by proposing a novel graph-based technique for generating abstractive summary of duplicate sentences. The method discusses the details by constructing graphs, ensuring the sentence correctness using some constraints, and finally scoring the sentences individually by fusing sentiments using SentiWordNet. Extractive approach uses the principle of principal component analysis (PCA). The work includes the application of PCA in summarization of text by reducing the number of dimensions in data (aspects) and relatively finding the summary of the reviews on ranking the most relevant ones, according to the prime aspects without any loss of information respective of a particular domain. The analysis is conducted on the standard Opinosis data set and comparison is made between both of the techniques to discuss which method generates more coherent and complete summary.},

  abstract     = {The adversarial attack methods based on gradient information can adequately find the perturbations, that is, the combinations of rewired links, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the deep learning model-based graph embedding algorithms, but it is also easy to fall into a local optimum. Therefore, this article proposes a momentum gradient attack (MGA) against the graph convolutional network (GCN) model, which can achieve more aggressive attacks with fewer rewiring links. Compared with directly updating the original network using gradient information, integrating the momentum term into the iterative process can stabilize the updating direction, which makes the model jump out of poor local optimum and enhances the method with stronger transferability. Experiments on node classification and community detection methods based on three well-known network embedding algorithms show that MGA has a better attack effect and transferability.},

  abstract     = {A recommendation system is an integral part of any modern online shopping or social network platform. The product recommendation system as a typical example of the legacy recommendation systems suffers from two major drawbacks: recommendation redundancy and unpredictability concerning new items (cold start). These limitations take place because the legacy recommendation systems rely only on the user&#39;s previous buying behavior to recommend new items. Incorporating the user&#39;s social features, such as personality traits and topical interest, might help alleviate the cold start and remove recommendation redundancy. Therefore, in this article, we propose Meta-Interest, a personality-aware product recommendation system based on user interest mining and metapath discovery. Meta-Interest predicts the user&#39;s interest and the items associated with these interests, even if the user&#39;s history does not contain these items or similar ones. This is done by analyzing the user&#39;s topical interests and, eventually, recommending the items associated with the user&#39;s interest. The proposed system is personality-aware from two aspects; it incorporates the user&#39;s personality traits to predict his/her topics of interest and to match the user&#39;s personality facets with the associated items. The proposed system was compared against recent recommendation methods, such as deep-learning-based recommendation system and session-based recommendation systems. Experimental results show that the proposed method can increase the precision and recall of the recommendation system, especially in cold-start settings.},

  abstract     = {Individuals who have very low income and belong to an underprivileged community have a challenging task when managing their financial life, typically due to negative unpredictable events and lack of health and financial services. Cooperation strategies based on savings and credits are becoming a very important option for these communities to address such challenges and to have some level of financial stability. Since designing new cooperation strategies takes a significant amount of time and effort, computational tools have been recently introduced to simulate and evaluate communities that implement these financial cooperation schemes. In this article, based on the theory that underlies these computational tools and theoretical concepts of cooperation, we propose a new cooperation strategy based on donations that are distributed between the members of the community according to the given network topology. Through mathematical and simulation analyses, we show the scenarios where the proposed cooperation strategy, based on altruistic behavior, can potentially improve the resiliency of the community to negative unpredictable events.},

  abstract     = {Community detection, aiming to group nodes based on their connections, plays an important role in network analysis since communities, treated as meta-nodes, allow us to create a large-scale map of a network to simplify its analysis. However, for privacy reasons, we may want to prevent communities from being discovered in certain cases, leading to the topics on community deception. In this article, we formalize this community detection attack problem in three scales, including global attack (macroscale), target community attack (mesoscale), and target node attack (microscale). We treat this as an optimization problem and further propose a novel evolutionary perturbation attack (EPA) method, where we generate adversarial networks to realize the community detection attack. Numerical experiments validate that our EPA can successfully attack network community algorithms in all three scales, i.e., hide target nodes or communities and further disturb the community structure of the whole network by only changing a small fraction of links. By comparison, our EPA behaves better than a number of baseline attack methods on six synthetic networks and three real-world networks. More interestingly, although our EPA is based on the Louvain algorithm, it is also effective in attacking other community detection algorithms, validating its good transferability.},

  abstract     = {Cyber argumentation platforms offer specially designed environments for users to discuss and debate their stances and viewpoints on important issues. However, argumentation polarization often occurs in discussions and debates on these cyber argumentation platforms. Several researchers investigated argumentation polarization qualitatively in the past, but none of them have developed a quantitative model for measuring the degree of argumentation polarization. We addressed this important and challenging issue by developing an innovative argumentation polarization model to measure argumentation polarization by incorporating four important attributes of argumentation polarization: 1) the total number of argumentation poles; 2) the population size of the argumentation poles; 3) similarity within argumentation poles; and 4) the dissimilarity between argumentation poles. Its baseline model was derived from an economic polarization model proposed by Esteban and Ray, which measures polarization using three features: 1) homogeneity within each group; 2) heterogeneity across groups; and 3) a small number of significant groups. We adapted their model by incorporating population sizes for poles, normalizing for population size, and normalizing for parameter selection, to fit our formulation of argumentation polarization. This model was evaluated using an empirical study conducted using our cyber argumentation platform, the intelligent cyber argumentation system (ICAS). This model was evaluated with two other distribution-based opinion polarization models that were applied in online discussion contexts, both analytically and empirically, since there are no existing argumentation polarization models. The analytical and empirical evaluations indicate that our model performs more effectively in terms of the definition of argumentation polarization and the four attributes.},

In its adaptive version, additional seed users can be selected after observing certain diffusion results. On the other hand, social computing tasks are often time-critical, and therefore, only the influence resulted in the early period is worthwhile, which can be naturally modeled by enforcing a time constraint. In this article, we present an analysis of the time-constrained adaptive IM problem. On the theory side, we provide the hardness results of computing the optimal policy and a lower bound on the adaptive gap, which measures the superiority of adaptive policies over the nonadaptive policies. For practical solutions, from basic to advanced, we design a series of seeding policies for achieving high efficacy and scalability. Finally, we investigate the proposed solutions through extensive simulations based on real-world data sets.},

However, the promoted opinion is not always desirable, and in some cases, it is desired to prevent its propagation in the network. This mission can be done with the help of informed agents that are common agents that act as hidden advertisers. In this article, we will discuss how many and which agents should be selected as informed agents in a way that the final opinions of agents satisfy some given constraints. In the line of solving this problem, the notion of equilibratability is considered, and the problem is formulated as minimizing the zero-norm of available solutions. Knowing that the mentioned problem is NP-hard, some relaxation methods are considered to solve this problem. The efficiency of the proposed methods is investigated for selecting the sparsest solution in a well-known graph. Finally, the required informed agents to resist a group of spreaders in some random graphs [generated with different methods, such as Erdös and Rényi (ER), Watts and Strogatz (WS), and Barabási and Albert (BA)] are compared, and some reasonable results are observed.},

Toward this end, a multilayer LTM (ML-LTM) is first presented to deal with the hierarchical clustering issues of multicontent variables. Second, we further develop an ML-LTM-based multicontent recommendation system. Our experiment results show that the proposed ML-LTM can achieve 90% recommendation accuracy, but the current LTM can only has 20%. Third, we propose an incremental update approach for ML-LTM that can save five-sixth updating time comparing with the whole-model retraining approach for achieving the same recommendation accuracy.},
