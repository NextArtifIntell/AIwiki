In the beginning, replacement of components and redesign of equipment drove sales. Embedding logical instructions in the design of an integrated circuit changed calculators and scientific instruments. Those products found enthusiastic buyers in a generation of engineers and scientists raised on slide rules and vacuum tubes. The rise of personal computers changed the focus. Apple and IBM won a format war, which benefitted their respective suppliers, Motorola, Intel, and IBM’s semiconductor division. Third party software providers added applications. By 1985, IBM’s PC division achieved sales that would have made it the third largest computer company, had it been free-standing. Not long thereafter, IBM lost control over the design to clones such as Compaq.},

Weighing in at a staggering 32 kg and featuring a blazing-fast 2.048-MHz clock, it was the first computer to use silicon integrated circuits (ICs). Mankind has made great strides and advances both in regards to space exploration as well as technology since the AGC made its debut.

  abstract     = {Reports on the history and development of computer aided design systems. In quick succession between 1964 and 1971, our field saw the proposal of Moore’s law,1 the coining of the term “computer architecture,”2 and the introduction of the first microprocessor.3 For much of the five decades since then, we have benefitted extraordinarily from both the dynamism of Moore’s law transistor scaling and the stable durability of the hardware–software abstractions of computer architecture. The dynamic duo of Moore’s law and computer architecture have allowed massive scaling to occur, and also to be navigated smoothly with relatively little software impact. For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, surges in power density occurred as we reached challenging limits in very large scale integration (VLSI) designs based on bipolar transistors; a technology transition from bipolar to complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) occurred with relatively little impact or awareness from the software portion of the computing community.4 Over the past 10–15 years however, more fundamental shifts have occurred. For example, Dennard scaling,5 a companion phenomenon to Moore’s law stating that power density could remain stable while transistor sizes shrank, is reaching physical limits. This means that further Moore’s law increases in transistor counts are becoming more complex and are only achieved with great effort and at higher power-density costs. Furthermore, as we reach fundamental physical limits in the functioning of small semiconductor transistors, Moore’s law itself is being challenged by the increased physical effort and financial expense required to maintain transistor scaling trends.},

It lived on the processor daughterboard along with the 6502 and a suite of other display and sound chips. ANTIC ran a single-loop program at 60 Hz, matching the refresh rate of National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) televisions. Each instruction described how to draw 1–16 scan lines on my TV, with a variety of bitmapped and character-mapped modes (characters indirected to another set of bitmaps, allowing compact representation of 2-D game worlds). An ANTIC program was called a “Display List”; enterprising programmers could mix text and graphics vertically down the screen with the goal of conserving the machine’s precious 16– 48 KB of random access memory (RAM).},

According to reliable sources,1 in late 1974, Federico Faggin, who was then best known as the designer of the first commercial microprocessor Intel 4004, and Ralph Ungermann, from the Intel 8080 team, left Intel to form their own company. Then, Masatoshi Shima, who was the transistor-level designer of Intel 8080, left Intel in April 1975 to join Faggin and Ungermann. At the beginning, Faggin intended to develop a single-chip computer (microcontroller), but soon realized that it is difficult to compete in the microcontroller market with a company who has its own semiconductor fabrication facility. In December 1975, Faggin came up with an idea of developing a 5-V microprocessor, which was machine core compatible with then popular Intel 8080, and adding most of the functionalities available in Motorola 6800, so that they could pinch both markets. Faggin, Ungermann, and Shima managed to find a venture capital from Exxon Enterprises for the development of a new microprocessor Z80 and formed their own company Zilog.},

As we transformed microprocessors from single-core to multicore to manycore, innovations in the architecture, design, and management of on-die cache hierarchy were critical to enabling scaling in performance and efficiency. In addition, at the system level, as input/output (I/O) devices (e.g., networking) and accelerators (domain-specific) started to interact with general-purpose cores across shared memory, advancements in caching became important as a way of minimizing data movement and enabling faster communication. In this article, we cover some of the major advancements in cache research and development that have improved the performance and efficiency of microprocessor servers over the last 25 years. We will reflect upon several techniques including shared and distributed last-level caches (including data placement and coherence), cache Quality of Service (addressing interference between workloads), direct cache access (placing I/O data directly into CPU caches), and extending caching to off-die accelerators (CXL.cache). We will also outline potential future directions for cache research and development over the next 25 years.},

In this article, I attempt to provide a retrospective view of IBM&#39;s POWER and PowerPC microprocessors, through the lens of someone who has been associated with such modeling in support of microarchitecture definition and optimization from the earliest days of this particular family of processors. The focus in the early/mid-1980s was on cycle-accurate performance modeling; much later, beginning in 1999 or so, the looming power wall triggered a new era of power-performance modeling at the microarchitecture level. Subsequently, temperature-aware and reliability-aware modeling were added dimensions that CMOS technology evolution drove us into. The problem of model validation is an unavoidable aspect of presilicon modeling. Without that mindset, the microarchitecture definition team can make serious mistakes, which results in unpleasant postsilicon surprises. I provide pointers to early approaches in addressing this issue. The article attempts to mention the contributions of many talented researchers and engineers that have, over the years, contributed immensely to the evolution of the POWER/PowerPC microprocessors from earliest research concepts through the recently announced POWER10—using model-based analysis to ensure competitive performance growth.},

Many of these features were indeed new, but others have their roots in a line of processor architectures that predates this revolution and that, alone among those ancient species, continues to thrive in modern information technology (IT) world: the IBM mainframe, launched in 1964 as S/360 and now continuing as IBM Z. This article will briefly describe some of the “modern” features that were pioneered there, then recount how the mainframe made the transition into the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) microprocessor world.},

They also generate compelling photorealistic images at real-time frame rates. GPUs have evolved by adding features to support new use cases. NVIDIA’s GeForce 256, the first GPU, was a dedicated processor for real-time graphics, an application that demands large amounts of floating-point arithmetic for vertex and fragment shading computations and high memory bandwidth. As real-time graphics advanced, GPUs became programmable. The combination of programmability and floating-point performance made GPUs attractive for running scientific applications. Scientists found ways to use early programmable GPUs by casting their calculations as vertex and fragment shaders. GPUs evolved to meet the needs of scientific users by adding hardware for simpler programming, double-precision floating-point arithmetic, and resilience.},

While Microsoft is following Apple and Google’s lead by integrating special-purpose silicon for secure cryptographic operations, it is taking a different approach by leveraging existing open standards and technologies.

The I-DVFS, unlike legacy DVFS, does not require halting an IPs execution to perform a DVFS transition, and thus, the performance overhead of DVFS is both reduced and more deterministic. Such attributes enable the more frequent use of DVFS and, thus, improve an IPs performance, power, and energy efficiency. Nonetheless, the overlapping of an IPs DVFS transition with the normal IPs execution creates a number of issues that need careful treatment at design time to ensure the reliable operation in the field. This article presents these issues and elucidates on how they are addressed in an implementation of I-DVFS that has been productized and can be found in millions of CPUs.},

The Kunpeng series processors combine technology innovations from various levels to improve efficiency, eliminate bottlenecks, and deliver value and performance. Its key features are as follows: The Kunpeng 920 core is specifically designed with superscalar architecture with the support of vector extension to provide leading features for high-performance computing applications; the coherent cache subsystem is created to integrate multicores into single chiplet (e.g., 7-nm process node) with a ring design that is ultralow-latency (&lt;15 ns), nonblocking and bufferless; a dedicated parallel small-IO block is developed to achieve high-bandwidth (e.g., 400 GB/s) interdie connection for 2-D package solutions; IO die is redesigned (e.g., 16-nm process) so that the latest standard interface (e.g., PCI4.0) can be leveraged to scale up the System on a Chip (SoCs) and connect them with other IO devices; two or four Kunpeng 920 can work together as single symmetric multiprocessor system with cache coherent nonuniform memory access fabric.},

Calibration of a quantum system is often achieved by running complex series of dependent experiments and a full system calibration can require tens of calibration experiments to complete. Optimal control parameters drift over time, and components of experimental quantum systems are susceptible to failure. Hence, continuous operation of a quantum system requires automated background processes such as frequent recalibration and monitoring. In this article, we present a scheduling toolkit that schedules experiments based on a directed acyclic graph using a configurable traversal algorithm. Our scheduler can be triggered from any process, enabling universal feedback between the scheduler and the quantum control system. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we implemented a complex system calibration algorithm based on our scheduling toolkit.},

Multicore architectures are a firm candidate for unlocking the scalability of quantum processors. Nonetheless, the vulnerability and complexity of quantum communications make this a challenging approach. A comprehensive design should imply consolidating the communications stack in the quantum computer architecture. In this article, we explain how this vision, by entangling communications and computation in the core of the design, may help to solve the open challenges.

The field is relatively new and it is imperative to consider emerging technologies in the space and evaluate their unique tradeoff spaces to determine how to best close the gap between current devices and target applications. Here, we explore three recent developments on this front. First, we consider extensions to currently available hardware, which allow the use of higher level states, beyond the usual binary, which when used temporarily can confer circuit-level advantage. Second, we consider the use of superconducting resonant cavities to reduce hardware requirements to implement quantum error correction protocols. Finally, we consider the use of neutral atoms, which offer unique strengths and weaknesses. It is valuable to evaluate new technology early and often to determine the best path toward scalability.},

Rather than waiting for quantum hardware technologies to mature, we need to start assessing in tandem the impact of the occurrence of quantum computing in various scientific fields. However, to this purpose, we need to use a complementary but quite different approach than proposed by the NISQ vision, which is heavily focused on and burdened by the engineering challenges. That is why we propose and advocate the PISQ approach: Perfect Intermediate Scale Quantum computing based on the already known concept of perfect qubits. This will allow researchers to focus much more on the development of new applications by defining the algorithms in terms of perfect qubits and evaluate them on quantum computing simulators that are executed on supercomputers. It is not the long-term solution but will currently allow universities to research on quantum logic and algorithms and companies can already start developing their internal know-how on quantum solutions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing systems are developing rapidly as powerful solvers for a variety of real-world calculations. Traditionally, many of these same applications are solved using conventional high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which have progressed sharply through decades of hardware and software improvements. Here, we present a perspective on the motivations and challenges of pairing quantum computing systems with modern HPC infrastructure. We outline considerations and requirements for the use cases, macroarchitecture, microarchitecture, and programming models needed to integrate near-term quantum computers with HPC system, and we conclude with the expectation that such efforts are well within reach of current technology.},

However, the qubit quality is likely to remain quite low making it difficult to execute programs reliably. Furthermore, scaling the designs to a large number of qubits would require specialized hardware that operates at cryogenic conditions.

In this work, we propose to adopt an array of thin-film thermoelectric (TE) devices, which is integrated within the chip packaging, for both cooling and energy-harvesting purposes. Each TE device within the array can be during the runtime enabled either for energy harvesting or on-demand cooling. Our approach is implemented and evaluated using a mature finite elements analysis tool in which a commercial multicore mobile chip is modeled after careful calibrations together with state-of-the-art TE devices. Results demonstrate that our approach reduces the peak temperature by up to 24 $^\circ C$∘C and the average temperature by 10 $^\circ C$∘C across various benchmarks with the cost of 67.5 mW. Additionally, the harvested energy from the array of TE devices compensates for 89\% of the required cooling energy.},

Unfortunately, such applications suffer from a significant waste of both execution cycles and energy in current computing systems due to the costly data movement between the computation units and the memory units. Genome analysis and weather prediction are two examples of such applications. Recent field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) couple a reconfigurable fabric with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to enable more efficient data movement and improve overall performance and energy efficiency. This trend is an example of a paradigm shift to near-memory computing. We leverage such an FPGA with HBM for improving the prealignment filtering step of genome analysis and representative kernels from a weather prediction model. Our evaluation demonstrates large speedups and energy savings over a high-end IBM POWER9 system and a conventional FPGA board with DDR4 memory. We conclude that FPGA-based near-memory computing has the potential to alleviate the data movement bottleneck for modern data-intensive applications.},

We exploit domain-specific knowledge to reduce the amount of transferred data that limits overall system performance. Our proof-of-concept implementation reveals that the effective accelerator throughput nearly quadruples with optimized data movement, reaching up to 75\% of its theoretical peak and nearly 10× faster processing than a CPU using AVX2 extensions.},

  abstract     = {As applications move to the edge, efficiency in computing power and power/energy consumption is required. Heterogeneous computing promises to meet these requirements through application-specific hardware accelerators. Runtime adaptivity might be of paramount importance to realize the potential of hardware specialization, but further study is required on workload retargeting and offloading to reconfigurable hardware. This article presents our framework for the exploration of both offloading and hardware generation techniques. The framework is currently able to process instruction sequences from MicroBlaze, ARMv8, and riscv32imaf binaries, and to represent them as Control and Dataflow Graphs for transformation to implementations of hardware modules. We illustrate the framework’s capabilities for identifying binary sequences for hardware translation with a set of 13 benchmarks.},

Experiments during the pandemic turned into regular operations, and have had a profound impact on perceptions of the viability of remote work. I do not lightly use the word “profound.” The trend reverses more than two centuries of separating the location of work and residences. That separation has deep roots, and reflects something fundamental about the gains to society from separating work from other activities. All developed countries have this feature. The pandemic brought about an acceleration of remote work. To appreciate how suddenly this arrived, consider that two years ago less than 25\% of the U.S. workforce participated in some sort of remote work at home, and it was typically less than half their work hours. During the height of the pandemic, however, approximately 40\% of the U.S. labor force participated in remote work, and it was full time at home.},

In recent years, numerous error correcting codes, such as the surface code, have emerged which are well suited for current and future limited connectivity 2-D devices. We find quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5-D architecture, can efficiently implement surface codes with around 20× fewer transmons via this work. We virtualize 2-D memory addresses by storing the code in layers of qubit memories connected to each transmon. Distributing logical qubits across many memories has minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient logical operations. Virtualized logical qubit (VLQ) systems can achieve fault tolerance comparable to conventional 2-D transmon-only architectures while putting within reach a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of around ten logical qubits, requiring only 11 transmons and 9 attached cavities.},

However, little research has been conducted to develop a cryogenic-optimal core architecture even with its high potentials in performance, power, and area efficiency. In this article, we first develop CryoCore-Model, a cryogenic processor modeling framework that can accurately estimate the maximum clock frequency of processor models running at 77 K. Next, driven by the modeling tool, we design CryoCore, a 77 K-optimal core microarchitecture to maximize the core’s performance and area efficiency while minimizing the cooling cost. The proposed cryogenic processor architecture, in this article, achieves the large performance improvement and power reduction and, thus, contributes to the future of high-performance and power-efficient computer systems.},

However, the traditional logic abstractions and the digital design patterns we understand so well have coevolved with the hardware technology that has embodied them. As we look past CMOS, there is no reason to think that those same abstractions best serve to encapsulate the computational potential inherent to emerging devices. We posit that a new and radically more efficient foundation for computing lies at the intersection of superconductor electronics and delay-coded computation. Building on recent work in race logic, we show that superconducting circuits can naturally compute directly over temporal relationships between pulse arrivals; that the computational relationships between those pulse arrivals can be formalized through a functional extension to a temporal predicate logic used in the verification community; and that the resulting architectures can operate asynchronously and describe real and useful computations. We verify our hypothesis through a combination of detailed analog circuit models and layout designs, a formal analysis of our abstractions, and an evaluation of several superconducting temporal accelerators.},

Recent studies on Optane DIMM-based systems unveil discrepant performance characteristics, compared with what many researchers thought before the product release. To thoroughly analyze the source of the discrepancy and facilitate real-NVRAM-aware system design, we develop an NVRAM microarchitecture characterization and modeling framework, consisting of a Low-level profilEr for Non-volatile memory Systems (LENS) and a Validated cycle-Accurate NVRAM Simulator (VANS). LENS allows users to comprehensively analyze NVRAM performance attributes and reverse engineer NVRAM microarchitectures. We use LENS to reverse engineer the sophisticated microarchitecture design of Optane DIMM and generate a set of architecture implications of industrial NVRAMs. VANS models Optane DIMM microarchitecture and is validated by comparing with the detailed performance characteristics of Optane DIMM-attached servers. VANS adopts a modular design that can be easily modified to extend to other NVRAM architecture designs.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has begun a transformation from using virtual machines to using containers. Containers are attractive because of their “build once, run anywhere” computing model and their minimal performance overhead. Cloud providers leverage the lean nature of containers to run hundreds of them or more on a few cores. Furthermore, containers enable the serverless paradigm, which involves the creation of short-lived processes. In this work, we identify that containerized environments create page translations that are extensively replicated across containers in the TLB and in page tables. The result is high TLB pressure and redundant kernel work during page table management. To remedy this situation, this article proposes BabelFish, a novel architecture to share page translations across containers in the TLB and in page tables. BabelFish reduces the mean and tail latency of containerized workloads, cold-start effects of function execution, and container bring-up time. This work also advocates for the need to provide more hardware support for containerized and serverless environments.},

Conventional binary architectures for GEMM exhibit poor scalability in area and energy efficiency, due to the spatial nature of number representation and computing. On the contrary, unary computing processes data in temporal domain with extremely simple logic. However, to date, there rarely exist efficient architectures for unary GEMM. In this work, we first present uGEMM, a hardware-efficient unary GEMM architecture enabled by universally compatible arithmetic units, which simultaneously achieves input-insensitivity and high output accuracy. Next, we demonstrate that the proposed uGEMM can reliably early terminate the computation and offers dynamic energy-accuracy scaling for real-world applications via an accuracy-aware metric. Finally, to propel the future research for unary computing, we open source our unary computing simulator, UnarySim.},

To accelerate the queries, we designed a Genesis hardware library of efficient coarse-grained primitives that can be composed into a specialized dataflow architecture.

  abstract     = {We offer the first security analysis of cache compression, a promising architectural technique that is likely to appear in future mainstream processors. We find that cache compression has novel security implications because the compressibility of a cache line reveals information about its contents. Compressed caches introduce a new side channel that is especially insidious, as simply storing data transmits information about the data. We present two techniques that make attacks on compressed caches practical. Pack+Probe allows an attacker to learn the compressibility of victim cache lines, and Safecracker leaks secret data efficiently by strategically changing the values of nearby data. Our evaluation on a proof-of-concept application shows that, on a representative compressed cache architecture, Safecracker lets an attacker compromise an 8-byte secret key in under 10 ms. Even worse, Safecracker can be combined with latent memory safety vulnerabilities to leak a large fraction of program memory.},

Researchers have made tremendous efforts in various aspects, especially in device and circuit design. However, there has been little progress in designing a convincing SFQ-based architectural unit due to a lack of understanding about its potentials and limitations at the architectural level. This article provides the design principles for SFQ-based architectural units with an extremely high-performance neural processing unit (NPU). To achieve our goal, we developed and validated a simulation framework to identify critical architectural bottlenecks in designing a performance-effective SFQ-based NPU. We propose SuperNPU, which outperforms a conventional state-of-the-art NPU by 23 times in terms of computing performance and 1.23 times in power efficiency even with the cooling cost of the 4K environment.},

The ML field needs systematic methods for evaluating performance that represents real-world use cases and useful for making comparisons across different software and hardware implementations. MLPerf answers the call. MLPerf is an ML benchmark standard driven by academia and industry (70+ organizations). Built out of the expertise of multiple organizations, MLPerf establishes a standard benchmark suite with proper metrics and benchmarking methodologies to level the playing field for ML system performance measurement of different ML inference hardware, software, and services.},

This behavior invites plenty of legal analysis, angry editorializing, and technological proposals, but rarely economic analysis. The author addresses that gap and considers the question of &quot;What economic factors make confrontational conversation more or less likely in our era?&quot; the increasing frequency of breakaways is a symptom that they are becoming cheaper to build. Ergo, we should expect mainstream sites to face increasing pressures towards fragmentation. He concludes that the trends toward fragmentation worries anyone who wants to maintain civil society. Who will encourage the confrontations that settle the public conversations? Most worrisome, misinformation, and deep fakes are becoming more widespread in breakaway communities, and especially on the dark web. Right now, most users of deepfakes entertain themselves (you do not really want to know the details.), but, as with any frontier software, it will become mainstream soon enough. As deepfakes become more common, who will adjudicate whether a deepfake of a politician or celebrity is real or not?

Interleaved-multithreading (IMT) processor cores are interesting to pursue energy efficiency and low hardware cost for edge computing, yet they need hardware acceleration schemes to run heavy computational workloads. Following a vector approach to accelerate computations, this article explores possible alternatives to implement vector coprocessing units in RISC-V cores, showing the synergy between IMT and data-level parallelism in the target workloads.},

These Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are composed of chips, systems, and software, all co-designed in-house. In this paper, we detail the circumstances that led to this outcome, the challenges and opportunities observed, the approach taken for the chips, a quick review of performance, and finally a retrospective on the results. A companion paper describes the supercomputers built from these chips, the compiler, and a detailed performance analysis [Jou20].},

In this work, we present Manticore, a general-purpose, ultraefficient chiplet-based architecture for data-parallel FP workloads. We have manufactured a prototype of the chiplet’s computational core in Globalfoundries 22FDX process and demonstrate more than 5x improvement in energy efficiency on FP intensive workloads compared to CPUs and GPUs. The compute capability at high energy and area efficiency is provided in “Snitch: A tiny pseudo dual-issue processor for area and energy efficient execution of floating-point intensive workloads,” IEEE Trans. Comput., containing eight small integer cores, each controlling a large floating-point unit (FPU). The core supports two custom ISA extensions: The SSRs extension elides explicit load and store instructions by encoding them as register reads and writes (“Stream semantic registers: A lightweight RISC-V ISA extension achieving full compute utilization in single-issue cores,” IEEE Trans. Comput.). The floating-point repetition extension decouples the integer core from the FPU allowing floating-point instructions to be issued independently. These two extensions allow the single-issue core to minimize its instruction fetch bandwidth and saturate the instruction bandwidth of the FPU, achieving FPU utilization above 90\%, with more than 40\% of core area dedicated to the FPU.},

In that sense, it is possible to have a nonpartisan conversation about the technology policy dilemmas inherited by a new administration, and discuss how realistic policy changes shape the economic situation for firms. That is what today’s column provides—a nonpartisan survey of interesting technology policy issues to watch in the new administration. To be clear, there is professional opinion in this column—i.e., I made some judgment calls about what topics interest those in the technology business. To the best of my ability, however, I tried to stick to the economics and nothing else. This survey will show how many key decisions are up in the air. That has one important economic implication for investors: It creates a classic situation where new information about policy will move financial markets far in advance of the actual actions of firms responding to new policy. Expect indicators to move up and down immediately after decisions become public.},

It delivers asynchrony in heterogeneous system integration while yielding low-energy on-chip data movement. The approach consists of both a lightweight asynchronous switch architecture (using transition-signaling protocols and bundled-data encoding) and a complete synthesis flow built on top of mainstream industrial CAD tools. For the first time, this article demonstrates compelling area, performance and power benefits when compared to a recent commercial synchronous switch, and the ability of the tool flow to correctly instantiate a complete and competitive network topology.},

  abstract     = {The increased variability renders nanometer devices prone to timing errors. Recent work focused on the development of error prediction models for either evaluating the effects of timing errors on applications or guiding the voltage/frequency settings. Such models may have considered the data-dependent excitation of paths, but they have neglected the impact of all the concurrently executed instructions on error occurrence; which may lead to inaccurate error estimation in pipelined designs. To investigate such a limitation, we develop ExHero, a fully automated framework that performs dynamic timing analysis considering the execution history of a number of in-flight instructions. Using ExHero, we first demonstrate that the order and type of instructions within sequences that have length equal to the pipeline depth significantly affect the error rate. When applied to a pipelined floating-point unit, ExHero reveals that existing approaches estimate on average 46.5\% and 32.1\% lower error rate and absolute error, respectively, than the actual ones.},

Commonly, each is measured per service—availability probability of a specific service, the latency of a specific service, and overall—system average reliability and average latency, considering the demand for every service. Intuitively, minimizing latency requires minimizing the number of network elements a service makes use of. In a nonredundant environment, this would also guarantee the maximal reliability of a service, as reliability degrades when relying on more elements. However, reliability is often guaranteed by allocating backup resources. We explain that such redundancy or the joint support for multiple services can impose a tradeoff between reliability and time-efficiency criteria. In this article, we study the conditions for the existence of such a tradeoff and design solutions that jointly take care of both design goals.},

In this article, we propose and evaluate a solution to deal with congestion in lossy DCNs, based on the same approach as the dynamic virtual lanes technique, previously proposed for lossless DCNs. This approach consists of isolating congesting flows in special queues, so that they do not share queues with noncongesting ones. This reduces the probability of standard queues becoming congested, thus reducing the dropping (and retransmission) of noncongesting packets and improving network performance. The experiment results confirm that these benefits are achieved by adding just a single special queue per switch port.},

  abstract     = {Chiplet technology can significantly reduce the cost and time needed to develop custom high-performance silicon products. To realize a chiplet-based product, a die-to-die (D2D) network to interconnect the chiplets is required. Almost all of today&#39;s chiplet-based products use proprietary D2D interfaces. Industry has primarily paid attention to D2D PHYs. A design also requires logical information flow between chiplets. Current designs use proprietary PHYs and logic protocols between components. This approach makes it challenging to integrate chiplets from multiple vendors. The open domain-specific architecture (ODSA) is a project within the open compute project (OCP) community that aims to establish open physical and logical D2D interfaces for chiplets. Ultimately, the ODSA aims to create open interfaces to enable a marketplace of interoperable chiplets. This will allow product designers to develop chiplet-based products that integrate best in class chiplets from multiple vendors. This article reviews technical developments within the ODSA.},

We hypothesize that a cache access latency occurred at every Allreduce is a significant bottleneck in the current computational systems with high-bandwidth interconnects for distributed DL. To reduce this frequency of latency, it is important to aggregate data at the network interfaces. We implement a data aggregation circuit in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Using this FPGA, we proposed novel Allreduce architecture and training strategy without accuracy degradation. Results of the measurement show Allreduce latency reduction to 1/4. Our system can also conceal about 90\% of the communication overhead and improve scalability by 20\%. The end-to-end time consumed for training in distributed DL with ResNet-50 and ImageNet is reduced to 87.3\% without any degradation in validation accuracy.},

The configurable network protocol accelerator (COPA) framework enables FPGAs to support custom inline/lookaside accelerators and attach directly to a 100-Gb/s Ethernet network. The hardware component provides the necessary networking/accelerator infrastructure. The software component supports an open standard API that enables the integrated accelerators to be used with network communication by applications/middleware.
