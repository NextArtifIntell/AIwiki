  abstract     = {Extreme learning machines (ELMs) has been theoretically and experimentally proved to achieve promising performance at a fast learning speed for supervised classification tasks. However, it does not perform well on imbalanced binary classification tasks and tends to get biased toward the majority class. Besides, since a large amount of training data with labels are not always available in the real world, there is an urgent demand to develop an efficient semi-supervised version of ELM for imbalanced binary classification tasks. In this article, owing to the distinct insensitivity of area under the ROC curve (AUC) to both class skews and changes of class distributions, we focus the study on integrating AUC maximization into the ELM framework to tackle with imbalanced binary classification tasks well. By demystifying the AUC metric with the ELM framework, we develop a new AUC-based ELM called AUC-ELM for imbalanced binary classification, which essentially is revealed to be equivalent to an ELM on another transformed data space. Accordingly, its semi-supervised version called SAUC-ELM is also developed. Both AUC-ELM and SAUC-ELM have the distinctive merits: 1) they share the advantage of ELM in both generalization capability and training efficiency, and further uniquely tailored for imbalanced binary classification tasks and 2) in contrast to the existing imbalanced variants of ELM, such as class-specific cost regulation ELM and semi-supervised ELM, they have fewer parameters to tune, thereby reducing the computational cost for model selection. Experiments on a heap of datasets show that both AUC-ELM and SAUC-ELM outperform the other comparative methods in terms of both classification performance and training speed.},

First, an integral-type Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is constructed to handle output constraint. Next, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) control and robust control are used to tackle unknown nonlinear function. The continuous switching function is designed to switch RBFNN control to robust control when the arguments of the unknown function exceed the active region of neural network. Utilizing the property of radial basis function, we derive the upper bound of the term containing the unknown nonlinear function and design adaptive laws to determine the derived upper bound and robust control gain. Then, the predefined time virtual control inputs are obtained and their derivatives are estimated by finite time differentiator. Finally, we use the dead zone inverse technique to obtain the actual control input. Stability analysis shows the presented control scheme achieves global convergence of the errors to predefined accuracy within predefined time. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the presented control scheme.},

Instead of using discontinuous functions, such as the sign function, an auxiliary function is employed to obtain a smooth control input that is still able to achieve perfect tracking in the presence of bounded disturbances. Indeed, the global boundedness of all closed-loop signals and asymptotic perfect tracking of fractional-order system output to a given reference trajectory are proved by using fractional directed Lyapunov method.

This approach combines an ADRC and a global finite-time control for high accuracy trajectory tracking control. Based on the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control, the proposed approach can remove the condition in the original ADRC that the derivative of the uncertainties is required to be bounded. The extended state observer is employed to handle the real-time estimation of the total uncertainty. It can be found that the proposed scheme not only can converge fast to the semi-global finite-time stable equilibrium but also can have superior tracking control performance. In summary, compared to existing approaches, the proposed scheme can have several advantages, such as uncertainty rejection, easy implementation, robustness, chattering-free, high precision, and no need for prior knowledge of bounded uncertainties.

  abstract     = {The minimum dominating set (MDS) of the network is a node subset of smallest size that every node in the network is either in this subset or is adjacent to one or more nodes of this subset. MDS has found wide applications, ranging from network monitoring, routing, to epidemic control, and text processing. However, the majority of existing studies on MDS problem are confined to single networks. In real world, more and more complex systems consist of a set of elements linked up by different types of connections, which are best modeled as multiplex networks with interacting network layers. Though vastly important, the MDS of the multiplex networks has not yet been formally defined and its application and identification remain open issues. In this article, we present the definition of the MDS of the multiplex network and show some of its possible applications. For solving the MDS problem of the multiplex network, we built a spin-glass model and solve it through the belief-propagation (BP) equations under the replica symmetry mean-field theory. As a consequence, we can predict the relative size of the MDS of the multiplex network theoretically and we can propose a BP-guided decimation algorithm to construct an approximate optimal dominating set in practice. Then the algorithm is improved in both accuracy and efficiency by embedding a novel multiplex network-oriented leaf-removal strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is finally verified by comparing with other methods on a number of the multiplex network examples.},

On this basis, we consequently propose an observer-based SMFAC (ObSMFAC) scheme, including a sampled-data parameter estimator to estimate the unknown partial derivatives and a sampled-data observer to estimate the residual nonlinear uncertainty, respectively. Note that the sampling period is incorporated explicitly in the proposed ObSMFAC which enhances the control performance by reducing its negative influence on the system stability. The constraint on the input rate is also considered in the control law as the transition condition of the input updating algorithms. The convergence of the proposed ObSMFAC is proved by using the contraction mapping principle. The simulation study demonstrates the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the inner estimations of the minimal domains of attraction (MDA) for uncertain nonlinear systems, whose uncertainties are modeled by parameters defined in a semialgebraic set. We begin from an initial inner estimation of MDA and then enlarge this initial inner estimation by iterative calculating common Lyapunov-like functions with a linear sum of squares programming-based approach. Afterwards, this enlarged inner estimation of MDA is further improved by iterative computations of parameter-dependent Lyapunov-like functions. Especially, we use a simple semialgebraic set, described by a polynomial level-set function, to under-approximate this improved estimation. In the end, our methods are implemented and tested on several uncertain examples with comparisons to existing methods in the literatures.},

For the system nonlinearity, the linear-in-parameterized dynamics are formulated and the updating law of the parameter vector is given. For the system uncertainty, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) is utilized. To improve the approximation accuracy of the compound nonlinearity, the updating laws of the parameter vector and RBF NN weight are constructed by the tracking error and the filtered modeling error derived from SPEM. Furthermore, the fast terminal (FT) SMC is employed to achieve finite-time convergence. The simulation results show that the proposed controller obtains higher tracking accuracy and faster convergence, while the compound nonlinearity approximation is with higher precision.},

By virtue of random environment-based scaled consensus algorithms, it is shown how to reconstruct the original system into augmented error systems with random coefficient matrices. With the kind assistance of substochastic matrix and super-stochastic matrix, sufficient conditions for the cases with a static leader and a dynamic leader are derived, respectively.

When the states of a positive system cannot be fully obtained, the output feedback control strategy is a good method to stabilize the control system. From fuzzy control point of view, we employ the polynomial fuzzy model rather than the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model, and this kind of models can express a wider range of nonlinear positive systems. However, the polynomials in the system matrices and the feedback control gain matrices will make the nonconvex stability conditions more difficult to deal with. Thereby, in order to crack the hard nut, a nonzero transformation vector is introduced in this article to deal with the nonconvex problem skillfully. Furthermore, the imperfect premise matching technique is taken into account so that the implement of the controller is more simple and money-saving. In addition, the augmented dynamic of the positive polynomial fuzzy-model-based (PPFMB) control system is investigated to facilitate the stability and positivity analysis, and the basic conditions in the light of sum of squares (SOSs) are derived. Besides, the advanced membership function dependent (MFD) technique is used so that a great of useful information of MFs is extracted to improve the relaxation of the results.

First, the advantages of nonsingular terminal sliding control are adopted, a nonlinear function is used to design the sliding hyper plane, then the tracking error in the system could converge to zero in a specified finite time. Second, fractional order control can increase the order of differential and integral, which greatly improves the flexibility of control method. The fractional-order controller has some advantages that integer-order systems cannot achieve, thus obtaining better control effects than that without adding fractional order control. Furthermore, the chattering problem of control input can be effectively solved by using the super-twisting algorithm, which makes the control input smoother. Finally, the unknown model of the micro gyroscope is estimated by using the DLFNN. Because the DLFNN can adjust the base width, the center vector and the feedback gain of the inner and outer layers adaptively, the accurate approximation of the unknown model can be achieved, and the robustness and accuracy can be enhanced. The simulation results and the comparisons with conventional neural sliding mode control prove the presented scheme can realized better tracking property and estimate the unknown model more accurately.},

Since the subsystem may switch between two adjacent events while the corresponding controller does not switch, asynchronous switching may occur. Meanwhile, an event-triggered switching signal caused by asynchronous switching is designed with the mode-dependent average dwell time approach and event-triggered instants. By constructing multiple Lyapunov functions in the framework of the input delay approach and designing an error feedback controller, the sufficient condition for event-triggered asynchronous output regulation problem is solved.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the anti-disturbance control for Markov jump systems with matched and mismatched disturbances. First, the matched part is estimated by an output-based disturbance observer. Meanwhile, the mismatched part is attenuated by the $H_{\infty }$ controller. Therefore, a composite static output control scheme is built to make the closed-loop system stable with the required $H_{\infty }$ performance. Second, an integral sliding-mode output (ISMO) control approach is proposed to restrain the mentioned disturbances by using the upper bounds of disturbances. Third, an ISMO anti-disturbance strategy is established to integrate the advantages of the above two methods. It is noteworthy to point out that the proposed output observer structure could be reduced to the state case. Moreover, the diagonal constraint on Lyapunov variables is removed in this article. Finally, a numerical example is simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the energy-limited denial-of-service attack scheduling problem on remote state estimation under signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio-based channels. The goal of the attacker is to design the optimal attack strategy to degrade the control performance of cyber-physical systems and to reduce his energy consumption. First, to weigh the importance between the current and future rewards, an optimization problem with a discount factor is formulated, which is used to reflect the attacker’s goal. Next, a Markov decision problem (MDP) is formulated to solve the optimization problem. Due to the difficulty of solving the high-dimensional MDP with unknown transition and reward functions, a value iteration adaptive dynamic programming method is proposed to achieve an approximate optimal solution. Also, convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the efficiency and feasibility of the obtained results.},

To deal with the asymmetric input saturation, a unified smooth nonlinear function is constructed to effectively characterize the limitations between the control signal and the actuator. Subsequently, the novel backstepping design process, instead of the traditional $n$ -step-ahead predictor, is developed to design the stable event-triggered adaptive tracking controller by combining one neural approximator. Especially, a modified event-triggering condition is equipped into the designed controller to increase the number of triggering events at the transient-state stage. The proposed control scheme can not only achieve the good tracking performance with the avoidance of the $n$ -step time delays and the improvement of the transient-state performance but also alleviate the transmission burden of the network resource, and eliminate the effect of the asymmetric actuator saturation. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme proposed in this article.},

To deal with this phenomenon, a compensation scheme is proposed for other sensor nodes, based on which the past measured signal stored in the corresponding buffers may be utilized by the controller.

Sufficient conditions are derived such that the system states can reach a neighborhood of the sliding surface and the resultant closed-loop fuzzy system is input-to-state stable.

The proposed estimators ensure that the closed-loop error signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in mean square.

Given the significant successes of such models, especially supervised ones, in addressing such metrics, the time has come to ask if they can also be put to direct use in understanding the users and addressing basic human needs, e.g., subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, leisure, creation, identity, and freedom. A prerequisite to addressing such human needs is that the ML models exhibit a basic grasp of human psychology. In this article, we present ML models that can be embedded in our smartphone and enable it to understand us. We call this system your smartphone understands you (YSUY). YSUY uses wearable medical sensors to understand our physical, mental, and four-class (two-class) emotional states with 90.0\%, 90.3\%, and 98.4\% (99.5\%) accuracy, respectively. After verifying YSUY’s ability to understand the human condition from various perspectives, we evaluate the relationship between the different states and discuss how YSUY can be taken one step further to start playing a helpful role in addressing human needs of the types mentioned above from four different perspectives: “being,” “doing,” “having,” and “interacting.” We show that YSUY is a a promising candidate for adapting ML models to human-centric needs. We view this only as an initial step, hopefully, spurring other researchers to investigate the relationship between ML models and fulfilling human needs in much greater depth.},

A novel mixed-type feedback is introduced to reduce the horizontal shift effect so as to minimize tracking errors experienced by the follower agents. In this article, we also study the complete pose control using a nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) method. A stability analysis is provided to prove the finite-time boundedness of the tracking error signals. Quantitative evaluations of the multiple effects on the error bound are conducted to facilitate the subsequent control design to improve the performance. Numerical simulation results of a team of two degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) manipulators demonstrate the improved tracking performance of the end effectors with small bounded errors which are affected by network delays, maximum assigned accelerations, and the selection of control gains. The experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller.},

  abstract     = {In the new wave of artificial intelligence, deep learning is impacting various industries. As a closely related area, optimization algorithms greatly contribute to the development of deep learning. But the reverse applications are still insufficient. Is there any efficient way to solve certain optimization problem through deep learning? The key is to convert the optimization to a representation suitable for deep learning. In this article, a traveling salesman problem (TSP) is studied. Considering that deep learning is good at image processing, an image representation method is proposed to transfer a TSP to an image. Based on samples of a ten city TSP, a fully convolutional network (FCN) is used to learn the mapping from a feasible region to an optimal solution. The training process is analyzed and interpreted through stages. A visualization method is presented to show how an FCN can understand the training task of a TSP. Once the training is completed, no significant effort is required to solve a new TSP and the prediction is obtained on the scale of milliseconds. The results show good performance in finding the global optimal solution. Moreover, the developed FCN model has been demonstrated on TSP’s with different city numbers, proving excellent generalization performance.},

The injection model is assumed to be Lipschitz continuous and derivable regarding an unknown bounded signal, and the signal is produced from an unknown finite $L_{2}$ -gain dynamical system. First, based on neural network identifier and adaptive dynamic programming techniques, a novel controller with two fictitious dynamical systems, as co-workers of the closed-loop systems resisting attacks, is proposed. Furthermore, a cooperative interaction framework between the virtual dynamical systems and the closed-loop systems is developed, and through optimal control theory and Lyapunov function methods, it is proved that, the robust resilient controller designed in the framework ensures the attacked system states are uniformly ultimately bounded. Contrary to the presented approach, the impact of attacks is not considered in the existing results, then the stability for partially unknown nonlinear systems might not be guaranteed. Two illustrative examples validate the presented method.},

First, we propose a novel control framework, i.e., networked dual-mode adaptive horizon model predictive control (MPC), which consists of a local controller, a remote controller that is subject to packet losses, and a judger coordinating the switchings between them. The optimization procedure of MPC with variable prediction horizon is implemented in the remote controller while a simple state-feedback control law is in the local one. Second, to establish the stability condition, we propose a new Lyapunov function. By specifying the relation between the Lyapunov function and the optimal MPC value function, the input-to-state practical stability is established. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed control scheme.},

In the considered problem, a network of agents work collaboratively to minimize the social cost function, which is defined as the sum of the agents’ local objective functions. The engaged agents are supposed to be equipped with an undirected and connected communication graph. Different from most of the existing works, the social cost function in the considered problem is allowed to be nonconvex and possibly admits local extrema. To avoid local extrema and achieve the global minimization of the social cost function, an extremum-seeking-based approach is proposed by introducing a dynamic average consensus protocol to the sinusoidal-dither-signal-based extremum seeking scheme. The dynamic average consensus protocol is leveraged in the proposed extremum-seeker for information sharing and the sinusoidal probing signal is utilized for information extraction. For the avoidance of local extrema, the amplitude of the dither signal is designed to be adaptive. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the proposed method enables the decision variable to converge to a neighborhood of the global minimum point if the conditions on the network connectivity, the existence of unique global minimum and achievability of the global minimum are satisfied.

A class of Petri nets, systems of sequential systems with shared resources (S 4 PR), are used to model these considered AMSs. Our previous work has showed that deadlocks in S 4 PR are characterized by saturated perfect activity-circuit (PA-circuit). In this article, we divide all saturable PA-circuits into two categories: 1) dependent and 2) independent. An algorithm is proposed to compute all independent saturable PA-circuits. We prove that by adding a monitor for each independent PA-circuit to ensure that it is not saturated, all dependent PA-circuits cannot be saturated either and deadlocks in S 4 PR are successfully prevented. The presented method simplifies the structure of the deadlock controller without imposing tight constraints on the system. Finally, the proposed controller is illustrated by some examples.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is achieving significant success in various applications like control, robotics, games, resource management, and scheduling. However, the important problem of emergency evacuation, which clearly could benefit from RL, has been largely unaddressed. Indeed, emergency evacuation is a complex task that is difficult to solve with RL. An emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that make it challenging to solve. Also, there is no standard benchmark environment available that can be used to train RL agents for evacuation. A realistic environment can be complex to design. In this article, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train RL agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modeled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty, and bottlenecks. The implementation of our environment is in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new RL approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN-based agent [DQN/Double-DQN (DDQN)/Dueling-DQN] to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular $Q$ -learning to learn the shortest path on the building model’s graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the $Q$ -matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions due to fire spread, bottlenecks, and uncertainty. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN, DDQN, Dueling-DQN, PPO, VPG, state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), actor–critic method, and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN-based models. Finally, our model is tested on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. In order to reduce the action space, we propose a strategy that involves one step simulation. That is, an action importance vector is added to the final output of the pretrained DQN and acts like an attention mechanism. Using this strategy, the action space is reduced by 90.1\%. In this manner, the model is able to deal with large action spaces. Hence, our model achieves near optimal performance on the real world emergency environment.},

A novel spacecraft attitude stabilization constraint with the time-decaying term and the time-varying gaining parameter is constructed, such that not only is the designed constraint satisfied at the initial instant but also the spacecraft attitude can converge into the small neighborhood of the desired attitude. Two constraints on joint accelerations are constructed, such that the constraints on joint angles/velocities/accelerations and the requirement on the end-effector trajectory tracking are both satisfied. Besides, for the cost function with the control efforts and the manipulability optimization, it can be equivalently converted as a strictly convex quadratic function. Correspondingly, the trajectory planning problem of the FFSM at the acceleration level can be formulated as a constrained convex quadratic programming problem. The proposed trajectory planning algorithm avoids the dynamic singularity of the FFSM. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by the simulation results.},

Two kinds of SMC schemes for systems with time delay and without time delay are considered, respectively. When time delay is addressed in the system, an SMC strategy is structured via disturbance observer, where the unknown external disturbances are supposed to be generated by an exogenous dynamic. When time delay is not addressed, an SMC approach is designed in which the unknown external disturbances are assumed to tend to a constant steady state in infinite time. Sufficient conditions for stability of the corresponding sliding motion are derived by using Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and Lyapunov function approach, respectively. Our results can be applied when the bound of the disturbances are unmeasured or unknown. Two simulation examples are shown to illustrate the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of face image hallucination techniques. However, the previous face hallucination methods are unsupervised and ignore the label information of training samples, leading to undesirable results. This article proposes a locality-constrained and category embedding representation (LCER) method to super-resolve face image in a supervised manner by embedding the label information in data representation. The proposed LCER incorporates the locality prior and category information into one unified framework, which aims to learn both the advantages of locality in preserving the true typologic structure of data manifold and the discriminability in exposing the class subspace information. Such strategy allows the LCER not only to preserve more sharpen image details but also to guarantee the face structure pattern be transferred mainly from the same subject in super-resolution reconstruction. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed LCER, and the comparative results demonstrate that it achieved superior face hallucination performance in both the quantitative measurements and visual impressions compared to several state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the labor effort in hazardous environments like spray painting, an automatic car part spray painting machine has been set up. This article presents an intelligent location procedure for this machine. The location procedure assumes that the car part is placed with a tiny arbitrary pose, furthermore some kinds of parts under inspection undergoes through the deformation and thus it contains a nonrigid model. To tackle this problem, a workpiece positioning system works though multicamera is established first. Subsequently, a novel modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is proposed which registers the nonrigid shape to the undeformed source shape in the training library. The modified ICP combines the ideas from traditional ICP and deformation estimation from bounded biharmonic weights. It solves a nonlinear cost function by using Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. As a result, it estimates the transformation of the target point cloud with regards to the source point cloud. Additionally, it improves the accuracy of traditional ICP and increases its scope to nonrigid shapes. By employing these results in our location procedure, it can estimate the 6-DOF pose of the car part to be painted in addition to that it also estimates the deformation compared to the source cloud in the training library. This information is subsequently used to modify the guidance trajectory of the spray gun. In this article, a test case of front bumper is given, as it is commonly made of soft plastic materials and undergoes deformation under the influence of the external force. All the stated results support the efficacy of our algorithm.},

It is shown that via dynamic coupling, the output synchronization problem is transformed into a family of output homogenization and internal-model-based synchronization problems. In contrast to conventional approaches, the adopted approach does not rely on the generation of a specific reference trajectory, to be tracked by all agents. Based on this premise, we propose a distributed state-feedback protocol driving all the heterogeneous multiagent individual systems onto a copy of a virtual reference signal. Invoking the results from the theory of output regulation and cooperative control, the state-feedback controller synthesis is conducted to achieve the output synchronization of heterogeneous multiagent networks. Immediate extensions of the obtained results to observer-based control are also discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed output synchronization algorithm is verified through theoretical analysis and case studies.},

  abstract     = {A cluster tool consists of several single-wafer processing chambers and a wafer handling robot. A wafer has to wait within a chamber after being processed there until it is unloaded by the robot. Such wafer delays may cause wafer quality degradation or variability due to residual gases and heat in the chamber. The tool operation schedule has to maintain identical timing patterns or schedules for each cycle so as to keep wafer delays constant for every wafer. However, at the beginning of the tool operation, the tool is in an empty state and hence we need to make the tool reach such steady schedule by loading wafers into the tool. In this article, we develop a method of scheduling the robot tasks during the start-up period of a cluster tool to reach a target steady schedule quickly as possible. To do this, we model the behaviors of a cluster tool using timed Petri nets and linear system matrices in the max-plus algebra. By analyzing the matrices, we first identify a class of steady schedules which can be reached from the empty tool. We develop the matrices that explain the schedule evolution of the start-up period before reaching the steady period. By examining the matrices, we develop a method of choosing the most desirable one from such class of reachable steady schedules that can be achieved in the minimum time. We also prove that the schedule also minimizes the time duration of the close-down. Finally, we present computational experiments.},

In this article, the presented system design conditions establish several quantitative relationships between attack parameters and system performance.

  abstract     = {This article presents a simple and intuitive solution for multilabel image classification, which achieves the competitive performance on the popular COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks. The main idea is to capture how humans perform this task: we recognize both labels (i.e., objects and attributes) and the correlation of labels at the same time. Here, label recognition is performed by a standard ConvNet pipeline, whereas label correlation modeling is done by projecting both labels and image features extracted by the ConvNet to a common latent vector space. Specifically, we carefully design the loss function to ensure that: 1) labels and features that co-appear frequently are close to each other in the latent space and 2) conversely, labels/features that do not appear together are far apart. This information is then combined with the original ConvNet outputs to form the final prediction. The whole model is trained end-to-end, with no additional supervised information other than the image-level supervised information. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms previous approaches on COCO and PASCAL VOC in terms of mAP, macro/micro precision, recall, and $F$ -measure. Further, our model is highly efficient at test time, with only a small number of additional weights compared to the base model for direct label recognition.},

The algorithm is applied to the dynamics of coupling two vertical planes. The dynamic model is a multiple-input–multiple-output underactuated system. Based on the backstepping and hierarchical sliding mode schemes, a robust nonlinear control law is obtained to govern the balance and transfer of the ridable ballbot; this scheme considers input constraints as well as matched and mismatched uncertainties. The influence of actuator saturation is examined by proposing an auxiliary system. The stability of the whole system is guaranteed via Lyapunov theory and Barbalat’s lemma, which shows that the switching gains are limited by the upper bound of the matched uncertainty. An adaptive law is proposed to estimate the matched uncertainty using radial bias function networks. As a result, the robustness is enhanced, and the constraints of the switching gains on the matched uncertainty can be relaxed. The stabilizing and tracking problems of the ridable ballbot are investigated through comparative simulations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control algorithm in the presence of parameter variations, external disturbances, and input saturation.},

Different from the conventional vision-based approaches, the monocular camera is not required to be mounted at the center of WMR, and thus the derived visual model is subject to not only the nonholonomic constraint but also the unknown camera extrinsic parameters. To ensure the WMR can track a desired trajectory effectively, a combined observation/control strategy is proposed. First, a concurrent learning observer is designed to identify the camera extrinsic parameters with measurable visual signals. Then, with the aid of the estimated parameters, a nonlinear controller is presented to achieve the tracking task.

  abstract     = {In supply chain systems, with the rapid growth of electronic commerce, a lot of firms are puzzled with the issue about how to best manage the distribution channels. In this article, we study the online channel management, pricing and coordination (i.e., optimization) in supply chains in which both channel members have an opportunity to introduce an online channel for retailing products to consumers. We focus on examining the roles of “channel leadership,” online channel decision and customer channel preference. Through systematic analysis and comparisons, we obtain some important insights, such as: 1) consumers do not care about who the channel leader is, but care about who establishes the online channel; 2) the dual-channel structure can make the manufacturer charge a “higher wholesale price” regardless of who establishes the online channel and who the channel leader is; and 3) no matter who the channel leader is, the dual-channel structure hurts the consumers’ benefit when the retailer establishes the online channel. We also illustrate how the proposed dual-channel supply chain can be optimized with the use of supply chain contracts.},

However, current dual models aimed at deriving a maximum return have been limited to special cases. A further problem has been the return allocation to the individuals. With this in mind, this article presents two general dual consensus models, the first of which is a minimum cost consensus model, and the second of which allows the different individuals to have different tolerance levels. In both models the individual opinions and the group opinion are connected using a weighted average operator. To understand the economic significance of these models, some properties, such as the weak duality property, the optimality property, and the strong duality property are given. The relationships between the individual opinions, the unit costs, and the unit returns are also proven, and the core return allocation problem is addressed. It was found that in both cases, the costs the moderator needed to pay to a given individual were precisely equal to the returns the individual deserved. Numerical case studies were used to illustrate the proposed models, with the simulation results providing insights into the practical use of these optimization consensus models.},

To enhance the BCI performance, improving the classification accuracy of EEG signals is the key, which has always been the focus of research and development. In this article, a novel method integrating complex network and broad learning system (BLS) is proposed for visual evoked potential (VEP)-based BCI research. First, systematic VEP-based brain experiments are conducted for obtaining EEG signals, including steady-state VEP (SSVEP) and steady-state motion VEP (SSMVEP). Then, limited penetrable visibility graph (LPVG) and its degree sequence are employed to implement the preliminary feature extraction. All these features are finally fed into a BLS to study and classify the SSVEP and SSMVEP signals, respectively. The classification results show that our LPVG-based BLS can effectively classify VEP-based EEG signals, with average classification accuracy 96.22\% for SSVEP and 74.54\% for SSMVEP. These results are significantly better than other comparison methods as well as traditional CCA-based methods. All these open up new venues for studying EEG-based BCI systems via the fusion of network science and BLS.},

  abstract     = {We propose to employ evidential reasoning (ER) rule to construct a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to aid physicians to predict the probability of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital death for trauma patients once they arrive at a hospital. A generalized Bayesian rule is used to mine evidence from historical data. Evidence is profiled using a format of belief distribution, where the belief degrees of different trauma outcomes are assigned with derived probabilities linked to the corresponding outcomes. Inputs to the CDSS are clinical data of a patient, and output from the system is predicted belief degree of severe trauma, including ICU admission and in-hospital death. The inner logic of the CDSS is that pieces of evidence that match the clinical data of a patient are identified from the evidence base first, and then the ER rule-based evidence aggregation mechanism is utilized to combine the matched evidences to arrive at a prediction. The reliability, weight, and interdependence of clinical evidence are taken into account. Moreover, an evidence weight training module is constructed. The ER rule-based prediction model has superior performance compared with logistic regression and artificial neural network models. An innovative and pragmatic ER rule-based CDSS for trauma outcome prediction is contributed by this article. In the era of big data, this CDSS helps predict patient outcomes based on historical data and helps physicians in emergency departments make proper trauma management decisions.},

Most recent feature extraction methods are based on the deep neural networks and show good performances. However, these methods require rendering engine to assist in generating a large amount of training data, which need much time to converge and further lead to the block in a rapid industrial production line. Besides, for the common hand-crafted features, the lack of discriminant feature-points amongst various texture-less and surface-smooth objects can cause ambiguity in the process of feature-points matching. To address these challenges above, a hand-crafted 3-D feature descriptor with center offset and pose annotations is proposed in this article, which is called view-specific local projection statistics (VSLPSs). By relying on these annotations as seeds, a voting strategy is then used to transform the feature-points matching problem into the problem of voting an optimal model-view in the 6-DOF space. In this way, the ambiguity of feature-points matching caused by poor feature discrimination is eliminated. To the end, various experiments on three public datasets and our built 3-D bin-picking dataset demonstrate that our proposed VSLPS method performs well in comparison with the state-of-the-art.},

Different from the existing DOBPF method where disturbance estimation is achieved via the Kalman filter, the disturbance observer adopted in this article is in the form of variational Bayesian adaptive Kalman filter (VBAKF) which deals with the inaccurate process noise covariance matrices in both the dynamic models of the state and the ATVU. Compared with conventional PF approaches, the proposed method, named VBAKF-PF, exhibits enhanced robustness against both the ATVU in the state transition equation and the uncertainties of process noise covariance matrices.

The communication delays are taken into account, which commonly occur during the estimation exchanges among the sensor nodes with communication links. A new prediction-based suboptimal distributed filter is designed by taking the missing probabilities and the prediction estimation into account, which has the advantages on the active compensation of the impacts caused by the missing measurements and communication delays. That is, a new compensation filtering method within the time-varying framework is presented based on the predictive estimation and the innovation measurements. A locally minimum upper bound matrix for the estimation error covariance is obtained by properly designing the distributed filter gain at every sampling step. Furthermore, the performance analysis problem of the prediction-based distributed filtering algorithm is discussed by providing the desirable theoretical derivations.

Also, with the help of the structural characteristics of RBF NNs, the violation between the nontsrict-feedback form and backstepping method is tackled.

Based on the existing results of the adaptive protocol using relative output information, a modified robust nonlinear adaptive consensus protocol for MAs is proposed. The Lipschitz nonlinearity in the agents’ dynamics and the adaptive protocol are reformulated using a composite linear parameter-varying (LPV) approach. Our composite LPV reformulation is less restrictive because it utilizes all the properties of Lipschitz functions. Consensus protocol design conditions based on the proposed reformulation of Lipschitz nonlinearities, Lyapunov theory, and the modified nonlinear consensus protocol are derived to attain the exponential consensus. The proposed consensus protocol approach is further extended by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the straightforward evaluation of the robust adaptive protocol gains. The proposed fully distributed consensus protocol is robust to ensure the consensus error and adaptive gains bounded by eliminating the effect of disturbances. The resultant consensus control scheme reduces conservatism and is feasible for large values of Lipschitz constants. Finally, simulation results are presented for verifying the potency of the developed control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Referred to as the RQ-CEASE, this article proposes a resilient framework for quantized, event-triggered (ET), sampled-data, average consensus in multiagent systems subject to denial of service (DoS) attacks. The DoS attacks typically attempt to block the measurement and communication channels in the network. Two different ET approaches are considered in RQ-CEASE based on whether the ET threshold is dependent or independent of the state dynamics. For each approach, we analytically derive operating conditions (bounds) for the sampling period and ET design parameter guaranteeing the input-to-state stability (ISS) of the network under DoS attacks. In addition, upper bounds for duration and frequency of DoS attacks are derived within which the network remains operational. For each approach, the maximum possible error from the average consensus value is derived. The resilience of the two RQ-CEASE approaches to DoS attacks, as well as their steady-state consensus error, and transmission savings are compared both analytically and using simulations.},

  abstract     = {Today, many mobile apps (MAs) act as an efficient channel for e-tailers to sell products. In addition to selling, some of these apps even include e-payment functions. This creates e-payment convenience but also a concern on privacy. In this article, we consider a supply chain with an e-tailer which sells through such an MA and an online website. The two channels influence the demand of one another. In the basic model, the e-tailer decides the promotion efforts in both channels. We interestingly find that the optimal promotion efforts are independent of e-payment convenience and privacy concern. We analytically establish that profit-sharing contract and two-part-tariff contract can coordinate the dual channel supply chain system but not revenue-sharing contract or sales rebate contract. In the extended models, we first consider the case when the e-tailer makes product pricing as well as promotion efforts decisions together. We analytically derive the optimal solution and find that the optimal pricing and promotion efforts depend on e-payment convenience and privacy concern. We further extend the analyses to the case when the e-tailer is risk averse and uncover that: 1) when the retail selling price is exogenously given, the optimal promotion efforts between the risk-neutral and risk-averse e-tailers are the same and 2) when the retail selling price is endogenous, the corresponding optimal retail selling prices and promotion efforts between the risk-neutral and risk-averse e-tailers are different. In particular, a higher degree of risk aversion will lead to higher (lower) promotion efforts and a higher (lower) retail selling price if demand volatility is sufficiently large (small).},

Considering the particular requirement that output of systems should be constrained in some practical working fields, we further design adaptive fuzzy full-state and output-feedback control schemes with output constraint to ensure that output maintains in constrained regions. By applying the Lyapunov theory, it is guaranteed that closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Tangent-type barrier Lyapunov function is used for the controller design with output constraint and ensure stability.

  abstract     = {Path tracking control of intelligent vehicles has to deal with the difficulties of model uncertainties and nonlinearities. As a class of adaptive optimal control methods, reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in solving difficult control problems. However, feature representation and online learning ability are two major problems to be solved for learning control of uncertain dynamic systems. In this article, we propose a multi-kernel online RL approach for path tracking control of intelligent vehicles. In the proposed approach, a multiple kernel feature learning framework is designed for online learning control based on dual heuristic programming (DHP) and the new online learning control algorithm is called multi-kernel DHP (MKDHP). In MKDHP, instead of the expert knowledge for selecting and fine-tuning of a suitable kernel function, only a set of basic kernel functions is required to be predefined and the multi-kernel features can be learned for value function approximation in the critic. The simulation studies on path tracking control for intelligent vehicles have been conducted under $S$ -curve and urban road conditions. The results demonstrated that compared with other typical path tracking controllers for intelligent vehicles, such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), the pure pursuit controller and the ribbon-based controller, the proposed multi-kernel learning controller can achieve better performance in terms of tracking precision and smoothness.},

MBSE offers approaches that can address issues associated with cost, complexity, and safety. One way that this can be achieved is by performing early functional validation of the high-level spacecraft functional avionics system. The use case discussed in this article focusses on the Biomass model, a systems modeling language-based representation of the Biomass Earth-observation mission. The MBSE approach is used to calculate the required size of the data handling unit onboard the Biomass spacecraft. The functional response of the system in terms of the onboard memory usage throughout the mission is simulated. Traditionally, this level of analysis would not be available at this early stage. The approach aims to replace ad hoc, spreadsheet-based calculations with a formal representation of the system that can be executed, interrogated and quantified. The flexibility of this MBSE approach is demonstrated by applying changes to the Biomass project and assessing the time required to implement these changes in the Biomass model and propagate them through to the results of the simulation. The changes have been made independently of each other and include: changes to the logical architecture, changes to the functional definition, changes to the mission profile, and changes to the requirements. Potential areas for improvement regarding the structure of the Biomass model are highlighted and discussed.},

By means of an incidence matrix, the consensus under the relative state saturations is transformed into the stability of edge dynamics operating on constrained sets. To enable the edge states to stay within the constrained sets, a novel nonlinear protocol is designed by embedding an elaborate saturation function. Sufficient conditions are identified, under which not only consensus is achieved but also relative state saturations do not occur.

It has two major benefits. First, both classification and variable selection could be realized, the highly correlated features tend to be selected or removed together. Second, by using feature screening and sample screening rule alternatively rather than using each of them individually, our MFSS-DKSVCR can delete more redundant features and samples before the training stage. Hence, the solving speed is improved a lot. And our MFSS-DKSVCR is safe in the sense that the solutions obtained from the reduced problem and original problem are identical. Besides, a fast algorithm SDCA is used to solve the problem more efficiently.

The stochastic deception attack is considered in the procedure of propagating measurement information among agents. To solve the consensus control problem for addressed MASs under stochastic deception attacks, a definition of quasi-consensus is put forward. The objective of our investigation is to devise a consensus protocol to drive all agents to stay within an allowable range despite the existence of stochasticity and external malicious attacks. With the help of recursive linear matrix inequality and stochastic analysis methods, sufficient conditions are acquired to guarantee that all agents are constrained in the desirable range. Subsequently, an optimization algorithm is presented, which is to seek the locally optimal allowable distance among agents. Finally, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the availability of our proposed algorithm.},

It contains two types of attacks in contested environments, one of which is an attack on the sensor or actuator of followers, called Attack type I. Another attack on communication networks is Attack type II. Solving the time-varying output formation tracking problem is divided into two steps. The first step is to design the compensation control signal to realize formation problem and the second step is to design the optimal control law to realize the tracking problem. Assuming that the state of leader is unknown, a novel resilient observer is first designed to estimate the state of leader for each follower, as well as compensate the effect of Attack type II.

  abstract     = {A kind of facilities for wafer fabrication, cluster tools (CTs) need to close down to an idle state from time to time because of periodical maintenance and switches from one type of lots to another, which is called a normal close-down process (NCDP). It is crucial to optimize such a transient process since it tends to occur more and more frequently due to customization. Also, process modules (PMs) in CTs are known to be failure-prone. Once a PM failure occurs, a tool needs to close down to an idle state as well, which is different from NCDP and is called a failure close-down process (FCDP). With wafer residency time constraints (WRTCs) being imposed, close-down process optimization for such a tool is challenging, since one needs to not only finish this process as soon as possible but also meet WRTCs during this transient process. In order to tackle this problem, this article first introduces steady state scheduling problems. Then, with a presented backward robot task sequence, a linear programming model is first proposed to optimize NCDP. To deal with the PM failures, efficient PM failure response policies are formulated for the cases in which a PM fails. Then, four linear programs are proposed to optimize an FCDP. Finally, industrial case studies are given to show the usefulness of the proposed approaches.},

The stability of the rumor-free equilibrium of the rumor-truth propagation system is analyzed and conditions to reach uniform asymptotic stability as well as global exponential stability are obtained. For the endemic case, the conditions under which rumor would persist uniformly are obtained. An optimal hybrid control problem is formulated to address the tradeoff between restraining rumor and minimizing the cost of control.

Specifically, at the first step, without considering the external disturbance, a global finite-time state feedback controller is proposed to dominate uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the second-order system. To address the more challenging case where only the system output is available, a novel design idea of the nonseparation principle is employed. By treating the unknown external disturbance as a generalized state, a finite-time convergent extended state observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasured state and the unknown external disturbance. Based on this observer, an output-based composite controller with finite-time convergence is developed. The global uniform finite-time stability of the overall closed-loop system is proven based on the Lyapunov method. Simulation results of the inverted pendulum system demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control method in terms of both convergence performance and disturbance rejection performance.},

Qualitative analysis is first given for a general form of such cross-coupling systems, indicating the necessity of CDN. The analysis and control design principle of CDN is then exemplified through two applications. A numerical linear application produces abundant quantitative results through the powerful transfer function and frequency domain tools. A more complex nonlinear flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicle application shows how conventional compensation deteriorates the couplings between rigid and flexible modes, and validates the effectiveness of CDN through comprehensive model analysis and simulation results. The proposed CDN design principle also arouses awareness of the importance of: 1) understanding the characteristics of the plant to be controlled and 2) recognizing the critical role the information plays in engineering practice.},

Then, a novel observer-based bipartite control scheme is developed on the basis of two event-triggering mechanisms. One is designed for the communication between neighbors and another is for controller updates. Different from the existing methods, the proposed control strategy does not need continuous updates, avoids continuous communication between neighbors, and is applicable for the signed communication topology. Moreover, we extend the results from the bipartite leaderless consensus to the bipartite leader-following consensus and the bipartite containment consensus.

However, this mechanism is inefficient to regulate the exploration and exploitation search. This article first analyzes the main factors that influence the performance of BSO and then proposes an orthogonal learning framework to improve its learning mechanism. In this framework, two orthogonal design (OD) engines (i.e., exploration OD engine and exploitation OD engine) are introduced to discover and utilize useful search experiences for performance improvements. In addition, a pool of auxiliary transmission vectors with different features is maintained and their biases are also balanced by the OD decision mechanism. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified on a set of benchmarks and is adopted to resolve the quantitative association rule mining problem considering the support, confidence, comprehensibility, and netconf. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is very powerful in optimizing complex functions. It not only outperforms previous versions of the BSO algorithm but also outperforms several famous OD-based algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the quasi-synchronization problem of delayed memristive neural networks (MNNs) via hybrid event-triggered control. First, a hybrid event-triggering mechanism with a novel threshold function is devised. Therein, an exponential decay term and a non-negative constant term are additionally introduced. It can further extend the time span between two successively triggered events and therefore can reduce the amount of triggering times in comparison with some existing event-triggering mechanisms. Then, by constructing a time-dependent and piecewise Lyapunov functional, a less conservative criterion for quasi-synchronization of drive-response delayed MNNs is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. In addition, an explicit expression of the error bound is provided and the design of the feedback gain is presented for a predetermined error bound. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the advantages of the proposed event-triggering scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem of vehicle active suspension is concerned in the discrete-time domain, in which the road disturbances and faults in actuator and measurement are considered. The main contribution consists of proposing an active physically realizable fault-tolerant controller based on a reduced-order observer, which makes up an optimal vibration control component and an event-triggered FTC component. More specifically, by discussing a discrete vehicle active suspension subject to road disturbances generated from the output of a designed exosystem, the optimal vibration control component is derived from maximum principle to offset the inevitable vibrations. Meanwhile, based on the real-time system output of vehicle suspension rather than residual error, a reduced-order observer is proposed to cover the physically unrealizable problem for the designed optimal vibration control component. After that, an event-triggered FTC component and an event-triggered restructured system output are designed to compensate the faults in actuator and measurement, respectively. Finally, extensive experiments are conduced to the control performance of vehicle active suspension under the proposed controller, and confirm its effectiveness and superiority over other control schemes.},

Two common actuator faults: 1) loss of effectiveness and 2) increased bias input, are considered simultaneously. The fuzzy tracking control system is first established by incorporating the integral term of the output tracking error. Then, an appropriate fuzzy integral switching surface is designed such that the corresponding sliding motion only suffers from the unamplified unmatched disturbance. The solution of the nominal tracking controller can be transformed into a to convex optimization problem. In particular, an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode tracking controller is synthesized to ensure the accessibility of the sliding motion despite the effect of actuator faults and unknown disturbances. Finally, the proposed tracking strategy is verified by applying it to the dynamic positioning control of unmanned marine vehicles.},

The considered SMJSs are ruled by Markov jump switching and deterministic switching simultaneously. The deterministic switching follows the persistent dwell time (PDT) switching which is more general than the dwell time (DT) switching and the average DT (ADT) switching. To tackle the difficulties caused by PDT switching, a new method is constructed by restricting the deterministic switching frequency into a suitable range. First, the detailed parameter analyzing is presented because the general measure parameter is unable to describe the dynamic characteristic of SMJSs with PDT switching. Second, the switching rule is established on account of the restricted switching frequency. Two sufficient conditions are further proposed to ensure the EAS-stability of SMJSs with all stable subsystems and SMJSs containing unstable subsystems, respectively. A numerical example and a fault-prone system model are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

In this article, we propose a special neural model, which combines the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the feedforward NNs. The stochastic RBM learns the input–output probability distributions. The feedforward NN learns the dynamics of nonlinear systems. For the input–output probability distributions, we give the calculation methods of their conditional and joint probabilities. The approximation abilities of this neural model are analyzed. We use two nonlinear systems to compare our guaranteed probability distribution method with the other black-box identification methods.

Owing to its application potential and promising performance in discovering the optimal solution, the PSO algorithm has been recognized as a powerful optimization technique and attracted an ever-increasing interest in the evolutionary computation community. In this article, a novel $N$ -state Markovian jumping PSO (NS-MJPSO) algorithm is presented where the velocity updating equation is adjusted based on the state evolution governed by a Markov chain.

By representing the coupling features of the target states in the measurements as a directed graph, a modified Kalman consensus filter (KCF) is proposed for a target-dependent augmented system whose state vector consists of in-going neighborhood targets. To analyze the performance of the modified KCF in a directed graph, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the boundedness of the estimation errors in the mean square sense.

A novel prescribed performance control strategy together with an actuator update protocol is developed to form a solution. Different from the existing results, only a binary signal (either 0 or 1) needs to be sent to the actuator. In this way, the number and the bit of data transmission are both curtailed, leading to the economy of the communication cost. On the other hand, output tracking with guaranteed transient and steady-state performance is achieved regardless of unknown nonlinearities, disturbances, and measurement errors.

  abstract     = {In this article, the stability issues are addressed for switched linear systems (SLSs) with mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT). By dividing the dwell time into several segments, and constructing a reverse timer which starts timing at the end of each segment, we propose a new reverse-timer-dependent multiple discontinuous Lyapunov function (RTDMDLF), which is more general than the multiple Lyapunov function (MLF) and the multiple discontinuous Lyapunov function (MDLF). With the help of the RTDMDLF approach, several convex and nonconvex stability conditions are derived for SLSs with both stable and unstable subsystems, and the relation of these conditions and existing ones is revealed. Moreover, the stability conditions for SLSs with all stable subsystems are also given. All the results are presented in terms of infinite-dimensional linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be relaxed into computable conditions by using a discretized approach. It is shown that the tighter bound of MDADT can be achieved by the RTDMDLF approach compared with those of the literature. Finally, the advantages of the results are illustrated within three numerical examples.},

Then a novel mathematical model for T-S fuzzy systems with multiple cyber-attacks and AETM is proposed first.

In this article, we present a novel robotic fish platform with a camera stabilizing system and achieve real-time two-dimensional target tracking assisted by reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous environments. More specifically, we first develop an active visual tracking system based on cascade control structure to obtain the relative orientation between the robotic fish and the underwater target. Then, we propose a target tracking controller dealing with continuous state and action spaces based on deep RL (DRL). The controller takes the position of the target object as input and yields the motion parameters of the bioinspired central pattern generator governed robotic fish. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed controller as well as the influence of time-delays on the control system are explored via simulated experiments under different scenarios. Finally, both static and dynamic tracking experiments on the actual robotic fish demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechatronic design and control methods, providing insights to executing aquatic vision-based tracking tasks.},

A two-player continuous-time system is used to present this approximate mechanism, which is implemented as a critic-actor architecture for every player. The constraint is incorporated into this optimization by introducing the nonquadratic value function, and the associated constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation is derived. The critic neural network (NN) and actor NN are utilized to learn the value function and the optimal control policy, respectively, in the light of novel weight tuning laws. In order to tackle the stability during the learning phase, two stable operators are designed for two actors.

For this scenario, a defense strategy dependent on the received innovation is proposed to identify the occurring attacks as far as possible. In light of identified attacks, a novel distributed filter is constructed and its gain is designed via a set of recursive formulas on the upper bound of covariance of filtering errors. The utilization of upper bound is to avoid the calculational challenge of cross-covariance matrices and realize the requirement of distributed implementation, simultaneously. Furthermore, the developed scheme only depends on the neighboring information and the information from the subsystem itself, and thereby satisfying the requirement of the scalability.

The main idea of the existing consensus strategies for strict-feedback nonlinear MASs with unknown control directions is leading agents toward predefined global leaders/exosystems. However, in several missions, agents need to reach autonomous agreement on an a priori unknown quantity for a desired state, and hence the existing results are not applicable in these missions. The main contribution of this article is designing an adaptive leaderless consensus control scheme for strict-feedback nonlinear MASs when agents&#39; control directions are unknown and unidentical. First, we introduce decentralized local error surfaces designed based on each agent position and neighboring agents&#39; positions. We show that as the error surfaces remain bounded and converge to zero, the boundedness of the agents&#39; positions and achieving leaderless consensus in the MAS can be guaranteed. Then, based on the properties of the Nussbaum-type functions, a decentralized backstepping adaptive control law is proposed under which the local error surfaces remain bounded and converge to zero. Finally, the design is more clarified and evaluated via an example.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a model-based hybrid adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework consisting of continuous feedback-based policy evaluation and policy improvement steps as well as an intermittent policy implementation procedure. This results in an intermittent ADP with a quantifiable performance and guaranteed closed-loop stability of the equilibrium point. To investigate the effect of aperiodic sampling on the communication bandwidth and the control performance of the intermittent ADP algorithms, we use a Hamiltonian-driven unified framework. With such a framework, it is shown that there is a tradeoff between the communication burden and the control performance. We finally show that the developed policies exhibit Zeno-free behaviors. Simulation examples show the efficiency of the proposed framework along with quantifiable comparisons of the policies with different intermittent information.},

Because of the affected by model uncertainty, time-varying parameter, pavement roughness excitation, etc., the study of suspension systems can be regarded as the multivariable nonlinear control problem. First of all, the prescribed performance function (PPF) is applied to constrain the displacement and pitch angle of the suspension systems to ensure the transient and steady-state suspension responses. Second, an integral terminal sliding mode control method with strong robustness is put forward, which can make the system converge rapidly in a finite-time when it is far from the equilibrium point, solve the singularity problem in the control process, and reduce the chattering phenomenon in the traditional sliding mode control. Then, the neural networks (NNs) approximation characteristics are used to deal with unknown items in the design of the controller, and the Lyapunov stability theory is employed to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system. In the end, the comparative simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Based on the neighbors’ information, a new distributed continuous-time optimization algorithm (DCTOA) is first proposed for each agent, where its gradient gains are nonuniform. By introducing a scaling factor and a model transformation, the corresponding system is changed into a time-varying nonlinear system which does not contain constraint operator in form.

  abstract     = {Monitoring various types of disasters involves diversified requirements, such as the spectral band, resolution, and timeliness. However, at present, different types of observation platforms are separately operated. This isolated resource organization model is insufficient to meet the requirements of various Earth-observation tasks, especially when disasters occur. As a result, it is necessary to construct an Earth-observation network that contains space-air-ground observation resources and makes unified task planning for the included heterogeneous resources, such that the efficiency of the entire observation system is maximized. In this article, an architecture with two planning phases is proposed for the coordinated planning of heterogeneous Earth-observation resources, in which area targets and four types of space-air-ground observation resources [i.e., satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), airships, and ground monitoring vehicles] are considered. The two-phase approach in this architecture includes an area target decomposition phase and a task allocation phase. In the first phase, an area target hierarchical decomposition (ATHD) method is proposed to decompose the area targets into subtasks. In the second phase, a task conflict heuristic allocation (TCHA) method is proposed to allocate the decomposed subtasks to subplanning centers. Extensive experiments on simulated and realistic scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ATHD and TCHA methods. The computational results show that the ATHD method substantially improves the efficiency of the coordinated task planning process. Moreover, compared with traditional task allocation methods, the TCHA method could produce high-quality observation plans for the Earth-observation network, as it brings complementary benefits via the comprehensive usage of heterogeneous space-air-ground resources.},

The challenges behind these tasks involve how to realize the accurate and real-time garbage detection, how to resist the disturbances while IWSCR conducts vision-based steering, and how to grasp the floating garbage reliably despite the turbulent conditions on the surface of the water. To overcome these difficulties, three key techniques are proposed for IWSCR. First, the YOLOv3 network, which is widely applied in the high speed and accuracy object detection field, is trained on the proposed floating garbage dataset to realize accurate and real-time garbage detection. Next, to improve the ability of resisting disturbances, a control law based on the sliding-mode controller is proposed for vision-based steering. Furthermore, inspired by the stability of floating bottles in fluid, a feasible grasping strategy is utilized for IWSCR. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that IWSCR is competent to carry out the task of water surface cleaning.},

By exploiting the parallel distributed compensation strategy and the output of disturbance observer, the desired fuzzy rule-based control law is formulated.

A novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism is put forward to schedule the interagent communication. It removes the assumption that each agent has to broadcast continuously, and therefore resource consumption is reduced significantly. Different from the existing event-triggered mechanisms, the proposed mechanism involves internal dynamic variables that play an important role in excluding Zeno behavior. Then, an event-based distributed control protocol is developed by using locally triggering data. It is proven that the leader-following consensus is achieved under our control strategy. Moreover, the criterion for designing a desired triggered mechanism and the control protocol is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy is capable of reducing communication more effectively than the existing results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we concentrate on dealing with the distributed optimization problem over a directed network, where each unit possesses its own convex cost function and the principal target is to minimize a global cost function (formulated by the average of all local cost functions) while obeying the network connectivity structure. Most of the existing methods, such as push-sum strategy, have eliminated the unbalancedness induced by the directed network via utilizing column-stochastic weights, which may be infeasible if the distributed implementation requires each unit to gain access to (at least) its out-degree information. In contrast, to be suitable for the directed networks with row-stochastic weights, we propose a new directed distributed Nesterov-like gradient tracking algorithm, named as D-DNGT, that incorporates the gradient tracking into the distributed Nesterov method with momentum terms and employs nonuniform step-sizes. D-DNGT extends a number of outstanding consensus algorithms over strongly connected directed networks. The implementation of D-DNGT is straightforward if each unit locally chooses a suitable step-size and privately regulates the weights on information that acquires from in-neighbors. If the largest step-size and the maximum momentum coefficient are positive and small sufficiently, we can prove that D-DNGT converges linearly to the optimal solution provided that the cost functions are smooth and strongly convex. We provide numerical experiments to confirm the findings in this article and contrast D-DNGT with recently proposed distributed optimization approaches.},

Percolation on networks is a potent instrument for network robustness analysis. However, existing percolation theories are primarily developed for interdependent or multilayer networks. Little attention is paid to multipartite networks which are an indispensable part of complex networks. In this article, we theoretically explore the robustness of multipartite networks under node failures. We put forward the generic percolation theory for gauging the robustness of multipartite networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Our developed theory is capable of quantifying the robustness of multipartite networks under either random or target node attacks. Our theory unravels the second order phase transition phenomenon for multipartite networks. In order to verify the correctness of the proposed theory, simulations on computer generated multipartite networks have been carried out.

  abstract     = {Community evolution remains a heavily researched and challenging area in the analysis of dynamic complex network structures. Currently, the primary limitation of traditional event-based approaches for community evolution analysis is the lack of strict constraint conditions for distinguishing evolutionary events, which entails that as the cardinality of discovered events increases, so does the number of redundant events. Another limitation of existing approaches is the lack of consideration for weak events. Weak events can be generated by small changes in communities, which are empirically prevalent, and are typically not captured by traditional events. To manage these two aforementioned limitations, this research aims to formalize a weak and strong events-based framework, which includes the following newly discovered events: “weak shrink,” “weak expand,” “weak merge,” and “weak splity” predicated on the community overlapping degree and community degree membership, this article refines these traditional strong events, as well as new constraints for weak events. In addition, a community evolution mining framework, which is based on both strong and weak events, is proposed and denoted by a weak-event-based community evolution method (WECEM). The framework can be summarized by the following: 1) communities in complex networks with adjacent time-stamps are compared to determine the community overlapping degree and community membership degree; 2) the values of the community overlapping degree and membership degree meet the definition of events; and 3) weak events are effectively identified. Extensive experimental results, on real and synthetic data sets consisting of dynamic complex networks and online social networks, demonstrate that WECEM is able to identify weak events more effectively than traditional frameworks. Specifically, WECEM outperforms traditional frameworks by 22.9\% in the number of discovered strong events. The detection accuracy of evolutionary events is approximately 12.2\% higher than that of traditional event-based frameworks. It is also worth noting that, as the cardinality of the data grows, the proposed framework, when compared with traditional frameworks, can more effectively, and efficiently, mine large-scale complex networks.},

As the main contribution of this article, an effective strategy of seeking a distributed optimal protocol is proposed for second-order agents over the digraph of the directed tree. Detailedly, the feasibility of distributed optimal protocol is first affirmed, that is, the existence of optimal gain parameters can be guaranteed. Then, by recursively deriving the completely explicit formulas of the consensus errors of relative position and velocity, an online implementable algorithm is developed to achieve the parameterization of the cost functional, that is, to obtain the explicit formula of the cost functional with respect to gain parameters of all agents. Lastly, the desired optimal gain parameters are obtained by minimizing the explicit formula.},

Under the proposed ETM, the average data-releasing rate over the whole operating period can be extremely decreased, thereby reducing the burden of network bandwidth, computation, and battery-supply. Moreover, during the system with external disturbance or attack on the communication network, more transmission-events can be generated than other periods. As a result, the desired control performance can be achieved. By using stochastic analysis techniques and Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are derived to obtain both the controller gains and the parameters of the ETM. Numerical simulation of chemical reactor systems is given to illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed theories and design techniques.},

Both the communication network connecting these two layers and the cyber communication network within the cyber layer may subject to malicious DoS attacks. These two types of attacks have different impacts on the networked system; the former one affects the timely update of control inputs, and the latter influences the connection weights of the cyber communication graph. First, for DoS signals occurring in the communication network which transmits the state and control input information between the two layers, the distributed control protocol based on the event-triggered scheme and locally deployed estimators are designed. Efficient algorithms for selecting event-triggered control parameters and Zeno-free triggered parameters are given to ensure the mean-square consensus. The relationships between the system&#39;s parameters and the features of DoS attacks are successfully revealed. Second, corresponding theoretical analysis is derived for consensus tracking of the networked systems when DoS attacks are launched within the cyber layer. Conditions concerning the length of repairing time and indexes of DoS attacks are given by utilizing hybrid control theory.

In light of stochastic analysis, the desired filter gain, achieving the suboptimality of filtering performance, is obtained recursively by solving two optimization issues with the form of Riccati-like difference equations. With the help of the fashionable weighted fusion conception combined with the well-known law of large numbers, a recursive estimation of process noise covariance is derived step by step and consequently suits for online computation.

The general harmony degree (GHD) is defined to determine the before/after feedback difference between the original and revised opinions. It is proved that the GHD index is monotonically decreasing with respect to the feedback parameter, which means that higher parameter values will result in higher changes of opinions. An optimization model is built with the GHD as the objective function and the consensus thresholds as constraints, with the solution being personalized feedback advices to the inconsistent experts that keep a balance between consensus (group aim) and independence (individual aim). This approach is, therefore, more reasonable than the unpersonalized feedback mechanisms in which the inconsistent experts are forced to adopt feedback generated with only consensus target without considering the extent of the changes acceptable by individual experts. Furthermore, the following interesting theoretical results are also proved: 1) the personalized feedback mechanism guarantees that the increase of consensus level after feedback advices are implemented; 2) the GHD by the personalized feedback mechanism is higher than that of the unpersonalized one; and 3) the personalized feedback mechanism generalizes the unpersonalized one as it is proved the latter is a particular type of the former.

The considered problem can be solved by two procedures: 1) timetabling and 2) sequencing. The timetabling is to translate a given job sequence into a feasible schedule that satisfies the deadlock-free and no-wait constraints. A novel timetabling algorithm based on the controlled PN model is then proposed for solving it. The goal of sequencing is to find a job sequence so that the makespan of the corresponding schedule is the minimum. To this end, a hybrid heuristic search (HHS) is developed by combining the A* algorithm and dynamic window. Two new heuristic functions are designed to guide the search, and the dynamic window is used to limit the searched space. The performance of HHS with different heuristic functions and deadlock controllers is evaluated by ten instances. The computational results demonstrate that through the proposed approach, optimal or suboptimal feasible schedules can be obtained within a reasonable time.},

This article presents a system for studying dynamic emotions in human-computer interaction from the perspective of emotional transfer and guidance. Based on the emotional state of the interlocutor and the distribution of emotional transfer, the process of emotional transfer is simulated and sampled, and the sequence of emotional guidance is generated. In this system, two algorithms are proposed. A generative Markov chain Monte Carlo (GEN-MCMC) algorithm is proposed to generate a variety of emotional transfer sequences that fit the talke’s personality dynamically based on the real-world dialog. Further, a guiding MCMC (GUI-MCMC) algorithm-based GEN-MCMC is proposed to generate the emotional guiding sequences. The generated emotional sequences by GEN-MCMC were evaluated in two aspects: 1) consistency and 2) diversity. The experimental results show that the GEN-MCMC algorithm performs better than the general sequence generation algorithm in terms of consistency and diversity in generating emotional states. The GUI-MCMC was able to generate a proper stimulus sequence when given the first and target emotions. An emotional stimulus sequence can simulate the emotional transfer of the interlocutor in the process of dialogue, and give the observer appropriate reference to guide and control the emotions of dialogue. The experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively model the dynamic emotion in emotional transfer and guidance, which can be further used to build chat robots, intelligent assistants, and human–machine interaction systems. The models can also be used for emotional induction and enhance the feel-good or feel-terrible factor in human–machine communication applications, such as medical treatment of mental diseases, interrogation, and psychological attack and defense.},

  abstract     = {The hexapod manipulator is the most common motion platform, which is widely used as a simulation-based motion platform (SBMP). As the hexapod manipulator has a limited workspace, it is not physically possible to regenerate the real vehicle motion signals using the SBMP. The motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is responsible for regenerating a realistic vehicle motion sensation for the user when the SBMP operates within its physical and dynamical limitations. Recently, model predictive control (MPC) has been introduced to extract the optimal input motion signals while considering the SBMP limitations in the Cartesian coordinate space, which leads to a linear time-invariant (LTI) MPC-based MCA methods. Unfortunately, the existing LTI MPC-based MCA methods are still not able to consider the parameters of the SBMP&#39;s hexapod mechanisms inside their models. In general, the current studies only consider the constraints in the Cartesian coordinate system of the hexapod mechanism, instead of its design parameters. This consideration results in a poor usage of the hexapod workspace due to the conservative assumptions; consequently, the SBMP users do not experience realistic motions. The main contribution of this article is to take the SBMP&#39;s physical limitations into account in the MPC model such that more precise motion cues can be extracted for the users. A linear time-varying (LTV) MPC-based MCA method is designed for the first time in this article to consider the parameters of the hexapod mechanism in the MPC model. The proposed model (LTV MPC-based MCA) is validated using the MATLAB software, and the results depict better motion sensation with more accurate motion signals as compared with those from the existing LTI MPC-based MCA methods.},

In this article, two cost functionals with some delay-dependent matrices are introduced, respectively, for the two types of time delays. In order to obtain less conservative conditions, a novel inequality on quadratic polynomial functions is established, which includes some existing ones as its special cases. Based on the novel inequality, two sufficient conditions are derived to design the terminal weighting matrices of the cost functionals such that the resulting synchronization error system can be stabilized with a prescribed infinite horizon H ∞ performance level.

Feature extraction methods can effectively extract features from high-dimensional data sets and enhance the accuracy of tasks. However, the performance of feature extraction methods is not stable in low-dimensional data sets. This article extends the broad learning system (BLS) to a framework for constructing robust representations in low-dimensional and small data sets. First, the BLS changed from a supervised prediction method to an ensemble feature extraction method. Second, feature extraction methods instead of random mapping are used to generate mapped features. Third, deep representations, called enhancement features, are learned from the ensemble mapped features. Fourth, data for generating mapped features and enhancement features can be randomly selected. The ensemble of mapped features and enhancement features can provide robust representations to enhance the performance of downstream tasks. A label-based autoencoder (LA) is embedded in the BLS framework as an example to show the effectiveness of the framework. A random LA (RLA) is presented to generate more different features. The experimental results show that the BLS framework can construct robust representations and significantly promote the performance of machine learning models.},

And the explicit conditions that can realize consensus tracking are established in terms of parametric Lyapunov equations and scalar inequalities. Besides, the protocol design algorithms under the maximum allowable delay and the maximum convergence rate are, respectively, provided. Compared with the existing results, the salient characteristic of the current results is to reveal the quantitative relationship among the time delay, unstable plant, network topologies, and the convergence rate. Specifically, for achieving the consensus tracking, the synchronization force from network connectivity needs to dominate the anti-synchronization force from unstable open-loop poles and input delays; the maximum allowable input delay is inversely proportional to the sum of the unstable open-loop poles; the convergence rate becomes smaller as the input delay bounds or/and the sum of the unstable poles in plant increase.

To prevent DoS attacks from causing open-loop unstable operation of the system with single-channel transmission, we present a primary-redundancy (PR) communication structure on the basis of limited bandwidth allocation; the correlation of communication delay bound between PR channels is introduced. To save the limited bandwidth, we propose a dynamic the event-triggered mechanism (DETM). Then, a switched delay system model is established to describe system dynamic driven by primary channel control, redundancy channel control, and unstable operation under DoS attacks. Further, by using the convex combination method, a switching law for PR channel is designed with the aim of keeping the concealment of the redundancy channel. With the switching law, a criterion of exponential stability is obtained by using piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method. A co-design method is proposed to obtain feedback control gains, DETM parameters and switching law parameters. Finally, two simulation examples are illustrated to verify the validness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {TCP provides the principal framework for the Internet traffic control. Following the protocol development, however, the communicating parties have not benefitted from the potential of multiple interfaces, now commonly installed at the end-point devices. In order to grasp new opportunities, a multipath version of TCP - multipath TCP (MPTCP) - has recently been introduced. It permits the simultaneous use of a few, diverse interfaces for enhancing the user experience. This article provides a discrete-time model of the data exchange process in the MPTCP framework and new flow control algorithms. The algorithms, applicable to the paths with nonhomogenous properties with respect to delays, loss rate, etc., are designed following the rules of discrete sliding-mode control (DSMC). As a result, direct implementation in discrete networking context and robust transmission system performance are guaranteed in uncertain operating conditions. It is formally demonstrated that a finite data queue length in the end-point buffers and a feasible (non-negative and bounded) input signal are ensured despite input and output perturbations affecting the control process. It is also shown that the classical DSMC design approach results in decreased performance for unanticipated surge in the intensity of network-related perturbations. A second, improved algorithm, with a well-chosen sliding variable, eliminates this drawback.},

Two filters with extended states in each follower are designed with the idea of extended state observer to reconstruct the states of the transformed MAS. Then, uncertainties of the MAS are compensated with the help of the estimations of the extended states. Moreover, the derivative of the virtual control signal in the backstepping technique is replaced by a tracking differentiator (TD), overcoming the so-called “explosion of complexity” problem.

This article focuses on the problem of customizing a dynamic quarantine and recovery (QAR) scheme for an organization so that the APT impact is minimized. Based on a novel node-level epidemic model characterizing the effect of the QAR scheme on the expected state of the underlying network, we estimate the expected impact of APT under a QAR scheme. On this basis, we model the original problem as an optimal control problem. By use of optimal control theory, we derive the optimality system for the optimal control problem and thereby introduce the concept of normal potential optimal (NPO) control. Next, through comparative experiments, we find that the NPO control outperforms a set of heuristic controls. Hence, the QAR scheme associated with the NPO control is satisfactory in terms of the effectiveness of defending against APT. Finally, we examine the effect of some factors on the expected APT impact under the NPO control. This article would be helpful to the defense against APT for cyber espionage.},

To reduce the complexity of candidate models, eTL-P constructs a monotone submodular function, which facilitates to select Top- ${K}$ models from all available candidate models based on their representativeness in terms of behavioral coverage as well as reward diversity. eTL-P also integrates social selection mechanisms for agents to identify their better-performing partners, thus improving their learning performance and reducing the complexity of behavior prediction by reusing useful knowledge with respect to their partners’ mind universes.

  abstract     = {In this article, robust and convergent properties of iterative learning control (ILC) laws are investigated for two kinds of two-dimensional (2-D) linear discrete systems (LDS) in the second Fornasini-Marchesini&#39;s model (FMMII). The iteration-dependent uncertainties in reference trajectories, boundary states, and disturbances are considered in the ILC designs of 2-D FMMII. By virtue of the lifting matrix/vector technique, the ILC processes of two kinds of 2-D FMMII are transformed into 2-D linear inequalities. As a result, robust and convergent conditions are obtained for the proposed ILC laws. It is theoretically proved that by using the proposed ILC laws, under the discussed iteration-dependent uncertainties, the ILC tracking errors of 2-D FMMII can be driven into a residual range, the bound of which is relevant to the bound parameters of uncertainties. In particular, when the iteration-dependent uncertainties of 2-D FMMII are progressively convergent in iteration domain, an accurate tracking to the desired reference trajectory can be realized except at the boundaries. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the designed ILC laws.},

An automatic inspection system is built that adopts an endoscope to improve the imaging quality. To detect the low contrast targets in complex background, we adopt the pipeline of Faster R-CNN but with several improvements. The improved network specifies the targets in the form of quadrangular bounding box as opposed to previous methods that specify them by rectangular bounding box. With the quadrangular representation, additional shape and pose information is provided and unexpected overlaps and background disturbance could be avoided. In the network, an eight-dimensional (8-D) vector is designed to represent the quadrangular bounding box followed by the improved anchor mechanism in the region proposal network. And also, a novel overlap score calculation method is proposed. On the basis of the detection result, rules arisen from expertise are provided to determine the quality of the component in which way automatic quality inspection could be accomplished. The superiority of our detection network over existing ones is sufficiently demonstrated with the detection result of irregular targets in images captured in the industrial scenario. Meanwhile, successful inspection result proves that the system meets the industrial requirements in terms of both accuracy and speed and thus is of practical significance to industrial applications.},

By introducing the mean value theorem, the considered CSTR is decomposed to nonlinear systems (NSs) with pure-feedback structure. To deal with time-varying output constraint, tangent barrier Lyapunov function (TBLF) is applied in the adaptive finite-time controller design process. The closed-loop system stability can be identified by the presented adaptive finite-time control approach with the TBLF.

For improvement, a lightweight multiscale multipath ensemble CNN (MSME-CNN) is proposed. First, the shallow-layer and deep-layer convolution output features are directly concatenated to form a multipath ensemble mode, which can not only avoid gradient vanishing but also fuse the multilayer features. In addition, each path of the network is composed of multiscale low-rank convolution kernels in parallel. This structure can extract multiscale features of the input and improve the feature extraction ability of the network. Meanwhile, the convolution kernel low-rank approximation can effectively compress the model complexity. Furthermore, the proposed sparse connection mechanism of the convolution kernel helps to reduce the complexity, so that higher classification accuracy can be obtained with less parameters and computational load. Finally, the linear sparse bottleneck structure is used to fuse multiscale features and compress the convolution channel, which further improves the network performance. Experiments of four commonly used image recognition datasets verify the superiority of MSME-CNN to several baseline models.},

Through incorporating a compound orthogonal neural network (CONN) into the design process of the modified extended state observer (MESO), the NMESO is developed to estimate the uncertainties in the DP control system, such as the environmental disturbances and the unknown dynamics, as well as the thruster faults simultaneously without knowing any prior information of them. With the help of the accurate estimation of the total uncertainties by NMESO, a PD-like feedback controller is established to realize the FTC of the DP vessel toward the thruster faults. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that all the error signals in the closed-loop cascade system formed by the NMESO and PD-like feedback controller are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and the bounds could be arbitrarily small by choosing appropriate parameters. Simulation experiments on two typical thruster fault scenarios are carried out to validate the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed NMESO-FTC compared with the conventional ESO-FTC. The simulation results show the proposed approach has better fault-tolerant performance.},

The proposed MOEA divides the optimization process into multiple stages according to the population in each generation, and updates the population by different steady-state selection schemes in different stages.

On the whole, the FTTC policy is constructed by the reduced-order estimator, tracking error feedback, double signal compensation, and optimal predictive regulation (PR). In specific, a novel reduced-order estimator is first designed to provide the state and fault information. Then, an unconstrained robust tracking error feedback control is designed to stabilize the LPV systems.

Although several SLR methodologies have been proposed, the development of a real-world SLR system is still a very challenging task. One of the main challenges is related to the large intersigner variability that exists in the manual signing process of sign languages. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network that explicitly models highly discriminative signer-independent latent representations from the input data. The key idea of our model is to learn a distribution over latent representations, conditionally independent of signer identity. Accordingly, the learned latent representations will preserve as much information as possible about the signs, and discard signer-specific traits that are irrelevant for recognition. By imposing such regularization in the representation space, the result is a truly signer-independent model which is robust to different and new test signers. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in several SLR databases.},

To deal with more complicated non-Gaussian noises such as noises from multimodal distributions, in this article, we develop a new Kalman-type filter, called minimum error entropy KF (MEE-KF), by using the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion instead of the MMSE or MCC. Similar to the MCC-based KFs, the proposed filter is also an online algorithm with the recursive process, in which the propagation equations are used to give prior estimates of the state and covariance matrix, and a fixed-point algorithm is used to update the posterior estimates. In addition, the MEE extended KF (MEE-EKF) is also developed for performance improvement in the nonlinear situations. The high accuracy and strong robustness of MEE-KF and MEE-EKF are confirmed by experimental results.},

  abstract     = {A distributed optimization problem (DOP) with affine equality and convex inequality constraints is studied in this article. First, the consensus constraint of the considered DOP is relaxed and a related approximate DOP (ADOP) is presented. It is proved that the optimal solutions of the ADOP (i.e., the near-optimal solutions of the original DOP) are able to approach the optimal solutions of the original DOP. A continuous-time algorithm is proposed for the ADOP and it is demonstrated that the state solution of the presented algorithm converges to the critical point set of the ADOP with general locally Lipschitz continuous objective functions. This means the presented algorithm is efficient for distributed nonconvex optimization problems. Particularly, when the objective functions are convex ones, the state solution of the presented algorithm is further proved to converge to a near-optimal solution of the original DOP. One illustrative example and an application on load sharing problems are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this article, a novel complex network (CN) based broad learning system (CNBLS) is proposed to realize an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based fatigue detection. First, a simulated driving experiment was conducted to obtain EEG recordings in alert and fatigue state. Then, the CN theory is applied to facilitate the broad learning system (BLS) for realizing an EEG-based fatigue detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNBLS can accurately differentiate the fatigue state from an alert state with high stability. In addition, the performances of the four existing methods are compared with the results of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms these existing methods. In comparison to directly using EEG signals as the input of BLS, CNBLS can sharply improve the detection results. These results demonstrate that it is feasible to apply BLS in classifying EEG signals by means of CN theory. Also, the proposed method enriches the EEG analysis methods.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world scenarios, extrinsic rewards provided by the environment are sparse. An agent trained with classic reinforcement learning algorithm fails to explore these environments in a sufficient and effective way. To address this problem, the exploration bonus which derives from environmental novelty serves as intrinsic motivation for the agent. In recent years, curiosity-driven exploration is a mainstream approach to describe environmental novelty through prediction errors of dynamics models. Due to the expressive ability limitations of curiosity-based environmental novelty and the difficulty of finding appropriate feature space, most curiosity-driven exploration methods have the problem of overprotection against repetition. This problem can reduce the efficiency of exploration and lead the agent into a trap with local optimality. In this article, we propose a combination of persisting curiosity and temporary curiosity framework to deal with the problem of overprotection against repetition. We introduce the self-attention mechanism from the field of computer vision and propose a sequence-based self-attention mechanism for temporary curiosity generation. We compare our framework with some previous exploration methods in hard-exploration environments, provide a series of comprehensive analysis of the proposed framework and investigate the effect of the individual components of our method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework delivers superior performance than existing methods.},

The state updates at the fast rate while sensors uniformly sample at positive integer multiples of the state updating period. Different sensors may have different sampling rates. The system noise and measurement noises are auto- and cross-correlated at the same instant. The phenomenon of PDs randomly occurs during data transmission from a sensor to a data processor through unreliable networks. A recent developed compensation strategy that a predictor of a lost packet is employed as a compensator is adopted to optimize the tracking process. First, an optimal linear local filter (LF) for each sensor at measurement sampling points (MSPs) is presented by using an innovation analysis approach. Then, a local estimator (LE) at state updating points (SUPs) is proposed by filtering or prediction based on the LF at MSPs. Furthermore, estimation error cross-covariance matrices (CCMs) between arbitrary two LEs at SUPs are deduced, which can recursively be calculated by three joint difference equations. Finally, a distributed fusion filter (DFF) weighted by matrices in the sense of linear unbiased minimum variance (LUMV) is addressed. Period steady-state (PSS) property of the LEs, CCMs, and DFF is proved. A simulation example verifies the effectiveness of algorithms.},

A multiple spatial pairwise local co-occurrence descriptor is proposed to improve the calculation of the similarities between pores. It calculates multiple local co-occurrence statistics for each pore using its neighbors. The proposed method can establish correspondences between pores more accurately. The refinement of the correspondences is then achieved by using a local topology-preserving matching algorithm. The algorithm uses rotational invariant local structures and pore pair local topology similarities to calculate the cost of each correspondence. It can remove the mismatches more accurately and efficiently.

One major advantage of the proposed inverse S-T model is that only the system output is utilized, without any state measurement.

  abstract     = {We introduce a new configuration of a robust and adaptive autopilot system for a model-scale flapping-wing aircraft. The system is specifically designed to achieve high performance flapping angle tracking in the face of large uncertainties. To describe the dynamics of the system, we leverage the benefits of both first principle modeling and data-driven approach (system identification technique). We introduce a high-performance robust and adaptive nonlinear control system by means of a feedback linearization (FL) technique, supported with an interval Type-2 fuzzy system due to its ability to accommodate the footprint-of-uncertainties (FoUs). While the first stage of our nonlinear control system is to cancel some predictable nonlinearities using an FL technique, the second phase of control is to accommodate the existing uncertainties in the system by way of an interval Type-2 fuzzy control technique, e.g., due to imperfect cancelation and modeling errors. This way, the stability and the robustness of the closed-loop control system can be guaranteed. We quantify the relative merit of our hybrid control system with respect to an FL technique, supported with a fixed gain state feedback controller and a Type-1 fuzzy system. Lastly, we also conduct stability analysis of the overall closed-loop control system.},

  abstract     = {Joint-drift problems could result in failures in executing task or even damage robots in actual applications and different schemes have been presented to deal with such a knotty problem. However, in these existing schemes, there exists the coupling in coefficients for eliminating the drift in the joint space and the equality constraint for completing the given task in the Cartesian space, thereby, theoretically, leading to a paradox in achieving zero joint drift in the joint space and zero position error in the Cartesian space simultaneously. A novel joint-drift-free (JDF) scheme synthesized by a projected zeroing neural network (PZNN) model for the motion generation and control of redundant robot manipulators perturbed by disturbances is proposed and analyzed in this article. Besides, the PZNN model could adopt saturated or even nonconvex projection functions. The proposed scheme completely decouples the interferences of joint errors in the joint space and position errors in the Cartesian space for the first time. Beyond that, theoretical analysis is conducted in order to validate that the PZNN model is of global convergence to the theoretical kinematics solution to the motion generation of robots, and that the joint-drift problems are thus remedied. Moreover, several simulations and physical experiments on the strength of different robot manipulators are carried out to confirm the superiority, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed JDF scheme synthesized by the PZNN model for remedying joint-drift problems of redundant robot manipulators in noisy environments.},

However, both techniques have to face the limitation of asynchronization attack, which will cause the pseudonym ID and one-time hash chain value between participants to be loss of synchronization when the transmitted message is blocked. Most recently, a serial of lightweight anonymous authentication scheme with forward secrecy (LAASFS) have been built to resolve this problem. Unfortunately, they failed to handle this question satisfactorily. Besides, most of them are still vulnerable to smart card loss attack (SCLA). In this article, to address these issues and make more effective, we combine pseudonym ID, one-time hash chain and tag techniques to construct an LAASFS for WSNs environment. The proposed LAASFS can be adaptive resilience of asynchronization attacks. In addition, it is also able to resist a variety of known attacks like SCLA and wrong password login attack. Formal analyses are taken by BAN logic and ProVerif tool to demonstrate the security of properties of our LAASFS. Compared with several previous related schemes, the proposed LAASFS possesses obvious advantages in computation and communication costs.},

In-cloud Android malware detection often suffers privacy leakage and communication overheads. Therefore, this article focuses on on-device Android malware detection. At present, on-device malware detectors are usually trained on servers and then transplanted to mobile devices (e.g., smartphones). In practice, on-device training is particularly important due to the demand for offline updates. Because mobile devices are limited in resource, however, on-device training is hard to implement, especially for those high-complexity malware detectors. To overcome this challenge, we design a lightweight on-device Android malware detector, based on the recently proposed broad learning method. Our detector mainly uses one-shot computation for model training. Hence it can be fully or incrementally trained directly on mobile devices. As far as detection accuracy is concerned, our detector outperforms the shallow learning-based models, including support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost, and approaches the deep learning-based models multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Moreover, our detector is more robust to adversarial examples than the existing detectors, and its robustness can be further improved through on-device model retraining. Finally, its advantages are confirmed by extensive experiments, and its practicality is demonstrated through runtime evaluation on smartphones.},

The novel projection plane is adaptively changed with the light intensity change to eliminate the color distortion induced by motion. In this article, the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation Deeplabv3+ is implemented to segment the skin pixels from the facial region that is detected by several trackers (Boosting, MIL, TLD, Median Flow, Mosse, and CSRT) to boost the computational time compared to the conventional face detection by Haar-Like features. Image and digital signal processing techniques are also applied to eliminate possible noise for obtaining a clean pulse signal. The proposed approach is compared with other existing approaches (Green, PCA, Chrom, and POS) in multiple challenges. From the experiments conducted, the Deeplabv3+ outperforms the conventional K-means for different kinds of skin segmentation. Moreover, the proposed approach is quite robust and stable in the stationary case (with the accuracy 96\%), dim-lighting environment and the long-distance up to 4-m away without zooming in camera. Besides, multiple head-movement simulations and motions of fitness are conquered by the APP approach as shown in the experiments. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed approach is applicable to surveillance or healthcare applications.},

In the system, the system state uniformly updates and the measurement is randomly sampled. Packet losses induced by unreliable networks from a controller to an actuator and from a sensor to an estimator under the TCP protocol are tackled by employing two independent Bernoulli distributed stochastic variables. A state space model (SSM) at successfully received measurement sampling (SRMS) points is developed under the condition of known sampling time. Using an innovation analysis approach, a recursive nonaugmented optimal estimator is proposed in the linear minimum variance (LMV) sense. It can obtain state estimates at state update (SU) points and SRMS points. In addition, for multisensor systems, a centralized fusion estimator by reordering measurement data from sensors and a suboptimal distributed covariance intersection fusion estimator are proposed, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through an example.},

Local filter-driven approximators are designed to compensate for unknown nonaffine nonlinear functions lumped in the local controller design procedure where the first-order filtered signals of the error surfaces, state variables, and control inputs are linearly combined for the design of the filter-driven approximators. A containment control scheme using the filter-driven function approximators is recursively constructed to ensure that the outputs of the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by multiple time-varying leaders. Compared with existing containment control results using adaptive neural-network-based or fuzzy-based approximators, the proposed FDA-based containment control scheme depends only on the relative output information among agents and does not require any adaptive techniques. Thus, the proposed control structure can be simplified. It is shown that the closed-loop signals, including approximation errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded.

  abstract     = {In a multidomain application environment, it is of paramount importance for different organizations to collaborate with each other to facilitate secure interoperation. However, various types of conflicts related to access control constraints may arise as a result of integrating access control policies for individual domains, such as role inheritance violations (RIVs) and separation of duty violations (SoDVs). Current methods solve the conflicts in a centralized way by withdrawing or removing all crossdomain relationships resulting in the violations with the knowledge of all domains. However, these methods are inappropriate for large-scale systems due to their high computational complexity. In this article, we propose a distributed approach to avoid secure conflicts in a multidomain environment. We first model the role inheritance hierarchies of multiple domains as an interoperation graph. We then develop RIVs and SoDVs avoidance algorithms based on the interoperation graph and the communications among different domains. Each domain can execute the algorithms autonomously and in real time by evaluating whether its succeeding activated role can result in RIVs and SoDVs. We show that the new algorithms perform well in contrast to the existing algorithms.},

In particular, by using a fuzzy logic system to approximate unknown nonlinearity and by introducing fault estimators to estimate actuator/sensor faults, a novel distributed fuzzy formation controller is developed. By virtue of introducing a modification technique in adaptive law, the phenomenon of strictly increase in adaptive law caused by actuator/sensor faults and unknown nonlinearity can be avoided.

Our attention is focused on designing a fuzzy-model-based finite-time SMC law to attenuate the influences of uncertainty, nonlinear term, and external disturbance during the finite-time region. First, a novel integral sliding-mode surface is proposed based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rule. Then, by using the key point of Lyapunov function theory, an appropriate fuzzy SMC law is designed to make sure that the signal variables can arrive at a domain within the assigned fixed-time level. Moreover, some new IO-FTS criteria are constructed for the resulting sliding dynamics over the whole finite-time level, including reaching phase and sliding motion phase.

By integrating the neural network approximation technique with two error transformations, a neuroadaptive fault-tolerant control strategy is developed with two attractive features: 1) it is capable of coping with the scenario that some of the actuators suffer from extreme actuation faults without the need for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD)/fault detection and isolation (FDI) or actuator switching and 2) the tracking error is forced to converge to a prescribed residual (symmetric or asymmetric) boundary at a preassignable decay mode within a prechosen finite settling time despite actuator failures and external disturbances.

  abstract     = {Solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) is a challenging task since it is necessary to optimize several conflicting objective functions and handle various constraints simultaneously. A promising way to solve CMOPs is to integrate multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with constraint-handling techniques, and the resultant algorithms are called constrained MOEAs (CMOEAs). At present, many attempts have been made to combine dominance-based and decomposition-based MOEAs with diverse constraint-handling techniques together. However, for another main branch of MOEAs, i.e., indicator-based MOEAs, almost no effort has been devoted to extending them for solving CMOPs. In this article, we make the first study on the possibility and rationality of combining indicator-based MOEAs with constraint-handling techniques together. Afterward, we develop an indicator-based CMOEA framework which can combine indicator-based MOEAs with constraint-handling techniques conveniently. Based on the proposed framework, nine indicator-based CMOEAs are developed. Systemic experiments have been conducted on 19 widely used constrained multiobjective optimization test functions to identify the characteristics of these nine indicator-based CMOEAs. The experimental results suggest that both indicator-based MOEAs and constraint-handing techniques play very important roles in the performance of indicator-based CMOEAs. Some practical suggestions are also given about how to select appropriate indicator-based CMOEAs. Besides, we select a superior approach from these nine indicator-based CMOEAs and compare its performance with five state-of-the-art CMOEAs. The comparison results suggest that the selected indicator-based CMOEA can obtain quite competitive performance. It is thus believed that this article would encourage researchers to pay more attention to indicator-based CMOEAs in the future.},

Moreover, it is more sensitive to the change of environments. In this article, a novel image-sequence-based framework for place detection and recognition is proposed. Rather than a single frame image, a place is represented by an image sequence in this article. Position invariant robust feature (PIRF) descriptors are extracted from images and processed by the incremental bag-of-words (BoWs) for feature extraction. The robot automatically partitions the sequentially acquired images into different image sequences according to the change of the environmental appearance. Then, the echo state network (ESN) is applied to model each image sequence. The resultant states of the ESN are used as features of the corresponding image sequence for place recognition. The proposed method is evaluated on two public datasets. Experimental comparisons with the FAB-MAP 2.0 and SeqSLAM are conducted. Finally, a real-world experiment on place recognition with a mobile robot is performed to further verify the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Predictor-based control has been widely used to compensate input delays. However, the conventional predictors such as Smith predictor, usually have poor robustness with respect to system disturbances. In this article, a novel robust predictive scheme, that can achieve exact state prediction in finite-time, is proposed for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to input delay and unmatched sinusoidal disturbances. By combining the super-twisting technique with the proposed predictive scheme, we also propose a new predictor-based output-feedback super-twisting controller which can compensate arbitrary long input delay and eliminate the effect of unmatched disturbances from the corresponding state completely. The simulation comparison shows the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Therefore, this article considers to develop an asynchronous controller for a class of two-dimensional continuous-time MJSs. The relation of the plant’s mode and the controller’s mode is modeled by the hidden Markov model, i.e., the plant’s mode influences the controller’s transitions in a conditional probabilistic style. By defining a vector Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition for mean-square exponential stability and ( $\mathcal U$ , $\mathcal R$ , $\mathcal S$ )- $\varepsilon $ dissipativity is derived, whose feasible solutions give birth to a desired asynchronous controller. Finally, the influence of conditional probabilities on dissipativity performance is further studied through simulations.},

The robust integral of the sign of error (RISE) control strategy is proposed to achieve the lane-keeping control purpose with rollover prevention, by guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, attenuating systematic disturbances, and maintaining the controlled states within the prescribed performance boundaries. Three contributions have been made in this article: 1) a new prescribed performance function (PPF) that does not require accurate initial errors is proposed to guarantee the tracking errors restricted within the predefined asymptotic boundaries; 2) a modified neural network (NN) estimator which requires fewer adaptively updated parameters is proposed to approximate the unknown vertical dynamics; and 3) the improved RISE control based on PPF is proposed to achieve the integrated control objective, which analytically guarantees both the controller continuity and closed-loop system asymptotic stability by integrating the signum error function. The overall system stability is proved with the Lyapunov function. The controller effectiveness and robustness are finally verified by comparative simulations using two representative driving maneuvers, based on the high-fidelity CarSim-Simulink simulation.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the problem of stabilizing a scalar continuous-time nonlinear system under bounded network delay and process noise. In order to save the feedback network’s bandwidth, a model-based periodic event-triggered control policy is utilized to maintain longer intersampling intervals, which are at least as long as the sampling period of periodic policies. Furthermore, the event-triggering condition is only checked intermittently at fixed time instants, i.e., the sampling time instants. Without acknowledgment (ACK), the updating of nominal models at the sensor and at the controller are asynchronous. The two cases, where the network delay is either less than the sampling period or larger than the sampling period, are investigated. In comparison with periodic sampling methods, our scheme can make full use of the received data packets, particularly their sampling time instant information, which yields a lower occupied bit rate while guaranteeing the desired input-to-state stability. Note that the obtained bit rate conditions are only related to the Lipschitz parameter, the bound of network delay, the number of quantization bits, and the sampling period. The bounded process noise will not incur any increase of the stabilizing bit rate under the proposed strategy.},

Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is utilized to remedy with the output limitation constraints. By combining the fixed-time control and switching techniques, and choosing the appropriate symmetric Lyapunov function, the control algorithm of fixed-time stabilization is designed guaranteeing that the closed-loop system state trajectories tend to zero in a fixed time and meanwhile not going beyond the preset operating range in the control process. The adaptive tracking control law is proposed by using the asymmetric BLF and adaptive control technologies. Under the adaptive controller, the output constraints are also achieved, and the tracking errors are adaptively converge to steady zero states, respectively, while keeping all the signals bounded in the control process.

Second, the convergence rate of the identification algorithm is proved to be $O(1/t)$ and it depends on the true parameter instead of a priori information of the parameter, which is more intuitive. Due to the convergence and the convergence rate of the identification algorithm, we finally prove that the adaptive tracking control is asymptotically optimal and the tracking speed is faster than the previous control algorithm.

And for these algorithms, it is still difficult to achieve a satisfactory tradeoff among precision, computational complexity, robustness to network types, and scalability to network size. In this article, we propose a chaotic ant colony optimized (CACO) link prediction algorithm, which integrates the chaotic perturbation model and ant colony optimization. The extensive experiments on a wide variety of unweighted and weighted networks show that the proposed algorithm CACO achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy and robustness than most of the state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that the chaotic ant colony effectively takes advantage of the fact that most real networks possess the transmission capacity and provides a new perspective for future link prediction research.},

A novel distributed algorithm is proposed over time-varying unbalanced directed networks based on epigraph form of the original optimization problem and consensus theory. By incorporating the random sleep scheme, the proposed algorithm allows each agent to independently and randomly decide whether to calculate subgradient and take projection at each iteration, which alleviates the cost of subgradient observation. Besides, it neither resorts to doubly stochastic weight matrices (but only row-stochastic) nor the information of the graph sequence to execute. The convergence of the algorithm is explicitly analyzed under conditions that the sequence of time-varying directed graphs is uniformly jointly strongly connected and the subgradients of all local objective functions are bounded over a convex set. The optimization algorithm ensures zero-gap on the expected distance between the estimated value of each agent and the exact optimal solution. The two simulation cases are presented to demonstrate the practicability of the algorithm and correctness of the obtained theoretical results.},

We innovatively reformulate the object search into an IPP problem, which takes account of the knowledge of possible target object locations. To model the target object distribution knowledge, the semantic information of the focused environment is utilized to obtain the probabilities of finding the target object at possible locations. Then, the probability distribution is modeled by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to generate an information map. Based on the map, a sampling-based IPP method is proposed to minimize the object search cost. It is worth noting that the object search path is planned with a tree structure and evaluated by a utility function that concerns both search information gain and path cost. Moreover, to improve the quality of the search path, a novel informative sampling strategy and a rewire mechanism are conceived. The performance of the proposed object search framework is fully evaluated through both simulation experiments and real-world tests with a mobile robot platform. Results demonstrated that our method can find the target object efficiently and robustly with shorter path length than three comparative methods in the literature and the mobile robot shows human-like behavior when searching for the target object.},

First, distance metric learning is proved to be consistent with rank-reduced regression, which provides a new perspective to learn structured regularization matrices. Second, orthogonal and non-negative rank-reduced regression problems are addressed individually for clustering, and the corresponding algorithms with proved convergence are proposed. Finally, both distance metric learning and clustering are addressed simultaneously in the problem formulation, which may trigger some new insights for learning an effective clustering oriented low-dimensional embedding. To show the superior performance of the proposed method, we compare it with several state-of-the-art clustering approaches. And, extensive experiments on the test datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

However, the corresponding theory for singular systems, especially singular fractional-order systems (SFOSs), is lacking. Therefore, many control problems for this type of systems cannot be optimized in limited frequency ranges. In this article, a universal framework of the finite frequency band generalized Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma for SFOSs is established, the bounded real lemma in the sense of the ${L_{\infty }}$ -norm is derived for different frequency ranges, and the corresponding controller is designed to improve the ${L_{\infty } }$ performance index of SFOSs.

The DLMPC inherits the stability and robustness of the extended state observer (ESO)-based auxiliary control law and invokes online optimization to improve formation tracking performance of the multi-AUV system. The closed-loop stability of the multi-AUV system is guaranteed by the stability constraint that utilizes the ESO-based auxiliary controller and the associated Lyapunov function. Furthermore, the inter-AUV collision avoidance can be achieved by incorporating well-designed artificial potential fields-based cost term in the formation tracking cost function. Extensive simulations on the Saab Falcon AUVs are carried out, demonstrating the superior control performance and robustness of the proposed method.},

This is different from unsigned networks involving only cooperations, of which behavior analysis can be feasibly achieved based on the nonnegative matrix theory. With these facts, this article first bridges a relation between signed and unsigned networks and then takes advantage of the relation for the behavior analysis of signed networks under directed switching topologies. In particular, a solution is provided for the connection of signed and unsigned networks via solving a class of linear dynamic systems, which is obtained by separating antagonisms from cooperations. The solution makes it possible to employ the convergence results for unsigned networks to address the convergence issues for signed networks. If the joint spanning tree condition is met, then switching signed networks can achieve the quasi-interval bipartite consensus. Moreover, the established results can be applied to signed networks with both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics.},

By modeling the unknown inputs with a noninformative prior distribution, a local minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is derived in the Bayesian framework.

Each agent in the network possesses only its private local objective function, and the sum of all local objective functions constitutes the global objective function. We particularly consider the scenario, where the underlying interaction network is strongly connected and the relevant weight matrix is row stochastic. To collectively figure out the optimization problem, a distributed accelerated convergence algorithm where agents utilize uncoordinated step-sizes is presented by incorporating consensus of multiagent networks into distributed inexact gradient tracking technique. Most of the existing methods require all agents to possess the out-degree information of their in-neighbors, which is impractical and hardly inevitable as interpreted in this article. By utilizing the small-gain theorem, we prove that if the maximum step-size is positive and sufficiently small (constrained by a specific upper bound), the proposed algorithm, termed as SGT-FROST, converges geometrically to the optimal solution given that the objective functions are smooth and strongly convex. A certain convergence rate is also shown. Simulations confirm the findings in this article.},

  abstract     = {It remains a challenging problem for data classification without training patterns. In many applications, there may exist some labeled data in other related domains (called source domain), and such labeled data can be helpful to solve the classification problem in the target domain. It is considered that the source domain and target domain are heterogeneous here and they represent the distinct feature spaces. A new transfer classification method for heterogeneous data is proposed based on the evidence theory. Some pattern pairs in the source domain and target domain are given to predict the link of these two domains. For each pattern in the target domain, we estimate its possible mapping value in the source domain using these pattern pairs with a self-organizing map (SOM) technique, and then the mapping value is classified using the labeled data in the source domain. However, the patterns with close values in the target domain may have more or less different values in the source domain due to the distinct characteristics of these two domains. So the mapping value can be very uncertain sometimes. In such a case, the target pattern is allowed to have multiple mapping values with different weights/reliabilities in the source domain. These mapping values can produce different classification results. The evidence theory is good at characterizing and combining uncertain information. In order to improve the classification accuracy, a new evidence-based weighted fusion method is developed for combining these classification results, which are discounted by the corresponding weights under the belief functions framework, and the final class decision is made according to the combination result. In experimental applications, some heterogeneous remote sensing data and UCI data are used to test the performance of new method with respect to several other methods, and it shows that the new method can efficiently improve the classification accuracy.},

Many researchers have studied the reliability modeling and optimization of LMCCSs. However, most of the existing works on LMCCSs have focused on the uncertainty in connection ranges of CEs; none of them have considered signal loss during the transmission. In practice, a signal emitted from a node may neither completely reach nor completely not reach the destination node. In other words, only a fraction of the signal may reach the destination node whereas the rest is lost. This article makes new contributions by proposing a model that evaluates the expected signal fraction receivable by the sink node in an LMCCS subject to signal loss. Moreover, we solve the optimal design policy problem, which co-determines CEs allocation and nodes building to minimize the system cost while meeting certain constraints on system reliability and expected receivable signal fraction.

Then, observer-based finite-time guidance laws using the information of neighbors are designed based on a containment scheme. An artificial potential field is incorporated into the distributed guidance law design to avoid collision and preserve connectivity. Finally, antidisturbance kinetic control laws are devised based on the finite-time convergent observers and nonlinear tracking differentiators.

  abstract     = {Generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) are a class of state specifications on Petri nets (PNs). They are generally enforced on the nets by a simple control structure called control places (monitors). Unfortunately, this conventional procedure is implemented in an offline and monolithic manner, which suffers from computational difficulty and is arduous for the control of a system in real time. Additionally, the flexibility and fault tolerance of such a method are somewhat unacceptable, and the method suffers from a lack of adaptability to net variations incurred by system reconfiguration, communication failure, and constraint integration. This article aims to enforce GMECs for a live PN model by using critical places and marking estimation. First, we define GMECs on some so-called critical places, such that the satisfaction of the GMECs can be determined by only monitoring the number of tokens in their corresponding critical places during runtime. Then, an efficient and effective control strategy is developed such that the controllers forbid all those transition firings that lead to the violated GMECs based on the estimated markings of critical places derived by observers from a resource perspective rather than exploring the markings of the entire system.

For the whole system, impedance control is developed for coordinated robots. The notable feature is that the robot-environment interaction performance is improved without any information about the environment, so that the robotic system follows the commanded position trajectory in noncontact phase, while the desired destination is obtained according to the force exerted on the environment during contact phase. Moreover, based on assumption that some system signals are unmeasurable, output feedback control is designed for coordinated robot systems, where a state observer based on neural network technique is designed, that can force the state estimate error converge to a small neighborhood of zero. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

First, a descriptor learning SMO, without the observability condition of fast subsystem, is developed such that the reconstruction of fault and states is achieved, simultaneously. Then, a sufficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition is presented to guarantee the admissibility of the sliding motion. Meanwhile, the LMI condition ensures the boundedness of the state and fault estimation errors. By utilizing robust H ∞ strategy, the impact of disturbance on the system can be reduced. Moreover, an RBF neural network-based sliding-mode control (SMC) strategy is adopted to estimate the nonlinearity, unknown positive constants, and ensure the reachability condition, simultaneously.

A control-separation LQ design has the specific desired functions for output regulation and failure compensation as well, and is applied and analyzed for solving the persistent actuator failure compensation problem. Both nominal control design for system known and adaptive control design for system unknown are developed. The desired control performance is ensured by a robust adaptive control technique and is fully characterized in terms of a small in the mean output regulation, that is, the mean value of the system output is bounded by the average number of actuator failures over time and the average actuator failure value. Such desired system performance is shown by a complete analytical study and demonstrated by an illustrative simulation study.},

  abstract     = {This article concerns studies on finite-time systems (FTSs), which are expected for high-level system synthesis. An FTS usually obeys an attracting law (AL), under which the dynamics of the FTS is governed. This article probes into the analysis of finite-duration convergence of the power-rate ALs, and especially on the estimation for the bound of their settling time functions, without selecting the transition state to be one. It is shown that the settling time is a function of the initial state, and the value of the function varies with the initial state. The existence of the upper bound of the function assures that the duration over which the settling time varies is finite with respect to the initial state. The estimate depends on the transition state, revealing that the bound on the settling time cannot be determined by a certain value, as different transition states are chosen. The optimal transition state in certain sense is acquired in this article, and the comparison is made between the existing estimation and the optimal one. Furthermore, we concern ourselves with the two-phase AL (TPAL) also without fixing the transition state, for which we are able to give an accurate bound of its settling time function. To illustrate the usefulness of the TPAL, we present a finite-duration learning control approach which utilizes the merits of the exiting control methods in coping with both time-varying parametric and nonparametric uncertainties.},

However, CDP always prefers constraints to objectives, which tends to cause premature convergence. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new CHT on the basis of CDP. In our CHT, the fitness function of each solution is defined as the weighted sum of two rankings: one is the solution&#39;s ranking based on CDP and the other is the solution&#39;s ranking based on Pareto dominance (i.e., without considering any constraints). It is evident that these two rankings favor the “feasibility” and “optimality” of each solution, respectively. More importantly, the weight employed in the fitness function is related to the proportion of feasible solutions in the current population, enabling the population to adaptively balance constraints and objectives in the evolutionary process. The effectiveness of our CHT is evaluated on three test suites and the experimental results demonstrate that our CHT shows better or highly competitive performance compared with other representative CHTs.},

  abstract     = {As a newly emerging multivariate statistical process monitoring method, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and its variants avoid the positive and negative cancellations between the extracted features because of the purely additive combination of non-negative components. Thus, they make a good match with this reality that the negative values of both observations and decomposed components are physically meaningless in many kinds of industrial processes. However, these methods are effective only for linearly separable problems and are not suitable for dealing with nonlinear process monitoring. In this article, the kernel-based method is integrated into the projective NMF (KPNMF) to improve the accuracy of fault detection, and the appropriate multiplicative update method is proven to be convergent. Furthermore, inspired by the false nearest neighbors (FNNs) method, a new dimensionality reduction approach (KPNMF-FNN) is presented to further reduce the original variables for determining the smallest dimension regression vector needed. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed approach can greatly reduce the time and storage space required on the premise of maintaining a high fault detection rate and low false alarm rate. The experimental results on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process and the pumping unit system show that the proposed algorithms have excellent performance and can effectively detect faults under the circumstances of retaining only the top 60\% of the original variables.},

Such Lyapunov function results in a novel adaptive law with time-varying adaptive gains, as opposed to state-of-the-art laws with fixed positive adaptive gains.

The case with continuous communication is first considered, a distributed proportional integral + reset consensus protocol is proposed, which consists of the proportional-integral controller and the reset mechanism. The results are further generalized to the case with asynchronous sampling, which relaxes the requirement for continuous communication and clock synchronization. A hybrid model of the MAS is constructed to describe the system dynamics, and a hybrid systems approach is proposed to handle the reset- and sampling-induced jump dynamics in a unified framework. Moreover, a novel Lyapunov function is proposed and LMI-based stability conditions are given. Finally, an example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Evidential reasoning (ER) rule has been widely used in addressing uncertainty, ignorance, and vagueness information. To explore its performance measure (PM), the perturbation analysis (PA) for the ER rule (ER rule-PA) is conducted, with perturbation taken into consideration. This article aims to analyze the robustness and stability of the ER rule, serving as theoretical basis and technical support for applied research and applications. The combination of two pieces of independent evidence is discussed, and perturbation is added to one piece of evidence. To represent the expected utility of evidence combination under perturbation, perturbation utility is introduced. The novel concept of perturbation coefficient is proposed to characterize the PM of the ER rule (ER rule-PM). The properties of perturbation coefficient are explored to demonstrate the impact of perturbation. The maximum permissible error (MPE) of perturbation coefficient is defined to characterize the acceptability of perturbation. A numerical study is examined to illustrate the implementation process of ER rule-PA. Moreover, a case study of reliability evaluation of aerospace relay is conducted to show the potential applications of ER rule-PA, which makes the proposed method more practical.},

A distributed integral sliding mode (ISM) and a fixed-time convergent command filter are introduced. The performance of nominal dynamics is dominated by the nominal control part which ensures the fixed-time convergence in the ISM surface. The discontinuous sliding mode or continuous super-twisting-like part related to the ISM is utilized to compensate disturbances within fixed convergence time. In this article, we have designed the continuous fixed-time consensus tracking controllers which can eliminate the chattering phenomenon and simultaneously guarantee the convergence precision. Independent of any initial state values, the restrictive bound of the convergence time is estimated. Some fair comparisons are performed to demonstrate the merits of the proposed strategies.},

Several researchers have addressed the smooth path planning problem and the sample-based integrated path planning techniques. We believe that the main benefits of the proposed approach are: directly drivable path, no additional post-optimization tasks, reduced search branching, low computational complexity, and completeness guarantee. Several examples and comparisons with the state-of-the-art planners are provided to illustrate and evaluate the main advantages of the HE* algorithm. HE* yields a collision-safe and smooth path that is close to spatially optimal (the Euclidean shortest path) with a guaranteed continuity of curvature. Therefore, the path is easily drivable for a wheeled robot without any additional post-optimization and smoothing required. HE* is a two-stage algorithm which uses a direction-guiding heuristics computed by the E* search in the first stage, which improves the quality and reduces the complexity of the hybrid search in the second stage. In each iteration, the search is expanded by a set of BBs, the parameters of which adapt continuously according to the guiding heuristics. Completeness is guaranteed by relying on a complete node mechanism, which also provides an upper bound for the calculated path cost. A remarkable feature of HE* is that it produces good results even at coarse resolutions.},

The new sufficient conditions, taking into account state constraints and actuators saturation, are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Further, it is shown that the closed-loop system can be made asymptotically stable while reducing the conservatism over decentralized and linear distributed control laws derived following the same method. At the same time, the maximization of the estimate of the domain of attraction (DoA) for the closed-loop system is pursued.

  abstract     = {This article considers the rendezvous problem of a group of heterogeneous second-order agents subject to information transmission delays. A major challenge to construct a fully distributed rendezvous protocol is to deal with these delays, which are assumed to be nonuniform and time-varying. Inspired by the fact that a large enough damping coefficient can improve the robustness of a second-order agent against external disturbance, we overcome the above challenge by studying the impact of the damping coefficient on the rendezvous problem. To theoretically analyze the impact, one type of static rendezvous protocol is first proposed and employed. It is interesting to find that agents can reach rendezvous under the static protocol if the damping coefficient is large enough, even though the duration of the time-delay is uncertain. This fact indicates that a large damping coefficient can make the static protocol be robust to the uncertainty of time-delay, which is consistent with the common sense. Then, we apply this impact to deal with the uncertainty introduced by the nonuniform time-varying information delays. To fully apply this impact, we adopt an adaptive approach to making the damping coefficient automatically adapt with the changes of the time-delay. Hence, two classes of fully distributed and adaptive rendezvous protocols are designed, which do not need the global information of the entire communication graph or the value of these time-delays at all. The difference between two classes of protocols is whether it can realize low-frequency learning or not. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed on multiple robots to illustrate the analytical results.},

  abstract     = {Finding a good Pareto front (PF) approximation and locating sufficient equivalent Pareto optimal solutions are two important goals of the multimodal multiobjective optimization (MMO). Preserving the diversity in decision and objective spaces is a core task in the MMO accordingly. Although various “soft isolation” approaches, such as niching methods, have been proposed to promote the diversity and find multiple Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space, they may perform poorly on complex MMO problems (MMOPs) due to high environmental selection pressure and complex geometry of Pareto optimal sets (PSs). To alleviate the above-mentioned challenging task, a “hard/physical isolation” method called zoning search (ZS) is proposed to maintain the diversity in the decision space and reduce the problem complexity in this article. In the ZS, some decision variables of MMOPs are selected randomly and then divided into several segments, i.e., the entire search space is partitioned into many subspaces. Clearly, the population diversity can be naturally maintained in the decision space and the problem complexity is reduced by the ZS in each subspace. The effectiveness of the ZS is systematically evaluated by 11 recently proposed MMOPs. The experimental results demonstrate that the ZS can effectively assist a selected multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MMOEA) in finding more and better distributed equivalent Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space, and keep its performance in the objective space unchanged. Additionally, if additional computational resources are given, the ZS can further help the selected MMOEA to improve its performance in the decision space when compared with a soft isolation method used in the corresponding MMOEA. Overall, the ZS is a simple and promising approach to balance the broad search and the deep search in solving MMOPs.},

This is approached in a cyber-physical system setting, where the attacker can inject false data into a selected subset of sensors to maximize the quadratic cost of states and the energy consumption of the controller at a minimal effort. A 0-1 integer program is formulated, through which the adversary finds an optimal sequence of sets of sensors to attack at optimal switching instants. Specifically, the number of compromised sensors per instant is kept fixed, yet their locations can be dynamic. Leveraging the embedded transformation and mathematical programming, an analytical solution is obtained, which includes an algebraic switching condition determining the optimal sequence of attack locations (compromised sensor sets), along with an optimal state-feedback-based data-injection law. To thwart the adversary, however, a resilient control approach is put forward for stabilizing the compromised system under arbitrary switching attacks constructed based on a set of state-feedback laws, each of which corresponds to a compromised sensor set. Finally, an application using power generators in a cyber-enabled smart grid is provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the resilient control scheme and the practical merits of the theory.},

First, a novel sliding-mode surface is introduced. Using the new surface, the stability of the fuzzy system can be studied even if the input matrices are not common. Second, a new lemma is given to judge if the surface can be utilized in the considered system. Third, a new control law is constructed according to the new sliding-mode surface. The control law is designed to deal with the problems produced by time delay and stochastic systems. At last, two simulations are provided. In this part, the input matrices of fuzzy systems are different from each other and there is a disturbance in this considered system. From the simulations, the results illustrate the validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses a problem of seabed terrain following control (STFC) for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). The motivation is to perform a visual search of marine products closely to seabed in unknown environment. In terms of this issue, we propose a novel and robust STFC framework for our UVMS to maintain an appropriate height to seabed. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method is formulated to solve the STFC problem. To relieve online computational burden and system noisy influence, Ohtsuka&#39;s continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm incorporated with a tracking differentiator (TD) is investigated. In order to improve the following accuracy, the system state prediction part of the NMPC and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network are elaborated to predict future seabed terrain using a depth gauge and an altimeter, respectively. Finally, the three different physical scenarios for STFC problem are established using ROS to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

In contrast to the initial zeroing neural network or the noising-enduring zeroing neural network, which either only achieves finite-time convergence or only suppresses external disturbances, the merit of the proposed NZNN model is able to find an error-free optimal solution in a finite time under various different types of external noises.

Numerical comparative results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and advantages of the NZNN model for TVNO under various types of external disturbances.

Great advances have been made for the deep networks, but small objects detection is still a challenging task. In order to solve this problem, a majority of existing methods utilize complicated network or bigger image size, which generally leads to higher computation cost. The proposed network model is referred to as modular feature fusion detector (MFFD), using a fast and efficient network architecture for detecting small objects. The contribution lies in the following aspects: 1) two base modules have been designed for efficient computation: a) Front module reduces the information loss from raw input images and b) Tinier module decreases the model size and computation cost, while ensuring the detection accuracy; 2) by stacking the base modules, we design a context features fusion framework for multiscale object detection; and 3) the proposed method is efficient in terms of model size and computation cost, which is applicable for resource-limited devices, such as embedded systems for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs). Comparisons with the state-of-the-art on the challenging KITTI dataset reveal the superiority of the proposed method. Especially, 100 ft/s can be achieved on the embedded GPUs such as Jetson TX2.},

To improve the users&#39; utility of purchased resources, according to the historical bidding information, we present data-driven cloud resource procurement (CRP) auctions which can help the resource buyer make an optimized selection for cloud resources. First, we design two procurement auction mechanisms with personalized reserve prices for CRP: Lazy-CRP and Eager-CRP, in which the reserve prices are set by the broker before the auction based on the broker&#39;s knowledge about costs of cloud providers. Then, given the assumption that each cloud provider is myopic, we propose the optimal learning algorithms of personalized reserve prices for the Lazy-CRP approach, and 2-approximation learning algorithm for the Eager-CRP approach. Both of two algorithms can be performed even if the cost distribution functions of cloud providers are nonidentical. By comparing our mechanisms with Vickery-Clark-Groves CRP (VCG-CRP) in simulation, the results show that our proposed mechanism is very suitable for occasions where the number of providers is very small. According to the results of the simulation, the total utilities obtained by the data-driven procurement schemes are significantly higher than VCG-CRP when the number of cloud providers is less than four. When there are only two providers, the increased total utility of our mechanism can be up to 80\% of that obtained by VCG-CRP.},

The proposed controller is built upon the frameworks of contraction and partial contraction theories which ensures that bounded tracking performance as well as quantify the steady-state error bounds in terms of the various control design parameters. Notably, in contrast to the existing Lyapunov-method-based designs, the proposed approach allows to tune the controller performance without arbitrary reduction of singular perturbation parameters. Therefore, the vulnerability of the controller toward actuator saturation and noise, due to the ill-effects of high-gains stemming from the conventional high-gain controllers, are reduced. The extensive experimental results using a wheeled mobile robot are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Mechanically, the developed robotic fish named CasiTuna comprises three important parts, i.e., an innovative two-motor-actuated propulsive mechanism, a buoyancy adjustment structure, and a pair of pectoral fins. Unlike most robotic fishes&#39; multiple concatenated links-based propulsive mechanism, CasiTuna&#39;s two-motor-actuated one places both motors in the anterior body and utilizes a transmission system to achieve tuna-like lateral undulations. Meanwhile, the buoyancy adjustment mechanism in conjunction with pectoral fins endows the robot with the capability of three-dimensional maneuverability. Kinematic and dynamic analyses are further conducted to reveal the interactive hydrodynamic forces. Regarding the locomotion control method, a bio-inspired central pattern generator-based controller is adopted to achieve multimodal swimming. In particular, two kinds of turning maneuvers are implemented and discussed. Aquatic experiments, including straight swimming, circular turning, and nearly static pitching validate the effectiveness of proposed mechatronic design and locomotion control methods. Remarkably, CasiTuna achieved a peak forward speed of 0.8 m/s (corresponding to 1.52 body lengths per second) and a minimum turning radius of less than 0.3 body lengths.},

  abstract     = {During the two last decades, the failure prognostics has been given an increasing importance by the researchers and industrials thanks to the benefits its results can induce in terms of availability, security, and maintenance costs. However, a detailed study of the literature in the domain shows that most of the published works deal with prognostics at component level, where the failure of the system is linked to the failure of its critical components. Even if this assumption can be tolerated in some cases, it cannot be generalized. This is because, in practice, the components are interconnected and, consequently, a degradation of one component can affect the others leading to a modification in the system&#39;s health state and then in its remaining useful life (RUL). To take into account this reality, a new model for prognostics is proposed in this article, namely inoperability input-output model (IIM). This model allows representing multicomponent systems while considering the interactions between their components. More than that, the IIM enables to integrate the mission profile effects on the system degradations to make its RUL predictions more accurate. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach, a mechatronic system is considered as a case study.},

The existing reconstruction methods often rely on the knowledge of the dynamics on networks. In many cases, a prior knowledge of the dynamics is unknown, so it is natural to ask: is it possible to reconstruct network and estimate the dynamical processes on complex networks only rely on the observed data? In this article, we develop a framework to reconstruct the structures of networks with binary-state dynamics, in which the knowledge of the original dynamical processes is unknown . Within the reconstruction framework, the transition probabilities of binary dynamical processes are described by the Sigmoid function in logistic regression, we then apply the mean-field approximation to enable maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which gives rise to that the network structure can be inferred by solving the linear system of equations. Meanwhile, the original dynamical processes can be simulated by estimating the parameters in the Sigmoid function. Our framework has been validated by a variety of binary dynamical processes on synthetic and empirical networks, indicating that our method can not only reveal the network structures but also estimate the dynamical processes. Moreover, the high accuracy of our method is highlighted by comparing it with the existing methods.},

Specifically, the output policy is obtained by solving a model predictive control problem with a locally optimal state value as terminal constraints. When the planning horizon decreases to zero, the MB control will transform into the MF control smoothly. Meanwhile, inspired by the neural mechanism of emotion modulation on decision-making, we build a biologically plausible computational model of emotion processing. This model can generate an uncertainty-related emotional response on the basis of the state prediction error and reward prediction error, and then dynamically modulates the planning horizon in the tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decision-making framework can produce better policies than traditional methods. Emotion modulation can shift the MB and MF control well to improve the learning efficiency and the speed of decision-making.},

To do so, we first model ${\boldsymbol{\beta }}$ -NLF’s learning objective with a ${\boldsymbol{\beta }}$ -divergence function. Subsequently, we deduce a general single latent factor-dependent, non-negative and multiplicative update scheme for ${\boldsymbol{\beta }}$ -NLF, and then design an efficient ${\boldsymbol{\beta }}$ -NLF algorithm. The experimental results on HiDS matrices from industrial applications indicate that by carefully choosing the value of ${\boldsymbol{\beta }}$ , ${\boldsymbol{\beta }}$ -NLF outperforms an NLF model with Euclidean distance in terms of accuracy for missing data prediction without increasing computational time. The research outcomes show the necessity of using an optimal ${\boldsymbol{\beta }}$ -divergence function in order to achieve the best performance of an NLF model on HiDS matrices. Hence, the proposed model has both theoretical and application significance.},

First, the distributed optimization algorithms based on the event-triggered scheme are proposed to achieve optimal consensus as well as reduce communication costs for the EL multiagent systems when the model parameters are available. Second, when the model parameters are unavailable, the tracking controllers are developed to solve the optimization problem for the EL multiagent systems.

In consideration of the topology structures of the Lur&#39;e networks, an effective impulsive pinning controller is proposed, which will be placed on the Lur&#39;e systems having directed paths with those in the other clusters. Considering different functional roles that the impulsive effects play, sufficient criteria for the cluster synchronization of the nonidentically coupled Lur&#39;e dynamical networks are obtained by applying the proportionally delayed impulsive comparison principle, the concept of average impulsive interval, and the extended parameters variation formula. Simultaneously, the exponential convergence rates are successfully estimated with respect to different functions of the impulsive effects.

Neural networks have achieved great successes on the sentiment classification task in recent years, since recurrent neural networks and long-short-term memory networks have the ability to deal with sequences of different lengths and to capture contextual semantic information. However, the effectiveness of these methods is limited when used to extract contextual information from relatively long texts. Therefore, in our model, we apply bidirectional gated recurrent units to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may effectively reduce the noise compared to other methods. We also propose a novel loss function namely drop loss (DL) which makes the model focus on the hard examples - examples which are easily classified incorrectly - in order to improve the accuracy of the model. We experiment on four commonly used datasets, and the results show that the proposed method has a good performance on four datasets, and needs fewer parameters compared with recent benchmarks, such as CoVe, ULMFiT, embeddings from language models, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the classification performance of existing shallow network models can be significantly improved by using DL. In particular, the accuracy of the CNN+LSTM model improves 9\% on the IMDB-10 dataset.},

The new privacy-preserving approach is that we construct an output mask to make agents&#39; internal states indiscernible by others, which is different from the existing privacy-preserving methods adding random noises to the update law of agents&#39; states. Compared with the existing privacy-preserving methods, our approach makes all agents in MANSs exactly converge to the average value of initial states instead of its mean square value. Based on the proposed algorithm, we carry out the detailed theoretical consensus analysis of the network agents, from which, it is shown that the upper bound of the communication time delay between neighbors&#39; agents can be estimated approximately. Moreover, the Zeno-behavior of event-triggered time sequences for each agent is excluded. Finally, two simulation examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

However, it will give attackers the possibility of discovering vulnerabilities in the system, and the control systems lack the ability of dynamic perception of security state and risk, causing the systems to be exposed to risks. In this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes, states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors. Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the access control rules based on the current security status and events of the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score. As the system threats are shown to be decreased obviously from these experiments, this dynamic model can decrease the vulnerabilities and risk effectively.},

Therefore, it is more efficient for the complex nonlinear systems with insufficient data. Third, a novel transfer learning mechanism is designed to determine the optimal control sequence of KDD-MPC with strong adaptability. Therefore, it is suitable to achieve the desired control performance for engineering implementations.

Three stable adaptive tracking schemes for a given reference signal are proposed by devising different control algorithms. In the first scheme, bounded-error tracking is achieved in the sense that the tracking error converges exponentially to an adjustable region around the origin, where the σ-modification adaptive laws are used to ensure the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. In the second scheme, asymptotic tracking is obtained in the sense that the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically, where the strictly positive and integral functions are employed in the control law to ensure the signal boundedness and zero-error tracking. In the third scheme, exponential tracking is gotten in the sense that the tracking error exponentially converges to zero with a given convergence speed, where exponential functions are incorporated into control law and adaptive laws to ensure system stability and the faster convergence. Three adaptive tracking schemes are, respectively, applied to nonlinear chaotic Chua&#39;s circuit with control inputs. The parametric model is developed for Chua&#39;s circuit with uncertain parameters and external disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms is demonstrated by comparative simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {The dropper is one of the core components of the high speed railway catenary and dropper failure will lead to serious transportation accidents. It is very important to carry out dropper failure and defect detection. There are a large number of droppers installed in the catenary. The dropper images are collected by the high-definition camera installed on the top of the moving catenary inspection vehicles. The image quality and image consistency are poor, and it is very difficult to identify dropper defects automatically. The railway department and companies lack efficient and intelligent detection methods. This article innovatively proposes a multialgorithm fusion image processing technology, and builds a dropper recognition and failure–defect detection model based on a deep learning algorithm and subpixel level dropper defect detection model, and achieves high accuracy dropper failure and defect detection. The detection model based on the Faster R-CNN algorithm is studied to realize the positioning and recognition of the dropper and the failure detection of bending slack and broken dropper. The subpixel level dropper defect detection algorithm is based on the fusion of the image preprocessing, dropper fine positioning algorithm, edge fitting and bending zoom algorithms, the Hough transform algorithm, and so on. These can be used to realize detection of defects, such as microdeformation, dropper-strands loosened, dropper-strands broken, and foreign body adhesions. The test is verified by the catenary images taken from a practical high speed railway. The detection accuracy, real-time performance, and stability of the algorithm meet the needs of inspection and maintenance for a high speed railway.},

The difference from most previous works is that input delay and packet losses occur simultaneously in the communication channel connecting the controller to the actuator. Moreover, the data packet dropout is modeled as a time-homogeneous Markov process which poses challenges due to the temporal correlation. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, by applying the maximum principle involving Markov jumps and delay, the linear quadratic optimal control problem in finite horizon is solved and the solution is given in terms of a forward and a backward stochastic difference equations (FBSDEs-M). Second, under a basic assumption, the infinite horizon optimal control problem is solved and the necessary and sufficient condition for mean square stabilization is given in terms of the solutions to coupled algebraic Riccati-type equations with Markov jumps. The presented results are new to the best of our knowledge since there is no existing work that tackles delay and Markovian packet dropouts simultaneously. It is a generalization of the previous work in which the packet dropouts is modeled as an independent identically distributed Bernoulli process.},

First, the operational indices are obtained through some optimization algorithms. Second, the controllers are designed in the ideal situation to ensure that the controlled variables can track desired set points. To minimize the performance deterioration caused by non-Gaussian stochastic noises or disturbances, a novel Pareto distribution estimation (Pareto DE)-based intelligent set-points reselection approach is proposed to optimize entropy and expectation simultaneously. In the proposed method, entropy is formulated in a recursive way basing on joint PDFs which are obtained through multivariate kernel density and bandwidth selection. Meanwhile, both the controller structure and controller parameters are fixed for whatever disturbances acting on the system.

Therefore, we propose to build our system based on existing WiFi infrastructure and its channel state information (CSI). To explore the correlations of adjacent subcarriers, we apply the visibility graph (VG)-based network analysis method to process the CSI data. Specifically, in this article we make the following contributions: 1) we design a CSI-based orientation detection system; 2) we model the correlations between subcarriers using complex network and propose a VG-based feature extraction technique; and 3) we demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our system with commercial products in real-world deployments. The experimental results show that our technique can achieve more than 98\% accuracy and at least 26\% better than the baseline approaches.},

Nowadays, workers are often naturally organized into groups through social networks. To address such common issue of grouped workers in real crowdsourcing systems, this article explores a novel crowdsourcing paradigm in which the task allocation targets are naturally existing worker groups but not individual workers or artificially formed teams as before. Because a natural group might not possess all required skills and needs to coordinate with other groups in the social network contexts for performing a complex task, a concept of contextual crowdsourcing value is presented to measure a group&#39;s capacity to complete a task by coordinating with its contextual groups, which determines the priority that the group is assigned the task; then, the task allocation algorithms, including the allocations of groups and the workers actually participating in executing the task, are designed. The experiments on a real-world dataset show that our presented group-oriented approach can nearly always achieve better synergy performance, consistency performance, conflict performance, adaptability, and effectiveness on reducing costs, as compared with previous benchmark individual-oriented and team formation approaches.},

To counter the conundrum rising in these cases, we present a novel intuitionistic fuzzy clustering-based segmentation method, which integrates structural symmetry and local homoplasy information, for precise infrared pedestrian segmentation. Enlightened by the multiapplication and favorable performance of fuzzy clustering methods, intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (IFCM) is applied as the backbone of our segmentation method. The contributions of the proposed method mainly include two parts. First, motivated by potential target characteristics and tendency for clearer contour description, structural symmetry information is utilized, which is an intrinsic shape feature of objects and would be significant especially when the texture and details of the target are lost in infrared images. Further, a map that represents the probability of pixels belonging to the target is constructed in the form of ellipse symmetry region. Combined with the probability map, symmetry information is utilized to establish a novel dissimilarity function in fuzzy clustering. Second, local homoplasy information which is designed based on region similarity is introduced to suppress the intensity inhomogeneity and noises to further improve the performance of the proposed method. Finally, a dataset containing 500 infrared pedestrian images paired with corresponding pixel-wise annotation is constructed to verify segmentation effectiveness. The proposed SR-IFCM is compared with 12 state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods and works better for infrared pedestrian segmentation.},

  abstract     = {A maximally permissive (or optimal) supervisory control of an automated manufacturing system (AMS) modeled by Petri nets (PNs) can be usually implemented by imposing constraints in the form of a set of linear inequalities. To find such a set of linear constraints, in the existing work, an integer linear programming (ILP) problem is generally formulated and solved for some dominant markings obtained by reachability analysis and vector covering theory, which is computationally inefficient due to the combinatorial nature of solving ILPs to decide the coefficients of optimal linear constraints. This paper addresses the deadlock prevention problem for AMSs by developing efficient methods to reduce the computational overhead through the establishment of conditions on deciding the maximal permissiveness of linear constraints imposed on a system. By taking the advantage of structural properties of a PN model under consideration, we identify the most part of minimal covered illegal markings that can be optimally controlled via policies obtained by specific linear inequality constraints. Also, algorithms are developed to implement the proposed policies. The proposed approach can verify the optimality of a linear constraint efficiently without solving ILP problems. A linear programming method is developed to deal with the markings that cannot be processed by the proposed structural analysis. It is shown that for the considered class of PNs, called system of simple sequential processes with resources (S 3 PR), no mixed ILP problem needs to solve and the computational burden is dramatically reduced. Two examples are employed to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed method.},

Dynamic stability criterion and Hopf bifurcation condition are obtained by carrying out the eigenvalue analysis of the controlled network. The stability range of the parameters of the PID control is evaluated completely for the small-world network.

  abstract     = {A rare event, such as a natural disaster, does not occur frequently, but may cause catastrophic impacts on human beings and their living environment once it happens. Social media provides people an immediate and convenient way to share their opinions. Researchers can thus use it for investigating people&#39;s actions, feelings, and attitudes during multiple rare events. By using social media data, many studies try to build the connection between rare events in a real world and people&#39;s responses, including feelings, attitudes, and behaviors, in a virtual world. In this article, we propose a feature extraction and text classification approach to Twitter text data related to a rare event, e.g., Hurricane Sandy. First, a novel feature extraction method is proposed to mine useful features from each text message. Next, a fuzzy logic-based classification method is proposed to distinguish event-related and unrelated messages. Finally, our proposed method is compared with the existing keyword search one that is widely used in analyzing the evolution of a rare event. The result reveals that the proposed approach is suitable to identify the rare event-related and unrelated text messages.},

Under the sign function framework, two complex-valued control strategies are designed based on two different norms of complex numbers. Some synchronization criteria are derived and the settling times of synchronization are effectively estimated by developing fractional-order finite-time differential inequalities and utilizing the theory of complex-variable functions.

With users and items exploding, such a matrix is usually high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS). Recently, the idea of deep learning has been applied to RSs. However, current deep-structured RSs suffer from high computational complexity. Enlightened by the idea of deep forest, this paper proposes a deep latent factor model (DLFM) for building a deep-structured RS on an HiDS matrix efficiently. Its main idea is to construct a deep-structured model by sequentially connecting multiple latent factor (LF) models instead of multilayered neural networks through a nonlinear activation function. Thus, the computational complexity grows linearly with its layer count, which is easy to resolve in practice. The experimental results on four HiDS matrices from industrial RSs demonstrate that when compared with state-of-the-art LF models and deep-structured RSs, DLFM can well balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, which well fits the desire of industrial RSs for fast and right recommendations.},

In this article, a high-precision attitude control scheme of a space manipulator system is designed via a combination of disturbance observer (DO), prescribed performance-based H ∞ control, and iterative learning control (ILC) techniques. The proposed control scheme consists of three portions: 1) a DO that estimates the vibration disturbance caused by flexible appendage of base satellite; 2) a robust H ∞ controller with prescribed performance to attenuate the inertial uncertainties resulting from capture of an unknown object; and 3) an ILC for improving the transient and steady-state process in the presence of a repetitive on-orbit assembly task. This novel control scheme can not only handle the flexible vibration and inertial uncertainty of the space manipulator but also achieve satisfactory tracking performance. Both simulation and experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed control strategy.},

By minimizing the self-reconstruction error, the ELM-AE-based DR algorithms learn the compressed representations which facilitate the subsequent classification. However, the existing ELM-AEs only consider the DR problem in an unsupervised manner and ignore the valuable supervised information when these information is available. To find discriminative features of the original data, in this paper, we propose a graph embedding-based DR framework with ELM (GDR-ELM) for DR problems. Instead of self-reconstruction, the proposed GDR-ELM reconstructs all samples according to the weights in a graph matrix containing the supervised information. Furthermore, GDR-ELM can be stacked as building blocks to construct a multilayer framework like other ELM-AEs for more complicated representation learning tasks. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GDR-ELM and its multilayer framework.},

Without a prior knowledge of the distribution of the unknown inputs, we propose to construct a PSVM model and formulate the underlying FD problem as a distribution-free Bayes optimal classifier, where the FAR and FDR indicate the worst-case classification accuracies of future residuals for the fault free case and faulty case. Then a bank of parity space vectors and corresponding thresholds can be designed integratedly by applying the techniques of the minimum error minimax probability machine and, at the same time, an optimal tradeoff between FAR and FDR is achieved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a longitudinal control system of unmanned aerial vehicle and further comparison with a traditional parity space-based FD is also addressed.},

With the reference variation being treated as bounded disturbance, this paper incorporates H ∞ control with MPILC to constitute a robust MPILC (RMPILC), so as to restrain the fluctuation of tracking error caused by the varying reference. This RMPILC adopts the linear parameter varying (LPV) model to represent the dynamic property of the nonlinear system. It then solves the input vector of controlled system by optimizing the tracking performance objective function with constraints in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The robust stability and convergence condition of RMPILC are analyzed.

As a result, this paper is dedicated to the controlling problem of partially unknown nonlinear switched systems whose dynamics are perturbed by both matched and mismatched uncertainties. In addition, since the existence of gain deviations in real-world implementations of physical actuators can lessen the control act of the switching system, this paper handles the corresponding gain variations in the control inputs via some adaptation variables. In the design procedure, no limiting supposition is made for the switch signal of the switched plant. The proposed control algorithm is based on the variable structure control theory in which the selected sliding surface is able to deal with mismatching uncertainties and the deriving control law is robust against the lumped uncertain components. As a contribution, the Lyapunov functions are built such that not only to provide an asymptotic stable system but also to assure the global (practical) finite-time stability of the equilibrium state of the final closed-loop cascade switched plant.

In this article, a deep adversarial domain adaptation (DADA) model is proposed for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. This model constructs an adversarial adaptation network to solve the commonly encountered problem in numerous real applications: the source domain and the target domain are inconsistent in their distribution. First, a deep stack autoencoder (DSAE) is combined with representative feature learning for dimensionality reduction, and such a combination provides an unsupervised learning method to effectively acquire fault features. Meanwhile, domain adaptation and recognition classification are implemented using a Softmax classifier to augment classification accuracy. Second, the effects of the number of hidden layers in the stack autoencoder network, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, and the hyperparameters of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm are analyzed. Third, comprehensive analysis is performed on real data to validate the performance of the proposed method; the experimental results demonstrate that the new method outperforms the existing machine learning and deep learning methods, in terms of classification accuracy and generalization ability.},

In the clustering, the contribution of a few pairwise constraints to the clustering performance is very limited, and some may negatively affect the outcome; and 3) these methods are not effective to handle high dimensional data, especially for time series data. Up to now, few work touched semi-supervised clustering on time series data. To efficiently cluster large-scale time series data, we first tackle contract time series clustering to produce the most accurate clustering results under a contracted time. We propose a semi-supervised time series clustering framework (STSC), which integrates a fast similarity measure and a constraint propagation approach. Based on the proposed framework, two valid semi-supervised clustering algorithms including fssK-means and fssDBSCAN are designed. Experiments on 11 datasets show that our proposed method is efficient and effective for clustering large-scale time series data.},

Novel constraints on variable impedance profiles are given to guarantee the exponential stability of the desired variable impedance dynamics. An ADI-based impedance control law is designed to achieve the desired variable impedance dynamics through the convergence of a variable impedance error. Based on the extended Tikhonovs theorem, it is proven that the closed-loop control system has semiglobal practical exponential stability. The proposed impedance controller can be implemented in a PID form and is appealing for its simple structure, easy implementation, and control stability guarantee. The effectiveness of the proposed variable impedance controller is illustrated by an illustrative example taken on a five-bar parallel robot.},

  abstract     = {This article presents two interrelated problems-along tracking and cross tracking-in guidance design for curved path following for unmanned surface vehicles. Since these two types of directional tracking are interactively constrained in most research work, an iteration mechanism is first put forward to optimize the path parameter in each closed loop such that along tracking will not affect cross tracking in the subsequent time period. An extended line-of-sight (ELOS) guidance principle is then proposed by varying the look-ahead distance with the cross-track error such that sideslip in cross tracking can be promptly compensated through vehicle heading amendment. Both simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which perform better than the conventional line-of-sight (LOS) and integral LOS (ILOS) guidance laws.},

  abstract     = {Rotorcrafts, with satisfactory maneuver performance and ability under complex terrains unreachable for ground robots, are playing important roles for goods transportation. In this article, we focus on the control of the cable-suspended transportation way due to its lower costs and more agility of the rotorcraft&#39;s rotational motion. Compared with traditional crane systems and single rotorcrafts without loads, the aerial transportation system presents “double” underactuated property, stronger system nonlinearity, and more complex dynamic coupling, which are huge challenges for control schemes design. Meanwhile, aerial transportation usually suffers from external disturbances and uncertainties presented with aerodynamic damping coefficients and rope length. Additionally, overshoots of the rotorcraft&#39;s position are potential threats for flight safety, especially in confined and complex environments. To address these problems, a novel adaptive control scheme is designed, which ensures effective rotorcraft positioning and payload swing suppression with restricted overshoot amplitudes. Asymptotic results are obtained with rigorous theoretical derivations provided by the Lyapunov-based stability analysis and LaSalle&#39;s invariance theorem. Real-time experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme even in the presence of external disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method designed for aerial transportation systems which achieves simultaneous rotorcraft positioning and swing suppression, together with insurance for overshoot restriction even in the presence of parametric uncertainties.},

This paper proposes a robust controller to assist human drivers in the handover scenarios. A driver–vehicle model including the driver steering input is developed to enhance the cooperation between a human driver and an automated driving controller. The driver parametric uncertainties are explicitly modeled to consider different human driving performances. Then a robust controller is designed to assist the driver considering his/her steering input and parametric uncertainties. The effectiveness of the designed controller is validated through several driver-in-the-loop tests on a driving simulator. The handover test results show that the driver steering loads and the vehicle lateral deviations can be reduced by the designed controller, thereby improving the driving safety in the handover processes.},

Although the global Gauss-Newton (GN) method is an excellent candidate for solving such problems, many challenges need to be addressed for practical realization due to its natures of centralization and noncooperation. Without specialized design for routing, we motivate and propose new diffusion GN methods with cooperative strategy among local neighborhoods. The good performances of diffusion cooperation schemes have been proved in different literatures, such as distribution, robustness, and easy implementation. The proposed cooperative diffusion strategies are named as aggregation-then-update (ATU) and update-then-aggregation (UTA), which reach fully information diffusion across network and consist of two steps in a reversible way including aggregation of local estimates and local GN update. Although all implementations are local, the cooperation between nodes is network wide. Based on the steady-state equilibria theory in the nonlinear discrete dynamical system, the convergence analysis of proposed algorithms is provided. The results show that the global convergence can be achieved when the sufficient conditions are satisfied. We also provide performance comparisons and analysis together with simulation to confirm the applicability and effectiveness of proposed diffusion GN algorithms.},

Since the train usually runs on the same railway periodically, such as the same tunnels, slopes, bridges, etc., ILC is an inherent method for designing the tracking controller that is able to improve the operation performance of train iteratively. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the multi-agent framework and ILC methodology are considered simultaneously in a single train, which can better reveal the coupled characteristic of adjacent cars and impose the repetitive operation pattern of train.

Then, an auxiliary predictive compensation-based ILC (APC-ILC) method is presented by defining an expanded output variable in which the predictive output is incorporated to compensate the unavailable output data due to the shorter operation length. The learning gain is iteration-time-varying and is updated using real-time data to adapt to system changes.

  abstract     = {Aiming at time-variant problems solving, a special type of recurrent neural networks, termed zeroing neural network (ZNN), has been proposed, developed, and validated since 2001. Although equality-constrained time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) has been well solved using the ZNN approach, TVQP problems with inequality constraints involved have not been satisfactorily handled by the existing ZNN models. To overcome this issue, this paper designs a ZNN model with exponential convergence for solving equality- and inequality-constrained TVQP problems. Considering a fast convergence is preferred in some time-critical applications in practice, a predefined-time stabilizer is for the first time utilized to endow the ZNN model with predefined-time convergence, leading to a predefined-time convergent ZNN (PTCZNN) model that exhibits an antecedently- and explicitly-defined convergence time. Theoretical analysis is performed with the convergence of the two ZNN models including the predefined-time convergence of the PTCZNN model rigorously proved. Validations are comparatively conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the PTCZNN model in terms of convergence performance. To demonstrate the potential applications, the PTCZNN model is applied to image fusion and kinematic control of two robotic arms with joint limits considered. The efficacy and applicability of the PTCZNN model are validated by the illustrative examples. This is the first time to develop a ZNN model working as a quadratic programming solver that is applicable to kinematic control of robotic arms with joint constraints handled since the emergence of ZNNs.},

To address estimation of the indirectly accessible modes, the observed-mode sequence emitted by emission probabilities is utilized in this article. By extending the classic Lyapunov stability theory, a set of novel convex stability criteria is proposed by eliminating the nonconvex terms in stabilization conditions with the aid of certain techniques. The proposed stability criteria are utilized to ensure the H ∞ performance of the studied fuzzy systems. In addition, numerically checkable conditions on the existence of a fuzzy observed-mode-dependent estimator are formulated to guarantee the σ-error mean square stability of the underlying error system with a guaranteed H ∞ disturbance attenuation level. The developed theoretical results are illustrated by an application of a single-link robotic arm.},

A lot of efforts have been devoted to derive different adaptive algorithms under MCC, but to date, little insight has been gained as to how the MCC solution will be influenced by outliers. In this paper, we investigate this problem and our focus is mainly on the parameter estimation of a simple linear errors-in-variables (EIVs) model with scalar variables. Under some conditions, we derive an upper bound on the absolute value of the estimation error and show that the MCC solution can get very close to the true value of the unknown parameter even with arbitrarily large outliers in both the input and output variables. Illustrative examples are provided to verify and clarify the theory.},

However, motion learning and generalization of musculoskeletal systems are still challenging problems. In this article, a muscle-synergies-based neuromuscular control is proposed. First, a new computational model of time-varying muscle synergies is constructed, which utilizes both phasic and tonic muscle synergies to characterize the basic features of muscle excitations more sufficiently. Second, a novel neuromuscular control method is proposed for realizing the motion learning and generalization of musculoskeletal systems. Therein, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is designed to modulate muscle synergies according to different movement targets. Muscle excitations are computed with the combination of modulated muscle synergies. Covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy is applied to realize the synchronous optimization of muscle synergies and the RBF neural network. In the experiment, a sophisticated musculoskeletal system learns to perform center-out reaching tasks through trial-and-error learning on a few targets. With the muscle synergies and neural modulation learned from a few targets, the musculoskeletal system can also reach many unexperienced targets. The proposed method not only improves the speed and accuracy of motion learning but also enhances motion generalization. This article also promotes the development of the musculoskeletal robotic system and the fusion of neuroscience and robotics.},

Therefore, IFSs have been used in many areas. However, the distance measure between the IFSs indicating the difference or discrepancy grade is still an open question that has attracted considerable attention over the past few decades. Although various measurement methods have been developed, some problems still exist regarding the unsatisfactory axioms of distance measure or that lack discernment and cause counterintuitive cases. To address the above issues, in this article, we propose a new distance measure between IFSs based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. This new IFS distance measure can not only satisfy the axiomatic definition of distance measure but also has nonlinear characteristics. As a result, it can better discriminate the discrepancies between IFSs, and it generates more reasonable results than do other existing measure methods; these advantages are illustrated by several numerical examples. Based on these qualities, an algorithm for pattern classification is designed that provides a promising solution for addressing inference problems.},

This article presents a novel JADE variant by incorporating chaotic local search (CLS) mechanisms into JADE to alleviate this problem. Taking advantages of the ergodicity and nonrepetitious nature of chaos, it can diversify the population and thus has a chance to explore a huge search space. Because of the inherent local exploitation ability, its embedded CLS can exploit a small region to refine solutions obtained by JADE. Hence, it can well balance the exploration and exploitation in a search process and further improve its performance. Four kinds of its CLS incorporation schemes are studied. Multiple chaotic maps are individually, randomly, parallelly, and memory-selectively incorporated into CLS. Experimental and statistical analyses are performed on a set of 53 benchmark functions and four real-world optimization problems. Results show that it has a superior performance in comparison with JADE and some other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.},

However, no current existing approach is “optimal” for big data due to high complexity, which remains it a great challenge.

KNN-BLOCK DBSCAN uses a fast approximate kNN algorithm, namely, FLANN, to detect core-blocks (CBs), noncore-blocks, and noise-blocks within which all points have the same type, then a fast algorithm for merging CBs and assigning noncore points to proper clusters is also invented to speedup the clustering process.

Sufficient conditions are derived under which the exponentially mean-square input-to-state stability is guaranteed and the desired security level is then achieved.

To accomplish this, the concept of a full coalition set is defined in which each participating decision maker (DM) is represented once either as an individual player or part of a coalition. All possible scenarios in which a full coalition set could be formed is called the universal coalition set. When calculating the stability of a specific state for a particular coalition in a given conflict, the remaining DMs form the universal coalition set whose moves have the potential to block any CIs by the focal coalition within four specified solution concepts having full participation of sanctioning opponents. To handle heterogeneous opponents with mixed CIs (MCIs), the mixed coalition analysis approach is proposed, which provides a more general coalition analysis framework than existing coalition analysis approaches. Moreover, the interrelationships among coalitional stabilities and mixed coalitional stabilities with full participation are investigated followed by their corresponding matrix representations which can significantly improve their computational efficiency and make the computer implementation possible. Finally, a case study is investigated to demonstrate how to employ the proposed mixed coalition analysis approaches to address a real-world environmental conflict.},

However, most feedback mechanisms do not consider the willingness of decision makers to accept these advices. In the opinion dynamics discipline, the bounded confidence model justifies well that in the process of interaction a decision maker only considers the preferences that do not exceed a certain confidence level compared to his own preference. Inspired by this idea, this article proposes a new consensus reaching model with personalized feedback mechanism to help decision makers with bounded confidences in achieving consensus. Specifically, the personalized feedback mechanism produces more acceptable advices in the two cases where bounded confidences are known or unknown, and the unknown ones are estimated by a learning algorithm. Finally, numerical example and simulation analysis are presented to explore the effectiveness of the proposed model in reaching consensus.},

Two kinds of classical control schemes, which are dynamic containment control and static containment control schemes, are utilized to address the proposed synthesis problem. Based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, the dynamic containment controller and static containment controller are designed to plunge into the studied semi-Markovian multiagent systems, respectively. Moreover, the random switching topologies with the semi-Markovian process, the partly unknown transition rates, and the generally uncertain transition rates are taken into account, which can be applicable to more practical situations.

This article provides sufficient and necessary conditions for the identifiability of the influence model, and also develops estimators for model structures through exploiting the model&#39;s special properties.

On the basis of the universal approximation property of NNs, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to estimate the unknown compounded disturbance composed of external disturbance and the residual term of input saturation. According to the measurement error defined by control signal, an event-triggered mechanism is developed to save network transmission resource and reduce the number of controller update. Then, an adaptive NN compensation control approach is proposed to tackle the problem of sensor faults via the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique. It is proved that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Sink mobility is a significant technique to improve the performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Generally a mobile sink visits several rendezvous points (RPs), forming a trip tour for data collection. However, the low movement speeds of mobile sinks tend to incur serious data delivery delays. In this article, we propose a quick convex hull-based rendezvous planning (QCHBRP) scheme, which aims to not only achieve full connectivity for disjoint WSNs but also construct a shorter trip tour and minimize the data delivery latency accordingly. The trajectory formation of the mobile sink is based on a path skeleton, i.e., a near-convex hull, which is created by the quick determination of several special locations as RPs. The benefits of QCHBRP are threefold. First, it is especially designed for disjoint WSNs where sensor nodes are deployed in multiple isolated segments and the network connectivity is lost in advance. Second, it is suitable for delay-harsh applications which require short paths of the mobile sink. Third, it is of much lower computational complexity compared with existing methods. The extensive analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of this new scheme in terms of connectivity cost and data delivery delay.},

The neural networks (NNs) or fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) used to accommodate uncertainties also impose demanding computational cost and sluggish convergence. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new output-feedback control for uncertain pure-feedback systems without using backstepping and function approximator. A coordinate transform is first used to represent the pure-feedback system in a canonical form to evade using the backstepping or DSC scheme. Then the Levant&#39;s differentiator is used to reconstruct the unknown states of the derived canonical system. Finally, a new unknown system dynamics estimator with only one tuning parameter is developed to compensate for the lumped unknown dynamics in the feedback control. This leads to an alternative, simple approximation-free control method for pure-feedback systems, where only the system output needs to be measured. The stability of the closed-loop control system, including the unknown dynamics estimator and the feedback control is proved. Comparative simulations and experiments based on a PMSM test-rig are carried out to test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread application of service-oriented architecture (SOA), a flood of similarly functioning services have been deployed online. How to recommend services to users to meet their individual needs becomes the key issue in service recommendation. In recent years, methods based on collaborative filtering (CF) have been widely proposed for service recommendation. However, traditional CF typically exploits only low-dimensional and linear interactions between users and services and is challenged by the problem of data sparsity in the real world. To address these issues, inspired by deep learning, this article proposes a new deep CF model for service recommendation, named location-aware deep CF (LDCF). This model offers the following innovations: 1) the location features are mapped into high-dimensional dense embedding vectors; 2) the multilayer-perceptron (MLP) captures the high-dimensional and nonlinear characteristics; and 3) the similarity adaptive corrector (AC) is first embedded in the output layer to correct the predictive quality of service. Equipped with these, LDCF can not only learn the high-dimensional and nonlinear interactions between users and services but also significantly alleviate the data sparsity problem. Through substantial experiments conducted on a real-world Web service dataset, results indicate that LDCF&#39;s recommendation performance obviously outperforms nine state-of-the-art service recommendation methods.},

Due to the issues, such as polysemy, ambiguity, as well as fuzziness of sentences, intense sentence understanding is very challenging. To this end, in this article, we introduce the corresponding image of sentences as reference information for enhancing sentence semantic understanding and representing. Specifically, we first propose an image-enhanced multilevel sentence representation net (IEMLRN), that utilizes the image features from pretrained models for enhancing the sentence semantic understanding at different scales, i.e., lexical-level, phrase-level, and sentence-level. The proposed model advances the performance on NLI tasks by leveraging the pretrained global features of images. However, as these pretrained image features are optimized on specific image classification datasets, they may not show the best performance on NLI tasks. Therefore, we further propose to design an adaptive image feature generator that extracts fine-grained image labels from the corresponding sentences. After that, we extend the IEMLRN to multilevel image-enhanced sentence representation net (MIESR) by utilizing not only the coarse-grained pretrained features of images, but also the fine-grained adaptive features of images. Therefore, sentence semantic can be evaluated and enhanced more comprehensively and precisely. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (SNLI, SICK) clearly show our proposed IEMLRN significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, and our proposed MIESR model achieves the best performance by considering not only the text but also images in an adaptive multigranularities way.},

The popular approaches to engage in exploration are mainly by injecting noise into neural network (NN) parameters or by augmenting additional intrinsic motivation term. However, the randomness of injecting noise and the metric for intrinsic reward must be chosen manually may make RL agents deviate from the optimal policy during the learning process. To enhance the exploration ability of agent and simultaneously ensure the stability of parameter learning, we proposed a novel proximal parameter distribution optimization (PPDO) algorithm. On the one hand, PPDO enhances the exploration ability of RL agent by transforming NN parameter from a certain single value to a function distribution. On the other hand, PPDO accelerates the parameter distribution optimization by setting two groups of parameters. The parameter optimization is guided by evaluating the parameter quality change before and after the parameter distribution update. In addition, PPDO reduces the influence of bias and variance on the value function approximation by limiting the amplitude of the two consecutive parameter updates, which can enhance the stability of the parameter distribution optimization. Experiments on the OpenAI Gym, Atari, and MuJoCo platforms indicate that PPDO can improve the exploration ability and learning efficiency of deep RL algorithms, including DQN and A3C.},

Then, the robot makes an autonomous decision according to the environmental features, robot state, and safety constraints. Lastly, a suitable step length and height are given to the parameterized gait pattern planning model of robot to assist with walking.

First, a new power law inequality with fractional-order and two finite-time fractional differential inequalities are established by means of L&#39;Hospital rule, Laplace transform, and reduction to absurdity, which greatly extend some existing results. In addition, unlike the traditional maximum absolute value-based method to propose memristive synaptic weights, by introducing some transformations, FMNNs are translated to a type of fractional-order systems with uncertain parameters. Furthermore, the finite-time synchronization of FMNNs is investigated by designing a discontinuous control scheme and several criteria are derived based on the developed fractional inequalities and M-matrix theory. Note that in addition to the traditional Lyapunov function with absolute value form, a more general Lyapunov function is constructed to deal with the finite-time synchronization, which makes the derived criteria more flexible and less conservative. Lastly, the derived theoretical results are verified via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Mobile social networks (MSNs) provide real-time information services to individuals in social communities through mobile devices. However, due to their high openness and autonomy, MSNs have been suffering from rampant rumors, fraudulent activities, and other types of misuses. To mitigate such threats, it is urgent to control the spread of fraud information. The research challenge is: how to design control strategies to efficiently utilize limited resources and meanwhile minimize individuals&#39; losses caused by fraud information? To this end, we model the fraud information control issue as an optimal control problem, in which the control resources consumption for implementing control strategies and the losses of individuals are jointly taken as a constraint called total cost, and the minimum total cost becomes the objective function. Based on the optimal control theory, we devise the optimal dynamic allocation of control strategies. Besides, a dynamics model for fraud information diffusion is established by considering the uncertain mental state of individuals, we investigate the trend of fraud information diffusion and the stability of the dynamics model. Our simulation study shows that the proposed optimal control strategies can effectively inhibit the diffusion of fraud information while incurring the smallest total cost. Compared with other control strategies, the control effect of the proposed optimal control strategies is about 10\% higher.},

This characteristic is desired because a chaotic system with robust chaos can overcome the chaos disappearance caused by parameter disturbance in practical applications. However, many existing chaotic systems fail to consider the robust chaos. This article introduces an exponential chaotic model (ECM) to produce new one-dimensional (1-D) chaotic maps with robust chaos. ECM is a universal framework and can produce many new chaotic maps employing any two 1-D chaotic maps as base and exponent maps. As examples, we present nine chaotic maps produced by ECM, discuss their bifurcation diagrams and prove their robust chaos. Performance evaluations also show that these nine chaotic maps of ECM can obtain robust chaos in a large parameter space. To show the practical applications of ECM, we employ these nine chaotic maps of ECM in secure communication. Simulation results show their superior performance against various channel noise during data transmission.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the potential relations between nodes in networks, known as link prediction, has long been a challenge in network science. However, most studies just focused on link prediction of static network, while real-world networks always evolve over time with the occurrence and vanishing of nodes and links. Dynamic network link prediction (DNLP) thus has been attracting more and more attention since it can better capture the evolution nature of networks, but still most algorithms fail to achieve satisfied prediction accuracy. Motivated by the excellent performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) in processing time series, in this article, we propose a novel encoder-LSTM-decoder (E-LSTM-D) deep learning model to predict dynamic links end to end. It could handle long-term prediction problems, and suits the networks of different scales with fine-tuned structure. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that LSTM, together with an encoder-decoder architecture, is applied to link prediction in dynamic networks. This new model is able to automatically learn structural and temporal features in a unified framework, which can predict the links that never appear in the network before. The extensive experiments show that our E-LSTM-D model significantly outperforms newly proposed DNLP methods and obtain the state-of-the-art results.},

The existed nonlinearity in the considered MJSs means that there exist limitations to employ the renown sliding mode control (SMC) method directly. In this work, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) technique is exploited to model the nonlinearity on which no knowledge whatsoever is available. Then, with the help of the adaptive backstepping method, an NN-based FTC approach is proposed to overcome the considered challenging case. The adverse effects, arising from the nonlinearity and the actuator faults can be completely compensated by the proposed adaptive controller. With the proposed controller and the adaptation laws, the bounded stability of the considered closed-loop plant can be guaranteed. Furthermore, only two types of adaptive parameters are adopted in the proposed approach to achieve the purpose of FTC, and this reduces the computational burden and thus extends its applicability.

The property of radial basis function (RBF)NNs is used to solve the algebraic loop problem based on the approximation structure. In order to achieve full state constraint satisfactions, the barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) are employed in each design procedure. Based on the backstepping and less adjustable parameters techniques, the controllers and the adaptive laws are obtained. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is proved. Therefore, the scheme not only solves the stability problem of the nonstrict feedback system but also overcomes the influence of the state constraint on the control performance.

  abstract     = {As a class of batch-mode reinforcement learning (RL) methods for Markov decision problems with large or continuous state spaces, approximate policy iteration (API) has received increasing attention in the past decades. One open problem in the design of API algorithms is how to construct the basis functions or features for value function approximation (VFA). In this paper, we propose a novel batch-mode RL approach with randomly projected features for VFA. The proposed approach can be viewed as an extension of extreme learning machines (ELMs) to RL problems so it can be called ELM-API. The ELMs have been popularly studied in supervised learning problems, but there is not much work on the extension of ELMs to learning control problems. The proposed approach has advantages over the previous API algorithms in that the features for VFA can be quickly generated without complex parameter selection and the performance will be adaptive to different sample sets in batch-mode RL. In particular, the ELM-API approach can realize fast and efficient feature reconstruction when training sample sets are relatively small. Comprehensive simulation studies on two benchmark learning control problems were carried out to test the performance of API algorithms with different feature construction methods. It is shown that the ELM-API algorithm can obtain comparable or better performance than the previous API approaches. To further show the effectiveness of ELM-API in real-world applications, the simulation results on a more challenging high-dimensional lane-changing decision problem in dynamic traffic environment are also reported, which show the capability of the ELM-API algorithm in learning satisfactory lane-changing policies with high data efficiency.},

Another contribution is that the problem of the optimal control with the piecewise constant controller gains under a stochastic environment is solved, and the reformed dynamic principle and the reformed Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) partial differential equations (PDEs) are proposed by using the splitting method and Feynman–Kac formula. Furthermore, since the multiagent system often runs on a high-dimensional space, a heuristic method is proposed based on the derivation of the reformed HJB PDEs and the scalar of the computational complexity of the PDEs is equivalent to that of a system of ordinary differential equations with the same dimensions when the multiagent system can be described as a piecewise linear system.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the issue of neuro-fuzzy-based adaptive dynamic surface control (DSC) for uncertain fractional-order (FO) nonlinear systems in strict-feedback form where input constraint is considered in the systems. In the recursive steps, the neuro-fuzzy network systems are employed to deal with the unknown nonlinear terms existing in systems. Furthermore, based on a DSC scheme, a modified FO filter is constructed to overcome the problem of explosion of complexity caused by the traditional backstepping design. Moreover, according to the FO Lyapunov stability theory, a neuro-fuzzy-based adaptive controller is designed to guarantee all the signals of FO closed-loop systems tend to be bounded. Finally, the three examples are provided to verify the validity and superiority of the presented control scheme.},

A novel phenomenon is that there may exist two kinds constrained fixed points, which are, respectively, named as the livelock and deadlock ones. It is different with the traditional fixed point. Accordingly, a formula is presented to calculate the number of constrained fixed points and constrained cycles. In the second part, the constrained reachability and stabilization problem of the event-triggered controlled BCNs are investigated. Two necessary and sufficient criteria are, respectively, obtained.

  abstract     = {With the increase in the number of optimization objectives, balancing the convergence and diversity in evolutionary multiobjective optimization becomes more intractable. So far, a variety of evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with more than three objectives. Most of the existing algorithms, however, find difficulties in simultaneously counterpoising convergence and diversity during the whole evolutionary process. To address the issue, this paper proposes to solve MaOPs via multistage evolutionary search. To be specific, a two-stage evolutionary algorithm is developed, where the convergence and diversity are highlighted during different search stages to avoid the interferences between them. The first stage pushes multiple subpopulations with different weight vectors to converge to different areas of the Pareto front. After that, the nondominated solutions coming from each subpopulation are selected for generating a new population for the second stage. Moreover, a new environmental selection strategy is designed for the second stage to balance the convergence and diversity close to the Pareto front. This selection strategy evenly divides each objective dimension into a number of intervals, and then one solution having the best convergence in each interval will be retained. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, 48 benchmark functions with 7, 10, and 15 objectives are used to make comparisons with five representative many-objective optimization algorithms.},

Thus, the communication frequency of each channel is significantly reduced. Here, communication over different channels is independent with each other and, thus, a channel-based control protocol is further proposed. The update times of control protocol could be also lowered in this framework. Here, an iterative evaluation method is constructed to design a fully distributed self-triggered scheme without involving any global information, especially the eigenvalue information of the Laplacian matrix. In addition, by introducing several variables, some sufficient conditions for achieving the second-order consensus and average consensus are obtained, respectively, in a distributed fashion, and the Zeno behavior is successfully eliminated.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) data with non-negativity constraints are commonly seen in industrial applications, such as recommender systems. They can be modeled into an HiDS matrix, from which non-negative latent factor analysis (NLFA) is highly effective in extracting useful features. Preforming NLFA on an HiDS matrix is ill-posed, desiring an effective regularization scheme for avoiding overfitting. Current models mostly adopt a standard L 2 scheme, which does not consider the imbalanced distribution of known data in an HiDS matrix. From this point of view, this paper proposes an instance-frequency-weighted regularization (IR) scheme for NLFA on HiDS data. It specifies the regularization effects on each latent factors with its relevant instance count, i.e., instance-frequency, which clearly describes the known data distribution of an HiDS matrix. By doing so, it achieves finely grained modeling of regularization effects. The experimental results on HiDS matrices from industrial applications demonstrate that compared with an L 2 scheme, an IR scheme enables a resultant model to achieve higher accuracy in missing data estimation of an HiDS matrix.},

Compared with many existing resource allocation problems, the formulation involves the dynamics of agents. The second-order dynamics of agents induce the difficult in algorithm design and analysis, since the decisions of agents could not be directly decided by their control inputs. In order to optimally allocate the network resource, two distributed algorithms are designed via state feedback and gradient descent for the two problems, respectively. Besides, the convergence of the two algorithms are analyzed. By the two algorithms, the second-order agents converge to the optimal allocation of the two problems, respectively.

To overcome this problem, an intelligent optimal control system with flexible objective functions (IOCS-FOF) was proposed in this paper. The main merits of this proposed IOCS-FOF were shown as follows. First, an optimal control system scheme was developed, where different time-scale operational objectives were detailed to describe the operational features. Second, a flexible objective strategy was designed to determine suitable objective functions, which could adapt to complex environments of WWTP. Third, a novel dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithm for flexible objectives (FO-DMOA) was developed to obtain the optimal solutions of IOCS-FOF. Finally, the proposed IOCS-FOF was applied in the benchmark simulation model No. 1 (BSM1) to confirm its technique capability.

The asynchrony in this context implies that there is no global clock to synchronize the update time in each distributed agent and also each agent updates its own state asynchronously without waiting for values received from neighboring agents. It has been noted without much attention that asynchronous stationary solutions may not be unique and disagree with a synchronous stationary value. In some applications, this discrepancy may cause serious consequences, and thus it is critical to analyze the effect of asynchrony on stationary solutions. In this paper, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of stationary solutions for discrete-time multiagent systems. In the case of nonunique stationary solutions, the normalized expected error between synchronous and asynchronous stationary solutions is also analyzed. To validate the proposed methods, we provide three example problems: 1) containment control; 2) fixed-point iteration; and 3) distributed averaging formulated in a discrete-time setting.},

  abstract     = {The issue of impulse noise detection and reduction is a critical problem for image processing application systems. In order to detect impulse noises in corrupted images, a statistic named local consensus index (LCI) is proposed for quantitatively evaluating how noise free a pixel is, and then an impulse noise detection scheme based on LCI is introduced. First, the similarity between arbitrary two pixels in an image is quantified based on both their geometric distance and intensity difference, and the LCI of arbitrary pixel is calculated by summing all the similarity values of pixels in its neighborhood. As a new statistic, the value of LCI indicates the local consensus of the concerned pixel regarding its neighbors and could also tell whether a pixel is noise free or impulsive. Therefore, LCI can be directly used as an efficient indicator of impulse noise. Furthermore, to improve the performance of impulse noise detection, different strategies are applied to the pixels at flat regions and the ones with complex textures, since distributions of LCI value within those regions are totally different. As for impulse noise filtering, a hybrid graph Laplacian regularization (HGLR) method is introduced to restore the intensities of those pixels degraded by impulse noise. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our impulsive noise detection and reduction method, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of impulse detection and noise removal.},

Under the framework of the attacks, the remote state estimation error is analyzed, and the optimal attack policy is derived by solving a convex optimization problem to achieve the maximal estimation error.

  abstract     = {With the profound diffusion of technological systems in the real world, fault diagnosis has become a major requirement due to its importance in terms of system reliability, security, and efficiency. In this paper, we focus on the problem of causal model-based diagnosis (MBD) of spatially distributed systems in terms of colored Petri nets (CPNs). First, we introduce the colored behavioral Petri net (CBPN) model as a particular CPN intended for the description of a system&#39;s causal behavior where each transition is associated with a matrix describing the possible ways it may fire. On the basis of such matrices, we define a particular technique that we call CW-analysis as a backward reachability analysis of CBPNs. With no need to expressions inversion, which is particularly required for original CPNs, the CW-analysis can be realized by a simple manipulation of the net transition matrices. Second, we propose a new approach for distributed systems, where the diagnostic process is captured within a framework based on the formalism of CBPNs. The systems we consider consist of a set of interacting subsystems. Hence, the overall system model is given as a set of place-bordered CBPNs. The interactions between the subsystems are captured by tokens that may pass from one net model to another via bordered places. The diagnostic system is defined as a multiagent system, each agent is in charge of diagnosing an associated subsystem, by having its local CBPN and receiving only the observations generated by its elements. We show how the formalization of the diagnostic process at the level of each agent can be obtained in terms of reachability in a CBPN and can be implemented by exploiting the CW-analysis technique. Once local diagnoses are obtained by the different agents, a cooperation process should be initiated to ensure global consistency of such diagnoses.},

By introducing a compact form dynamic linearization (CFDL) scheme, a linear data model of the nonlinear nonaffine system is derived. Then, a parameter estimation algorithm is developed to offline identify the linear data model. On the basis of the identified linear data model, a CFDL-based event-triggered model-free adaptive control (CFDL-ET-MFAC) is developed by designing an event-triggering condition to guarantee the Lyapunov stability. The control action is active only when the event-triggering condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the input signal remains the same as that at the previous triggering instant. In addition, the parameter estimation algorithm is developed for the proposed CFDL-ET-MFAC to identify the CFDL model in real time for improving the robustness to the uncertainties. Meanwhile, both a partial form dynamic linearization-based event-triggered MFAC and a full form dynamic linearization-based event-triggered MFAC are proposed to further improve the control performance by using additional parameters to capture the more complicated behavior of complex nonlinear systems. The proposed ET-MFAC methods only rely on the linear data models directly obtained from data without using any other mechanistic model information. The validity of the three ET-MFAC methods is confirmed through both theoretical analysis and simulation studies.},

The main concerned problem is to estimate stronger upper bounds than the conventional ones for the integral terms induced through the derivative LKF. For this estimation process, combining the weighted integral inequality together with the reciprocal convex lemma, a new type of relaxed-based integral inequality is introduced to bound the integral term based on the weighted integral inequality. By making the use of derived inequality, the desired exponential stability conditions are established by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

It enables the description of complex system models; however, it cannot effectively support all system engineering activities.

In this case, the transformation of SysML system models to executable simulation models for specific simulation methodologies and tools is required. Model transformation is a key component for addressing the challenges of seamless integration of SysML model simulation in model-based system engineering. In this paper, we explore a declarative approach, based on the query/view/transformation-relations (QVT-R) standard, for the transformation of SysML models to executable simulation models, fully adhering model-driven architecture (MDA) concepts. It is supported by a framework implemented to provide executable simulation model and code generation. Methodological guidelines, for the effective use of a declarative language as QVT-R, for model transformation, are provided, emphasizing the utilization of existing domain-specific SysML profiles, as well as executable simulation library components. The experience obtained from two different domains, namely, enterprise information and railway transportation systems, modeled as systems-of-systems via SysML, is discussed, based on a quantitative analysis of the respective QVT-R transformations.},

Our results manifest that the time-average of coupling strength over intervals of certain length, together with the underlying topology and the values of self-delays, plays a crucial role in guaranteeing consensus. Based on the theoretical analysis, an estimation of the largest admissible delay is also available.

Considering the limitation of communication bandwidth, a new bounded logarithm quantized communication strategy is proposed to preprocess the information before its transmission, thus reducing the influence of quantization error on the final convergence state. In order to decrease the frequency of control law update and reduce the power consumption, a distributed event-triggered rule is designed to decide when to transmit the information and when to optimize the model predictive control, in which trigger function synthesizes three factors, namely, predictive step, saturation of quantizer, and event-triggered error related with quantized error. The optimal control sequence of DMPC guides the update of controller between two triggering instants. The relationship among the quantization level, event-triggered parameters, and Laplacian matrix is established. Conditions are presented to ensure that all leaders asymptotically converge to a designed formation configuration, while all followers reach to the convex hull of them. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

First, to handle the difficulty caused by the inherent unstable characteristic, a state feedback control law is introduced to the state-space model deduced with the kinematic coupling relationship between the longitudinal motion and tilt angle of vehicle body. Then, by system discretization, a standard quasi-convex optimization problem is formulated to plan a time-optimal trajectory with various constraints being taken into account, and the optimization problem can be solved by a bisection method combined with solving a series of convex feasibility problems. Next, to obtain the analytic expression of the discrete optimal trajectory, a B-spline interpolation algorithm with adaptive curve refinement is presented based on feature points recognition. Furthermore, as the time-optimal trajectories with analytic expressions, including displacement, velocity, and acceleration trajectories, have been obtained, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) tracking controller is applied to control the vehicle to track the optimal trajectories and, thus, the time-optimal point stabilization control for the WIP vehicle can be realized. Finally, simulation results of a numerical example is presented to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a force sensorless control scheme based on neural networks (NNs) is developed for interaction between robot manipulators and human arms in physical collision. In this scheme, the trajectory is generated by using geometry vector method with Kinect sensor. To comply with the external torque from the environment, this paper presents a sensorless admittance control approach in joint space based on an observer approach, which is used to estimate external torques applied by the operator. To deal with the tracking problem of the uncertain manipulator, an adaptive controller combined with the radial basis function NN (RBFNN) is designed. The RBFNN is used to compensate for uncertainties in the system. In order to achieve the prescribed tracking precision, an error transformation algorithm is integrated into the controller. The Lyapunov functions are used to analyze the stability of the control system. The experiments on the Baxter robot are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed control scheme.},

Both of the proposed event-triggered protocols can guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and the adaptive gains without the requirement of any global information of the network.

  abstract     = {A decentralized event-triggered approach is developed for leader-follower systems with time-invariant and time-varying network topologies in the absence of full-state feedback. Continuous interagent communication is eliminated by communicating information only during events. At the event times, an observer communicates with the neighboring agents to obtain update information. During the interevent intervals, an open-loop estimate is used as a substitute for local feedback. The advantages of our novel approach are that: 1) the amount of communication required can be reduced and determining the event times requires no interagent communication, with the event-triggered condition designed using stability analysis so that bounded consensus is guaranteed; 2) bounded state consensus can be achieved without receiving full-state information from the followers; and 3) the switching sequence of the time-varying network topologies can be arbitrary, since a switching controller is developed based on the common-Lyapunov-function approach to ensure state consensus. Intermittent feedback is present and the dynamics of the time-varying network topologies are discrete, which together prove that Zeno behavior never occurs. The stability of the closed loop is analyzed to guarantee bounded convergence for the designed control methodologies. The results of simulations are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of our novel controllers.},

It is critical to bridge the gap between real-time production data and health status evaluation, which helps maintenance team understand the health status of equipment exactly, and then make rational maintenance plans. For this purpose, this paper proposes a framework to realize real-time equipment health assessment with health status quantitatively characterized by health degree (HD). The proposed framework begins with removing redundant features using a principal component analysis (PCA) method. Then, to represent the optimal operation status, a support vector data description (SVDD) algorithm is employed for extracting normal observations in the offline part. Thereafter, HD is introduced based on the Euclidean distance between current observation and the normal sample set. In order to achieve online updating of the normal sample set, and promote accuracy and computational efficiency of the offline part, an improved incremental SVDD algorithm based on adaptive threshold N (NISVDD) is proposed. A case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and model using a benchmark dataset of rolling bearing. Results suggest that the proposed framework is effective, and PCA shows good potential to extract features and keep most of the original information. The proposed NISVDD model is able to trace the dynamics of equipment health status for whole run-to-failure process, and outperforms other models in both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Our approach considers the uncertainties and side effects of the interval variables to improve individual scalar representative values.

A new event-triggered information transmission mechanism is first presented, where each spacecraft only requires accessing to the states of neighbors intermittently. Subsequently, a novel event-based coordinated control scheme is proposed by combining a smooth adaptive projection rule that confines the parameter estimations to well-defined bounded convex hypercubes. Under the proposed control framework, the information exchange among spacecraft occurs only when the specified event is triggered, thereby significantly reducing the communication load and saving the onboard resources. Furthermore, a positive lower bound on interevent time intervals is guaranteed to exclude Zeno behavior. By virtue of Lyapunov stability analysis and graph theory, it is proved that the relative position tracking errors can converge to small invariant sets around the origin, and that all closed-loop signals are bounded, even in the presence of mass uncertainties and external disturbances.

First, the experience replay technique is applied to identify the uncertain parameters in the zero dynamics. It uses the recorded past data concurrently with current data which can greatly speed up the identification convergence. With the identified parameters, a novel approach called optimal bounded inversion is proposed to obtain the IID by solving a trajectory optimization problem using GPOPS-II. The boundedness of the IID is guaranteed by setting state constraints and the feasibility is achieved by minimizing the initial condition mismatch. Moreover, a piecewise IID updating scheme is adopted to reduce the computational burden.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a time-efficient indoor navigation and evacuation (TINE) framework to minimize moving time for mobile users based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. In normal time, the proposed TINE framework can estimate the density of mobile users in each area and determine the moving speeds to pass through different areas. Based on the determined moving speed of each area, an indoor navigation path can be planned to provide the shortest moving time for a mobile user. In emergent time, TINE can accurately estimate the escaping time for groups of mobile users by jointly considering the length and moving time of passageways, the capacity of passageways/doors/exits, the present distribution and parallel moving of mobile users, and the possible congestion caused by other groups. Based on the estimated escaping time, TINE can efficiently alleviate the congestion of all passageways/exits and evenly distribute the evacuation load among exits to minimize the total escaping time. According to our review of relevant research, this is the first solution that can both provide the fastest navigation path to arbitrary target places and evacuate all groups of mobile users to safe places in the shortest escaping time. Simulation results show that TINE outperforms existing schemes and can significantly reduce the total walking and escaping times of indoor navigation and evacuation, respectively. In particular, an Android-based prototype with iBeacon IoT localization is implemented to verify the feasibility of our TINE system.},

Recalling the backstepping method and neural network approximation technology, a new PI tracking controller characterized by simple structure and easy implementation is developed which ensures that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded.

  abstract     = {The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a method extensively applied in many areas, particularly, in nonlinear target tracking. The optimization criterion commonly used in EKF is the celebrated minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, which exhibits excellent performance under Gaussian noise assumption. However, its performance may degrade dramatically when the noises are heavy tailed. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes two new nonlinear filters, namely the linear regression maximum correntropy EKF (LRMCEKF) and nonlinear regression maximum correntropy EKF (NRMCEKF), by applying the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) rather than the MMSE criterion to EKF. In both filters, a regression model is formulated, and a fixed-point iterative algorithm is utilized to obtain the posterior estimates. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms in target tracking are confirmed by an illustrative example.},

The mental tasks are dominant area of investigations in BCI, which utmost interest as these system can be augmented life of people having severe disabilities. The performance of BCI model primarily depends on the construction of features from brain, electroencephalography (EEG), signal, and the size of feature vector, which are obtained through multiple channels. The availability of training samples to features are minimal for mental task classification. The feature selection is used to increase the ratio for the mental task classification by getting rid of irrelevant and superfluous features. This paper suggests an approach to augment the performance of a learning algorithm for the mental task classification on the utility of power spectral density (PSD) using feature selection. This paper also deals a comparative analysis of multivariate and univariate feature selection for mental task classification. After applying the above stated method, the findings demonstrate substantial improvements in the performance of learning model for mental task classification. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed approach is endorsed by carrying out a robust ranking algorithm and Friedman&#39;s statistical test for finding the best combinations and compare various combinations of PSD and feature selection methods.},

In this paper, we propose a unified model, enhanced attentive recurrent neural network ( EARNN ), for both answer selection and answer ranking tasks by taking full advantages of both Q&amp;A semantics and multifacet domain effects (i.e., topic effects and timeliness). Specifically, we develop a serialized long short-term memory to learn the unified representations of Q&amp;A, where two attention mechanisms at either sentence level or word level are designed for capturing the deep effects of topics. Meanwhile, the emphasis of Q&amp;A can be automatically distinguished. Furthermore, we design a time-sensitive ranking function to model the timeliness in CQA. To effectively train EARNN , a question-dependent pairwise learning strategy is also developed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Quora. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed EARNN model.},

The main innovation of the TRASIM is to build a universal framework to establish the similarity transformation via bidirectional rewarping to simulate different types of retargeting operators. Based on the similarity transformation, geometric distortion and content loss are measured to determine the retargeting quality. Experimental results on two widely used databases (CUHK and RetargetMe) indicate that the proposed TRASIM has higher consistency with subjective ranks, compared with the state-of-the-art IRQA metrics.},

Along with applying ubiquitous cellular network communication to deliver (delay tolerant) EVs&#39; charging reservations, we further study the feasibility of applying opportunistic vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication with delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) nature, due primarily to its flexibility and cost-efficiency in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).

In this paper, we build a vision-based, robust, and real-time robotic grasping approach with fully convolutional neural network. The main component of our approach is a grasp detection network with oriented anchor boxes as detection priors. Because the orientation of detected grasps is significant, which determines the rotation angle configuration of the gripper, we propose the orientation anchor box mechanism to regress grasp angle based on predefined assumption instead of classification or regression without any priors. With oriented anchor boxes, the grasps can be predicted more accurately and efficiently. Besides, to accelerate the network training and further improve the performance of angle regression, angle matching is proposed during training instead of Jaccard index matching. Fivefold cross-validation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 98.8\% and 97.8\% in image-wise split and object-wise split, respectively, and the speed of our detection algorithm is 67 frames per second (FPS) with GTX 1080Ti, outperforming all the current state-of-the-art grasp detection algorithms on Cornell Dataset both in speed and accuracy. Robotic experiments demonstrate the robustness and generalization ability in unseen objects and real-world environment, with the average success rate of 90.0\% and 84.2\% of familiar things and unseen things, respectively, on Baxter robot platform.},

Slippage is hard to avoid due to the possible existence of ice, sand, or muddy roads. To overcome the effect of slippage, an adaptive trajectory tracking controller for leader robot is designed, such that the leader robot can keep up with the virtual reference trajectory and estimate the real value of unknown slipping ratio accurately. In addition, it is difficult for each follower robot to obtain leader&#39;s states in a large formation system, so distributed formation controllers are designed based on distributed observers. It is shown that the proposed controllers can realize formation objective and overcome the slippage constraints at the same time. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controllers is verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Target recognition is a challenging task for human following of mobile service robots. In this paper, we combine the principal-component-analysis (PCA)-based face recognition with the tracking-learning-detection applied to the human face (Face-TLD) to obtain an improvement, named as IFace-TLD. The proposed IFace-TLD can significantly improve the discrimination ability of the Face-TLD for ambiguous facial appearances. To further deal with motion uncertainties of the human head, especially the sudden motion change, which makes face-based target recognition methods unstable or even loses the target, a skeleton-based model is introduced to improve the accuracy and robustness of the target recognition. Specifically, within a walk half-cycle, the skeleton features are extracted from the upper-body three-dimensional skeleton coordinates. Then, the extracted skeleton features are fed into the support vector data description (SVDD) to identify the target person when the IFace-TLD becomes invalid. The seamless fusion of the skeleton recognition and the IFace-TLD, named as the SIFace-TLD, significantly enhances the robustness in complex scenarios, especially for people tracking from both front and behind. To achieve a complete human following system, the particle filter (PF) is adopted for estimating the state of the human motion. And then, a controller is designed to maintain the relative position between the robot and the target. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IFace-TLD is more accurate and flexible than the original Face-TLD. And the SIFace-TLD shows a robust performance to human motion uncertainties. Moreover, the developed controller can achieve a satisfactory human following performance.},

  abstract     = {Two novel nonlinear pose (i.e., attitude and position) filters developed directly on the Special Euclidean Group SE(3) able to guarantee prescribed characteristics of transient and steady-state performance are proposed. The position error and normalized Euclidean distance of attitude error are trapped to arbitrarily start within a given large set and converge systematically and asymptotically to the origin from almost any initial condition. The transient error is guaranteed not to exceed a prescribed value while the steady-state error is bounded by a predefined small value. The first pose filter operates based on a set of vectorial measurements coupled with a group of velocity vectors and requires preliminary pose reconstruction. The second filter, on the contrary, is able to perform its function using a set of vectorial measurements and a group of velocity vectors directly. Both proposed filters provide reasonable pose estimates with superior convergence properties while being able to use measurements obtained from low-cost inertial measurement, landmark measurement, and velocity measurement units. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed filters considering large error in initialization and high level of uncertainties in velocity vectors as well as in the set of vector measurements.},

To handle the signal transmissions between sensor nodes and the MH estimator, a constrained communication channel is employed whose channel constraints implies that at each time instant, only one sensor node is permitted to access the communication channel and then send its measurement data. The RA protocol, whose scheduling behavior is characterized by a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), is utilized to orchestrate the access sequence of sensor nodes. By extending the robust MH estimation method, a novel nonlinear MH estimation scheme and the corresponding approximate MH estimation scheme are developed to cope with the state estimation task. Subsequently, some sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the estimation error is exponentially ultimately bounded in mean square. Based on that the main results are further specialized to linear systems with the RA protocol scheduling. Finally, two numerical examples and the corresponding figures are provided to verify the effectiveness/correctness of the developed MH estimation scheme and approximate MH estimation scheme.},

One of the main challenges in WLAN-based indoor positioning is the severe fluctuation of received signal strength (RSS), which may cause the RSS patterns to be mismatched and the positioning to be inaccurate. In this paper, an indoor positioning algorithm that combines the fingerprint scheme with mobility prediction is proposed. Since the mobility prediction is performed according to the moving speed and direction of the mobile client, the resulting location estimation is more stable compared to the use of RSS alone. Experimental results show that the proposed positioning algorithm can mitigate the impact of the RSS fluctuation and has better positioning accuracy and stability than previous fingerprint-based approaches.},

Furthermore, when the obstacles are detected by the sonar, an improved A* algorithm is employed to avoid the obstacles.

Within the proposed composite control scheme, the combination of the disturbance estimation information and the H ∞ technique enables the entire hybrid system precisely performing.

Regarding the nonideal communication network, we consider network-induced delays and packet disorders, which are common during packet transmission through networks. In order to cope with packet disorders, an active packet loss approach is introduced. As such, a new time-delay system model is established, by which the filtering error system is modeled as a switched system with an interval time-varying delay. Then, by employing piecewise Lyapunov functional method and average dwell time technique, some criteria are derived to ensure that the filtering error system can achieve a prescribed level of H ∞ performance.

Existing community detection algorithms have demonstrated their effectiveness on a variety of complex networks, most of them, however, suffer from the scalability issue on complex networks without a clear community structure due to the challenge in the detection of ambiguous community structure. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a community structure enhancement method, termed CSE, for community detection in complex networks. In the proposed CSE, the community structure of a network is enhanced by adding links between the nodes possibly belonging to the same community and reducing links between those belonging to different communities, thereby converting an ambiguous community structure into a structure much clearer than the original one. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed CSE over five state-of-the-art community detection algorithms on both synthetic benchmark networks and real-world networks, especially for those without a clear community structure.},

However, the normal backstepping method is only an effective method structured to control lower-triangular systems. Since the method is strictly limited to the system structure, the previous works cannot solve the problem considered. Thus, we employ the cross backstepping method to solve the problem of partial and alternate time-varying state constraints. For the constrained subsystems, the time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) is employed to ensure that the violation of any time-varying constraint does not occur. Besides, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to approximate the uncertainties. Then, based on the stability analysis, it is concluded that the output follows the desired trajectory as closely as possible, all the signals in closed-loop systems are bounded, and the alternate time-varying state constraints are never violated. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

This presented controller includes two subcontrollers: 1) a roll angle, pitch angle, and altitude subcontroller and 2) a horizontal position subcontroller. In the controller design, the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the coefficient matrix is applied to overcome the singularity of the roll angle. Third, the stability of both of the designed subcontrollers is verified by the Lyapunov stability theorem, and the convergence of the designed subcontrollers is analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and the designed controller.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement in information technology, datasets with an enormous amount of data are available. The classification task on these datasets is more time- and memory-consuming as the number of data increases. The support vector machine (SVM), which is arguably the most popular classification technique, has disappointing performance in dealing with large datasets due to its constrained optimization problem. To deal with this challenge, the variant SVM (VSVM) has been utilized which has the fraction (1/2)b 2 in its primal objective function, where b is the bias of the desired hyperplane. The VSVM has been solved with different optimization techniques in more time- and memory-efficient fashion. However, there is no guarantee that its optimal solution is the same as the standard SVM. In this paper, we introduce the generalized VSVM (GVSVM) which has the fraction (1/2t)b 2 in its primal objective function, for a fixed positive scalar t. Further, we present the thorough theoretical insights that indicate the optimal solution of the GVSVM tends to the optimal solution of the standard SVM as t → ∞. One vital corollary is to derive a closed-form formula to obtain the bias term in the standard SVM. Such a formula obviates the need of approximating it, which is the modus operandi to date. An efficient neural network is then proposed to solve the GVSVM dual problem, which is asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov and converges globally exponentially to the exact solution of the GVSVM. The proposed neural network has less complexity in architecture and needs fewer computations in each iteration in comparison to the existing neural solutions. Experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed recurrent neural network and the proximity of the GVSVM and the standard SVM solutions with more significant values of t.},

  abstract     = {For complex distributed parameter systems (DPSs) with strong nonlinearities and time-varying dynamics, the conventional spatiotemporal modeling methods become ill-suited since the elementary assumption that the process data follow a unimodal Gaussian distribution usually becomes invalid. In this paper, a multimode method is proposed for modeling of such systems. First, the original operating space is partitioned along the time dimension into several subspaces via modified dissimilarity analysis. Each subspace represents the local spatiotemporal characteristics of the original system. Second, the Karhunen-Loève decomposition (KLD)-based spatiotemporal modeling approach is applied to approximate the local dynamics of each subspace. Finally, an ensemble model is obtained using the soft weighting sum of the local ones, where the corresponding weights are calculated by principal component regression. By properly decomposing the original space into several local parts, the ensemble model is capable of handling the strong nonlinearities and time-varying dynamics of the system. The validity and efficiency of the proposed method are verified on two representative applications: 1) a one-dimensional parabolic catalytic rod and 2) a two-dimensional curing thermal process. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides a superior performance regarding modeling accuracy compared to several baselines.},

Each joint moves in an unpredictable way with uncountable possibilities of movements direction under the influence of one or many of its parent joints. This paper presents a method for human motion quantification via three-dimensional (3-D) body joints coordinates. We calculate a set of metrics that influence the joints movement considering the motion of its parent joints without requiring prior knowledge of the motion parameters. Only the raw joints coordinates data of a motion sequence are needed to automatically estimate the transformation matrix of the joints between frames. We also consider the angles between limbs as a fundamental factor to follow the joints directions. We classify the joints motion as global motion and local motion. The global motion represents the joint movement according to a fixed joint, and the local motion represents the joint movement according to its first parent joint. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we also propose a comparison algorithm between two skeletons motions based on the quantified metrics. We measured the comparative similarity between the 3-D joints coordinates on Microsoft Kinect V2 and UTD-MHAD dataset. User studies were conducted to evaluate the performance under different factors. Various results and comparisons have shown that our method effectively quantifies and evaluates the motion similarity.},

So far, three-dimensional (3-D) Otsu method has been based on histogram, which has only probability distribution of pixels as an object of interest. Histogram-based segmentation methods do not consider the contextual information which is significant to enrich the quality of segmented image. In this paper, a context-based 3-D Otsu algorithm has been proposed that considers the pixel intensity values as well as spatial information along with same properties of histogram. The proposed method is evaluated comprehensively with respect to quality and a detailed analysis is presented to compare the results of histogram-based 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D Otsu and energy-based 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D Otsu method, respectively. Experimental outcomes demonstrate the superiority of energy-based 3-D Otsu algorithm compared to histogram-based methods in terms of improved performance metrics, including mean error (ME), mean square error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), feature similarity index (FSIM), structure similarity index (SSIM), and entropy. Experiments on standard daily life color images have been carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed method can produce more promising segmentation results from the aspect of objective and subjective observations.},

The closed-loop attitude stabilization system is governed by the controller to be exponentially stable with disturbance rejected. The observer error of disturbance, the attitude, and the angular velocity are exponentially stabilized to be zero or within a small set with an arbitrary radius. The key feature of this scheme is that it ensures the control performance to be more robust to any external disturbance. The controller has a simple structure and does not involve complicated computation. The effectiveness of the presented solution is validated by a rigid satellite example.},

By employing the switched quadratic Lyapunov function technique and establishing multiple recursive formulas, sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee that the considered system is asymptotically stable under the arbitrary switching signal (ASS) case and exponentially stable under the restricted switching signal (RSS) case with the 2-D TSR- ϑ-dissipativity, respectively. The special cases, such as the 2-D passivity performance and the 2-D H ∞ performance, are also discussed. Based on the obtained dissipative stability conditions, the 2-D TSR- ϑ-dissipative state feedback controller and filter design problems are further studied for the addressed system. Particularly, the extended average dwell time (define this later on in text) technique is utilized for the system under the RSS case.

Currently, the greedy strategy is widely adopted, which limits the quality of the service (QoS) and the profit of the entire system. There are two crucial tasks in this system: 1) the pairwise prioritization and 2) the matching of taxi-passenger pairs. In this paper, we develop a two-stage taxi-passenger matching system to deal with these two tasks. In the first stage, we design a fuzzy controller to assign a priority score to each taxi-passenger pair in real time. To ensure its performance on providing good QoS and profit, the fuzzy controller is optimized by an offline differential evolution algorithm. New individual representation is designed to optimize the membership functions and fuzzy rule base simultaneously. To accelerate the optimization process, the algorithm is implemented in a parallel way. Then, in the second stage, considering the priority scores as weights in the bipartite graph of taxi and passenger sets, we further apply a polynomial Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to find the maximum weight perfect matching in the bipartite graph. Simulated results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which is able to enhance the QoS provided by the taxi system and improve the profit gained by the taxi service company.},

With mild conditions on the weight coefficients in the parameter update, the algorithm is proved to be convergent in mean square and the convergence rate can be the reciprocal of the number of observations, which has the same order as the optimal estimation when the system output is exactly known. Furthermore, it is also shown that the Cramér–Rao (CR) lower bound is achieved asymptotically with proper weight coefficients, which indicates that the algorithm is optimal in the sense of asymptotic efficiency.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the dynamic performance of subway transportation systems. A three-layer model, consisting of a rail layer, a train layer, and a passenger layer, is proposed to describe the structure and operation of a metro system. Two parameters, namely, time efficiency and maximum load ratio, are proposed to assess the transport efficiency and the train utilization rate, respectively. Case studies of the metro networks in Beijing, Tokyo, and Hong Kong show that the time efficiency decreases nonlinearly with the increase of vehicle resource and passenger demand, whereas maximum load ratio varies in an opposite manner. For the three metro networks under study, the Tokyo metro system has the highest time efficiency when passengers adopt a shortest-path (SP) routing strategy, while the Hong Kong system&#39;s highest time efficiency exceeds the others&#39; when passengers adopt a minimum-transfer-path (MTP) strategy. In general, the maximum time efficiency is higher when passengers adopt SP routing rather than MTP routing. Moreover, the Beijing metro system has the highest maximum load ratio, regardless of the passengers&#39; routing behavior. This paper can be applied to a metro network to optimize the train departure interval under a certain passenger entrance rate, with the aim to maximize the time efficiency and maximum load ratio. Our model permits assessment of the operational effectiveness of metro systems, which helps the metro operators to improve the performance and reduce the cost.},

For acyclic graphs, we give an algorithm that converges to the exact weighted average consensus in a finite number of iterations, equal to the graph diameter. For loopy (cyclic) graphs, we offer two remedies. In the first one, we give another distributed algorithm to enable our average consensus algorithm applicable to a loopy graph by converting it into a spanning tree. In the second one, we consider a slightly modified average consensus problem whose optimal solution approximates the consensus solution with arbitrary precision, and give a modified average consensus algorithm with guaranteed exponential convergence to the optimal solution. The proposed average consensus algorithms enjoy low complexities, robustness to transmission adversaries, and asynchronous implementation. Our algorithms are conceptually different from the popular graph Laplacian approach, and converge much faster than the latter approach.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decision model (3WDM) with decision-theoretical rough sets (DTRSs) always addresses precise cost parameters and precise attribute values in uncertain problem solving. However, intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), as extensions of fuzzy sets, are described by dual parameters, namely the membership and nonmembership degrees. Therefore, under intuitionistic fuzzy environments, the 3WDM confronted great challenges when intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) cost parameters and IFN attribute values arise together. In this paper, by considering the impacts of both the IFN cost parameters and the IFN attribute values, new 3WDMs with IFNs are constructed from the membership degree and nonmembership degree perspectives, respectively. Then optimistic and pessimistic 3WDMs with IFNs are, respectively, established based on different risk preferences for more accurate decisions. Subsequently, by introducing a sequential strategy, the presented models are applied to address attribute increments in practical problems. Finally, we present a numerical example and some experiments to validate the efficiency of sequential 3WDMs.},

Generally, the navigation problems of mobile service robot can be summarized to three aspects: 1) human detection; 2) robot real-time localization; and 3) robot motion planning. The purpose of this paper is to provide a feasible strategy to integrate these three aspects to achieve a conscious, safe, accurate, robust, and efficient navigation. We first introduce the human detection system for recognition of human gesture using a weighted dynamic time warping (DTW) with kinematic constraints. Thus, by interpreting the human body language through gesture recognition, robot motion behaviors like heading to the assigned position or following people can be activated. Then, for the robot localization, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method based on artificial and natural landmark recognition is employed to provide absolute position feedback in real time. For the motion planning, a novel quadrupole potential field (QPF) method is proposed to plan collision-free trajectories, adequately considering the nonholomic constraint of the mobile robot system. Then, a robust kinematic controller is designed for trajectory tracking to account for slip disturbances. Such a design automatically merges path finding, trajectory generation, and trajectory tracking in a closed-loop fashion, achieving simultaneous motion planning for obstacle avoidance and feedback stabilization to a desired position and orientation even in the presence of slippage. Finally, experiments prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy, showing a good navigation performance on mobile service robot.},

To eliminate the large lagging error in the solution of the inherently dynamic nonlinear optimization problem, the only way is to estimate the future unknown information by using the present and previous data during the solving process, which is termed the future dynamic nonlinear optimization (FDNO) problem. In this paper, to suppress noises and improve the accuracy in solving FDNO problems, a novel noise-tolerant neural (NTN) algorithm based on zeroing neural dynamics is proposed and investigated. In addition, for reducing algorithm complexity, the quasi-Newton Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method is employed to eliminate the intensively computational burden for matrix inversion, termed NTN-BFGS algorithm. Moreover, theoretical analyses are conducted, which show that the proposed algorithms are able to globally converge to a tiny error bound with or without the pollution of noises. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed NTN and NTN-BFGS algorithms for the online solution of FDNO problems.},

In this paper, we first investigate the optimal control problem (OCP) of semi-random epidemic networks. By using the Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle, we obtain the optimal control strategy aimed to minimize the total epidemic incidence and control cost. We then define a centrality index which can measure average control strength of the optimal control. Based on this index, the OCP is converted into a static OCP (SOCP), whose solution is utilized to design a nonidentical constant control (NCC). NCC is suboptimal as it is optimal on a subset of the whole control set, and is determined by only the network&#39;s clustering coefficient and initial condition. We finally propose an effective targeted constant quarantine control by using this centrality index. The results uncover the relationship between the optimal control and the network&#39;s topological structure, provide a convenient method to determine suboptimal control, and present a strategy for targeted constant control.

It is proven that if the distributed nonlinear PI functions are suitably selected, the proposed algorithms can achieve consensus for high-order agents under strongly connected topologies and switching topologies with a jointly strongly connected basis (JSCB). Furthermore, we extend the consensus results to the case of time-varying topologies described by δ-connected, continuous graphs.

In view of this, an average dwell-time method-based iterative learning control (ILC) scheme is proposed in this paper. First, the multiphase process is represented as an equivalent closed-loop two-dimensional (2-D) switched system composed of stable and unstable subsystems, based on which new relevant concepts on the stability of the switched system are given. Second, using an average dwell-time method, the ILC law is designed to guarantee the system exponentially stable. Minimum running time for the stable subsystems and maximum running time for the unstable ones are obtained. Lastly, depending on the maximum time for the unstable subsystems, the idea of putting the controller switching step forward is proposed. In this way, the asynchronous switching is removed such that the unstable subsystem can be avoided. The case study on an injection molding process demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the existing 2D-MPC and one-dimensional traditional control methods.},

  abstract     = {Finding synergy between a variety of control and estimation approaches can lead to effective solutions for controlling nonlinear dynamic systems in an efficient and systematic manner. In this paper, a novel controller design consisting of generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs) and sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed to control nonlinear multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) dynamic systems. The proposed design transforms GRNN from an offline regression model to an online adaptive controller. The suggested controller does not require any pretraining and it learns quickly from scratch. It uses a low computational complexity algorithm to provide accurate and stable performance. The proposed controller (GRNNSMC) performance is verified with a generic MIMO nonlinear dynamic system and a hexacopter model with a variable center of gravity. The results are compared with the standard PID controller. In addition, the stability of the GRNNSMC controller is verified using the Lyapunov stability method.},

  abstract     = {The hyperbolic cosine function with high-order errors can be utilized to improve the accuracy of adaptive filters. However, when initial weight errors are large, the hyperbolic cosine-based adaptive filter (HCAF) may be unstable. In this paper, a novel normalization based on the logarithmic hyperbolic cosine function is proposed to achieve the stabilization for the case of large initial weight errors, which generates a logarithmic HCAF (LHCAF). Actually, the cost function of LHCAF is the logarithmic hyperbolic cosine function that is robust to large errors and smooth to small errors. The transient and steady-state analyses of LHCAF in terms of the mean-square deviation (MSD) are performed for a stationary white input with an even probability density function in a stationary zero-mean white noise. The convergence and stability of LHCAF can be therefore guaranteed as long as the filtering parameters satisfy certain conditions. The theoretical results based on the MSD are supported by the simulations. In addition, a variable scaling factor and step-size LHCAF (VSS-LHCAF) is proposed to improve the filtering accuracy of LHCAF further. The proposed LHCAF and VSS-LHCAF are superior to HCAF and other robust adaptive filters in terms of filtering accuracy and stability.},

It is shown that each follower can track the leader&#39;s trajectory within a fixed time. Particularly, the gain of the presented consensus protocol is directly related to the prescribed time, which makes it convenient to determine and tune the gain according to the requirement of convergence time.

It is well known that single high-gain observers (HGOs) are not able to provide satisfactory performance when the system output is contaminated by noise, and in turn, controllers, which utilize such estimations, perform poorly. To address this issue and improve the control performance, a bank of HGOs is employed, and an appropriate combination of their estimations is used for control purposes. The proposed strategy is capable of mitigating destructive effects of measurement noise and improving transient response, and it does that because it introduces an extra design parameter. The performance recovery capabilities of MHGO-based controllers and the stability of the closed-loop system are discussed. The simulations are performed on an underwater vehicle system and a mechanical system to evaluate the performance of the MHGO-based controller. Furthermore, a detailed comparison to controllers based on conventional HGO, HGO with switching gain, and multi-observer approach is provided, which shows the superiority of the MHGO-based controller over the other methods.},

Then, an event-triggering condition and an event-triggered feedback control algorithm are designed to learn the optimal control policy and the disturbance policy in the worst case. The algorithm eliminates identifier, actor, and disturber neural networks and also relaxes the persistent excitation condition.

The existing consensus algorithms for the public BlockChain, such as proof of work (PoW) or proof of stake (PoS) does not apply to the JointCloud, because they require a massive computing power with a low throughput or monopoly risk. In this paper, we propose a practical Byzantine-fault-tolerance (PBFT)-based consensus algorithm called proof of previous transactions (PoPT), in which the accountants are selected by a specific hash function from a certain number of candidates. The candidates are chosen according to the users&#39; participation in JointCloud, and only candidates that join the PBFT-based consensus process instead of all users. We also propose a new BlockChain structure for parallel accounting to improve the scalability of JCLedger, and a consistent hashing algorithm is used to assign the transactions to different accountants. Simulation experiments show that the PoPT can shield the unequal computing power of the users to provide them equal accounting opportunities, and the parallel accounting can handle the massive and high-frequency transactions in JointCloud more efficiently.},

Three types of protocols, namely continuous, intermittent, and adaptive state feedback protocols are, respectively, proposed for achieving the constrained consensus, and meanwhile yielding consensus values. A consensus analysis is provided by virtue of state saturation theory, switched system theory, adaptive theory, and Lyapunov stability theory. Output feedback protocol is also designed. Finally, the obtained results are applied to connectivity preservation for first-order nonlinear multiagent systems, despite the presence of limited communication range and input constraints.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the adaptive event-triggered fault detection problem of semi-Markovian jump systems (S-MJSs) with output quantization. First, we develop an adaptive event-triggered scheme for S-MJSs that is more effective than conventional event-triggered strategy for decreasing network transmission information. Meanwhile, we design a new adaptive law that can dynamically adjust the event-triggered threshold. Second, we consider output signal quantization and transmission delay in the proposed fault detection scheme. Moreover, we establish novel sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability in the proposed fault detection scheme with an H ∞ performance with the help of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The quadruped robot imitates the motions of four-legged animals with a superior flexibility and adaptability to complex terrains, compared with the wheeled and tracked robots. Its leader-following ability is unique to help a human to accomplish complex tasks in a more convenient way. However, long-term following is severely obstructed due to the high-frequency vibration of the quadruped robot and the unevenness of terrains. To solve this problem, a visual approach under a novel T-D-R framework is proposed. The proposed T-D-R framework is composed of a visual tracker based on correlation filter, a person detector with deep learning, and a person re-identification (re-ID) module. The result of the tracker is verified by the detector to improve tracking performance. Especially, the re-ID module is introduced to handle distractions and occlusion caused by other persons, where the convolutional correlation filter (CCF) is employed to discriminate the leader among multiple persons through recording the appearance information in the long run. By comparing the results of the tracker and the detector as well as their similarity scores with the leader identified by the re-ID module, a stable and real-time tracking of the leader can be guaranteed. Experiments reveal that our approach is effective in handling distractions, appearance changes, and illumination variations. A long-distance experiment on a quadruped robot indicates the validity of the proposed approach.},

The online FPC is developed based on linear model predictive control (MPC) by replanning the trajectories of the center of mass (CoM) and properly placing the footsteps to resist external disturbances and recover the walking posture. To further improve the robustness of the humanoid robots to suppress strong external disturbance, a strategy of upper body posture control is proposed. The presented controller stabilizes the humanoid robot by utilizing hip joints to modulate the upper body posture online.

To overcome this difficulty, we give a robust observer design scheme by using convex combination approach. Furthermore, develop an observer-based output feedback control strategy. During the procedure of control design, adaptive neural control approach is used to deal with the unknown nonlinear functions and backstepping technique is employed to construct the ideal control laws. It is shown that the presented control law achieves the control issue of getting small tracking error, meanwhile, ensuring boundedness of all the closed-loop signals.

Under the mentioned conditions, the objective of this paper is to make all the followers’ states converge to the convex hull shaped by the leaders’ states with an expected exponential rate.

  abstract     = {The high penetration of renewable energy sources always leads to the fluctuation of the droop coefficients which are designed in inverse proportion to their rated capacity, and power electronics devices are prone to static instability. Although the impedance-based approaches have been widely studied to deal with this problem, the stability-oriented droop coefficients region identification due to the fluctuation of renewable energy sources is not provided. Thus, this article proposes an impedance-based approach to assess the droop coefficients stability region in the power system consisting of numerous distributed generators (DGs). First, the modified phase margin and opposing argument (MPMOA) forbidden criterion is constituted to acquire the complementary space of the droop coefficients stability region. The MPMOA forbidden criterion is first transformed into the condition that the generalized return-ratio matrix is Hurwitz through mirror, rotation, and translation mapping. In comparison with the previous simplified stability criteria, the conservatism of the proposed criterion is reduced a lot. Thereafter, the droop coefficients stability region is directly calculated by the generalized return-ratio matrix and guardian map theory. Eventually, the simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the conservatism and effectiveness of the impedance-based stability region identification approach. Therein, the simulation results illustrate that the proposed droop coefficients stability operation criterion has lower conservatism than these of the previous simplified stability criteria. Furthermore, the simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed stability-oriented droop coefficients region identification approach can provide an effective parameter stability region.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a dynamic sliding mode control (SMC) approach to the robust voltage regulation of dc-dc boost converters by using interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks (IT2FNNs). First, uncertainties caused by the perturbation of the input inductor and the output capacitor are represented with some bounded approximation errors, by the utilization of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling approach. Based on the represented model of the boost converter, a new type of sliding surface is designed depending on the duty cycle and reference inputs of the converter. Then, a dynamic SMC law is designed, by considering that the perturbation of the uncertain parameters, including input inductor, output capacitor, load resistor, and input voltage, is bounded. Meanwhile, we adopt an exponential plus power approaching law in the sliding mode controller for fast reachability of the sliding surface and a small chattering in the duty cycle input. Moreover, in terms of the considered uncertainties, a novel IT2FNN-based dynamic SMC law is derived, by applying simplified ellipsoidal-type membership functions in the type-2 fuzzy neural network. To improve the capacity to manage the uncertainties, some online learning algorithms for the updating of the IT2FNN are designed by a gradient descent method (GDM), without the requirement of the boundedness of the uncertainties. The resulting tracking error system is synthesized to be bounded stable based on the designed IT2FNN-based dynamic SMC. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive IT2FNN-based dynamic SMC method is verified by some comparative simulation results.},

The principle target of modeling the reliable control for PMSM is to improve the performance of PMSM in terms of speed of response, tracking accuracy, and robustness. In contrast to work found in the literature, the proposed dynamic model of a PMSM the load torque variation acts as disturbances, speed control strategy is developed based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and stochastic actuator faults are considered which is more practical and challenging. In such a manner, first, the nonlinear PMSM model is altered into corresponding linear submodels through the sufficient T-S fuzzy membership rules. Then, based on the obtained dynamic model, reliable H ∞ control is designed for the considered PMSM. By executing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional together with linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization procedure, Wirtinger-based integral inequality approach, and arrangement of the delay-dependent adequate condition is determined which ensures that the closed-loop PMSM is robust asymptotic stable. Based on the acquired condition, the controller gains are derived by solving a set of LMIs. At last, the simulation results are depicted to validate the efficiency of our presented control method.},

Distinct to the existing controller schemes, the proposed fuzzy integral sliding mode control (FISMC) scheme contains the ET condition which needs to be satisfied for the activation of the controller. Besides that, the network-induced communication constraints are considered into the derivation of sufficient conditions, and then the corresponding stabilization issue is attenuated in the sense of H ∞ control performance. In addition, the appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) candidate is constructed and evaluated through convex matrix inequality approach that ensures the stable H ∞ performance of the closed-loop system in terms of solvable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Further, instead of considering the general problem for the validation of the proposed result, the stabilization problem of nonlinear chaotic permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) model is taken into account for the validation of the proposed sufficient conditions.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the fuzzy integral sliding-mode control (ISMC) for permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). To do this, by using the double orthogonal complement and Frobenius theorem, the existence condition of the fuzzy sliding surface is presented. By constructing a suitable fuzzy Lyapunov function and introducing slack matrices, the sufficient conditions are gained via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the concerned model to be asymptotically stable and passive. Further, the reachability of the switching surface is ensured by the considered fuzzy sliding-mode control laws. Besides that an adaptive fuzzy ISMC is constructed to derive the passivity criterion. For the demonstration, the presented control strategy is validated with nonlinear PMSG-based WECS. Finally, the effectiveness of the derived theoretical result is established by the numerical parameter values of PMSG-based wind-turbine model.},

  abstract     = {Multimicrogrid (MMG) systems play an increasingly important role in the smart grid. They come with various potential cyberattacks, which may cause power supply interruption or even human casualties. Therefore, decision-making for timely mitigation of cyberattack risks is highly desirable in the security protection of power systems. However, there is a lack of effective decentralized decision-making strategies that are able to deal with MMG scenarios through distributed consensus. To address this issue, a decentralized consensus decision-making (DCDM) approach is proposed in this article for the security of MMG systems. It achieves decentralized consensus without the need of a trusted authority or central server, making it distinct from existing consensus methods. Meanwhile, it guarantees the consistency and nonrepudiability of consensus results, which are stored on the blockchain in sequence. In each of the distributed agents, the approach consists of a fuzzy static Bayesian game model (FSB-GM) to determine the optimal security strategy and a hybrid consensus algorithm to achieve consensus. The FSB-GM considers the fuzzy preferences of different types of attackers and defenders. The hybrid consensus algorithm is implemented by the fusion improvement of two consensus mechanisms in the blockchain. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through a case study on an MMG system.},

  abstract     = {An engineered system is designed to deliver certain performance related to its quality-of-service, and while doing so, it must also maintain stable operation. Resilience of a system is its ability to continue to offer system performance stably, while withstanding any adverse events. Motivated by this concept, we propose to measure the resilience level of a power system by quantifying its stability level as measured by: transient stability margin (TSM), critical clearance time (CCT), relay margin (RM), and load security margin (LSM), as well as its performance level as measured by: load loss (LL) and recovery/repair time (RT) while being exposed to adverse events. For comparability, we also propose a normalization for each of the 6 measures to a number in the unit interval [0, 1], which is scale-invariant, and further probabilistically average each of those across all possible sequences of faults (of a specified length) against their occurrence probabilities to arrive at a set of 6 unit-interval valued indices. New polynomial complexity algorithms (in the number of generators) are proposed for estimating TSM (in form of volume of region of stability) and CCT; new quadratic program formulation for precise computation of RM is developed and implemented; also, new security and stability informed notions of LSM and LL are introduced and implemented by extending continuation power flow. Such quantification of resilience levels provides a numerical measure to compare the relative abilities of different power grids to withstand the impact of sequences of adverse events. The proposed approach is illustrated by computing and comparing the resilience of three similar power system topologies differing only in the location of generators. The framework is further validated by implementing it on the IEEE 30-bus test system.},

In this article, a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine systems (WTSs) are integrated into each area of the power system. The main reason behind the integration is because the power factor has the ability to destabilize the performance of the power supply. To ensure the stability of the LSMAIPS, a decentralized sampled-data feedback load frequency control is designed. The stability and stabilization conditions are derived through constructing suitable Lyapunov function which contains the sampling information and the solvable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) along with an evaluation of H ∞ performance.

In comparison with some traditional state-dependent event-triggered communication schemes, since the proposed QEC depends not only on the state of controlled plant but also on the QoS of communication network, higher communication efficiency can be achieved. Then, a resilient LFC is well developed based on the proposed QEC, where “resilient” implies that: 1) for a normal QoS case, less packets are transmitted to save the communication resources and 2) for an abnormal QoS case, more packets are transmitted to mitigate the influence of nonideal QoS. Moreover, the proposed method provides a better way to balance the control performance and communication resource by reasonably choosing the parameters of QEC.

Based on the DHPN model, a novel dynamic ED integrated with security control is proposed to overcome the issues that cannot be solved in conventional models. Furthermore, to reduce the computational complexity and unified the mathematical model of the DERs, the inverter-based power control strategy is converted to a predictive control model which can be decomposed into several subsystems.

Then, based on the MOEA/D framework, a probabilistic penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) with gradient descent differential evolution (GDDE) algorithm is proposed to search the optimal scheme from these regions under different uncertainty budgets. To ensure reliable and low risk operation of the hybrid energy system, the Markov inequality is employed to deduce a proper interval of the uncertainty budget. Further, a fuzzy grid technique is proposed to choose the best scheme for real-world applications. The experimental results confirm that the probabilistic adjustable parameters can properly control the uncertainty budget and lower the risk probability. Further, it is also shown that the proposed MOEA/D-GDDE can significantly enhance the optimization efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Economic dispatching of generating units in a power system can significantly reduce the energy cost of the system. However, the economic dispatch (ED) problem is highly constrained, and often has disconnected feasible regions because of various physical features. Enhancing population diversity is critical for the evolutionary approach to fully explore and exploit the feasible regions. In this article, we propose a density-enhanced multiobjective evolutionary approach to solve ED problem. An ED problem is first transformed into a tri-objective optimization problem, and then multiobjective optimization techniques are employed to fully optimize the constraints and cost function simultaneously. The first two objectives are derived from the original ED problem, while the third one is a novel density objective constructed by niching methods to enhance population diversity. These three objectives are optimized simultaneously by a dynamic dominance relation, which can make a good balance among feasibility, diversity, and convergence. To evaluate the performance of this proposed approach, 22 benchmark problems and seven real-world ED problems with different features are tested in this article. The experimental results show that our approach performs better than or at least competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms, especially on large-scale ED problems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a convex optimization problem which minimizes the sum of local agents&#39; cost functions subject to certain local constraints. Besides, both the local cost function and local constraints are only known by the local agent itself. To solve this problem, a new accelerated distributed gradient-based algorithm is proposed, which is inspired by the “momentum” phenomena in nature and aims to accelerate the convergence speed of conventional distributed gradient algorithms. Sufficient conditions for the stepsizes and the acceleration gains are derived to ensure the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, based on this proposed fast distributed algorithm, a new decentralized approach is proposed to solve economic dispatch problem, especially for a large-scale power system. Based on the idea of virtual agent, it is proved that this decentralized algorithm is equivalent to the original fast distributed gradient method. Several case studies implemented on IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 118-bus power systems, and a large-scale power system consisting of 1000 generators are conducted to validate the proposed method.},

We give a unified model to accommodate different types of thruster faults (e.g., partial, total, time-varying stuck, hard-over, and bias faults) in a common framework, which is significant because existing methods can only address them separately in a fault-specific manner. To eliminate the quantization effect induced by the communication channel by which the UMV outputs (e.g., position and velocity) and the control inputs are transmitted to and from the remote control station, a new dynamic uniform quantizer with an adjustable range of sensitivity is given. Via flexible choice of parameters, the adjustment range can fall within that of the existing results in the fault-free case. A quantized sliding mode controller and a dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy are then developed to suppress oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error and the yaw angle in the presence of thruster faults. Simulation studies have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Since the learning of attribute classifiers is independent of the learning of object classifier in zero-shot learning, it is difficult to guarantee that the learned attribute classifiers are optimal for the subsequent object recognition tasks. Therefore, a novel zero-shot learning method based on multitask extended attribute groups (MTEAGs) is proposed by using the multitask learning framework and grouping idea. First, we used an unsupervised clustering method to group the attributes and object classes of training images. Then, based on the obtained attribute and class groups, we constructed the group-based attribute/object classifier collaborative learning model where the class groups are viewed as the extension of attribute groups. In order to explore the shared features within a group as well restrict the feature sharing between groups, we applied the structured sparse method to constrain the model parameter matrix. At last, a hybrid zero-shot classifying model is designed by simultaneously considering the class-class and class-attribute matrices to predict the class labels of testing images, where the class-class relationship is measured by the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Experiments on two popular attribute datasets show that, MTEAG can yield higher zero-shot image classification accuracy compared with several baselines.},

The tracking control of the velocity and altitude of the HFV is designed by using a prescribed performance control technique. It allows that transient characteristics of the tracking errors can be improved and adjusted by some prescribed performance functions. According to an adaptive backstepping control design procedure, novel continuous control laws of the fuel equivalency ratio, canard deflection, and elevator deflection are designed with logarithmic quantization mechanism, for the sake of avoiding inadvertently increasing the effective gains of continuous controllers as well as reducing loads of the communication from controller unit to actuator unit. Besides, the limited tracking errors of the flight path angle and angle-of-attack can be achieved by applying the designed controllers.

The relationship between a predesigned non-negative auxiliary function and a given exponentially decreasing threshold function is used to describe the switching. Under this novel controller, sufficient conditions for the quasi-synchronization are derived by the impulsive differential inequality. In addition, by choosing appropriate parameters or initial conditions such that the initial value of the non-negative auxiliary function is less than that of the event-triggered function, the quasi-synchronization can be realized theoretically as long as the event-triggered impulsive intensity is less than 1. This greatly reduces the conservatism of the existing quasi-synchronization results. Furthermore, the event-triggered rules can avoid the Zeno behavior as long as the event-triggered impulsive intensity is less than 1. This hybrid mechanism can reduce the amount of impulsive control and lessen the network communication. Finally, one example is given to illustrate the validness of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {In the past few years, kernel-based one-class extreme learning machine (ELM) receives quite a lot of attention by researchers for offline/batch learning due to its noniterative and fast learning capability. This paper extends this concept for adaptive online learning with regularized kernel-based one-class ELM classifiers for detection of outliers, and are collectively referred to as ORK-OCELM. Two frameworks, viz., boundary and reconstruction, are presented to detect the target class in ORK-OCELM. The kernel hyperplane-based baseline one-class ELM model considers whole data in a single chunk, however, the proposed one-class classifiers are adapted in an online fashion from the stream of training samples. The performance of ORK-OCELM is evaluated on a standard benchmark as well as synthetic datasets for both types of environments, i.e., stationary and nonstationary. While evaluating on stationary datasets, these classifiers are compared against batch learning-based one-class classifiers. Similarly, while evaluating on nonstationary datasets, the comparison is done with incremental learning-based online one-class classifiers. The results indicate that the proposed classifiers yield better or similar outcomes for both. In the nonstationary dataset evaluation, adaptability of the proposed classifiers in a changing environment is also demonstrated. It is further shown that the proposed classifiers have large stream data handling capability even under limited system memory. Moreover, the proposed classifiers gain significant time improvement compared to traditional online one-class classifiers (in all aspects of training and testing). A faster learning ability of the proposed classifiers makes them more suitable for real-time anomaly detection.},

  abstract     = {The full information estimation (FIE) problem is addressed for discrete time-varying systems (TVSs) subject to the effects of a round-Robin (RR) protocol. A shared communication network is adopted for data transmissions between sensor nodes and the state estimator. In order to avoid data collisions in signal transmission, only one sensor node could have access to the network and communicate with the state estimator per time instant. The so-called RR protocol, which is also known as the token ring protocol, is employed to orchestrate the access sequence of sensor nodes, under which the chosen sensor node communicating with the state estimator could be modeled by a periodic function. A novel recursive FIE scheme is developed by defining a modified cost function and using a so-called “backward-propagation-constraints.” The modified cost function represents a special global estimation performance. The solution of the proposed FIE scheme is achieved by solving a minimization problem. Then, the recursive manner of such a solution is studied for the purpose of online applications. For the purpose of ensuring the estimation performance, sufficient conditions are obtained to derive the upper bound of the norm of the state estimation error (SEE). Finally, two illustrative examples are proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed estimation algorithm.},

For the underlying SN, it is assumed that only the measurement outputs from partial sensor nodes are available. Also, the phenomenon of censored measurements is taken into account to reflect the limited capability in measuring. A new H ∞ -consensus performance index is put forward to evaluate the disturbance rejection level of the filters against the simultaneous presence of external disturbances, initial conditions, as well as censoring effects. By utilizing the vector dissipativity theory and the recursive matrix inequality technique, sufficient conditions are established under which the prescribed H ∞ -consensus performance index is achieved. The parameters of the desired distributed filters are calculated via solving certain matrix inequalities, where such a calculation is conducted in a local sense so as to preserve the scalability of the filter design. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed filtering strategy.},

The PMLM is formulated mathematically by using a general nonlinear discrete-time system with consideration of exogenous disturbances. Then, a new iterative dynamic linearization (IDL) is proposed to equivalently reformulate the nonlinear PMLM system with a linear input-output incremental form involving iteration-varying initial states and disturbances. The concept of ESO is introduced into iteration direction to iteratively estimate the random initial states and disturbances as well as their corresponding partial derivatives by considering all of them as a whole extended state. The proposed ESO-based DDILC scheme contains a learning control algorithm and a gradient parameter updating algorithm obtained from two distinct objective functions, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method is data-driven and no explicit model is involved. Theoretical analysis shows the robustness of the proposed method in the presence of iteration-varying initial shifts and disturbances. The simulation on PMLM is conducted to confirm the validity and applicability of the ESO-based DDILC.},

By using the modified power integrator method, we propose a new robust fixed-time consensus tracking algorithm, with which the consensus tracking can be achieved in a fixed time independent of initial conditions even in the presence of uncertainties. An observer-based fixed-time consensus tracking algorithm is also developed as an alternative method to overcome the communication loop problem.

  abstract     = {Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems are often encountered in complex system design. Most of them need to be evaluated with a large number of interactive and qualitative indices, which are difficult to be addressed effectively through the existing methods. In this paper, a novel fuzzy Choquet integral-based grey comprehensive evaluation (GCE) method, called fuzzy grey Choquet integral (FGCI), is proposed to evaluate MCDM problems with many interactive and qualitative indices. In this method, expert evaluation of qualitative indices is represented through fuzzy linguistic values. Fuzzy values are defuzzified and standardized to obtain the original evaluation matrix. The original values are replaced by the correlation coefficients, which, to a certain extent, eliminate the influence of experts&#39; subjective preference. An improved teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm is employed to identify λ-fuzzy-measures following the weights given by experts in order to enhance the consistency of weights. Then the correlation coefficients are aggregated through Choquet integral among λ-fuzzy-measures, which can reflect interactions among indices. In addition, according to the characteristics of λ-fuzzy-measures, the construction guidelines for a corresponding index system are given to overcome the limitations of FGCI. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via a practical example of green design evaluation and compared with the GCE method. The results validate its feasibility and effectiveness.},

AIS is designed for remotely tracking vessels but nowadays also becomes a useful data source to enable vessels&#39; trajectory prediction so as to facilitate early alert of potential collision risks. Recent studies focus on improving prediction accuracy through the machine learning and knowledge-based technologies but the computational cost also greatly increases due to the model complexity of these methodologies. It becomes a practical challenge to realize near real-time (NRT) trajectory prediction of a large volume of ships. For risk alert application, forecasting timeliness is one of the key design considerations. In this paper, we propose a concurrent processing cluster solution to empower advanced trajectory forecasting for hundreds of vessels in NRT. The proposed solution relies on the properly determined frameworks by customizing the desired features for an integrated solution. Meanwhile, a novel task-based load balancing strategy with newly defined metrics are proposed, which aims to reduce the makespan of jobs and outperforms the existing load balancing algorithms. A practicable cluster system has been successfully implemented, serving as a step toward unlocking the power of advanced maritime traffic forecasting technologies and enabling the benefit from the latest progress on the methodological innovation.},

Most of them are hosted in a heterogeneous distributed large-scale cloud computing environment and face inherent uncertainty, unreliability, and malicious attacks that trouble both service users and providers. To solve the problems of malicious attacks (including solo and collusion deception ones) in a public cloud computing environment, we for the first time propose a double-blind anonymous evaluation-based trust model. Based on it, cloud service providers and users are anonymously matched according to user requirements. It can be used to effectively handle some malicious attacks that intend to distort trust evaluations. Providers may secretly hide gain-sharing information into service results and send the results to users to ask for higher trust evaluations than their deserved ones. This paper proposes to adopt checking nodes to help detect such behavior. It then conducts gain-loss analysis for providers who intend to perform provider-user collusion deception. The proposed trust model can be used to effectively help one recognize collusion deception behavior and allow policy-makers to set suitable loss to punish malicious providers. Consequently, provider-initiated collusion deception behavior can be greatly discouraged in public cloud computing systems. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperform two updated methods, i.e., one based on fail-stop signature and another based on fuzzy mathematics in terms of malicious node detection ratio and speed.},

Throughout the design process, we fully consider the external and internal structures of the long short-term memory (LSTM), both of which are efficiently implemented by memristor crossbars. In the specific design of the internal structure, the parameter sharing mechanism is used between the LSTM cells to minimize the hardware design scale. In particular, we designed a circuit that requires only one memristor crossbar for each unit in the LSTM cell. The activation function, including sigmoid and tanh (hyperbolic tangent function), involved in each unit is approximated by a piecewise function, which is designed with the corresponding hardware. To verify the effectiveness of the system we designed, we test it on IMDB and SemEval datasets. Considering the huge impact of the dimensions of the input data on the scale of the hardware design, we use word2vector instead of one-hot encoding for the input data encoding. With the parameter sharing mechanism, the transformed vectors are input in different periods, so only 65 memristive crossbars are needed in the entire system to complete the sentiment analysis of the input text. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed MLSTM system.},

Moreover, to hedge against risk exposure imposed by uncertain PV resource, we employ conditional value-at-risk to perform the optimal risk-averse configuration to meet the fluctuation mitigating requirements and minimize the expected configuration as well as the risk.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a minimal-function-approximation (MFA)-based decentralized event-triggered tracking problem for uncertain interconnected systems with completely unknown nonaffine nonlinearities. It is assumed that events are triggered to transmit state variables in the sensor-to-controller channel. The existing approximation-based event-triggered control schemes for single lower-triangular nonlinear systems require multiple neural-network-based or fuzzy-based function approximators and multiple event-triggering conditions that are equal to the order of the system. Thus, all error surfaces using virtual control laws should be computed to verify the triggering conditions in the sensor part. To overcome the complexity in using these multiple function approximators and event-triggering conditions, we propose an event-triggered tracking strategy using one function approximator and one event-triggering condition for each subsystem in the decentralized control framework, regardless of the order of pure-feedback nonlinear subsystems. The proposed strategy is based on the MFA design technique and thus one event-triggering condition using a local tracking error is established for the local tracking law of each subsystem. Using the impulsive system approach and the Lyapunov stability theorem, the total closed-loop stability is analyzed rigorously and the minimum interevent times for each subsystem are derived to exclude the unexpected Zeno behavior.},

The effect of adding the second reverse edge to a directed chain graph on the dominant convergence rate is investigated. According to the relative positions of the two reverse edges, three cases are discussed, respectively. It is revealed that the dominant convergence rate of the whole network is determined only by the ranges and the relative positions of the reverse edges. Moreover, the consensus performance will not get better with the new reverse edge being added, and it decreases as the reverse range increases.

  abstract     = {Feature selection is an optional preprocessing procedure and is frequently used to improve the classification accuracy of a machine learning algorithm by removing irrelevant and/or redundant features. However, in many real-world applications, the test cost is also required for making optimal decisions, in addition to the classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, thus far, few studies have been conducted on test-cost-sensitive feature selection (TCSFS). In TCSFS, the objectives are twofold: 1) to improve the classification accuracy and 2) to decrease the test cost. Therefore, in fact, it constitutes a multiobjective optimization problem. In this paper, we transformed this multiobjective optimization problem into a single-objective optimization problem by utilizing a new evaluation function and in this paper, we propose a new general wrapper framework for TCSFS. Specifically, in our proposed framework, we add a new term to the evaluation function of a wrapper feature selection method so that the test cost of measuring features is taken into account. We experimentally tested our proposed framework, using 36 classification problems from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) repository, and compared it to some other state-of-the-art feature selection frameworks. The experimental results showed that our framework allows users to select an optimal feature subset with the minimal test cost, while simultaneously maintaining a high classification accuracy.},

By resorting to the mode-dependent Lyapunov function approach and the matrix inequality techniques, some interesting results are derived to verify the properties of the stochastic FTBs and the stochastic IO-FTSy of the asynchronous filtering error system.

In this paper, we define covariance matrix, within scatter matrix, and between scatter matrix as the measures of scatter for uncertain data objects. Also, in this paper, we extend the idea of Fisher linear discriminant analysis for uncertain objects (UFLDA). We also develop kernel Fisher discriminant analysis for uncertain objects (UKFDA). The developed uncertain kernel Fisher discriminants are for two cases: 1) when the uncertain objects are given with PDF and 2) when the uncertain objects are given with multiple points. We compare the performance of our developed uncertain Fisher discriminants (UFLDA and UKFDA) with a few other methods in classification of uncertain data objects through several examples on both simulated and real-world data.

A local energy market is defined as an aggregation of energy producers, consumers, and prosumers that are located in a restricted area and see an interest in joining together to form a so-called “energy district.” In this paper, we present a two-stage approach that enables sharing renewable energy within a district and minimizes the costs and/or maximizes the revenues deriving from the provision and the sale of energy, both for single prosumers and for the district as a whole. The main novelty with respect to the state-of-the-art is the introduction in the optimization process of a second stage that, starting from the energy exchanges determined in the first stage, redistributes to the prosumers the surplus energy, i.e., the energy produced locally that exceeds the demand of the prosumers.

Based on the uncertain dynamic model and desired target of this system, an error system is constructed. The error system is considered as a linear system with a nonlinear virtual disturbance. The motion control objective of the USLFJM can be realized by globally asymptotically stabilizing this linear system and compensating the influence of the nonlinear virtual disturbance. Then, an EID-based control system is designed to realize this control objective. Only position measurements are utilized in this paper, and the stability of the control system is proved.

In this paper, a continuous-time zeroing neurodynamics (CTZN) model for quadratic programming is first obtained via zeroing neurodynamics (ZN) method. Then, a general four-step Zhang et al. discretization formula is presented and adopted to discretize the above CTZN model, and thus the general four-step discrete-time ZN (DTZN) algorithm for the FQP is developed. For comparison, a three-step DTZN algorithm and a one-step DTZN algorithm for the FQP are also presented. It is worth noting that there is an important parameter termed stepsize in the DTZN algorithms, which is closely related to their stability. If the value of stepsize is outside its effective interval, the DTZN algorithms are impossible to achieve convergence in terms of residual errors, which leads to failure of the FQP problem solving. By utilizing bilinear transformation and Routh stability criterion, the effective stepsize interval of the general four-step DTZN algorithm is confirmed via theoretical proof. Besides, numerical results substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the general four-step DTZN algorithm as well as the accuracy of the effective stepsize interval. Finally, the general four-step DTZN algorithm is applied to fulfill the path-tracking control of different robot manipulators, with the effectiveness and superiority further validated.},

A novel event-triggered CC protocol is presented to schedule communications between agents, which depends on both local states and control inputs. Different from traditional approaches using broadcasts, a unique property of the proposed protocol is that it enables agent-to-agent data transmission. To do so, each communication link is associated with a specific local event. The estimated relative interagent states are transmitted over a specific link only when the related input-based event is detected. We develop sufficient conditions to solve CC problem under this protocol and extend it to the adaptive event-triggered protocol that does not require the global knowledge on the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian. For both protocols, we derive positive low bounds on the interevent time intervals generated by individual events, which eliminate the “Zeno phenomenon.” Feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by an example.},

  abstract     = {In semiconductor manufacturing, a process module (PM) failure in cluster tools (CTs) happens from time to time. To effectively operate a CT, such a failure should be handled in a proper and timely manner. This issue becomes much more complicated because wafer residency time constraints (WRTCs) must be met to ensure the quality for some wafer fabrication processes. With such constraints, if a tool is operated under a periodic schedule and a PM fails, it is desired that the tool can still operate under a periodic schedule if it is possible. Nevertheless, the periodic schedule after a PM failure must be different from that before its failure since in this case the tool is degraded. Thus, there must be a transient process between them. It is a great challenge to operate a tool such that it can go through such a transient process with WRTCs being always satisfied. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing PM failure response policies which can successfully transfer a CT to the feasible schedule after failure from the one before a failure. Then, efficient algorithms are developed to improve these response policies. The proposed policies are composed of simple control laws such that they can be realized in real time and online. Illustrative examples are presented to show their applications.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks (OSNs) suffer from forged messages. Current studies have typically been focused on the detection of forged messages and do not provide the analysis of the behaviors of message publishers and network strategies to suppress forged messages. This paper carries out the analysis by taking a game theoretic approach, where infinitely repeated games are constructed to capture the interactions between a publisher and a network administrator and suppress forged messages in OSNs. Critical conditions, under which the publisher is disincentivized to publish any forged messages, are identified in the absence and presence of misclassification on genuine messages. Closed-form expressions are established for the maximum number of forged messages that a malicious publisher could publish. Confirmed by the numerical results, the proposed infinitely repeated games reveal that forged messages can be suppressed by improving the payoffs for genuine messages, increasing the cost of bots, and/or reducing the payoffs for forged messages. The increasing detection probability of forged messages or decreasing misclassification probability of genuine messages also has a strong impact on the suppression of forged messages.},

The goal of clustering is to construct a good graph similarity matrix such that the similarity of points between the same classes is largest, and the similarity of points between different classes is smallest. In this paper, a more efficient subspace segmentation approach to learn a similarity matrix with large spectral gap is proposed. In our model, a robust self-representation coefficient matrix is learned by utilizing the Schatten-p norm instead of the conventional rank function. Besides, the fast block-diagonal structure of the coefficient representation matrix is enhanced by learning and optimizing the co-association matrix with the soft label of clustering results simultaneously in a unified framework. The affinity graphs constructed in this paper can clearly reveal the intrinsic structures of the data sets. Extensive experiments on the real data sets demonstrate that our proposed method can perform better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

Second, nonlinear disturbance observers are introduced to enable the control law to exponentially recover the desirable tracking performance without any offset errors in the variable invariant manifold.

In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.},

Different from continuity with probability one for stochastic systems, the absolute continuity of system solution is a key point in this paper being ensured for application of the average dwell time approach. Then, the mean-square exponential stability of the obtained sliding mode is analyzed based on two types of uncertain TRs.

  abstract     = {Palm-related biometrics have been widely studied for a long time, as the palm contains many distinctive patterns. However, most of the existing systems are designed to work within an ideal environment, such as in front of a unicolor background or in a large enclosure. Those preconditions can avoid influences of ambient light and hand distance change, but at the same time, they also limit the applications of palm recognition. In the work reported in this paper, we designed a novel red-green-blue and depth-based four-camera system that can capture the palm-related images separately in real time. The techniques of region-of-interest (ROI) location, ROI alignment, and light-source intensity optimization were studied. The ROI location method is modified to increase the robustness of hand gesture variation. Based on the depth information, we proposed the coordinate mapping and inclination rectification methods to obtain aligned ROI pairs. Using this device, we collected a video-based multimodal palm image database. After the parameter optimization and information fusion, the equal-error-rate of our approach on this database is lower than 0.47\%. The recognition rate obtained from the support-vector-machine-based fusion is higher than 99.8\%. The experimental results prove that the proposed system achieves advantages of anti-spoofing, high speed, high accuracy, and small size.},

Moreover, the vulnerability of control signals transmitted via communication network means that the actuators may receive the attacked control signals.

  abstract     = {In evolutionary computation, balancing the diversity and convergence of the population for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is one of the most challenging topics. Decomposition-based MOEAs are efficient for population diversity, especially when the branch partitions the objective space of multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a series of subspaces, and each subspace retains a set of solutions. However, a persisting challenge is how to strengthen the population convergence while maintaining diversity for decomposition-based MOEAs. To address this issue, we first define a novel metric to measure the contributions of subspaces to the population convergence. Then, we develop an adaptive strategy that allocates computational resources to each subspace according to their contributions to the population. Based on the above two strategies, we design an objective space partition-based adaptive MOEA, called OPE-MOEA, to improve population convergence, while maintaining population diversity. Finally, 41 widely used MOP benchmarks are used to compare the performance of the proposed OPE-MOEA with other five representative algorithms. For the 41 MOP benchmarks, the OPE-MOEA significantly outperforms the five algorithms on 28 MOP benchmarks in terms of the metric hypervolume.},

Computationally straightforward consensus controller design conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the former conditions are also developed for both cases.

It aims to make good use of the convolution neural network&#39;s (CNN&#39;s) potential performance in avoiding local optima and speeding up convergence by the hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) with optimal initial population, in such a way that it realizes deep and global emotion understanding in human-robot interaction. Moreover, the idea of novelty search is introduced to solve the deception problem in the HGA, which can expend the search space to help genetic algorithm jump out of local optimum and optimize large-scale parameters. In the proposal, the facial expression image preprocessing is conducted first, then the low-level expression features are extracted by using a principal component analysis. Finally, the high-level expression semantic features are extracted and recognized by WACNN which is optimized by HGA. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of WACNN, experiments on JAFFE, CK+, and static facial expressions in the wild 2.0 databases are carried out by using k -fold cross validation, and experimental results show the recognition accuracies of the proposal are superior to that of the state-of-the-art, such as local directional ternary pattern and weighted mixture deep neural network (DNN), which aim to extract discriminative and are the DNN-based methods. Moreover, recognition accuracies of the proposal are also higher than the deep CNN without HGA, which indicates that the proposal has better global optimization ability. Meanwhile, preliminary application experiments are also carried out by using the proposed algorithm on the emotional social robot system, where nine volunteers and two-wheeled robots experience the scenario of emotion understanding. Application results indicate that the wheeled robots can recognize basic expressions, such as happy, surprise, and so on.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with iterative learning control (ILC) algorithms for two-dimensional (2-D) linear discrete systems described by the first Fornasini-Marchesini model (FMMI) with iteration-varying reference trajectories/profiles. The variation of reference trajectories in iteration domain is represented by a high-order internal model (HOIM) formula. Robustness and convergence of two types of HOIM-based ILC laws with different boundary conditions are investigated, respectively. A strategy employed in this paper is to reconstruct the HOIM-based ILC process of the 2-D linear FMMI system into a set of 2-D linear inequalities or a 2-D linear Roesser model such that sufficient robustness/convergence conditions of the HOIM-based ILC laws are obtained. Under random boundary conditions, the designed ILC law (9) is capable to drive the ILC tracking error into a bounded range. Moreover, under the HOIM-based boundary conditions, a perfect tracking to the iteration-varying reference trajectories can be achieved by utilizing the proposed ILC law (32). Two simulation examples are given to validate the effectiveness of the two proposed ILC algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the medium between two reconfigurable sensor nodes characterized by radio interfaces that support multiple channels for exchanging real-time messages under energy constraints. These constraints are violated if the consumed energy in transmission is higher than the remaining quantity of energy. A reconfiguration, i.e., any addition or removal of tasks in devices and consequently of messages on the medium, can cause the violation of real-time or energy constraints at run time. To achieve a feasible scheduling in time (i.e., message deadlines will be respected) and energy (i.e., there is available energy) on the medium, we propose new dynamic solutions: Balance, Dilute, and a Combination of them to manage any addition or removal of messages. The proposed approach utilizes the energy harvesting techniques and the PowerControl algorithm to reduce the nonharvested consumed energy. The proposed strategies achieve significant improvement over existing methods and provide the highest percentage of adding messages, with a lower average in response time and energy consumption. They reach a percentage of success in adding the highest priority messages while meeting deadlines up to 85\%.},

  abstract     = {Network embedding aims to learn distributed vector representations of nodes in a network. The problem of network embedding is fundamentally important. It plays crucial roles in many applications, such as node classification, link prediction, and so on. As the real-world networks are often sparse with few observed links, many recent works have utilized the local and global network structure proximity with shallow models for better network embedding. In reality, each node is usually associated with rich attributes. Some attributed network embedding models leveraged the node attributes in these shallow network embedding models to alleviate the data sparsity issue. Nevertheless, the underlying structure of the network is complex. What is more, the connection between the network structure and node attributes is also hidden. Thus, these previous shallow models fail to capture the nonlinear deep information embedded in the attributed network, resulting in the suboptimal embedding results. In this paper, we propose a deep attributed network embedding framework to capture the complex structure and attribute information. Specifically, we first adopt a personalized random walk-based model to capture the interaction between network structure and node attributes from various degrees of proximity. After that, we construct an enhanced matrix representation of the attributed network by summarizing the various degrees of proximity. Then, we design a deep neural network to exploit the nonlinear complex information in the enhanced matrix for network embedding. Thus, the proposed framework could capture the complex attributed network structure by preserving both the various degrees of network structure and node attributes in a unified framework. Finally, empirical experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed framework on a variety of network embedding-based tasks.},

The interrelationships between stabilities in local graph models and the overall graph model are investigated and utilized in developing algorithms to calculate stabilities in the hierarchical graph model. This novel methodology is then illustrated using a generic model of hierarchical climate change governance disputes. Stability calculations can uncover profitable courses of action.

It is proven that the estimated weights of all radial basis function NNs converge to a small neighborhood of their optimal values. Therefore, the unknown nonlinear function is approximated along the union of all the system trajectories.

Then, by using a time-delay approach, the filtering error system is modeled as a switched system, which characterizes the effects of the event-triggering scheme and nonperiodic DoS jamming attacks simultaneously. Based on the established model, by using the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based sufficient conditions are formulated to achieve the globally exponential stability as well as the weighted H ∞ performance of the resulting switched system under the DoS jamming attacks. Consequently, the co-design method for the desired filter parameters and event-triggering parameters can be formulated provided that the above LMIs are feasible.

Targeting the collaboration features of tasks in a DiA, the environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects model is used to formalize the ICSCD problem from the perspective of role-based collaboration. Aiming at the dynamic characteristics of the cloud environment, an integrated method is presented to evaluate the qualification of CSs via the interval numbers with multiple parameters. Based on the exact qualification values, the ICSCD can be optimized for improving the resource utilization of the CSs. A solution using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package is put forward to solve the problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach can provide high precision, performance, stability, resource utilization, and low usage cost for the resource utilization-aware ICSCD from the user side.},

The random packet losses occur in communication links based on a certain probability, and it is subject to the Bernoulli distribution. A novel distributed control protocol is designed based on the combined measurement to achieve the mean square consensus. By using the Riccati inequalities and linear matrix inequalities, an event-triggered condition with fewer parameters is also designed to reduce the information updating number. The interaction among the control gain matrix, sampling interval, and packet losses probability is used to describe the consensus conditions. The maximum sampling interval is presented explicitly. It is shown that the advantages of the proposed event-triggered strategy with the data sampling mechanism can avoid the Zeno behavior of the systems and continuous monitoring of the states. The simulations are provided to verify the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {A substantial body of literature on global design optimization techniques is based on an implicit assumption that a system under optimization is designed by a perfectly centralized design team with all team members committed to a global optimum solution. This assumption enables the system engineers to minimize all the objective functions simultaneously while controlling all design decisions at the same time. Recent research suggested that this inherent assumption may need to be revisited. This paper proposes a novel framework for design optimization using game theory, which represents a design process as a normal-form game and unifies two fundamental decisions of discipline designers, namely a system-global or a discipline-local optimum solution. This paper provides a general mathematical formulation of the framework for a design process with any number of discipline designers. The framework introduces the notion of the Nash front, which is a set of design solutions consisting of the Nash equilibria derived through the reallocation of design authority between discipline designers. This paper then tests the framework on a numerical optimization case study of a Stirling micro combined heat and power plant with two discipline designers. The result indicates that for the system capital cost and the system power output the difference between global Pareto-optimum designs and the Nash front designs on average across five different scenarios of design authority allocation was 22\% and 16\%, correspondingly. The application of the novel framework in different fields of engineering could help to build models that are more realistic and prevent impractical technical objectives.},

  abstract     = {Learning a prototype from a set of given objects is a core problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. A commonly used approach for consensus learning is to formulate it as an optimization problem in terms of generalized median computation. Recently, a prototype-embedding approach has been proposed to transform the objects into a vector space, compute the geometric median, and then inversely transform back into the original space. This vector space embedding approach has been successfully applied in several domains, where the generalized median problem has inherent high-computational complexity (typically NP-hard) and thus approximate solutions are required. Generally, it can be expected that the embedding should be done in a distance-preserving manner. However, the previous work based on the prototype-embedding approach did not take this embedding aspect into account. In this paper, we discuss the drawbacks of the current prototype-embedding approach and present an extensive empirical study that provides strong evidence of significantly improved quality of generalized median computation using distance-preserving embedding (DPE) methods. We also give concrete suggestions about suitable DPE methods. Moreover, we show that this framework can be used to effectively compute other consensus objects like the closest string. Finally, a MATLAB toolbox resulting from this paper is made publically available in order to encourage other researchers to explore the embedding-based consensus computation.},

The concept of MDADT is introduced, in which every subsystem has its own dwell time before switching to another subsystem. Moreover, a novel sliding mode controller is designed by an event-triggered mechanism which is based on the observer error and the system mode, where its triggered condition can be more conservative and practical than the existing triggered conditions. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the closed-loop system is stochastically exponentially stable in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the problem of controller design for normal nonlinear switched systems with unknown dynamics. The situation assumes that the nonlinear component of the system dynamics is unknown and there are extra uncertain terms and external perturbations affecting the system responses. Unlike previous methods that usually apply artificial neural networks to obtain an approximate model for an unknown dynamics, we use simple adaptive laws to surmount such fluctuations as well as to circumvent the steady state errors in the approaches provided by neural networks or fuzzy logics. No information on the bounds and parameters of the uncertain parts is needed. We design a twofold sliding mode control methodology to stabilize the whole switched system with arbitrary switching signals. To handle the consequences of the inherent chattering, a smooth integral type control signal is constructed. It is proved that once the system states attain the developed sliding manifold, the system becomes insensitive to both the lumped uncertainties and the dynamics of the switched system. The common assumption of a known Lyapunov functions for the subsystems is relaxed and the derived adaptive approach provides nonconservative circumstances for guaranteeing the global stability of the equilibrium state. The theoretical results of this paper are generalized for the canonical nonlinear systems with mismatched uncertainties and a novel adaptive sliding manifold is proposed to suppress the effects of the system mismatching uncertain parts. A comparative computer simulation is developed to examine the effective performance of the introduced controllers.},

The human/prosthesis system is first modeled as a two-domain hybrid asymmetric system. An optimization problem is formulated to obtain a stable human-like gait. The proposed controllers are then developed for the combined human/prosthesis model and the optimized reference gait. The stability of all three controllers is proven using the Lyapunov stability theorem, ensuring convergence to the desired gait. The proposed controllers are first verified on a bipedal walking robot as a hybrid human/prosthesis model in simulation. They are then experimentally tested on a treadmill with an able-bodied subject using third iteration of AMBER Prosthetic (AMPRO3), a custom self-contained powered transfemoral prosthesis. Finally, outdoor tests are carried out using AMPRO3 with three test subjects walking on level ground, uphill slopes, and downhill slopes at slope angles of 3° and 8°, to demonstrate walking in different real-world environments.},

Then, a finite-time controller is designed using a power integrator technology to ensure stability and improve control performances of the pneumatic cylinder servo system. Furthermore, both the effectiveness of the proposed ESO and the finite-time convergence of the closed-loop system are accordingly proven.

  abstract     = {Joint tracking and classification (JTC) is gaining momentum in recent years. Many algorithms have been proposed. However, not enough attention has been paid to JTC evaluation, although it is important in practice. In this paper, we deal with evaluating the goodness and credibility of JTC. For the JTC goodness, tracking and classification so far have been largely evaluated separately without considering the interdependence of tracking and classification. We propose a joint measure-joint probability divergence (JPD)-to quantify tracking error, misclassification and their interdependence. The basic idea of JPD is to measure the closeness between the cumulative distribution functions of the perfect JTC and the JTC to be evaluated. The proposed method has a number of attractive properties. Some results from algorithms can be regarded as self-assessments. The credibility problem is concerned with whether these assessments are credible or how credible they are. We define the credibility problem for decision and propose an associated noncredibility index (NCI). We also propose a joint NCI (JNCI) to quantify the noncredibility of estimation and decision jointly. Four examples are presented to demonstrate how well the JPD and JNCI reflect the joint performance of tracking and classification.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a 2-point algorithm is proposed to estimate the relative pose as well as the absolute scale between two vehicle-mounted cameras efficiently. The system model is deduced by combining a two-view geometric model and the planar motion constraint to reduce the degrees of freedom. 2-point correspondences are utilized to calculate the rotation information independently from the translation information, which indicates that the proposed algorithm can deal with pure rotation scenes. Besides, provided that the camera&#39;s configuration satisfies a certain condition, the absolute scale can be recovered. An approximation algorithm is developed and combined with the random sample and consensus scheme to deal with the uneven ground surfaces in practice. As only 2-point correspondences are required, less iterations are demanded in the estimating procedure compared with many other existing related algorithms. Both simulation and experiments are implemented to evaluate the proposed algorithm, in which the synthetic data, virtual robot experimentation platform, KITTI Vision Benchmark, and SUMMIT-XL platform are acquired. According to the results, the proposed algorithm performs better than many related algorithms including the well-known 5-point algorithm in many cases, especially when the camera&#39;s trajectory contains sharp corners.},

Particularly, the time delay estimation is designed to estimate the unknown dynamics of the robotic manipulators by adopting the theory of TDC. Further, the ATSMC is utilized to obtain the robustness, finite-time convergence, and an adaptive tuning is exploited to deal with bounded derivative of unknown dynamics. The overall system stability is investigated by the Lyapunov theorem application and computed the finite convergence rate thereafter. Finally, a simulation comparison with an existing adaptive fractional-order terminal sliding mode control under backlash hysteresis is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {One fundamental yet challenging issue in security control for resilient complex networks is to construct distributed control laws for the networks to perform various cooperative tasks in the presence of failures and attacks, where resilient indicates that the complex networks are exposed to the environment with cyber uncertainties and malicious adversaries. This is particularly important in today&#39;s critical infrastructure networks since most of them are vulnerable to attacks in the era of the Internet. Inspired by this observation, this paper focuses on synchronization control for resilient complex networks subject to cyber and physical attacks, where the states of nodes being attacked may change abruptly (i.e., the synchronization error may suffer impulsive disturbances), and some nodes as well as their corresponding connections may not work in some instances. Suppose that a smart control center is equipped in the considered network to detect the attacks in real time. Furthermore, the nodes and communication channels are assumed to be recovered through some repair work after detecting the attacks. On the theoretical side, by using the M-matrix theory, we get a few sufficient criteria to guarantee the achievement of secure synchronization against attacks on both nodes and communication links. On the algorithmic side, security control algorithm and architecture are proposed to select the coupling strength and the feedback gain matrix to realize synchronization. Finally, we perform two simulation examples to validate our theoretical results.},

Our convergence analysis indicates that when the local objective functions are strongly convex, the output state of the projection algorithm could asymptotically converge to the optimal solution of the resource allocation problem. In particular, when the projection operation is not involved, we show the exponential convergence at the equilibrium point of the algorithm. Second, we propose an adaptive continuous-time gradient algorithm over a strongly connected and weight-unbalanced directed graph for the reduced case without local convex sets. In this case, we prove that the adaptive algorithm converges exponentially to the optimal solution of the considered problem, where the local objective functions and their gradients satisfy strong convexity and Lipachitz conditions, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework called infection-probability-dependent interlayer interaction propagation processes in multiplex networks with an arbitrary number of layers, to more precisely depict the intertwined effects which bring challenges to the existing state-dependent interlayer interaction models. Specifically, the spreading rate of each node is regulated by the proposed spreading rate function (SRF) which depends on both the intrinsic dynamics in its layer and the infection probabilities of its counterparts. We propose an algorithm to obtain the spreading threshold of each layer of the proposed theoretical framework. We analyze the three-layer tuberculosis-awareness-flu model with the SRF of each node being the expectation of infection-probability-dependent spreading rate. This paper gives a thorough and detailed numerical investigation of the impact and interaction of system settings and the spreading threshold of each layer. We find that for tuberculosis spreading which is in competing relation with awareness and cooperation relation with flu, the epidemic threshold is a constant when other layers&#39; intrinsic spreading rates are small. The cooperation layer has dramatic influence on the constant while the competing layer has no effect on it.},

PRM refers to predated or early maintenance tasks resulting in additional activities over a long horizon. A novel methodology is proposed to monetize the impact of PRM and show its contribution to total maintenance cost. The proposed methodology is inspired by the proportional hazard model to capture the effects of human failure on the system&#39;s hazard rate.

However, the AUV inevitably suffers from external environmental disturbances which are driven by wind, density, and temperature gradients. The attitude transducers cannot derive accurate attitude information of the AUV. Additionally, the uncertain hydrodynamic parameters affect the stability of the system. Consequently, it is unknown whether tracking performance of the AUV can be guaranteed. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a finite-time controller is developed by using the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control technique. A robust differentiator is proposed to estimate the external disturbances and uncertain parts.

The peculiarity of this class is that no a priori bound on the continuous control gain functions is assumed (i.e., their boundedness cannot be assumed before obtaining system stability). This requires a new design. Differently from the available methods, the proposed design involves the construction of appropriate invariant sets for the closed-loop trajectories, which allows to remove the restrictive assumption of a priori bounds of the control gain functions. Furthermore, we show that such set-invariance design can handle input constraints in the form of input saturation. In line with the DSC methodology, semi-globally uniformly ultimate boundedness is proven: however, differently from the standard methodology, stability analysis requires the combination of Lyapunov and invariant set theories.},

Compared to recent studies, such as OCBA-CO and SCORE, this procedure can be more efficient when the simulation model involves large stochastic noise because its heuristic policy considers the precision of the sample mean ignored by the previous studies. Several experimental results of benchmarks demonstrate its improved efficiency, and a case study on the design of military network system shows its effectiveness for practical problems.},

  abstract     = {In lifelong machine learning (LML) systems, consecutive new tasks from changing circumstances are learned and added to the system. However, sufficiently labeled data are indispensable for extracting intertask relationships before transferring knowledge in classical supervised LML systems. Inadequate labels may deteriorate the performance due to the poor initial approximation. In order to extend the typical LML system, we propose a novel hierarchical lifelong learning algorithm (HLLA) consisting of two following layers: 1) the knowledge layer consisted of shared representations and integrated knowledge basis at the bottom and 2) parameterized hypothesis functions with features at the top. Unlabeled data is leveraged in HLLA for pretraining of the shared representations. We also have considered a selective inherited updating method to deal with intertask distribution shifting. Experiments show that our HLLA method outperforms many other recent LML algorithms, especially when dealing with higher dimensional, lower correlation, and fewer labeled data problems.},

  abstract     = {Traditional hinge loss function-based large-scale support vector machine (SVM) algorithms tend to perform poorly in the presence of noise, especially when the model is trained incrementally. In this paper, we propose an efficient stochastic quasi-Newton method-based twin parametric SVM using the pinball loss function (termed as SQN-PTWSVM), which is efficient and more robust to the presence of noise when compared to conventional hinge loss SVM for large-scale data scenarios. To establish the theoretical convergence of the method, a modified version of SQN-PTWSVM, termed as SQN-SPTWSVM, has also been proposed. It overcomes the poor convergence issue faced by stochastic gradient twin SVM thus resulting in a faster and reliable model. In SQN-SPTWSVM, the hyperplanes obtained are stable enough to handle noise and resampling issues that occur frequently in stochastic learning scenarios, leading to better generalization ability of the classifier. The proposed method has been extended to nonlinear scenarios as well. Moreover, batch versions of the proposed algorithms have also been introduced which significantly reduce the training time and memory requirement of SQN-PTWSVM and SQN-SPTWSVM. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets and activity recognition applications have shown that the performance of our method is better than the existing classifiers in terms of speed and accuracy.},

The significant design difficulty is the completely unknown nonlinear functions with all state variables that can neither be directly estimated by radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) nor be eliminated by the traditional backstepping technique. To achieve the control objective of this paper, a common state-feedback controller for all subsystems is first systematically constructed by using the common coordinate transformation, the variable separation technique, and the universal approximation capability of RBF NNs. Then the stability analysis shows that the semi-global bounded in probability of the whole closed-loop switched system can be obtained and the desired tracking performance can also be insured under a class of switching signals with the average dwell time property. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Virtual network embedding (VNE) is an important problem in network virtualization for the flexible sharing of network resources. While most existing studies focus on centralized embedding for VNE, distributed embedding is considered more scalable and suitable for large-scale scenarios, but how virtual resources can be mapped to substrate resources effectively and efficiently remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we devise a distributed VNE system with historical archives (HAs) and metaheuristic approaches. First, we introduce metaheuristic approaches to each delegation of the distributed embedding system as the optimizer for VNE. Compared to the heuristic-based greedy algorithms used in existing distributed embedding approaches, which are prone to be trapped in local optima, metaheuristic approaches can provide better embedding performance for these distributed delegations. Second, an archive-based strategy is also introduced in the distributed embedding system to assist the metaheuristic algorithms. The archives are used to record the up-to-date information of frequently repeated tasks. By utilizing such archives as historical memory, metaheuristic algorithms can further improve embedding performance for frequently repeated tasks. Following this idea, we incorporate the set-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) as the optimizer and propose the distributed VNE system with HAs and set-based PSO (HA-VNE-PSO) system to solve the VNE problem in a distributed way. HA-VNE-PSO is empirically validated in scenarios of different scales. The experimental results verify that HA-VNE-PSO can scale well with respect to substrate networks, and the HA strategy is indeed effective in different scenarios.},

Latent factor (LF) analysis proves to be highly efficient in extracting such knowledge from an HiDS matrix efficiently. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a highly efficient algorithm for building an LF model. However, current LF models mostly adopt a standard SGD algorithm. Can SGD be extended from various aspects in order to improve the resultant models’ convergence rate and prediction accuracy for missing data? Are such SGD extensions compatible with an LF model? To answer them, this paper carefully investigates eight extended SGD algorithms to propose eight novel LF models. Experimental results on two HiDS matrices generated by real recommender systems show that compared with an LF model with a standard SGD algorithm, an LF model with extended ones can achieve: 1) higher prediction accuracy for missing data; 2) faster convergence rate; and 3) model diversity.},

It is widely used for determining the underlying data structure, classifying natural data and compressing data in engineering, business management, social statistics, computer science, and medicine. Under the assumption that clusters are high density regions in the feature space separated by relatively low density neighbors, a novel approach is proposed for modeling any high dimensional clustering problem as a one-dimensional analysis of the probability distribution. First, a special path between two vertexes, namely eigenpath, is defined in this paper to represent their close connection. Second, we propose the connectedness index based on the eigenpath for quantitatively describing the connection between two vertexes. Third, the connectedness index is applied to the candidates of cluster centers and measures the connection between different candidates. Then an indicative curve can be drawn with the knowledge of connectedness index. This approach not only provides effective indicative curve for unknown data sets but also facilitates eliminating the curse of dimensionality partly as well as correctly recognizes arbitrary cluster forms and automatically excludes outliers. Extensive experiments showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

Starting with the boundedness condition of network trajectories, we introduce an invariant set such that it contains all limit points of ultimately synchronous trajectories. Then, we develop a decomposition technique for the heterogeneous network. With this decomposition, the synchronization of the network can be investigated by the convergence of one decomposed network and the synchronization of the other decomposed homogeneous-like network. Moreover, for a particular case that the invariant set is a linear subspace, conditional synchronization analysis is provided to reduce the coupling complexity between the two decomposed networks. It is noted that our decomposition technique is quite simple yet general: by this technique, the synchronization of various heterogeneous complex networks can be transformed into the stability of nonlinear systems and synchronization of homogeneous-like complex networks. Finally, we present several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. In particular, we use an example to show that our theoretical procedure is also feasible for some heterogeneous networks with a general invariant submanifold instead of linear subspace.},

  abstract     = {Typically, iterative learning control (ILC) is applied based on a core hypothesis that the strict repetitiveness of control environment, task, and model should be satisfied by the controlled system. The problem of interest in this paper is: whether and how can ILC robustly work for controlled systems subject to iteration-dependent environments, tasks and models? To successfully solve this problem, an ILC algorithm using a high-order internal model (HOIM) is proposed and convergence conditions are developed. It is shown that HOIM-based ILC both possesses robustness against iteration-dependent uncertainties from initial states, disturbances, and plant models and tracks iteration-dependent references. Also, simulation tests validate the effectiveness of HOIM-based ILC.},

First, a new two-dimensional (2-D) extended nonminimal state space model is formulated where more degrees of freedom are offered for further controller design; second, a new error compensation strategy is introduced in the controller design to improve the ensemble control performance. The two merits are combined together to form a new control strategy where the model predictive control and iterative learning control are united based on the 2-D framework. By employing the novel model formulation and the system error compensation approaches, the effects caused by uncertainty in the batch processes can be eliminated gradually from cycle-to-cycle such that the desired control performance will be obtained finally. The effectiveness of the proposed 2D-MPILC is tested on the packing pressure in the injection molding batch process.},

A necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal control minimizing the quadratic performance index is established.

Although CCL has been widely researched in theory, the existing studies of CCL have one problem: the concepts obtained by CCL systems do not have generalization ability. In the meantime, the existing incremental algorithms still face some challenges that: 1) classifiers have to adapt gradually and 2) the previously acquired knowledge should be efficiently utilized. To address these problems, based on the advantage that CCL can naturally integrate new data into itself for enhancing flexibility of concept learning, we first propose a new CCL model (CCLM) to extend the classical methods of CCL, which is not only a new classifier but also good at incremental learning. Unlike the existing CCL systems, the theory of CCLM is mainly based on a formal decision context rather than a formal context. In learning concepts from dynamic environments, we show that CCLM can naturally incorporate new data into itself with a sufficient theoretical guarantee for incremental learning. For classification task and knowledge storage, our results on various data sets demonstrate that CCLM can simultaneously: 1) achieve the state-of-the-art static and dynamic classification task and 2) directly accomplish preservation of previously acquired knowledge (or concepts) under dynamic environments.},

It is an effective approach for searching a global optimum by simulating the cooperative behavior of social-spiders. However, SSO takes too much computation time and shows premature convergence on some problems. In order to accelerate the computation speed and further enhance the search ability, a parallel SSO (PSSO) algorithm with emotional learning is proposed in this paper. First, we develop a parallel structure for the female and male individuals to update their positions, and each individual can be computed in parallel during the search process. Second, an emotional learning mechanism is used to increase swarm diversity which is helpful to improve the search performance. Furthermore, the convergence property and computational complexity of PSSO are discussed in detail. To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is applied to solve data clustering problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of PSSO is superior to six other clustering algorithms on several standard data sets. In the aspect of search performance, the results obtained by PSSO are better than the comparison algorithms in most used data sets. In the aspect of time performance, the computation time of PSSO is greatly reduced in the parallel computing environment. It is comparable with K-means which is the fastest among the comparison algorithms when the number of processors larger than and equals to 16.},

In this paper, an algebraic graph-theoretic condition is introduced to optimize pinning control. When individual node dynamics and coupling strength of the network are given, the effectiveness of pinning scheme can be measured by the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix obtained by deleting the rows and columns corresponding to the pinned nodes from the Laplacian matrix of the network. The larger this smallest eigenvalue, the more effective the pinning scheme. Spectral properties of the smallest eigenvalue are analyzed using the network topology information, including the spectrum of the network Laplacian matrix, the minimal degree of uncontrolled nodes, the number of edges between the controlled node set and the uncontrolled node set, etc. The identified properties are shown effective for optimizing the pinning control strategy, as demonstrated by illustrative examples. Finally, for both scale-free and small-world networks, in order to maximize their corresponding smallest eigenvalues, it is better to pin the nodes with large degrees when the percentage of pinned nodes is relatively small, while it is better to pin nodes with small degrees when the percentage is relatively large. This surprising phenomenon can be explained by one of the theorems established.},

A fuzzy Lyapunov function approach with less conservativeness is introduced into the research of positive systems. In the system under consideration, positive S-MSSs with the semi-Markovian process can describe more complex systems in a practical control process. The main motivation of this paper is that the practical system subject to positivity and abrupt changes can be described by positive nonlinear S-MSSs, which always needs to consider the external disturbance. First, by using the normalized membership function approach, positive nonlinear S-MSSs can be represented by local positive T-S fuzzy S-MSSs. Second, by constructing the fuzzy Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions are proposed for stochastic stability and G1-gain performance analysis, respectively. Then, a positive G1 observer in a novel standard linearprogramming condition is designed to guarantee the resulting closed-loop augmented system is positive and stochastically stable with a required G1-gain performance. Finally, a practical example about the epidemiological model is introduced to show the effectiveness of the main theory.},

The proposed controller makes the dynamic surface invariant while updating the closed-loop cut-off frequency accordingly with the self-tuner. The closed-loop properties are rigorously analyzed. The experimental verification result shows that the proposed controller establishes the 48\% enhancement of the circular tracking performance in comparison with the feedback linearization method, where the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is used.},

  abstract     = {Modern military operations in high-tech information warfare settings are dynamic processes involving various types of combat systems connected via multiple channels, which can be abstracted as a type of complex temporal combat network (TCN). The equipment contribution analysis in TCNs is of significant military value for optimizing operation process planning and improving network resilience in complex electromagnetic battlefields. This paper presents an integrated framework called capability oriented equipment contribution analysis (CECA) to analyze key equipment in TCNs. Specifically, a temporal network model is proposed to characterize TCNs by considering their dynamic nature and the heterogeneity capabilities of different types of functional entities during military operations. Based on this model, an operation capability contribution index is proposed to measure the contribution of each piece of equipment involved in executing operational tasks. Finally, the reliability and effectiveness of the CECA are demonstrated based on a TCN case study. This paper provides a detailed and precise quantitative analysis of the equipment contributions in TCNs, which yields useful insights for operation guidance and designing a more resilient combat system-of-systems.},

  abstract     = {In surgical simulation, the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation is commonly employed to imitate the physical characteristics of bleeding and the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPHs) algorithm is applied to solve the numerical solution of the N-S equation. However, blood is viscous, incompressible and non-Newtonian fluid whose physical properties cannot be fully incorporated by the simple N-S equation, and the kernel approximation of the SPH algorithm may lead to both edge and volume distortions plus high computational cost. In this paper, both the tension force and the effect of platelets on the viscous force of bleeding particles are incorporated into the N-S equation in order to render more realistic visual effect and biological features of bleeding in surgical simulation. Constant core radius of the kernel function of the SPH algorithm is substituted with a function of particle density, avoiding potential edge distortions in simulating bleeding area. A repulsive force between particles is introduced, which effectively prevents volume distortions. Besides, accelerated search for particles based on the cube mesh improves the computational efficiency. The simulation results show that the presented simulation method leads to smooth bleeding surface and improves the visual effects of edge and volume in comparison with existing methods, and relatively high computational efficiency can be achieved as well.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the motor skill learning from human demonstrations using the framework of dynamic regressive models (DRMs). The DRM-based motion planner is preferred as it generates the end-effector trajectory dynamically based on the current state of the end-effector. Within existing frameworks, a single DRM can learn a single motion profile. In addition, such learned DRMs from the data may not be stable. This paper addresses both these issues in a comprehensive manner. In this paper a single DRM has been used to encode human demonstrations involving multitask profiles and multiple task-equilibriums which is novel. We have introduced the idea that the learned DRM will generate human-like stable motion if the energy dissipation rate (EDR) of the generated trajectory follows that of the human demonstration. Thus, the DRM structure has been modified by adding a continuous guiding signal which can be called as the control signal. This signal has been derived using control theoretic principle to ensure asymptotic stability while maintaining the EDR equivalent to that of the human demonstration. The asymptotic stability of the learned DRM has been established by involving a nonmonotonic Lyapunov function consisting of first derivative of a quadratic function and the energy function associated with the DRM. The proposed framework can be learned using many existing regression techniques in this paper Gaussian mixture regression, locally weighted projection regression, and support vector regression techniques have been used successfully. During the pick and place tasks, human demonstrations involving multiple task profiles and multiple task-equilibriums are generated using a 7 DOF commercial robot manipulator. Experimental validations show that the DRMs learned using these three regression schemes are able to guide the robot along the multitask profiles in a stable manner.},

Instead of using a forecasting-based approach, the proposed methodology takes the difference between the available renewable generation and load, state-of-charge of ESS, and electricity market price to determine the charge and discharge rate of the ESS in a rolling horizon.

As an NP-hard problem, how to schedule cloud workflows effectively and economically with deadline constraints and different kinds of tasks and resources is extraordinarily challenging. To solve this constrained problem, this paper intends to develop an intelligent scheduling system from the perspective of users to reduce expenditure of workflow, subject to the deadline and other execution constraints. A new estimation model of the task execution time is designed according to virtual machine settings in real public clouds and execution data from practical workflows. Based on the new model, an adaptive ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed to meet the quality of service and orchestrate tasks. The adaptiveness of the algorithm is embodied in two aspects. First, an adaptive solution construction method is designed that each solution is built with a dynamically changing resource pool, thus the search space of the algorithm is narrowed down and the execution time is decreased. Second, two heuristics with self-adaptive weight are introduced to adaptively meet different deadline settings. Simulating results on four types of workflows show that the proposed approach is effective and competitive.},

Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) focuses on the examination of dissolved gasses in transformer oil to diagnose the state of a transformer. Fusion of black-box (BB) classifiers, also known as an ensemble of diagnostics models, have been used to improve the accuracy of diagnostics models across many fields. When independent classifiers diagnose the same fault, this method can increase the veracity of the diagnostics. However, if these methods give conflicting results, it is not always clear which model is most accurate due to their BB nature. In this context, the use of white-box (WB) models can help resolve conflicted samples effectively by incorporating uncertainty information and improve the classification accuracy. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware fusion method to combine BB and WB diagnostics methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using two publicly available DGA datasets.},

Single latent factor-dependent, non-negative and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) is an efficient algorithm for building an NLF model on an HiDS matrix, yet it suffers slow convergence. A momentum method is frequently adopted to accelerate a learning algorithm, but it is incompatible with those implicitly adopting gradients like SLF-NMU. To build a fast NLF (FNLF) model, we propose a generalized momentum method compatible with SLF-NMU. With it, we further propose a single latent factor-dependent non-negative, multiplicative and momentum-incorporated update algorithm, thereby achieving an FNLF model. Empirical studies on six HiDS matrices from industrial application indicate that an FNLF model outperforms an NLF model in terms of both convergence rate and prediction accuracy for missing data. Hence, compared with an NLF model, an FNLF model is more practical in industrial applications.},

Moreover, tracking differentiators are employed to avoid the explosion of complexity caused by repeated differentiations of nonlinear functions.

  abstract     = {Pareto dominance-based multiobjective optimization has been successfully applied to constrained evolutionary optimization during the last two decades. However, as another famous multiobjective optimization framework, decomposition-based multiobjective optimization has not received sufficient attention from constrained evolutionary optimization. In this paper, we make use of decomposition-based multiobjective optimization to solve constrained optimization problems (COPs). In our method, first of all, a COP is transformed into a biobjective optimization problem (BOP). Afterward, the transformed BOP is decomposed into a number of scalar optimization subproblems. After generating an offspring for each subproblem by differential evolution, the weighted sum method is utilized for selection. In addition, to make decomposition-based multiobjective optimization suit the characteristics of constrained evolutionary optimization, weight vectors are elaborately adjusted. Moreover, for some extremely complicated COPs, a restart strategy is introduced to help the population jump out of a local optimum in the infeasible region. Extensive experiments on three sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions from IEEE CEC2006, 36 test functions from IEEE CEC2010, and 56 test functions from IEEE CEC2017, have demonstrated that the proposed method shows better or at least competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the modeling and stabilization problems for a class of discrete-time stochastic networked systems (DSNSs) subject to successive packet losses. The system under consideration is transformed into a stochastic one with bounded stochastic delay. Considering that the stochastic delay is characterized by nonuniform distribution, a new equivalent model is then constructed that enables the DSNS&#39;s controller design to benefit from knowing the probability characteristic of packet losses. Specially, to verify this feature, the probabilities of the delay can be explicitly obtained by utilizing the formula of total probability, which is critical to model transformation and analyze practical problems that exist in DSNSs. Based on the proposed model, sufficient conditions are established under which the globally mean-square asymptotic stability of resulting stochastic delay closed-loop system is guaranteed, and a delay-distribution-dependent design procedure is then proposed. A numerical example with simulation is provided to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the design procedure.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering has been a popular research topic in data mining and machine learning. Despite its significant progress in recent years, there are still two challenging issues in the current ensemble clustering research. First, most of the existing algorithms tend to investigate the ensemble information at the object-level, yet often lack the ability to explore the rich information at higher levels of granularity. Second, they mostly focus on the direct connections (e.g., direct intersection or pair-wise co-occurrence) in the multiple base clusterings, but generally neglect the multiscale indirect relationship hidden in them. To address these two issues, this paper presents a novel ensemble clustering approach based on fast propagation of cluster-wise similarities via random walks. We first construct a cluster similarity graph with the base clusters treated as graph nodes and the cluster-wise Jaccard coefficient exploited to compute the initial edge weights. Upon the constructed graph, a transition probability matrix is defined, based on which the random walk process is conducted to propagate the graph structural information. Specifically, by investigating the propagating trajectories starting from different nodes, a new cluster-wise similarity matrix can be derived by considering the trajectory relationship. Then, the newly obtained cluster-wise similarity matrix is mapped from the cluster-level to the object-level to achieve an enhanced co-association matrix, which is able to simultaneously capture the object-wise co-occurrence relationship as well as the multiscale cluster-wise relationship in ensembles. Finally, two novel consensus functions are proposed to obtain the consensus clustering result. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

Second, by combining the local SOSM controller with a saturation function, a novel SOSM controller with a saturation level is constructed. The feature of the new SOSM controller lies in that the saturation level can be tuned not only to guarantee the global convergence but also to improve the dynamic performance.

When the nonlinear functions of agent dynamics depend on unmeasurable states, the problem remains open due to the difficulties in constructing distributed observers. When the leader is only available to a small portion of followers in the directed communication topology, we establish relationship between the network topology and the design of the corresponding distributed reduced order observers. Furthermore, by developing a new distributed high-gain homogeneous domination design method, distributed observers, and controllers are designed to guarantee that the errors between the followers&#39; outputs and the leader&#39;s output can be made arbitrarily small while keeping all the states of closed-loop system bounded.

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques for building recommender systems. To overcome the data sparsity in CF, social recommender systems have emerged to boost recommendation performance by utilizing social correlation among users&#39; interests. Recently, inspired by the immense success of deep learning for embedding learning, neural network-based recommender systems have shown promising recommendation performance. Nevertheless, few researchers have attempted to tackle the social recommendation problem with neural models. To this end, in this paper, we design a neural architecture that organically combines the intrinsic relationship between social network structure and user-item interaction behavior for social recommendation. Two key challenges arise in this process: first, how to incorporate the social correlation of users&#39; interests in this neural model, and second, how to design a neural architecture to capture the unique characteristics of user-item interaction behavior for recommendation. To tackle these two challenges, we develop a model named collaborative neural social recommendation (CNSR) with two parts: 1) a social embedding part and 2) a collaborative neural recommendation (CNR) part. In CNSR, the user embedding leverages each user&#39;s social embedding learned from an unsupervised deep learning technique with social correlation regularization. The user and item embeddings are then fed into a unique neural network with a newly designed collaboration layer to model both the shallow collaborative and deep complex interaction relationships between users and items. We further propose a joint learning framework to allow the social embedding part and the CNR part to mutually enhance each other. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

Among those classifiers, the extended belief rule-based system (EBRBS) has shown its potential in both big data and multiclass situations, while the time complexity and computing efficiency are two challenging issues to be handled in EBRBS. As such, three improvements of EBRBS are proposed first in this paper to decrease the time complexity and computing efficiency of EBRBS for multiclass classification under the assumption of large amount of data, including the strategy to skip rule weight calculation, a simplified evidential reasoning algorithm, and the domain division-based rule reduction method. This turns out to be a micro version of the EBRBS, called Micro-EBRBS. Moreover, one of commonly used cluster computing, named Apache Spark, is then applied to implement the parallel rule generation and inference schemes of the Micro-EBRBS for big data multiclass classification problems. The comparative analyses of experimental studies demonstrate that the Micro-EBRBS not only can obtain a desired accuracy but also has the comparatively better time complexity and computing efficiency than some popular classifiers, especially for multiclass classification problems.},

  abstract     = {Cascading failure on complex networks has been extensively studied over the past decade. However, restoration of networks from cascading failure is still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we consider cascading failure in conjunction with the restoration process involving repairing the failed nodes in a sequential fashion. Depending on the availability of resources, we tackle the sequential recovery problem from two distinct approaches, namely, result-oriented and resource-oriented restoration approaches. In the result-oriented approach, we aim to restore the network to the largest extent and within the shortest time. Heuristic network restoration strategies based on node load or degree are proposed. For resource-oriented restoration, we aim to maximize the increase of network size with a given number of nodes to be repaired, and we propose a novel iterative strategy to improve performance. Simulation results on the Barábasi-Albert scale-free network, Internet autonomous system-level network, and IEEE 300 bus power system have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed sequential recovery strategies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the consensus tracking problem for the multiagent system (MAS) based on a nonfragile memory sampled-data controller. Considering the effect of controller gain fluctuation and communication delay, a novel sampled-data control scheme with variable sampling interval is designed for each agent. By developing some new terms, an improved piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to take full advantage of characteristic about real sampling pattern. Furthermore, some relaxed matrices constructed in the LKF are not necessarily positive definite. Making full use of the LKF and free-matrix-based integral inequality, some sufficient criteria are developed to ensure the consistency of the MAS. Then, by solving a group of linear matrix inequalities with the maximal sampling interval, the desired sampled-data control gain matrix is obtained. Finally, the numerical example of a 5-agent system is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this paper.},

To find a feasible solution to this challenging task, the initial soft-bound interval control problem has been transformed into an output probability density function (PDF) tracking control problem with constrained tracking errors, thereby the controller can be designed under the established framework of stochastic distribution control. Fault tolerant control (FTC) is investigated for soft-bound interval control systems in presence of faults. Three fault detection methods are proposed based on criteria extracted from the initial soft-bound control problem and the recast PDF tracking problem. An integrated design for fault estimation and FTC is proposed based on a double proportional integral structure. This integrated FTC design is developed through linear matrix inequality. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to examine the key design factors, the implementation issues and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This paper addresses boundary control based on distributed measurement for output consensus of leader-following directed MASs modeled by parabolic PDEs. First, a boundary controller acting on spatial boundary points is designed by considering the delivered information produced by agents communicating with neighborhoods. Without considering input constraint, the Lyapunov&#39;s direct method is used to obtain a sufficient condition on the existence of the boundary controller to achieve output consensus. The condition is expressed as a form of the feasibility of LMIs. After that, the whole input constraint for MASs is given. And then, one more condition on control gains is obtained to ensure the existence of the boundary controller with input constraint. Finally, one numerical example with two cases illustrates the theoretical analysis results.},

This may result in short-term, and even permanent loss of the target from the field of view of the robot. In this paper, human following with a mobile robot in presence of potential occlusions occurring at corridor intersections is addressed. The robot detects four different types of corridor intersections using the on-board laser scanner. Then, a potential-field-based human tracker is designed by integrating the intersection information into the potential function, in order to increase the visibility of the target, while maintaining the relative distance and orientation between the target and the robot. Simultaneously, the robot builds a multihypothesis topological map of the environment based on an improved generalized Voronoi graph, where the edges represent the corridors and the vertices are the virtual meet points extracted from the intersections. In such a way, simultaneous human following and topological mapping are achieved. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can largely avoid occlusion of the target and obtain good performance of human following and topological mapping.},

  abstract     = {The current maritime applications have yielded strong demands for the development of advanced unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with more reliable path following capabilities to greatly extend mission durations and enhance accommodative capabilities of USVs to more hazardous and dynamic environments. This paper presents an adaptive path following control method using a retrofit adaptive tracking control technique with application to a USV with consideration of environmental disturbances (like winds, waves, and currents), while taking into account of the system constraints of USVs, including both turning features (turning rate limit and turning dynamics) and rudder operation constraints (rudder deflection and rate saturation, and its dynamics). In order to guarantee the satisfactory performance of the USV operating in a calm environment, a baseline state feedback tracking controller considering the characteristics of yaw rate and rudder operations, and USV steering and actuator dynamics is first designed. In the presence of time-varying environmental disturbances, a retrofit adaptive disturbance compensating control mechanism is then developed based on the disturbance amplitude estimated from an indirect adaptive disturbance estimator. Finally, a reconfigurable adaptive path following controller is synthesized by combining the baseline controller and the adaptive disturbance compensating mechanism for the proper operation of the USV in the presence of environmental disturbances, while the desired path is successfully followed by the USV within an acceptable deviation boundary and without violating constraints of turning rates as well as amplitude and rate of rudder deflections. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed path following control methodology, both numerical simulations on a nonlinear USV model and field experiments on a real-size USV are conducted.},

First, by using the measurable premise variables, a novel output feedback controller scheme is proposed. Second, via restricting the reachable set into an ellipsoid set, which is bounded by the objective region, the system state can be contained into a prespecified area so that the purpose of local stabilization can be fulfilled. Furthermore, because of network delay, there is a deviation between the membership function of the system and those of the controller. By exploring the information of the deviation, the stabilization condition can be further relaxed. Compared with the existing results, the new asynchronous controller strategy can simultaneously make full use of the information of the measurable premise variables and the aforementioned deviation for a less conservative result. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the applicability of the presented approach.},

The note-worthy aspect of this paper lies in the introduction of a-priori information for each dictionary atom, that in a way indicates its degree of importance with respect to the dynamic characteristics of the writer. The methodology behind obtaining this information for the dictionary atoms is based on the computation of entropy values over histograms that are generated from the sparse coefficients during the training phase. The prelearned values are incorporated on the traditional schemes of “max” and “mean” pooling of sparse codes, thereby resulting in a modified writer descriptor. Experiments performed with the proposed sparse classification strategy on the handwritten samples of the IAM and IBM-UB1 online handwriting databases demonstrate promising results.},

Recently, BCIs, and wearable computers in particular, have been receiving more attention by government and industry as an alternative means of interacting with technology. Wearable computers can combine highly immersive virtual/augmented/mixed reality experiences for entertainment, health monitoring, utilitarian purposes, and, most importantly at present, research. With wearable computers, researchers can design, simulate, and finely control experiments to examine human-brain dynamics outside the laboratory. Yet despite the power of BCIs, take-up is slow. This form of interaction is unnatural to humans and often requires external stimuli. Further, the response feedback produced by the computer part of the system is nowhere near as quick as our brains. Hence, we undertook a review of the current state-of-the-art in BCI research and distilled the current findings into a stimulus-free BCI, called direct-sense BCIs, that operates directly and seamlessly from our thinking. This is a novel paradigm that, in the short term, could substantially improve the quality of a user&#39;s experience with BCI, and, over the long term, lead to much more widespread take-up of BCI technology.},

Hence, in industry, smarter automation methods that leverage the dexterity, flexibility, and decision-making capability of a human to speed, precision, and power of a robot are required.

Ten metrics for implementing blockchain applications in the manufacturing system are devised while surveying research in blockchain-secured smart manufacturing. This study reveals how these CIs have been studied in the literature.

  abstract     = {The broad learning system (BLS) has been proved to be effective and efficient lately. In this article, several deep variants of BLS are reviewed, and a new adaptive incremental structure, Stacked BLS, is proposed. The proposed model is a novel incremental stacking of BLS. This invariant inherits the efficiency and effectiveness of BLS that the structure and weights of lower layers of BLS are fixed when the new blocks are added. The incremental stacking algorithm computes not only the connection weights between the newly stacking blocks but also the connection weights of the enhancement nodes within the BLS block. The Stacked BLS is considered as the increment of “layers” and “neurons” dynamically during the training for multilayer neural networks. The proposed architecture along with the training algorithms that utilizes the residual characteristic is very versatile in comparison with traditional fixed architecture. Finally, experimental results on UCI datasets, MNIST dataset, NORB dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, SVHN dataset, and CIFAR-100 dataset indicate that the proposed method outperforms the selected state-of-the-art methods on both accuracy and training speed, such as deep residual networks. The results also imply that the proposed structure could highly reduce the number of nodes and the training time of the original BLS in the classification task of some datasets.},

Fuzzy and linguistic decision-making approaches allow to address complex real-world decision problems where humans exhibit vagueness, imprecision, and/or use natural language to assess decision alternatives, criteria, etc. The aim of this article is threefold. First, the main fuzzy set theory and computing with words-based representation paradigms of decision information, with their different levels of expressive richness and complexity, are reviewed. Second, three core decision-making frameworks are examined: 1) multicriteria decision making; 2) group consensus-driven decision making; and 3) multiperson multicriteria decision making. Third, the article discusses new complex decision-making frameworks that have emerged in recent years, where decisions are guided by the “wisdom of the crowd”: their associated challenges are highlighted and considerations on much needed key guidelines for future research in the field are provided.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) empower the integration of physical processes and cyber infrastructure with the aid of ubiquitous computation resources and communication capabilities. CPSs have permeated modern society and found extensive applications in a wide variety of areas, including energy, transportation, advanced manufacturing, and medical health. The security of CPSs against cyberattacks has been regarded as a long-standing concern. However, CPSs suffer from extendable vulnerabilities that are beyond classical networked systems due to the tight integration of cyber and physical components. Sophisticated and malicious cyberattacks continue to emerge to adversely impact CPS operation, resulting in performance degradation, service interruption, and system failure. Secure state estimation and control technologies play a vital role in warranting reliable monitoring and operation of safety-critical CPSs. This article provides a review of the state-of-the-art results for secure state estimation and control of CPSs. Specifically, the latest development of secure state estimation is summarized in light of different performance indicators and defense strategies. Then, the recent results on secure control are discussed and classified into three categories: 1) centralized secure control; 2) distributed secure control; and 3) resource-aware secure control. Furthermore, two specific application examples of water supply distribution systems and wide-area power systems are presented to demonstrate the applicability of secure state estimation and control approaches. Finally, several challenging issues are discussed to direct future research.},

Based on the limitations of the interaction level and the constraints of the individual system level, the published results on intelligent control are categorized into limited sensing-based control, event-based control, pinning-based control, resilient control, and collaborative control under system constraints. Also, the applications of intelligent control for MASs are presented, especially for robotics, complex networks, and transportation.

GMCR can be used for studying large and small conflicts and includes methods for preference elicitation, preference uncertainty (unknown, fuzzy, grey numbers and probabilistic). Many kinds of definitions exist for possible human behavior under pure competition which can be transformed for utilization in coalition analysis. GMCR can handle emotions, attitudes, and misperceptions. Within inverse GMCR, one can calculate the preferences needed by decision makers (DMs) to reach a desirable equilibrium. Under behavioral GMCR one can ascertain the strategic thinking of DMs when the input and output are known. Decision support systems can be built for implementing the array of GMCR advancements. Future expansions of GMCR can be guided by key characteristics of actual disputes. Artificial intelligence (AI) GMCR is a promising subfield of study within GMCR.},

Under suitable assumptions, the state possibility distribution can be propagated using FEMC models in a similar manner as the state probability distribution using conventional Markov chain models. The article first discusses FEMC theory, procedures to identify FEMCs from data, and the use of FEMCs for forecasting and control.

Two-layer feedback BAMs always converge to fixed-point equilibria for threshold or threshold-like neurons. Every rectangular connection matrix is bidirectionally stable. These simpler BAMs extend to arbitrary hidden layers with supervised learning if the resulting bidirectional backpropagation algorithm uses the proper layer likelihood in the forward and backward directions.

Most “state-of-the-art” methods, such as sequential k-means, Birch, CluStream, DenStream, etc., acknowledge that the data are seen but once in real streaming analysis (e.g., intrusion detection, voter fraud, etc.). Interpretation of their outputs generally overlooks the fact that when the data cannot be saved, batch clustering ideas, such as preclustering assessment, partitioning, and cluster validity are not relevant. But in the current literature, the data, or some subset of it, are often saved for hindsight evaluation (we call this fake stream clustering). Our position? Useful analysis of real streaming data is in its infancy. We do not argue that current approaches to streaming clustering are wrong: rather, we regard them as transitional methods which will eventually lead to a new and useful paradigm for this type of computation. We think that this class of models and algorithms are actually classifiers, but with a special added component, viz., continuously updated cluster footprints of the instream processing. We need to carefully define the objectives of streaming analysis, and then choose terminology and methods that suit this evolving paradigm.},

  abstract     = {This article surveys the development of mathematical laws, circuits, and architectures that model how our brains make our minds, and shows how these contributions provide a blueprint for developing general-purpose autonomous adaptive algorithms and robots for intelligent applications in engineering and technology. The mathematical laws for short-term memory, medium-term memory, and long-term memory that provide the contemporary foundation for all subsequent biological neural network models were published in 1968, followed by a steady stream of model discovery and development to the present time. The Cohen-Grossberg model and theorem that was published in this journal in 1983 was one step in this series of developments. It proved global limit theorems for a general class of neural networks using a Lyapunov function as one tool. These theorems provide a guarantee that learning in these networks generates stable memories. This article surveys additional mathematical foundations for neural network design and applications and describes a modeling method for the incremental discovery of models with increasingly powerful and general functional capabilities. This method is illustrated by the adaptive resonance theory, or ART, architectures which explain how our brains autonomously learn to attend, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world, along the way explaining how our brains become conscious, as well as the computational constraints on learning that forced evolution to discover conscious states of mind. Multiple types of resonances support different kinds of conscious awareness and enable the explanation and prediction of large psychological and neurobiological databases about perception, cognition, emotion, and action. Because ART can be derived from a thought experiment about a universal problem of error correction in a changing world, its expanding applications to the development of autonomously intelligent systems should transform future technologies.},

Extensions of the N-tuple method are discussed using a generalized product expression and we relate the generalization to graphical models. We discuss the sum rule, the product rule, and the plurality voting rule for combining the scores of the subspace classifiers. We selected a representative sample of papers that the 1959 N-tuple subspace classifier inspired. Some of the papers introduced specialized improvements. Many of the papers showed the value of the N-tuple subspace classifier in all kinds of applications and compared the results of one or more varieties of the N-tuple subspace classifier with other state-of-the-art classifiers. Their experiments showed that the N-tuple subspace classifier was competitive with the state-of-the-art classifiers and often had a higher accuracy.

  abstract     = {A 50th birthday is an important milestone in the life of any individual and certainly in the development of collectives and organizations. January 2021 is such a milestone in the life of the IEEE T ransactions of S ystems , M an , and C ybernetics , which had its very first issue published in January 1971. Our 50th Anniversary Issue celebrates this remarkable achievement by introducing 20 survey articles from early pioneers of our field, as well as works by leading scientists conducting research at the cutting edge of systems science, with a focus on human aspects, cybernetics, with crucial societal impact. Our goal is to provide a vista of the remarkable developments in the past, giving a snapshot of the present state of our field, and indicating possible avenues for future progress in our rapidly changing research discipline.},
