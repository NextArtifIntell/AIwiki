  abstract     = {An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) networks fulfil the on-demand computation services for the mobile terminals (MTs) with its high mobility and easy deployment. Thus, reduction in the latency is observed but the energy efficiency is still a major issue in this network, as both the UAV and MTs have limited energy storage batteries. Also, to support the massive connectivity, and to handle the data traffic generated by the MTs in an uplink scenario, using nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is accomodated. The NOMA-based MEC provides flexible computing services to MTs. In this article, our goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of the NOMA-based MEC networks underlaying UAV with time, computation capacity, and UAV trajectory. The formulated model is a nonlinear programming problem; for the solution, it is divided into two subproblems: joint time allocation and task computation capacity, and UAV trajectory optimization. To solve the joint time allocation and computation task capacity, we proposed an iterative algorithm with low complexity, where closed-form solutions are obtained in each step. Next, to optimize the trajectory of the UAV, we used the successive convex approximation technique. Numerical results demonstrated that the proposed scheme achieves better results as compared to the orthogonal multiple access and equal resource allocation schemes.},

The proposed C-VAR method only requires limited communications about power flow and voltage in a subset of nodes locally and is optimization-free. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the real-time voltage control for a distributed large-scale power grid. For demonstration purposes, C-VAR is evaluated using the IEEE 123-node test feeder and compared with benchmark solutions, such as the IEEE Standard 1547 and centralized model predictive control. The results show that C-VAR does not incur too much power loss and quickly drives the voltage back to the desired range under high power loads and PV indeterminacy.},

The substation secondary equipment consists of the protection and control intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) known as relays. Each section of the OHW between the substations is protected by a set of two relays at both ends of a line for impedance protection and their backup relays. At substations facing the sections at the end of the line, where there is no other substation on the other end, usually the overcurrent and earth fault protection is used. At the substations, there are disturbance fault recorders installed or relays equipped with a capability to record and store disturbance fault records. An analysis of these fault records makes a significant contribution to the efficient running of a traction system such as the Gautrain rapid rail system. A combination of the analysis of the faults that occur in the OHW as recorded and stored in the relays as well as the performance of the IEDs and the protection settings using the on-site tests are a subject of this article.},

But, they are associated with some flaws such as complexity of implementation and low convergence rate. In this regard, in addition to the simplicity in implementation, the optimal point of the proposed model is a saddle point. Using augmented Lagrangian function with continuous-time optimization dynamics algorithm, a dynamic system will be established where its equilibrium points are Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points of the proposed model. Also, it will be shown that these points can be locally asymptotically stable under some conditions. Additionally, the proposed analytic method proves that the rate of convergence increases with an increasing penalty coefficient. To validate the performance of the presented algorithm, the problem of EE optimization for a sample mobile ad hoc network is simulated in MATLAB environment.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are a viable alternative for a sustainable mode of transportation. A huge penetration of EVs in future will lead to increasing demand in commercial parking lots equipped with charging systems. Hence, this research area is being pursued meaningfully in recent years. This article proposes a transactive energy management system (EMS) for commercial parking lots equipped with EV charging system and rooftop PV system. Initially, the EMS is optimized with the objective of balancing charging demand with supply. To make the EMS more realistic, factors such as battery degradation cost and photovoltaic levelized cost of energy are considered. At the later stage, the EMS of each parking lot communicates the energy requirement and excess energy to the local trading agent to initiate the proposed transactive energy transaction mechanism. The double-sided auction bidding mechanism is price flexible and based on the valuation of the energy requirement of parking lots. For a system with six parking lots and 25 EVs in each parking lot, the proposed scheme results in cost savings in the range of 2\% to 7\% for different cases of fixed and variable feed-in tariff. The uncertainty analysis shows that the cost savings vary from a minimum of 2.41\% to maximum 12.09\% with an average of 6.11\%. The case studies demonstrate the potential economic benefit of the proposed scheme.},

The transactive energy system is posited to afford such energy marketplace in the retail zone that facilitates the energy transactions between local entities through peer-to-peer contracts. Under such agreement, prosumer can sell its excess power to consumers by participating in energy trading. However, significant losses will incur in the distribution network due to energy transport between the buyers and sellers. This calls for an efficient and fair loss allocation framework. Moreover, the adopted allocation mechanism must consider the unbalanced nature of power flow allied to the distribution system for effective recovery. With this view, this article presents a transaction-tracing based loss allocation scheme for assigning the network losses incurred due to the transactions occurring between peers in a dynamic environment. The transaction paths of a 3Phase-4Wire system are derived using a graph-based method. The analysis is executed on a 33-bus distribution network and the results are compared with the branch current decomposition method to confirm the impartiality of the proposed approach. The result shows that the devised method performs well under different loadings and allocates the losses fairly between the network participants during all transactions.},

Sensors are omnipresent, owing to which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are developing as a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). M2M interaction poses a severe threat to the lifetime of the network. Clustering plays an essential role in elevating the energy efficiency of the WSN. Particularly, uniform distribution of cluster heads (CHs) is crucial for achieving better network lifetime and uninterrupted sensing from the area under observation. For this, we propose an efficient two-fold clustering algorithm, namely second-fold clustering (SFC). In the first phase, the selection of CH is made based on zonal residual energy and zonal degree of connectivity. In the second phase, the leftover nodes known as isolated nodes are clumped. CH is selected based on the zonal degree of connectivity to ensure that energy is disbursed (almost) uniformly by all the nodes. This uniformity makes it suitable for integration with the IoT. To find out the efficacy of SFC, carried rigorous experimental study out where it is compared to two existing clustering algorithms. The simulation results show that SFC outperforms its counterparts. The results showed that SFC improved network lifetime by approximately 9.6\% and 10.2\% compared to regional energy-aware clustering scheme and Residual-Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (R-LEACH), respectively.},

Based on this observation, we are motivated to exploit the advantages of NDN to achieve aVC. However, NDN has a different architecture from vehicular networking, which might lead to considerable aVC-based data retrieval costs and frequent reverse-path disruptions. To overcome the problems, we propose an NDN-based aVC framework (NVCF) to achieve aVC, and aim to reduce aVC-based data retrieval costs and improve aVC-based data acquisition success rates. NVCF exploits NDN to achieve aVC so that vehicles can acquire aVC-based data via one data retrieval process. Moreover, NVCF stabilizes reverse paths by electing a small number of forwarders so that vehicles can employ unicast and stable reverse paths to retrieve data from the nearest provider or forwarder involved in reverse paths. Furthermore, NVCF can effectively fix broken reverse paths to guarantee successful receipt of aVC-based data. NVCF is analyzed and evaluated, and the experimental results demonstrate that NVCF effectively reduces data retrieval costs and improves success rates.},

To enable the precise time feature in packet networks, a novel time synchronization scheme is proposed based on software-defined networking/network functions virtualization enabled network architecture, exploring the programmability of network time synchronization as a fundamental concept to define the function model for core components. Time synchronization is built as a virtual network function (VNF), and a synchronization controller is designed to manage the synchronization processing and precision compensation together with the network controller and the proposed VNF. More specifically, the time synchronization model and compensation algorithms are introduced to reveal the mechanism of the synchronization process. To thoroughly study the performance of the proposed scheme, an analytical model is developed that covers the primary influencing factors of synchronization accuracy, including the link length, delay coefficient, timestamping granularity, and local oscillator&#39;s characteristic of the network element. Further, experimental and analytical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

At the training stage, the unified decoder is trained to learn the distinct characteristics of encoded codewords following different specifications. Then, at the deployment stage, the classifier will extract the distinct structural features and identify the coding pattern. Thus, the DL decoder could choose an appropriate set of neural network parameters for information recovery.

This article proposes an adaptive protection scheme to handle DOCRs coordination problem in microgrid having multiple point of common couplings. The proposed scheme consists of two blocks: offline and online. In offline, settings of DOCRs are calculated for most important operating conditions (grid connected and islanded modes) and stored in corresponding DOCRs. The online task is performed based on local and global decision approaches. The local decision approach ensures significant less burden on microgrid central controller. Also, the proposed scheme does not cause any catastrophic conditions in microgrid when a fault occurs during critical situations. Then, coordination problem is formulated as constrained nonlinear programming problem and solved using a symbiotic organism search algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is examined on 7-bus and IEEE 33-bus microgrids during various operating conditions. Furthermore, simulation results are validated on hardware-in-loop test bed using real-time digital simulator, numerical relays, and CMS-356 (voltage and current amplifier). From simulation and hardware results, it is noticed that proposed scheme is able to provide an adequate protection to microgrids during various operating conditions, various types of bolted faults, and high-impedance faults.},

  abstract     = {Successive interference cancelation (SIC) has been considered widely for the detection of downlink nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) signals. However, the sequential detection inherent to SIC process may introduce additional time delay for certain users, making the SIC unsuitable for communication systems with time delay constraints such as wireless networks that utilize unmanned aerial vehicles or low earth orbit satellites. Therefore, this article considers the performance of NOMA systems using a joint multiuser detector (JMuD), which can detect the signals of all users simultaneously and, hence, reduce the detection time requirements. The performance of the JMuD is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER), computational complexity, and processing time and compared to the SIC detector (SICD). The exact BER of the JMuD is derived analytically using quadrature phase shift keying modulation where closed-form expressions are derived for the two- and three-user scenarios for the air-to-ground channel, which is modeled as a Rician fading channels with order statistics. The obtained analytical results corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation confirm that the BERs of the JMuD and SICD are identical; however, the processing time of the SICD is 51\% more than the JMuD for several cases of interest.},

  abstract     = {Multienergy systems (MESs), as coupling of various energy sectors, can offer appropriate solutions to the operation of energy systems. The flexibility introduced by energy diversity can leverage the operation of MESs in supplying different energy demands, e.g., electricity, heat, etc. This article presents a continuous-time optimization framework for the day-ahead operation of MESs, where a function space solution method is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the proposed model. The proposed methodology projects the day-ahead model into a finite-dimensional function space spanned by Bernstein polynomials and converts the problem with an indefinite dimension into a finite-order mixed-integer linear programming problem that can be easily solved with commercial solvers. The main purpose of the proposed framework is to model the parameter and decision trajectories of MESs in a way to reduce the day-ahead energy load approximation errors and minimize the costs associated with net-load deviations in real-time operation. In this way, the flexibility introduced by the operation of different energy units in MESs can be efficiently captured to further improve the performance of such systems. The proposed optimization framework is studied regarding four test MESs and the results for multiple cases are presented and compared. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology in capturing the load approximation errors, as it gives a better solution to the cost-efficient operation of MESs at a reasonable computational time.},

  abstract     = {Extensive redundant links and dedicated network components are deployed in existing networks to avoid network congestion caused by peak traffic. These network components are underutilized, leading to an extreme waste of electrical energy and negative environmental consequences. Most energy efficiency schemes have little consideration of the subsequent traffic load as well as the impact of energy saving on network performance, which brings many challenges, such as frequent flow rerouting, continual device state transition, and network load imbalance. In this article, we propose an energy efficiency optimization framework based on traffic prediction in software-defined networking, aiming at reducing network energy consumption while ensuring communication quality. First, we design a real-time traffic prediction mechanism based on gated recurrent unit neural network of deep learning to capture the temporal characteristics of network traffic and provide data basis for the deployment of energy-saving strategies. Second, we propose a heuristic algorithm for energy efficiency optimization to balance flow demand and energy consumption and to achieve dynamic load balancing and energy saving. Finally, simulation is carried out through Ryu controller, Mininet, and TensorFlow. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves about 47.71\% reduction in terms of the overall energy consumption with good network load balancing.},

A method to determine demand and feed-in limits depending on the day-ahead predictions of load demand and PV power profiles is developed. Furthermore, an optimal rule-based control strategy that determines day-ahead charge/discharge schedules of battery for peak shaving of utility grid power is proposed. The rules are formulated such that the peak utility grid demand and feed-in powers are limited to the corresponding demand and feed-in limits of the day, respectively, while ensuring that the state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery at the end of the day is the same as the SoC of the start of the day. The optimal inputs required for applying the proposed rule-based control strategy are determined using a genetic algorithm for minimizing peak energy drawn from the utility grid. The proposed control algorithm is tested for various PV power and load demand profiles using MATLAB.},

Hospitals cannot quickly provide treatment for chronic diseases for the elderly. This article discusses a mobile-medical-based system that uses effective data decision-making and wireless network communication to assist the elderly in implementing remote medical services and proposes a deep learning model-combined sparse autoencoder (CSAE) in the decision-making module. The model uses sparse autoencoders to process patient detection data and monitoring data collaboratively to achieve multisource data association and fusion. The prediction probability of diseases is obtained through deep neural networks and a classifier, and the best disease prediction sequence is output to realize the prediction and early warning of chronic diseases. In the experimental part, we compare CSAE with the other four machine learning classification algorithms in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results prove that CSAE is superior to other algorithms in the single-disease prediction, with the accuracy and specificity exceeding 85\%, and the sensitivity not lower than 75\%. When predicting multiple diseases, our proposed algorithm&#39;s performance is the most stable, with an accuracy higher than other algorithms by more than 10\%.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-fidelity haptic feedback in teleoperated robotic systems is crucial, particularly in applications, such as medical, industrial, military, space, and underwater explorations. The quality of haptic feedback depends to a great extent on the controller design objectives, such as stability and transparency. In addition to the time delay, the most challenging issues that affect haptic feedback are model uncertainties, parametric variations, and external disturbances. In this article, such issues have been addressed by developing a novel multimodal adaptive robust control algorithm for teleoperated systems with time-varying delay. Here, parametric convergence is achieved swiftly with a milder condition than a stronger persistent excitation condition on the regressor signal, resulting in the enhancement of transient performance. The proposed method ensures the robustness of the system against bounded perturbations and high-frequency unmodeled dynamics using a modified terminal sliding-mode controller alongside the adaptive scheme. The proposed method promises high-fidelity haptic feedback to the operator by ensuring improved robust global asymptotic stability, synchronization, and transparency, addressing parametric variations and disturbances. The validity of the proposed adaptive robust control law is substantiated through simulations and comparisons with the existing methods for a 2-R teleoperation system. The experimental results for a 1-R teleoperation system are also presented.},

Direct communication by smart devices with people to identify parameters of healthcare and send them to a central repository is crucial. There is a need to secure messages among the sender and recipient during data exchange in order to tackle the malicious attacks by human. To provide secure communication, various signature-based schemes are presented in the literature. However, smart devices require lightweight tasks by guaranteeing essential security strengths. The main difficulty in signature-based methods is more computational cost incurred for signature and verification stages involving large numbers. This article introduces a lightweight provably secure short digital signature technique for safe communication amongst smart devices in human-centered IoT (HCIoT), the security of which is closely related to an extended chaotic maps assumption in a random oracle model (ROM). Moreover, we used less comprehensive operations to accomplish processes of verification and signing, similar to human signing on legitimate documents and then check as per witness. The proposed technique provides a stronger guarantee of protection than existing signature techniques. The key advantage of the presented technique over the DSA techniques is that it takes less computation in the verification stage and signing length; it retains the degree of protection. The presented short signature takes less bandwidth for communication, storage, and computing resources.},

  abstract     = {An aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) can bring economic and technical benefits for the DER owners and system operator. However, the operation of DERs encounters various uncertainties, which can seriously impact the benefits of DER aggregation. This article presents a new operation optimization approach for an aggregator of DERs considering the unavailability of DERs (as discrete uncertainty sources) as well as forecast uncertainties of electricity prices, solar powers, and wind powers (as continuous uncertainty sources). The proposed approach for DER aggregator (DERA) operation optimization comprises stochastic multiobjective information-gap decision theory (IGDT) to model these discrete and continuous uncertain variables. Moreover, a hybrid endogenous/exogenous scenario generation method is incorporated into the proposed approach to enhance the efficiency of the stochastic programming part by producing decision-dependent scenario trees. The proposed approach is formulated as a nested bilevel optimization model. The proposed approach is compared with other DERA operation optimization models using an out-of-sample analysis method. The comparative results illustrate the superiority of the proposed stochastic multiobjective IGDT approach over various deterministic, stochastic, and IGDT methods. In addition, the high tractability of the proposed solution method is illustrated, while its linearization error for the stochastic multiobjective IGDT problem is well below 1\%.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a new mathematical model to solve the restoration problem in balanced distribution systems with distributed generators (DGs) considering closed-loop topology operation during the restorative state. The restorative state is comprised of the interval of time since the permanent fault has been isolated until the time at which the faulted zone is repaired. During this interval of time, switching operations are performed to minimize the negative effects resulting from the occurrence of a permanent fault in the network. In this way, the two main objective functions of the restoration problem are to minimize the amount of load curtailment in the restored system and to minimize the number of switching operations. Conventionally, the network topology is maintained radial throughout the restorative state. In this article, the possibility of forming loops is considered for improving both objective functions. As such, a new mixed-integer second-order cone programming model is proposed, considering the temporary formation of operational loops in the restorative state, and both connected and islanded operation of the DGs. Several tests are carried out using a 53-node test system and a 2313-node system for single and multiple fault scenarios. The results obtained with the proposed model outperform the solutions achieved when only open-loop configurations are considered for the restoration problem. Moreover, it is verified that the islanded operation of the DGs provides more flexibility to the network, allowing more load to be restored.},

  abstract     = {Distribution network failures can cause unintentional islanding of three-/single-phase multimicrogrids (MMGs). The transient impulse that occurs during the unintentional islanding period can affect the stability of the voltage and frequency in an MMG. To address this problem, this article proposes an unintentional islanding transition control strategy based on artificial emotional reinforcement learning (AERL) for a three-/single-phase MMG. First, to solve the three-phase unbalance problem that occurs during the unintentional islanding period, a three-phase combination method based on a merge sort is proposed to realize the combination optimization of the single-phase source-load-storage. Second, a load-shedding strategy based on AERL is proposed to deal with the tie-line power shortage caused by the distribution network failures. This strategy can quickly eliminate power shortages and ensure the uninterrupted power supply of critical loads. Finally, the performance of the proposed transition strategy is verified in a three-/single-phase MMG model based on a modified IEEE 37-bus system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system. During the unintentional islanding period, the proposed transition strategy reduces the frequency recovery time by 21.74\%, 14.29\%, and 10\%, the voltage recovery time by 16.22\%, 13.89\%, and 8.82\% compared with the mixed-integer second-order cone programming method (MISOCPM), the implicit enumeration method (IEM), and the compound storage-regulating and load-shedding method (CSLM) in the modified IEEE 37-bus system, respectively; the proposed transition strategy reduces the frequency recovery time by 25.64\%, 21.62\%, and 12.12\%, the voltage recovery time by 19.15\%, 15.56\%, and 7.32\% compared with the MISOCPM, IEM, and CSLM in the modified IEEE 118-bus system, respectively. The test results show that the proposed transition control strategy realizes the seamless transition of a three-/single-phase MMG and ensures the uninterrupted power supply of critical loads.},

How to achieve trustworthy interoperability among several heterogeneous entities and also among companies is still a challenge; however, hence, there is a strong focus on research, standardization initiatives, and adaptation of solutions from other areas. Yet, companies interested in Industry 4.0 do not have any guidance on what solutions or concerns should be considered to architect Industry 4.0 systems that assure trustworthy interoperability. This article contributes a set of essential requirements for assuring a trustworthy interoperability in Industry 4.0. We first identified the main challenges regarding interoperability in real-case Industry 4.0 projects. Then, we designed a set of architecture drivers combining such challenges with quality aspects extracted a systematic literature review. We refined these drivers based on a rigorous survey with experts from Industry 4.0. As a result, we found seven architecture drivers: Authentication to the system, data access control, data privacy to protect sensitive information, traceability and auditability of data, availability of physical devices, availability of data, and compatibility of data and services. We recommend adopting all these drivers jointly to assure trustworthy interoperability, which is such an important factor for Industry 4.0.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a novel millimeter wave (mmWave) access architecture, called mmWave over cable (mmWoC), for achieving effective indoor coverage under integrated access backhaul. The proposed mmWave access architecture is characterized by using an analog link over local area network cables to relay the frequency-converted signals between the mmWave small cell station at the outdoor and the mmWave antenna array in the indoor, so as to ensure line-of-sight transmissions for the indoor user equipment. We first develop a precoding process for the proposed mmWoC architecture where a cascaded radio–radio (R–R) mmWave channel (R–R channel) is seen at the mmWave base station. Then, rate analysis is provided for both the cascaded R–R channel and the cascaded radio–cable–radio channel (R–C–R channel). Furthermore, we investigate an efficient yet simple resource mapping scheme between the antenna signals and the cable subcarriers, namely nonconfigurable air-to-cable (NC-A2C), which ensures each cable subcarrier with sufficient capacity to meet the fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) requirement by manipulating the cable input powers. Simulation results indicate that the proposed NC-A2C scheduler can efficiently trade the capacity off for better control simplicity and cost effectiveness; and the proposed precoder can work well on the R–C–R indoor environment under the mmWoC architecture.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology for addressing resource scarcity in wireless networks. However, in the current CR-based framework, when resource availability changes, existing resource allocation algorithms restart the optimization process without using historical information. In addition, most previous studies have focused on one or two objectives and some have only addressed pure power control or spectrum allocation, limiting the potential of CR. Thus, this article proposes a dynamic multiobjective approach for power and spectrum allocation in a CR-based environment in which the available spectrum channels vary over time and multiple objectives are involved. This article presents a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) with the objectives of energy efficiency, fairness, and spectrum utilization and an approach of Pareto optimality. A dynamic resource allocation algorithm comprising a hybrid initialization method and feasible point generation mechanisms is proposed to solve the dynamic MOP. To dynamically adjust resource allocation, historical approximate Pareto optimal solutions, represented by a center and a manifold, are used to predict the new optima. The proposed approach can yield a better convergence level and convergence rate than those attained by comparable multiobjective resource allocation algorithms. Compared with conventional single-objective approaches, it achieves an excellent balance between the objectives.},

In this article, a novel methodology is proposed to online assess the reliability and optimize the mode transfer scheduling of the degrading standby system considering the load-sharing characteristic. First, the stepwise drifted Wiener process is invoked to characterize the component degradation process. Then, to deal with the process and measurement noise, the monitored degradation data are processed online to update the component degradation state and rate, based on the particle filter. Besides, a Monte Carlo method involving the closed Newton–Cotes quadrature rule is employed to quantify the real-time system reliability. Finally, the mode transfer scheduling of standby components is optimized online to maximize the system reliability at mission time. A numerical example and a case study referring to the aircraft hydraulic system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology.},

In particular, the base station transmits separate data streams through the cochannel direct link as well as the FD relay channel, utilizing the successive-interference-cancellation (SuIC) capability at the receiver. As a result, the downlink communication data can be interchangeably loaded to separate subcarriers, employing an orthogonal multicarrier strategy, or to different available links, i.e., direct or FD relay link, employing the nonorthogonal SuIC at the receiver. In order to reliably model the SuIC operation at the receiver, the collective sources of impairments, including the nonlinear transmit and receiver chain distortions as well as the channel state information inaccuracy are incorporated. An optimization problem for joint subcarrier and power allocation is then devised in order to maximize system sum-rate, which belongs to the class of smooth difference-of-convex problems. An iterative optimization solution is then proposed, utilizing successive inner approximation framework, which converges to the point that satisfies Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. Numerical results show performance and robustness gain of proposed SuIC scheme in terms of sum-rate compared to previously proposed single-connectivity and half-duplex relaying schemes.},

The increasing participation of IIDGs and the developments of power electronic technologies have raised the possibility of controlling the power injected by IIDGs for regulating the voltage level, especially during short-circuit fault conditions, following the regional grid codes. When a short-circuit fault occurs on the transmission line connected to the IIDGs bus, a dramatic voltage drop occurs. In this situation, the IIDG injects the reactive power fast that disrupts the performance of the distance relay as a result of which the operation of the relay in different operational conditions may either over reach or under reach. In this article, a comprehensive analysis is accomplished regarding the errors imposed on the estimated impedance of the distance relay, due to the voltage control of IIDGs, in single and double-circuit transmission lines. Then, an impedance-based pilot protection method is proposed to enhance the performance of the transmission line protection relays affected by the reactive power injected by the IIDGs.},

  abstract     = {While contact tracing is of paramount importance in preventing the spreading of infectious diseases, manual contact tracing is inefficient and time consuming as those in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days, later. This article proposes a smart contact tracing (SCT) system utilizing the smartphone’s Bluetooth low energy signals and machine learning classifiers to automatically detect those possible contacts to infectious individuals. SCT’s contribution is two-fold: a) classification of the user’s contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communication protocol. To protect the user’s privacy, both broadcasted and observed signatures are stored in the user’s smartphone locally and only disseminate the stored signatures through a secure database when a user is confirmed by public health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength each smartphone estimates its distance from other user’s phones and issues real-time alerts when social distancing rules are violated. Extensive experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative evaluation of five machine learning classifiers indicate that a decision tree classifier outperforms other state-of-the-art classification methods with an accuracy of about 90\% when two users carry their smartphone in a similar manner. Finally, to facilitate research in this area while contributing to the timely development, the dataset of six experiments with about 123 000 data points is made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol for client–server environments is a significant cryptographic primitive that provides communication confidentiality and mutual authentication between clients and servers. In an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, clients typically employ IoT devices with limited computing capability to interact with servers through the Internet. Numerous AKE protocols suitable for IoT devices, called AKE-IoT protocols, have been proposed. Recently, side-channel attacks have been conducted to defeat traditional cryptographic protocols because a side-channel adversary can retrieve partial content of long-term or short-term secret keys. Several leakage-resilient AKE (LRAKE) protocols were presented to counteract such attacks. Unfortunately, the existing LRAKE protocols are not suitable for IoT devices because expensive pairing operations are required for client sides. In this article, we propose the first efficient LRAKE protocol suitable for IoT devices, named LRAKE-IoT. By the unbalanced computation method, no pairing operation is required for client sides in our protocol. In the generic bilinear pairing group model, security analysis is conducted to demonstrate the security of the proposed protocol in the continuous-leakage-resilient extended-Canetti–Krawczyk model. Finally, computational experiences on two IoT devices are given to show that the proposed protocol is well-suited for IoT devices.},

  abstract     = {For avoiding the risk of information loss caused by quantum measurement and obtaining the concise and reliable fusion results of a given source weather dataset for decision-making, this article transforms a given source (weather) dataset into the collection of quantum states, and proposes a weather data detection and fusion method based on the von Neumann entropy controlled reduction of quantum representations. The reduction of the quantum representations within a data vector depends on the von Neumann entropy of this data vector. Then, all the source data samples (units) are classified into different subsets according to the gaps between the data samples recombined by the quantum elements after reduction. Depending on the impact factors of source data samples, the source data samples in a subset are fused into a new object data sample. After that, the reliabilities of all object data samples are evaluated through the predefined reliability evaluation model, and the object data samples with high reliabilities are useful for decision-making oriented applications (such as weather prediction). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data fusion method is more effective in obtaining the concise and reliable fusion results for decision-making oriented applications compared with the other mentioned data fusion methods.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of photovoltaic (PV) has been increased in distribution systems worldwide. The intermittent PV generation can cause diverse operational problems in the grid, especially voltage deviations and violations. As a result, voltage assessment in distribution systems interconnected with PV, which has a heavy computational burden, is privileged to assist power utilities in decision-making. In this article, a low-computational and accurate voltage assessment approach with PV considering fine-resolution simulations (i.e., time-step of 1 s) is proposed. Specifically, the proposed approach can rapidly compute the voltage deviation in the whole distribution system and terminal voltages of PV units based on a data-driven model. This model is built using machine learning considering various scenarios of PV and load profiles. The proposed approach has the following features. 1) Its computational burden is very low compared to the widely used iterative-based methods. 2) It can handle the full data with the finest available resolution, yielding accurate voltage assessment. The proposed method has been applied for voltage assessment considering daily and annual simulations of different distribution systems interconnected with PV units. The simulation results manifest the high accuracy and computational speed of the proposed approach, especially for fine-resolution simulations.},

Collaborative filtering and content-based are representative solutions in recommender systems, however, the content-based model has some shortcomings, such as single kind of recommendation results, lack of effective perception of user preferences; while, for the collaborative filtering model, there is a cold start problem, and such a model is greatly affected by its adopted clustering algorithm. To address these issues, a hybrid recommendation scheme is proposed in this article, which is based on both collaborative filtering and content-based. In this scheme, we propose the concept of time impact factor, and a time-aware user preference model is built based on it. Also, user feedback on recommendation items is utilized to improve the accuracy of our proposed recommendation model.

The RSMA framework is a novel multiple access method based on linearly precoded rate splitting at the secondary base station, and successive interference cancellation at the secondary receivers, which has shown better performance compared with the traditional space-division multiple access (SDMA) method. In particular, the objective is to minimize the transmit power at the secondary base station subject to the constraints of minimum energy harvesting, minimum data rate, and a maximum power level for allowable interference with the primary users. The challenging problem under consideration is nonconvex, and the solution relies on dividing it into outer and inner optimization problems. Then, we propose a particle-swarm-optimization-based algorithm to solve the outer problem, with the inner problem managed by the semidefinite relaxation method. In addition, we present a comparative scheme based on the successive convex approximation method and a scheme based on SDMA. Finally, simulation results confirm the superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison with the other schemes.},

However, transmission errors in the reference chaotic signal would induce the error propagations when directly used for demodulations. In order to address this issue, we propose a low-rank approximation of matrices (LRAM) detection method to improve the reliability performances. In our design, we exploit the low-rank characteristic of MC-DCSK signals sharing the reference chaotic signal. Instead of directly using the received reference chaotic signal for correlated demodulation, we propose to apply the LRAM method to jointly estimate the reference signal and the information-bearing signal. We use the singular value decomposition and generalized LRAM methods to minimize the distances between the estimates and transmitted data. Thus, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved to achieve lower bit error rate (BER). Moreover, theoretical BER expression is derived and LRAM-aided system is proved to be capable of proving the maximum-likelihood detection for received signals. Simulation results demonstrate the BER performances of our design outperform counterparts over additive white Gaussian noise and fading channels.},

  abstract     = {The coordinated operation of different energy systems, such as electrical, gas, and heating, can improve the efficiency of the whole energy system and facilitate the larger penetration of renewable energy resources in the electricity generation portfolio. However, appropriate models considering various technical constraints of the energy carriers (e.g., gas system pressure limit and heat losses in the district heating networks) are needed to effectively assess the true impact of integrated energy system (IES) operation on the overall system’s performance. This article proposes a flexible unit commitment (UC) problem for coordinated operation of electricity, natural gas, and district heating networks, called multicarrier network-constrained unit commitment (MNUC), to minimize the operation cost of the IES. Besides, an integrated demand response (IDR) program is considered as a promising solution to improve consumers’ electricity, gas, and heat consumption patterns and to increase the power dispatch of combined heat and power units. Multienergy storage systems are also included in the proposed model to decrease the impact of multienergy network constraints on the overall system’s performance. To model the uncertainties involved in the operation of the three networks, a combined robust/stochastic approach is preferred in the MNUC problem considering multicarrier energy storage systems and the IDR program. Numerical results show that the whole operation cost of the IES has decreased by 2.58\% considering the IDR program and multienergy storage systems.},

A modified prescribed performance control (MPPC) with asymmetric behavior boundaries is proposed to enable a better regulation ability for formation synchronization error without any overshoots, and the requirement on obtaining the precise value of initial error can be removed compared with the existing PPC. To deal with uncertainties appearing in individual quadrotors, a state estimator-based minimal learning parameter (SE-MLP) observer capable of reducing online computational burden without offline training is developed, such that a chattering-free transient learning process against disturbances can be ensured. Additionally, by introducing a high-order sliding mode (HOSM) differentiator to replace the linear filter in recursive back-stepping design, fast and accurate time-derivatives of virtual control signals can be generated to further improve the control performance. By fusion of MPPC, SE-MLP, HOSM as well as Lyapunov stability analysis, an enhanced neural guaranteed performance formation maneuvering control scheme for networked uncertain quadrotors is obtained such that position consensus without any overshoots can be achieved.

The approach is based on the estimated model of system behavior. The approach is in two phases. In the first phase, an observer is used to estimate unmeasured states and relevant parameters that can characterize system performance. In the second phase, in the beginning, the historical parameters obtained are used to identify models describing their dynamics using learning time-series prediction methods. In this article, the support vector regression and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system are illustrated. Then, the model is simulated to estimate the future performance of the system and compare it to the desired performance. A comparison of the results obtained using learning time-series prediction methods with those obtained using the maximum likelihood method is carried out. The results show that the proposed approach makes it possible to estimate the remaining lifetime with particularly good quality.

First, we designed a new multiauthority ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (MA-CPABE) scheme and showed that the new MA-CPABE has the indistinguishability of plaintext under adaptively chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) security and good performance. By combining the MA-CPABE and proxy re-encryption, the rights owner can flexibly sell the copyright to different users with once encryption by an agent who cannot access any information related to digital content when changing the ciphertext access policy as required. By using the smart contract of Ethereum, a fair trade of the decryption keys between the rights owner and rights requester is implemented. In order to further improve fairness, another blockchain is used as a ledge to store information related to digital rights, which greatly reduces the storage overhead in public blockchain. Security analysis shows that our scheme can provide IND-CPA security, resist collusion attacks, and protect the user’s privacy. Performance analysis shows that our scheme can provide a wealth of features to meet the various needs of users.

In this article, we consider a heterogeneous transmission network consisting of hosts and routers and aim to optimize both transmission capacity and robustness of this network simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for optimizing transmission capacity and robustness. Moreover, in order to achieve optimized transmission performance and robustness at reasonable and balanced computational cost, the proposed MOEA adopts a two-phase design, i.e., a sampling phase and an optimization phase. Simulation results on scale-free and realistic transmission networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, comprehensive analysis of the solutions from different parts of the obtained Pareto fronts shows distinct characteristics and provides various choices for optimizing transmission functionality and robustness of networks.},

This article investigates the operation and control of an AC/multiterminal dc (MTDC) system with bipolar topology incorporating the dc grid protection schemes. Based on the scale of a circuit breaker&#39;s operating time, the performance of three different protection strategies is compared and analyzed using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. Simulation results explicitly reveal that the dynamic performance of the MTDC grid significantly deteriorates with the slow functioning of the protection schemes, followed by a dc grid fault. Besides, prolonged recovery time causes a substantial loss of power infeed and affects the ac/dc grid&#39;s stability. Finally, to assess the frailty of the MTDC grid, a transient energy stability index is proposed considering the voltage variation in the prestate and poststate fault clearing interval. Relevant case studies are performed on the MTDC grid using an analytical approach and nonlinear simulation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed index.},

  abstract     = {DC microgrids are growing in popularity due to their advantages in terms of simplicity and energy efficiency while connecting dc sources and dc loads. In traditional hierarchical schemes, optimization and control are implemented at different time scales. The loose integration lowers its energy efficiency and makes it hard to achieve real-time optimization. Even a slight disturbance can result in deviations of bus voltages and output currents from their optimal operating points. Additionally, most real-time control schemes cannot guarantee the boundedness of individual bus voltages. Targeting these problems, a distributed optimal control algorithm is presented in this article for dc microgrids to minimize operation loss (converter loss and distribution loss) in real time and maintain all bus voltages within predefined ranges. First, the Karuch–Kuhn–Tucker condition of the original constrained optimization problem is converted to an equivalent optimality condition, which is suitable for control design. Then, a distributed control algorithm is designed to drive the system&#39;s operating condition toward the optimal one. Convergence to the optima is guaranteed through rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analyses. Finally, simulation studies with a detailed switch-level model demonstrate the merits of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {A generalized uplink cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system assuming access points (APs) are paired with mixed-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) is investigated in this article. Specifically, the mixed-ADC/DAC architecture sacrifices part of performance gains and advocates a few low-precision ADCs/DACs to reduce the power consumption. Based on this antenna structure, we derive closed-form achievable rate expressions for maximal ratio combining (MRC) receiver filters by drawing support from the additive quantization noise model (AQNM) and analyze the impacts of the key design parameters, i.e., the number of total antenna arrays, the precision of coarse ADCs/DACs, the proportion of ideal ADCs/DACs in the mixed ADCs/DACs structure, and the power control strategy. In addition, the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered mixed-ADC/DAC architecture is also explored by recalling a generic power consumption model. Aside from this, to guarantee uniformly good service wherever users are geographically located, a max–min fairness power optimization algorithm is proposed, which can be determined by solving a geometric programming problem. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical analyses and examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a medium access control (MAC) scheme, called STation pREsence-Aware MAC (STREAM), that offers equal contention opportunities to the stations in a network. STREAM is designed to preserve its performance in crowded and high-traffic networks. The scheme improves channel access, utilization, and service fairness of stations. STREAM detects collided transmissions or idle events in the network to estimate the number of active stations. STREAM sets the contention period as a function of the number of stations in the network. As a result, the number of contention opportunities is enlarged and the access to the transmission channel in the network is improved. In this way, STREAM overcomes the performance degradation of IEEE 802.11 under heavy traffic and crowded networks. We analyze the throughput of STREAM, fairness of service, and the probability that a station experiences collisions as a function of the number of stations in the network. We also present performance evaluations and comparisons with IEEE 802.11 and other high-performing schemes. We extend the application of STREAM on traffic with different priorities and quality of service. Our evaluations show that STREAM outperforms IEEE 802.11 and the compared schemes. We show that STREAM is an ideal candidate as a fallback mechanism for IEEE 802.11 under overwhelming conditions.},

In this article, we argue that the fog computing paradigm can be leveraged to ensure safety in the Internet of Underground-Mine Things. We emphasize on prioritizing and speeding up the processing of sensitive data by introducing a factor named “criticality index” and ensuring the fairness of bandwidth allocation using this index to comply with the resource requirement of critical data. We formulate the interaction between the fog nodes using the notions of the Stackelberg game. Simulation-based results show that using the proposed scheme, the fog nodes are able to allocate bandwidth with less average error and offset bandwidth, compared to the benchmark schemes.},

The proposed system can operate in single- and multihop modes depending on the surrounding radio frequency environment and network topology. Specifically, we design a per-deployed WSN system for LPG detection/monitoring in residential areas and factories that collects, analyzes, and forwards the collected information over a wireless channel to the monitoring center to take the appropriate action. To achieve a reliable communication and data delivery, we implement an efficient communication protocol that organizes the data exchange between different nodes in the network. The proposed WSN system is deployed and experimentally tested. The data acquired from the various experiments are used to examine the reliable operation of the implemented system in terms of robustness and data delivery reliability. Robust and reliable performance is demonstrated with packet loss rate as low as 5\%. The experimental results also indicate that the proposed system can promptly detect gas leakage within 50 ms and provide accurate gas concentration measurements with 97\% accuracy.},

Our system first extracts vehicle segments from the top-view image of each fish-eye camera. These segments are then integrated into a common undistorted coordinate system. The center of the vehicle is finally determined using our simple but effective box fitting method. Moreover, a 1/18 scale indoor parking lot is designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.

Each cloudlet is able to process real-time applications with the help of virtual machines (VM). While multiple applications running on the cloudlet, the possibility of overprovisioning issue is unavoidable due to massive task-offloading requests from mobile devices. In this regard, balancing the load, among the cloudlets in a high-interactive applications scenario, is a promising issue. In order to balance the cloudlet load, migration of VMs from an overloaded cloudlet to an underloaded cloudlet is a favored solution. During this process, a well-designed migration mechanism must be outlined that can perform two steps such as VM selection and cloudlet adaption. In this article, an application-aware cloudlet adaption and VM selection framework has been devised for balancing the load in a multicloudlet environment. The candidate-cloudlet adaption is based on a migration efficiency indicator that reduces the response time and enhances load-balancing rate. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework has been evaluated by comparing with other state-of-the-art cloudlet-selection strategies.},

From the μPMU data of reference substation and distributed generator terminals, two parameters are formulated; a cumulative sum of frequency difference and a phase angle difference. In the event of islanding, a linear correlation exists between the two parameters. The linear correlation between the two parameters is evaluated in real time using Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient formula. A time bound threshold is considered to differentiate islanding events from other non-islanding events like load switching and faults. The advantage of the proposed IDS is it does not require the establishment of any frequency and phase angle based thresholds. Also the islanding detection time is independent of power mismatch conditions. Real-time performance of the algorithm is accessed on a test bench comprised of dSPACE DS1104 real-time controller and a real-time digital simulator (RTDS).},

  abstract     = {Fog computing can effectively provide a variety of application support for the fast-growing number of Internet of Things devices. However, the unique characteristics of fog computing also bring new security problems, especially the identity authentication in fog computing will face new challenges: Low latency (cloud servers should not be involved in authentication); fog servers are not completely trusted; robustness (no user reregistration is required when a fog server leaves fog) and lightweight (fog devices have constrained resources). In order to solve these problems faced by identity authentication in fog computing, we propose an authentication scheme suitable for fog computing environment, which implements mutual authentication between fog users and fog devices with the cooperation of incompletely trusted fog servers. Formal security analysis using the extended real-or-random (ROR) model shows that the proposed scheme is provably secure, and informal security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can resist known attacks. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme supports more functionality features. In addition, a comparative analysis of the communication costs and calculation costs of various schemes shows that our scheme is more suitable for application in fog computing environment than the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Handling varying uncertainties in renewable energy generation and load demands are major challenges to the restructured power system environment. This article proposes the design of a novel control methodology using a robust UIO for dynamic state estimation and an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller for adaptive LFC of interconnected power systems with high penetration of renewable energy in a restructured power system environment. The capability of the proposed robust UIO to independently estimate the true state of the power system regardless of unknown inputs or disturbances that impact the frequency stability in real time is demonstrated by the asymptotic zero property of the state estimation error. This is supported by using an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller in the LFC loop of each area of the interconnected system to efficiently damp frequency oscillations, thereby improving power system stability and resilience. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using a modified two-area power system in the restructured environment. The results obtained from the stability and LFC analyses during severe operating conditions demonstrated the robustness of the proposed control framework to unknown inputs and unprecedented variations that can affect the frequency stability of the system.},

This article focuses on developing a cost-effective rumor-refuting strategy in the situation where the rumormonger is strategic. Based on a novel individual-based rumor spreading model, we estimate the expected net benefit of the rumormonger as well as the expected total loss of the rumor victim. On this basis, we reduce the original problem to a differential game-theoretic model. Next, we derive a system for solving the model. By solving the system, we get a dynamic strategy pair. Through extensive comparative experiments, we find that this strategy pair is effective in terms of the solution concept of Nash equilibrium. Hence, we conclude that the rumor-refuting strategy contained in this strategy pair is cost-effective. Finally, we examine the effect of the structure of the OSN on the cost effectiveness of the rumor-supporting and rumor-refuting strategies contained in the proposed strategy pair. To our knowledge, this is the first time the rumor-refuting problem is addressed under the assumption that the rumormonger is strategic.},

  abstract     = {As the growing demand for battery energy storage systems (BESSs) generally follows the renewable energy sources (RESs) trend, the active management of BESS- and RES-based distributed energy resources (DERs) could effectively solve voltage-sag problems in active distribution systems (ADSs). DERs are typically interfaced with the grid through power-electronic inverters. They are considered power resources with adjustable active/reactive power injections that could contribute to the enhancement of the grid&#39;s performance. This article proposes a new framework for active/reactive power management of inverter-based DERs to mitigate voltage-sag problems in ADSs. The new framework utilizes a novel zonal-based voltage control algorithm for mitigating voltage-sag problems in ADSs. The algorithm identifies mitigation zones&#39; virtual boundaries based on a proposed electrical influence intensity index that reflects the electrical connectivity of the network. A novel zone capability index (ZCI) ranks the mitigation zones according to DER capacity, zonal loading conditions, and the number of nodes within each mitigation zone. The voltage mitigation algorithm minimizes the energy injected from DERs’ inverters to achieve maximum voltage sag alleviation in each mitigation zone. This zonal-based mitigation algorithm is applied to the IEEE 33-bus distribution system under voltage-sag conditions to verify the proposed algorithm&#39;s feasibility and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Efficient transmission protocols are required to minimize the energy consumption of mobile devices for ubiquitous connectivity in the next-generation of wireless networks. In this article, we analyze the energy consumption performance of a two-hop opportunistic device-select relaying (ODSR) scheme, where a device can either transmit data directly to a base station (BS) or relay the data to a nearby device, which forwards the data to the BS. We select a single device opportunistically from a device-to-device (D2D) network based on the energy required for transmission, including the energy consumed in the circuitry of the devices. By considering the log-normal shadowing as the dominant factor between devices and the BS, and Rayleigh fading in D2D links, we derive analytical bounds and scaling laws on average energy consumption. The derived analytical expressions show that the energy consumption of the ODSR decreases logarithmically with an increase in the number of devices, and achieves near-optimal performance only with a few nearby devices. This is an important design criterion to reduce latency and overhead energy consumption in a relay-assisted large-scale network. We also demonstrate the performance of the ODSR using simulations in realistic scenarios of a wireless network.},

  abstract     = {The ongoing efforts by many countries worldwide to increase the share of renewable energy sources in power generation has changed the nature of existing power grids and introduced numerous stability-related issues. To address these problems, more extensive and detailed stability analysis studies are therefore needed. Driven by this need, in this article, we present a passivity-based framework for stability analysis and control design that allows more accurate modeling of both the network and the power system components while facilitating the derivation of completely decentralized stability results. In particular, the proposed approach relies on the formulation of the network as a dynamical multivariable system, which is shown to be passive, even when the network’s dynamic and lossy nature are taken into account. The application of decentralized passivity conditions on bus dynamics is then further exploited, together with the incorporation of more accurate dynamical models for the power system components, to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the interconnected system. Moreover, we discuss the opportunities provided by the proposed approach regarding the incorporation of higher order dynamics, the derivation of significant stability results in a completely decentralized manner and the design of effective distributed control mechanisms. These opportunities are finally verified through the design of a demand-side voltage droop controller and several dynamic simulations on two typical test systems.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes the perching of nano-quadrotor using self-trigger finite-time second-order continuous control on a vertical wall. In perching, nano-quadrotor evolves from 3-D space and aligned in 2-D space. Although quadrotor dynamics are quite complex, but it is a combination of subsystems, and each subsystem is a relative degree two-type system. The designed controller converges all the position error and derivative of position error simultaneously, and in reaching phase only, hence there is no sliding phase. The proposed controller is also chattering free. Therefore, it does not actuate the unwanted dynamics of the quadrotor. Stability analysis using the Lyapunov stability theory has been done, and also analysis of the finite-time convergence is given. Furthermore, using the Lipschitz method, self-triggering conditions are derived for the controller, which gives the next triggering instant of the actuation. This mechanism reduces the task of the controller as well as the sensor. Experimental studies for nano-quadrotor perching on the vertical wall are conducted in indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through the experimental study, it is also validated that the proposed controller provides a better result than the second-order twisting controller.},

  abstract     = {Although natural disasters have recently imposed enormous damages to power system infrastructures, resilience enhancement through hardening measures is not usually compensated in conventional power system planning. In this article, a framework is proposed to enhance the resilience of distribution systems against earthquakes. In particular, it focuses on substations’ retrofit whose failure can affect the distribution system, imposing outages to the customers connected to it. A knapsack based heuristic method, which considers the bus configuration of substation is proposed to select the substation components for hardening. The potential failure of substation components that would lead to complete unavailability of substation is evaluated through minimal cut set-fault tree analysis. A criterion for resilience enhancement is proposed, including hardening cost, cost incurred by damaged components, cost of customers’ interruption in the distribution system level, and power generation cost of Distributed Energy Resources. A penalty mechanism taking into account the component repair time is used to estimate interruption costs. The impact of earthquakes on substation components is modeled using fragility curves. A case study with real earthquake characteristics is considered and Monte Carlo simulation is used to capture the stochastic failure of substation components. The results show that power transformers and circuit breakers at 20 kV are the most critical components in the retrofitting strategies.},

  abstract     = {In the clustered dc microgrids (MGs), two dc MGs can be connected through multiple interlinking converters (ICs) in order to increase system power capacity as well as to achieve a better efficiency, reliability, and stability. This is more common for high-power dc MGs. The conventional droop control strategy is not a practical choice for providing proportional power sharing among two dc MGs with more than two ICs. This is mainly due to either differences in transmission line impedances or different output impedances of the ICs which can result in an unwanted circulating current among them. In this article, a two-level control scheme in a fully distributed manner is proposed for interconnecting two dc MGs by multiple ICs. The proposed scheme is based on the consensus protocol which only requires local measurement and neighbor information through a sparse communication structure. This control scheme proportionally shares power not only between two dc MGs but also among the multiple ICs and suppresses the circulating currents as well. A complete set of simulation studies is carried out in PLECS (Plexim) software to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the problem of the proper charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) has become increasingly difficult because there is high uncertainty on both the demand and supply sides of microgrid (MG) systems, which may reduce efficiency and increase the cost of MG systems. Available solutions to these challenges are the application of energy storage systems and energy exchange with the upstream utility grid (UUG). However, uncoordinated PHEV charging could have adverse effects on MGs, such as increasing the amounts of energy exchanged between the MGs and the UUG as well as decreasing the battery energy storage systems (BESSs) lifetime. This article proposes a smart charging scheme for PHEVs in ac MGs that can simultaneously minimize the energy drawn from the UUG to charge PHEVs and maximize the lifetime of BESSs based on a multiobjective optimization algorithm. For proving the validity of the proposed power management strategy (PMS), offline digital time-domain simulation studies are conducted based on the modified version of the IEEE 33-bus test system. The obtained results are compared with the results of other previously reported PMSs, which show that by increasing the output power of DER units (even when the penetration level of PHEVs increases), the proposed PMS can ensure proper charging of PHEVs while improving the lifetimes of BESSs and decreasing the energy drawn from the UUG.},

  abstract     = {Differential frequency hopping (DFH) technique is widely used in wireless communications by exploiting its capabilities of mitigating tracking interference and confidentiality. However, electronic attacks in wireless systems become more and more rigorous, which imposes a lot of challenges on the DFH sequences designed based on the linear congruence theory, fuzzy and chaotic theory, etc. In this article, we investigate the sequence design in DFH systems by exploiting the equivalence principle between the G-function algorithm and the encryption algorithm, in order to achieve high security. In more details, first, the novel G-function is proposed with the aid of the Government Standard algorithm and the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman algorithm. Then, two sequence design algorithms are proposed, namely, the G-function-assisted sequence generation algorithm, which takes the full advantages of the symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, and the high-order G-function-aided sequence generation algorithm, which is capable of enhancing the correlation of the elements in a DFH sequence. Moreover, the security and ergodicity performance of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Our studies and results show that the DFH sequences generated by the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the sequences generated by the reversible hash algorithm and affine transformation in terms of the uniformity, randomness, complexity, and the security.},

Four cases of fault occurrence are taken into account: single multiplicative actuator fault, single multiplicative sensor fault, simultaneous actuator and sensor faults, and single actuator fault with a dead-zone nonlinearity. We develop new adaptive laws for the estimation of fault parameters and embed the proposed laws into the infinite dimensional state observer design. Moreover, by considering the actuator fault with a dead-zone nonlinearity, an infinite dimensional observer associated with coupled parameter update laws is developed to help to complete the fault accommodation. This is achieved by reconfiguring the actuator input based on the estimated information of parameters in the actuator fault map with a dead-zone nonlinearity.},

  abstract     = {Ultrareliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is one of the important service categories of 5G, where high reliability and low latency are to be met simultaneously. Coordinated multipoint (CoMP), where a user equipment (UE) is connected to multiple base stations simultaneously, can provide high reliability for interference limited cell-edge UEs. Short-packet communication and 5G physical layer enablers combined with CoMP can be a potential solution to meet the quality of service requirements of the URLLC traffic. However, there exist some challenges in using CoMP for URLLC in a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture; mainly fronthaul capacity and remote radio head resource availability constraints. These resource constraints are addressed in this article; and a resource allocation scheme based on the effective bandwidth concept and 5G enablers is proposed, which can meet the reliability and delay requirements of the URLLC traffic. End-to-end error and latency components are identified and the interplay existing among the error components is utilized for bandwidth minimization. A novel packet delivery mechanism, queuing strategy, and time-frequency resource allocation for CoMP enabled URLLC in C-RAN architecture are proposed. The proposed scheme shows superior performance, in terms of the resource utilization and UE satisfaction, when compared with the existing techniques.},

This gap emphasizes the need to guarantee safety by capturing performance boundaries, as these algorithms are integrated. Additionally, multiple similar algorithms might need to be executed sequentially or concurrently to accomplish a mission or provide guidance for safety-critical operations. The selection among algorithm functionalities is a complex and critical activity that needs to be systematically designed and analyzed before actual implementation. Toward this end, we discuss our proposed process, which includes formally modeling abstractions of the algorithms in an architectural framework, then identifying the key performance parameters, followed by verification of the composition of these algorithms with formal contracts based on assumptions and guarantees. Finally, to reduce the gap between design and implementation, an automated translation from the architectural model to source code has been developed, which is a Java-based outline of the implementation. We demonstrate our compositional approach in assuring the behavior of an autonomous aerial system via a collision avoidance case study with advanced algorithms to handle critical emerging situations.},

Once the input signal of WADC is threatened by false data injection attacks (FDIAs), its performance will be decreased dramatically. To address this problem, this article proposes a resilient adaptive wide-area damping control (RAWADC) framework combined with linear state estimator (LSE) and goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP). The LSE is proposed and adopted as a preprocessor to detect and correct the attacked data. By detecting and correcting FDIA, the integrity of the WAMS measurement signal is guaranteed. The GrHDP algorithm is employed to design the WADC, which not only does not require a detailed mathematical model of the system but can also adapt to variations of the operating conditions. Simulation results of the 16-machine 68-bus system with voltage source converter based HVdc indicate that the RAWADC can suppress interarea oscillation effectively under a wide range of operating conditions, different FDIA types and measurement noise.},

All of the existing studies on the ASM-based PLS provide only approximate secrecy rate by treating random selection of two subsets of antennas for each symbol as independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables. To clarify its limitation, we first show that such widely adopted approximation incurs a significant error in the secrecy rate compared to the true value. In addition, we propose a new mathematical approach to derive the exact and closed-form expression for secrecy rate without any approximation. We also show the system optimization using our exact analysis in line with the simulation results, while the existing approximate analysis results in a considerable error.},

  abstract     = {Active shooting (AS) violence poses a serious threat to public safety. Most importantly, this number is increasing at an alarming rate over the last few years. Unfortunately, the knowledge base on attack detection and civilian response strategy under an AS incident are very limited. Such a lack of understanding hinders the development of effective training modules, response, and mitigation strategies (for both civilians and law enforcement officers) for an event that is highly unpredictable and unfolds quickly (typically in less than 5 min). To fill this gap in the literature, this article proposes an innovative mathematical model which captures several important features (e.g., capacity of the facility and individual choices, heterogeneity of individual behavioral and choice sets, restriction on choice sets depending on the location of the shooter and facility orientation, and many others) which are essential for appropriately characterizing and analyzing the response strategy for civilians under an AS exposed environment. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model by implementing the effectiveness of the RUN.HIDE.FIGHT. program in an academic environment. Results indicate that cognitive delay, the initial distribution of the civilians, and building configurations (e.g., location and number of entrances/exits) play a significant role in the safety of civilians under an AS incident.},

States and behavior are critical aspects to consider simultaneously with structure and function when assessing the complexity of modern systems as all of them have a profound impact on system design and future system performance. A more complete understanding of system complexity could improve the accuracy of scheduling and cost estimates during system development. This article proposes an objective, dynamic, and comprehensive complexity measure derived from molecular quantum mechanics and signal processing principles to quantify engineering system complexity. The proposed measure formalizes complexity as a single quantifiable system property that incorporates structure, functionality, and behavior, enabling unbiased comparisons of different conceptual designs, identification of complex elements, and analysis of complexity management. It provides systems architects and systems engineers with a strong basis for evaluating and communicating complexity during system design and architectural modeling.

  abstract     = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has become very popular in recent years. However, IIoT is still an attractive and vulnerable target for attackers to exploit and experiment with different types of attacks. To confront this problem, the research community began exploring novel systems to protect the network. However, there are concerns related to some of theses systems regarding the increasing levels of required human interaction, which impact their efficiency. Recently, machine learning techniques are gaining much interest in security applications as they exhibit fast processing capabilities with real-time predictions. One of the significant challenges in the implementation of these techniques is the available training data for each new potential attack category, which is most of the time, unfeasible. Hence, these techniques might suffer from low detection rates for the attacks with relatively small training data (minority classes). In this article, we propose a novel algorithm based on machine learning to alleviate the class imbalance problem by computing an optimized weight for each machine learning-based decision. In particular, a supervised machine learning algorithm is first used to classify the attack categories for each node. The decisions made by the machine learning classifier are then stored in a private database. A specially designed best effort iterative weighted attack classification algorithm exploits this collected data to enhance the accuracy of the rarely detectable attack types. For each class, the weight that maximizes the diagonal to maximum ratios of the confusion matrix is iteratively computed. Such approach is shown to enhance the overall classification performance and detection accuracy even for the rarely detectable classes. Both the UNSW and NSL-KDD datasets are used in this article to validate the proposed model and verify its efficiency in detecting intrusions. The simulation results show that the proposed model can effectively detect intrusion attacks with a higher detection rate and the lowest false alarm rate compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {Given the limited transmission power of smart devices in Internet of Remote Things (IoRT), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided space-air-ground (SAG) networks become a beneficial remedy for uplink data transmission in IoRT networks. In this article, we propose a SAG–IoRT framework, where drones act as relays to upload the data from smart devices to low earth orbit satellites. Considering the large number of smart devices, we maximize the system capacity by jointly optimizing smart devices connection scheduling, power control, and UAV trajectory, where the joint optimization is a nonconvex optimization problem. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonconvex optimization problem, which is challenging to solve directly. Hence, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the above-mentioned nonconvex optimization problem by applying variable substitution, successive convex optimization techniques, and the block coordinate decent algorithm. In particular, we alternately iterate smart device connection scheduling, power control, and UAV trajectory design to obtain the maximum system capacity. Numerical simulation results show that our proposed algorithm substantially improves the system capacity in comparison to the static UAV scheme, and achieves a gain of at least 22.3\% in terms of the capacity against dynamic UAV scheme with a circular trajectory.},

An efficient design of a controller for a complex system such as a building, which is also prone to uncertainties and disturbances, calls for advanced control methods such as model predictive control (MPC). This article presents a tube-based MPC to minimize the net cost of energy usage by the building’s HVAC system while satisfying the comfort level of the building’s occupants. Contrary to the conventional MPC, this controller is robust against model uncertainty and exogenous disturbances affecting the building thermal load model. Compared to other robust approaches such as the min–max controller, the proposed controller is of lower computational complexity and can be used with the environment having complex models, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics. Moreover, the proposed controller shows a satisfactory performance when optimizing an economic objective, such as cost minimization. The merits of using the proposed MPC controller are demonstrated using several simulation cases.},

  abstract     = {Both frequency and intensity of natural disasters have intensified in recent years. It is, therefore, essential to design effective strategies to minimize their catastrophic consequences. Optimizing recovery tasks, including distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) and repair sequence optimization (RSO), are the key to enhance the agility of disaster recovery. This article aims to develop a resilience-oriented DSR and RSO optimization model and a mechanism to quantify the recovery agility. In doing so, a new metric is developed to quantify the recovery agility and to identify the optimal resilience enhancement strategies. The metric is defined as “the number of recovered customers divided by the average outage time of the interrupted customers.” A Monte-Carlo-based methodology to quantify the recovery agility of different DSR plans is developed. It will be shown that if the total number of interrupted customers over the recovery horizon is minimized, the metric will be maximized. Accordingly, the DSR and RSO optimization models are modified to maximize the introduced metric. The proposed optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model that can be solved via commercial off-the-shelf solvers. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to several case studies to examine its effectiveness. It will be also shown how the proposed methodology can be utilized for distributed generator (DG) and tie-line placement problems in planning for enhanced structural resilience.},

  abstract     = {Fair resource allocation in a wireless multihop (MH) network is very important for ensuring high bandwidth reuse and high end-to-end throughput without a bottle-neck problem. However, it is very challenging because the available bandwidth for a node in wireless MH networks is limited by both the number of neighboring nodes and their geographic locations, which are always changeable due to users’ mobility. To address this problem, we propose a distributed resource allocation algorithm that enables collision-free and fair resource allocation among neighbors within two-hop distance. In the proposed algorithm, each node has a phase that linearly increases from 0 to 1 with a period of 1, and shares the phase information with its one- and two-hop neighbors. The shared phase information is used for distributed fair resource allocation for each node in a time division multiple access (TDMA) based network. We elaborate various characteristics of the proposed algorithm attributed to the MH properties. The necessary condition to ensure stability of the proposed algorithm is derived and analytically proved. Simulation results verify the stability of the proposed algorithm under various scenarios, and show faster convergence and higher bandwidth reuse compared to a comparison algorithm.},

Hybrid flow shops have widespread applications in real-world manufacturing systems such as steel production and chemical industry. In a practical production process, uncertainty commonly arises due to the difficulty of knowing exact information of facilities and jobs beforehand. In order to improve processing quality and customer satisfaction of manufacturing systems in uncertain environments, this article proposes a stochastic multiobjective hybrid flow shop scheduling problem aiming at maximizing processing quality and minimizing total tardiness, where the processing time of jobs obeys a known random distribution. To describe jobs&#39; processing quality mathematically, a quality-based cost function is presented, and further a chance-constrained programming approach is used to formulate this problem. Then, a multiobjective artificial bee colony algorithm incorporating a stochastic simulation approach is designed by considering its characteristics. Simulation experiments are performed on a set of instances and several state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization algorithms are chosen as peer approaches. Experiment results confirm that the proposed algorithm has an excellent performance in handling this problem.},

Whilst we understand low-dimensional networked systems&#39;s behavior well, our understanding of systems consisting of a large number of components is limited. Recent research in predicting the network level resilience pattern has advanced our understanding of the coupling relationship between global network topology and local nonlinear component dynamics. However, when there is uncertainty in the model parameters, our understanding of how this translates to uncertainty in resilience is unclear for a large-scale networked system. Here we develop a polynomial chaos expansion method to estimate the resilience for a wide range of uncertainty distributions. By applying this method to case studies, we not only reveal the general resilience distribution with respect to the topology and dynamics submodels but also identify critical aspects to inform better monitoring to reduce uncertainty.},

This problem is addressed using flexible payload architectures, enabling the allocation of the payload resources in a flexible manner to meet traffic demand of each beam, leading to dynamic resource management (DRM) approaches. However, DRM adds significant complexity to the VHTS systems, which is why in this article, we are analyzing the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to manage the resources available in flexible payload architectures for DRM. The VHTS system model is first outlined, for introducing the DRM problem statement and the CNN-based solution. A comparison between different payload architectures is performed in terms of DRM response, and the CNN algorithm performance is compared by three other algorithms, previously suggested in the literature to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach and to examine all the challenges involved.},

The proposed scheme has the polynomial time complexity and shows equal performance with the complex Exhaustive algorithm.

To prevent and avoid crime is of great importance for urban authorities and citizens. Crime prediction using various urban sensing data provides a promising paradigm to cope with this challenging problem. However, previous studies on crime prediction mainly focus on coarse-grained prediction at the region level, which fail in fine-grained road-level crime inference due to data sparsity problems. This article proposes a road-level framework for fine-grained crime risk inference leveraging heterogeneous open data. We first extract a set of features from relevant external datasets and historical crime records, i.e., temporal, spatial, and recurrence crime features. We then establish a spatio-temporal crime pattern using spatio-temporal features, and further infer road-level crime risk incorporating with recurrence crime features. The framework not only considers a useful spatio-temporal pattern but also considers a unique crime near-repeat phenomenon, which helps address the data sparsity. We further present an application crime risk-aware route recommendation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. This application cannot be solved well with coarse-grained (e.g., region-level) crime risk results since it is inconvenient for people to travel while avoiding large regions with potential crime risks. Experiments with the real-world datasets from New York City show that our framework accurately infers road-level crime risk and outperforms other baseline methods.},

For a single FMCW MIMO radar, we first propose the BMP-based imaging, in which the support vector (indicating the presence of targets in the radar image patches) and the associated coefficients (the reflection coefficients of the associated targets) are iteratively updated. Because MAP estimation needs the combinatorial search over all possible candidates to find the nonzero elements in the support vector, an approximated MAP estimation method is newly proposed. In addition, by extending the BMP-based imaging for a single FMCW MIMO radar, we develop a new distributed BMP-based imaging method when multiple FMCW MIMO radars are spatially distributed. Through the simulation, we confirm that the proposed BMP-based radar imaging methods outperform the conventional backprojection method or the orthogonal matching pursuit-based method with slightly increased computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Recent research works have engendered the existence of temporary misbehaving sensor nodes in both conventional wireless sensor and modern multilayered Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This article addresses the coexistence of misbehaving things (sensors) along with properly working ones, which altogether form a diverse network. We model the performance of a diverse network using stochastic modeling and introduce a multiparameter detection technique (MDT) to detect the existence of temporary misbehaving nodes in the network. MDT offers two separate algorithms for periodic and aperiodic response networks. We also propose a simple healing mechanism to alleviate the temporary disconnections of the misbehaving nodes from the network. With a simple recovery mechanism, MDT can provide 18\% extra throughput benefiting 20\% less energy consumption compared to a diverse network. The proposed scheme not only alleviates the effects of network diversity, but also outperforms the other solutions like self-detection and healing.},

  abstract     = {Drones should be allowed to respond to dynamic urban environments and self-adjust their paths, safely and efficiently. Existing studies fail to develop a comprehensive approach to deal with drone encountering various dynamic changes over the course of flying. In this article, an adaptive path replanning (APReP) method is proposed in discrete urban environments by considering the features of different types of dynamic changes, and the coordination among drones as well. First, various dynamic changes are concluded into three types. Three strategies are developed to conduct the path replanning for a single-drone operation under different combinations of dynamic changes. As the path replanning is extended to the operation involving multiple drones, the orders of planning are determined by task priority, path planning strategy, and competition mechanism. A discrete rapidly exploring random tree (DRRT) algorithm is presented to generate the path considering the characteristic of discrete urban environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the DRRT algorithm is suitable for the path replanning problems considered, and the three proposed path replanning strategies are valid to cope with the corresponding types of dynamic change. Compare to the other two algorithms, the APReP algorithm is more efficient in large-scale problems with a number of dynamic changes.},

With the rising demand for EVs and fast-charging stations (FCSs), the installation of renewable-based distributed generators (DGs) can further defer network upgrades and minimize energy losses. In this article, a new planning model is proposed to site and size FCSs and wind-based DGs, taking into account the stochastic nature of FCSs, residential EV loads, and renewable generation. The proposed planning model considers different cost and revenue components associated with FCSs and wind-based DGs. A typical distribution network is overlaid on a geographic map to illustrate how the network is connected with the municipal layout, thus taking into account practical constraints for installing FCSs and DGs in the vicinity of each bus. A novel scoring scheme that considers practical geographical aspects is developed to quantify the attractiveness of FCS candidate locations to the drivers of EVs. This scheme is essential to ensure installing FCSs at locations that maximize revenue to investors. Results demonstrate that planning for both FCSs and wind-based DGs is effective from a financial standpoint.},

  abstract     = {Contingencies such as faults, loss of generation or load may produce undesirable relay operations which can lead to cascade tripping causing system catastrophic failure. Thus, security of power system protection is a major concern for utilities. In this article, an approach based on system integrity protection scheme is proposed for enhancing the security of protection functions. Synchronous data measurements from strategic portions in the system are utilized for separating fault from stressed conditions. Determining the vulnerable relays (VR) which may maloperate during a stressed condition and incorporation of remedial strategy are proposed. It includes two algorithms; the first of which computes the relay margin to form a look-up table containing VR at different fault scenario and operating condition, in offline studies. Then, in accordance with the real-time system conditions, the relay characteristics are set for VRs based on the local information to avoid maloperation. The second is activated during critical heavy loading condition that may lead to voltage collapse and determines the load to be shed based upon sensitivity calculations of relay operation margin. The proposed method is tested for an IEEE-39 bus New England system as well as validated on real-time digital simulator (RTDS) platform for various operating scenarios and found to be robust. Thus, improvement in security of protection operation is achieved without compromising the dependability factor.},

  abstract     = {Data collection using mobile sink has received much attention in the past years. In the literature, most studies assumed that the mobile sink was controllable and the proposed algorithm made decisions to control the path, speed, and stop locations. However, there still exists some challenges in using the controllable mobile sink, including limited energy and the adaptive capability for overcoming the obstacles. This article considers the bus as the uncontrollable mobile sink to collect data from a given set of deployed static sensors. A distributed data collection mechanism, called energy balanced multihop data collection (EBMDC), is proposed that aims at maximizing the transmitted data volume from sensors to the bus while prolonging the network lifetime of the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To prolong the network lifetime, each sensor node distributes its data to its multiple parents in trees according to their remaining energies. Then, each anchor node locally schedules its transmission slots based on its and its neighbor&#39;s data volumes and remaining energies such that all data can be forwarded to the bus without collision and the lifetime of each anchor can be balanced. Experimental studies reveal that the proposed EBMDC algorithm outperforms related studies in terms of throughput, network lifetime, slot utilization, data loss ratio, and fairness.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, integrated electricity and natural gas system (IENGS) stands as one of the most discussed topics among industry and academic sectors. The interdependency issues of electricity and natural gas may limit the operational flexibility of the IENGS and consequently prevent wind power integration. This article aims to solve the problem by incorporating the demand-side flexibility of energy hubs (EHs) into the scheduling of the IENGS. To fully exploit the demand-side flexibility, the detailed integrated demand response (IDR) model is developed for the EHs. Unlike the traditional demand response programs in which only elastic electricity demand is considered, both electricity demand and natural gas demand are considered flexible and controllable in the IDR. Moreover, the IDR is modeled as an optimization problem rather than a price-responsive load bid. The interactions between the EHs&#39; IDR model and the IENGS&#39;s scheduling model are achieved based on the two-level optimization framework. Then, the IDR-embedded scheduling of the IENGS is formulated as a complicated two-level mixed integer nonlinear programming (TL-MINLP) problem. A technique is proposed to solve the TL-MINLP problem efficiently to enable the IDR-embedded scheduling model to be used in engineering practice. Case study illustrates the benefits of the proposed IDR-embedded scheduling method.},

In this article, round-robin protocol (RRP) and try-once-discard protocol (TODP) are studied for state estimation over network where information of different sensor nodes are fused. Using these protocols, at each time sample, only one sensor node can send its information over the network and consequently the required bandwidth is significantly reduced. Particle filters (PF) are able to estimate states of generally any nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems. Therefore, in this article, the development of particle filtering in networked systems under RRP and TODP protocols is studied. Toward this goal, two sequential importance sampling resampling algorithms under RRP and TODP are proposed where their corresponding marginal posterior pdfs are approximated by sequentially computations of weights. For the case of RRP, likelihoods of previous measurements are included in the weight computations while for TODP case, only the latest likelihood appears. Moreover, the approximated marginal posterior pdfs under RRP and TODP are compared with the normal posterior pdf using Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. This measure computes the difference between two probability distributions. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated for a networked interconnected four-tank system.},

Asymptotic approximations of the spectrum efficiency (SE) for large-scale MIMO systems are derived based on random matrix theory. With these closed-form expressions, we can provide insights into the tradeoffs between the SE and the ADC resolution and study the influence of the Rician K-factors on the performance. It is shown that a large value of K-factors may lead to a better performance and alleviate the influence of quantization noise on channel estimation. Moreover, we investigate the power-scaling laws for the system under imperfect channel state information and it shows that when the number of base station (BS) antennas is very large, without loss of the SE performance, the transmission power can be scaled by the number of BS antennas while the overall performance is limited by the resolution of ADCs. The asymptotic analysis is validated by numerical results. We also show that ADCs with intermediate resolutions lead to better energy efficiency than that with high-resolution or extremely low-resolution ADCs.},

  abstract     = {Flywheel energy storage system (FESS) can be used for frequency regulation in microgrids. In this article, an enhanced frequency control system is presented for FESS to reduce the frequency variations of microgrid. A three-layer control system is proposed for machine-side converter of the FESS including dc-link voltage controller, speed controller, and field-oriented control system. Unlike the conventional control methods, in the proposed method, the frequency controller is implemented in the grid-side converter to increase the ramp rate of the FESS and reduce the frequency deviation against load changes. Also, the proposed three-layer control system of the machine-side converter reduces the dc-link voltage variations. Furthermore, a mode coordination system is proposed to reduce the dc-link voltage variations when the operation mode of FESS changes from flywheel speed control mode to the microgrid frequency control mode. To demonstrate the advantageous of the proposed method in comparison to the conventional method, at first, the linearized model of the FESS in microgrid is extracted, and then the small-signal analysis is carried out for optimal design of proportional integral (PI) controllers. Two control strategies are theoretically presented and experimentally compared in a prototype microgrid including a diesel generator emulator and a load emulator. The frequency control system is studied in different loading conditions. Experimental results verify the theoretical concepts proposed in this article, and show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method.},

In this article, we propose a novel bilateral privacy-preserving and accurate task assignment framework in fog-assisted MCS, called BRAKE. Specifically, we utilize the multisecret sharing scheme to preserve location privacy in the MCS task assignment, where tasks and workers only need to provide the secret shares of their real location information to fog nodes. Moreover, we consider distance-oriented and time-oriented tasks for assignment optimization and propose an adaptive top-k worker selection algorithm to accurately select the most suitable workers. The security analysis proves that BRAKE can resist collusion attacks, and the extensive evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of BRAKE.},

  abstract     = {Parking lots (PLs) equipped with electric vehicle (EV) chargers will be the most convenient places for EV users to charge their cars. However, there is a high degree of unpredictability around how car parks are used, especially shopping center parking lots (SCPLs). Moreover, the cluster charging of EVs in PLs may destabilise the grid. The application of a battery energy storage system (BESS) in PLs is a potential way to reduce the impact of EV charging on the grid. This article proposes an approach for estimating the size of a stationary BESS for PLs in a constrained grid. At first, the intermittent charging demand of EVs is determined by considering the travel patterns, charging needs, and driver behavior of EVs. Then, a region reduction method combined with nonlinear optimization is proposed to estimate the optimal size of the BESS such that the capital cost and operational cost of the SCPL are minimized. The proposed sizing method 1) ensures the maximum utilization of the stationary BESS; 2) avoids over/undersizing; 3) reduces operational costs; and 4) maintains; the reliability of the system. The applicability of the proposed method is shown by simulating different cases, characterized by real household travel survey data and shopping center car park occupancy data.},

In this article, we study the implementation of low-cost analog sound sensors to detect outdoor activities and estimate the raining period in an urban residential area. The analog sound sensors are transmitted to the cloud every 5 min in histogram format, which consists of sound data sampled every 100 ms (10 Hz). We then use wavelet transformation and principal component analysis to generate a more robust and consistent feature set from the histogram. After that, we performed unsupervised clustering and attempt to understand the individual characteristics of each cluster to identify outdoor residential activities.

The output signal- to- interference- and noise ratio (SINR) with the proposed neural beamformer is 10dB higher than the conventional beamformers when the number of available snapshots of the received signal is as low as 100.

However, inadequacies in modulation bandwidth of light-emitting diode (LED) reduce the achievable data rate for image sensor-based VLC, also known as optical camera communication (OCC). Hence, for densely deployed OCC networks, multiple channel access is a major challenge faced when supporting large numbers of users. This article proposes an optical nonorthogonal multiple access based OCC (NOMA-OCC) system, where each LED can transmit two separate signals of two different power levels by superimposing them into one signal. An image sensor based receiver system is designed to separate these two signals supporting two users by implying an intensity threshold. The distinct channel capacities for both the users as well as the sum rate of the LED access point were analyzed. In order to validate the proposed NOMA-OCC scheme, the bit error rate performance of the system is also investigated through simulation for both channels and then compared with the conventional frequency shift on-off keying scheme.},

  abstract     = {The application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology in modern healthcare environment has given rise to a new paradigm known as healthcare IoT. The wireless body area network (WBAN) is one of the basic building blocks of IoT-based healthcare system, comprising many wearable (on-body) and implant (in-body) sensors placed in or around patient body connected to a hub for physiological signal monitoring. In in-body sensor-based WBAN, guaranteeing quality-of-service and prolonging network lifetime are major impediments due to the sensor location and limited battery capacity. In this article, we propose a novel energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol for IEEE 802.15.6 standard complaint in-body sensor-based WBAN. Typically, the in-body sensor-based WBAN communication is hub-initiated; however, in case of an emergency event, the in-body sensor node transmits an emergency frame arbitrarily without sensing the channel. This inadvertent in-body sensor-initiated transmission has a very high probability of collision with the ongoing hub-initiated transmission, and/or another in-body sensor-initiated emergency frame transmission. This results in emergency frame retransmission and consequently affects the node&#39;s energy consumption and lifetime. To alleviate this issue, we propose a modified superframe structure, in which separate access phases are introduced for the emergency event and regular event. In case of an emergency event, a novel emergency event handling scheme and a ranking and priority assignment protocol is proposed to detect and address the critical event of in-body sensors. To minimize the collision, a scheduled access mechanism is proposed according to the criticality of the node. Performance analysis of the proposed in-body sensor MAC is done in terms of latency and overall power consumption, in case of both emergency and regular events.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an augmented complex Kalman filter (ACKF) is proposed for distribution networks as a noniterative forecasting-aided state estimator. Although most of the distribution state estimator (DSE) algorithms deal with real and imaginary parts of distribution networks&#39; states independently, the proposed algorithm in this article considers the states as complex values. In the case of real-time DSE and the presence of a large number of customer loads in the system, employing DSEs in one single estimation layer is not computationally efficient. Consequently, our proposed method performs in several estimation layers hierarchically as a multilayer DSE based on an ACKF (DSE-MACKF). In the proposed method, a distribution network can be divided into one main area and several subareas. The aggregated loads in each subarea act like a big customer load in the main area. Customer load aggregation results in lower variability and higher spatial-temporal correlation. This increases the accuracy of the estimated states in the main estimation layer. Additionally, the proposed method is formulated to include unbalanced loads in low-voltage radial distribution networks. This approach is applied to two real distribution networks for comparison and evaluation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is discussed using several criteria such as computational time, standard deviation, and maximum and average voltage error. The performance of the proposed method has been assessed against the weighted least square estimation method, while the computational time and the average voltage error have been decreased from 14 to 2 s and 1.13\% to 0.23\%, respectively.},

We have derived two generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRTs) for passive MIMO radar detection, one for the case where the noise variance is known, and the other for the case where the noise variance is unknown. Our analysis shows that the derived two GLRTs have constant false alarm rate. Simulation results show that under the same condition the derived GLRTs outperform the GLRTs without using the preamble information. Moreover, the derived GLRTs are also compared with the GLRTs for active MIMO radar that totally knows transmit signals.

The key mechanism of our proposed JTARO strategy is to employ the optimization technique to jointly optimize the target-to-radar assignment, revisit time control, bandwidth, and dwell time allocation subject to several resource constraints, while achieving better tracking accuracies of multiple targets and low probability of intercept (LPI) performance of phased array radar network. The analytical expression for Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bound with the aforementioned adaptable parameters is calculated and subsequently adopted as the performance metric for multitarget tracking. After problem partition and reformulation, an efficient three-stage solution methodology is developed to resolve the underlying mixed-integer, nonlinear, and nonconvex optimization problem. To be specific, in Step 1, the revisit time for each target is determined. In Step 2, we implement the joint signal bandwidth and dwell time allocation for fixed target-to-radar assignments, which combine the cyclic minimization algorithm and interior point method. In Step 3, the optimal target-to-radar assignments are obtained, which results in the minimization of both the tracking accuracy for multiple targets and the total dwell time consumption of the network system. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the presented JTARO strategy, in terms of the achievable multitarget tracking accuracy and LPI performance of phased array radar network.},

  abstract     = {Searching and containing dynamic target like oil spillage in the ocean is a challenging task due to the natural time variance of the spread of the oil. The use of cooperative multi-marine vehicle systems in a cluttered environment for this purpose poses difficulties in sustaining formation pattern to pursue and contain the leakage. In this article, in order to provide realistic setup for the industrial applications of multi-marine vehicles systems, we present a novel approach for collision-free distributed formation control for a network of underactuated surface vessels (USVs). The proposed approach comprises two layers: A distributed coordination layer and a local fixed-time neural network control layer. In the first layer, formation leaders accomplish a specified formation configuration while tracking a desired trajectory from a tracking leader. The second control layer is to robustly drive the real USVs with parametric and nonparametric uncertainties to track their corresponding formation leaders. Because only parts of the formation leaders can acquire the states of the tracking leader, a distributed fixed-time estimator is proposed to obtain accurate estimations of the desired information for each USV in the network. Next, in order to effectively maneuver in cluttered environment, local path replanning-based repulsive potential function technique is proposed for each USV in the group formation to act on the formation leaders trajectories. Further, redesigned adaptive neural networks are integrated to compensate the model uncertainties. The stability of the proposed controller is verified by the Lyapunov direct method. Simulation studies of a hexagon formation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Radar system design for the detection of targets with unknown actual range in spectrally crowded environments is a challenge due to increasing demands for spectrum and the possibly experienced echo eclipsing. Assuming unknown target echo delay, this article deals with robust joint design of the radar code and receive filter bank guaranteeing spectral compatibility with the surrounding electromagnetic radiators. The average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the filter bank is considered as the performance measure to optimize under both similarity and spectral compatibility constraints on the radar code. Through an appropriate reformulation of the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we devise an alternate optimization algorithm, which sequentially improves the average SINR and converges to a point fulfilling the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the design problem. Each iteration of the algorithm involves both a convex and a hidden convex optimization problem, which can be solved via the rank-1 decomposition procedure. Finally, the performance is assessed by studying the tradeoff among the SINR, spectral shape, and autocorrelation. Numerical results reveal that the new method has better flexibility and robustness compared to several counterparts, which are presented in open literature.},

In this article, the SA algorithm is combined with the conventional perturb and observe (P&amp;O) technique in a hybrid MPPT method. This approach leverages the advantages of each technique. The technique is further enhanced by the integration of a novel sentry particle approach to identify when a change in the environmental conditions has occurred leading to a new global search being initiated.

Then, the WPP offers proper prices to the aggregators to attract them to supply their demand. Also, these aggregators can procure reserve for the WPP to compensate its uncertainties. Therefore, through a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading mechanism, the WPP requests the aggregators to allocate reserve to cover the uncertainties of the wind generation. Also, due to the presence of uncertain resources of the problem, a risk measurement tool is applied to the problem to control the uncertainties. The effectiveness of the model is assessed on realistic data from the Nordpool market and the results show that as the loads become responsive, more loads are allowed to choose their WPP to supply their load. Also, the reserve that is provided by these responsive loads to the WPP increases.},

However, it faces a set of new challenges, i.e., exacerbated noise problem caused by irrelevant or redundant information in different modalities, and the gap in joint understanding for multimodal sentiment. In this article, we propose hierarchical cross-modality interaction model for visual-textual sentiment analysis. Our model emphasises the consistency and correlation across modalities, by extracting the semantic and sentiment interactions between image and text in a hierarchical way, which could cope with the noise and joint understanding issues, respectively. Hierarchical attention mechanism is first adopted to capture the semantic interaction and purify the information in one modality with the help of the other. Then, multimodal convolutional neural network, which could fully exploit cross-modality sentiment interaction is incorporated, and better joint visual-textual representation is generated. A transfer learning method is further designed to alleviate the impact of noises in real social data. Through extensive experiments on two datasets, we show that our proposed framework greatly surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, the phrase-level text fragment plays an important role in interacting with image regions for joint visual-textual sentiment analysis.},

Number of power electronics actuators connected to the grid is increasing, and the legacy control methods employed on the grid are not responsive to this growing demand. Thus, the grid integration of EVs and their charging management requires a system-wide solution that is scalable, autonomous, and stable. In this article, we investigate two very complex networks: Internet and power grid in the context of controlling mass-scale EV charging problem. We adapt the well-known additive increase-multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm used in the Internet congestion control to EV charging in a distributed fashion. We develop an adaptation of the Internet&#39;s congestion control method for power grid considering the unique grid constraints using a decentralized concept. The advantage of the proposed method lies in its low-cost (memory-less) congestion detection mechanism based on only local voltage measurements. Results show that decentralized AIMD can successfully help flatten the peak loading caused by high EV penetration. To test the algorithm, a distribution grid model is designed based on IEEE 37-node test feeder with realistic load modeling. Finally, the results are presented in comparison with two other control architectures.},

To handle the tradeoff among multiple investors and the uncertainties in wind and solar power, this article develops a new two-layer game model, where a planned output game and a capacity allocation game are considered. The inner layer is a master-slave game to optimize the planned renewable energy output, which is used to predetermine the operation strategy of the microgrid under the initial capacity allocation. In the outer layer, based on the optimized planned output obtained from the inner layer, a noncooperative game and a cooperative sequential game dominated by wind-photovoltaic cooperative alliance are formed to determine the optimal capacity allocations. The equilibrium solution, achieved from the iterative optimization between inner and outer layers, determines the optimal capacity allocation of the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified using a case study of a wind/photovoltaic/battery/gas microgrid.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous miniaturization of sensors and processors and ubiquitous wireless connectivity, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also referred to as drones, are finding many new uses in enhancing our life and paving the way to the realization of Internet of Drones (IoD). In the IoD, a myriad of multisized and heterogeneous drones seamlessly interact with Zone Service Providers (ZSPs) to achieve the goal of assisting drones in accessing controlled airspace and providing navigation services. However, due to the high mobility of drones and the limited communication bandwidth between drones and ZSP, service scheduling becomes a critical issue when a set of drones wants to upload/download data to/from ZSP. In this article, we propose a priority-based service scheduling scheme, also named Psched, to provide efficient data upload/download service at ZSP in the IoD. The basic idea is that the Psched objectively and equitably assigns a weight to multiple service scheduling parameters based on multiattribute decision making theory, calculates the serving priority of each service request group, and then serves the service request groups based on the calculated serving priority accordingly. In addition, the Psched takes into account of bandwidth competition between upload and download service requests, and provides a service request balancing to achieve the maximum benefits of service scheduling scheme. In the experimental study, we choose request deadline, data size, and data popularity as service scheduling parameters, and conduct extensive simulation experiments using OMNeT++ for performance evaluation and comparison. The simulation results show that the proposed priority-based service scheduling scheme can not only increase service ratio but also can improve fresh data service ratio and average request serving latency, indicating a viable and efficient approach for satisfying service requests at ZSP in the IoD.},

IEE determines the transactions corresponding to the maximum social welfare based on participants&#39; submitted economic values. The economic values of entities are bids for buying and offers for selling the power. Two different pricing strategies for the approved transactions are presented. Distributed optimization for the self-scheduling based on an alternating direction method of multipliers has been implemented. Distributed optimization in a rolling fashion satisfies equality of complicated voltage magnitude, and voltage angles constraints at the connection buses. Furthermore, the participation of the distribution system in the day-ahead and real-time markets besides the transactive market is studied.

We obtain a joint optimal pricing strategy to maximize profit for the service provider (SP), as well as an optimal pricing strategy to maximize social welfare from the social administrator&#39;s viewpoint. We find that the socially optimal pricing strategy is to provide free service for all PUs, whereas the joint optimal pricing strategy for SP&#39;s maximum is equivalent to the pricing strategy that maximizes the two servers&#39; own expected net benefit.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a protection scheme based on the magnitude-phase plane of impedance difference (ID) using wide-area positive sequence components of current and voltage signals for the microgrid. The computation of the ID of the line is performed by extracting signals from the phasor measurement units complied with IEEE C37.118 standards. The composite magnitude-phase plane obtained from the magnitude of the ID and the angle of ID is considered as the key index for the detection of faults. The feasibility to include the proposed microgrid protection technique is examined by the extensive fault cases simulation with substantial variation in fault conditions, including types of fault and fault at different line length and for the grid-connected and islanding modes of microgrid operation. The fault study is carried out on a medium-voltage 15 bus test microgrid and a standard IEEE 34 bus microgrid testbed. The impact of several critical no-fault conditions is also investigated to analyze the possibility of false operation. The proposed ID-based scheme is extensively tested on MATLAB/Simulink platform and validated on the real-time digital simulator. The test results indicate that the magnitude-phase plane of the ID-based scheme can provide a dependable microgrid protection measure.},

  abstract     = {Despite being equipped with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), utility companies are subjected to electricity theft cyber-attacks. The existing machine learning-based detectors do not capture well the complex patterns and the temporal correlation present in the time-series profile of energy consumption data. This article proposes a deep recurrent vector embedding model to identify electricity theft cyber-attacks. Vector embedding is a data representation method that we use to express energy consumption profiles as vectors of real numbers. Since the reported electricity readings may be benign or malicious, vector embedding algorithms help in analyzing the relationships and capturing the patterns within the customer&#39;s reported readings. Furthermore, our model captures well the time-series nature of the data due to the adoption of gated recurrent units. We implement a sequential grid-search hyperparameter optimization algorithm to further improve the models detection performance. We test our model against two real datasets of benign and malicious readings. Results are 95.8\% in detection rate (DR), 2.1\% in false alarm (FA), and 93.7\% in highest difference (HD). Our model outperforms shallow detectors by 3.5\%-9.7\% in DR, 3.1\%-10\% in FA, and 8.7\%-21.8\% in HD. It also outperforms deep detectors by 1.5\%-3.2\% in DR, 2\%-4.3\% in FA, and 5.6\%-9.6\% in HD.},

The entire optimization portfolio is designed as a time average stochastic problem, which is simplified by the combination of queueing theory and Lyapunov optimization. The revised problem takes form of a mixed integer convex nonlinear programming, which is further solved using outer approximation approach. The proposed real-time home energy management framework needs only the current data regarding the random input parameters like renewable generation, energy price, and aggregated load demand, and does not call for their probabilistic estimation.

The proposed controller is based on a novel consensus protocol and a new control law that has a higher convergence rate than the traditional consensus protocol and its performance is quite satisfactory under large uncertainties. Different simulations are performed in MATLAB/SimPower Toolbox on a typical six-distributed generator MG and under various disturbances.

The proposed fault location scheme is primarily designed for fault location of CPLs in dc microgrids. First, a local protection relay for CPL is designed based on the transient behavior of the current and voltage in the main distribution line. Then, the estimation of the fault resistance is formulated based on the power sharing in the system to improve the accuracy of the protection system. To realize a robust protection scheme considering the variation of fault resistance, a fault resistance estimation procedure is employed to design a system that locates both low- and high-impedance faults. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated based on offline digital time-domain simulations in Digsilent PowerFactory software environment and experimentally verified by implementing on a laboratory scale hardware setup. The obtained simulation and experimental test results, and comparison with other methods prove that the proposed scheme is immune against these disturbances and can efficiently and reliably estimate the location and resistance of faults with high accuracy and acceptable error margin.},

In this particular configuration each substring has its own dc-dc converter and a dedicated maximum power search algorithm which increase the cost and complexity. In this article, an efficient centralized global maximum power tracking (GMPPT) algorithm for multistring PV array subject to partial shading conditions is proposed. The algorithm is based on artificial bee colony (ABC) as an optimization approach to provide the optimal duty cycles allowing the extraction of the optimal global maximum power from each substring. In particular, the proposed approach allows significant reduction of the required sensors to only one pair of current and voltage sensors, at the common point of connection of the overall PV strings. The simulation study has been carried out under Cadence/Pspice and MATLAB/Simulink platforms on the I-V curves to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when several shading patterns occur. In addition, complex shading pattern of a daily profile has been also carried out to demonstrate the GMPPT finding in dynamically variable conditions. Performance comparison against particle swarm optimization based maximum power point tracking algorithm and the traditional perturb and observe method has also been carried out. The obtained simulation and experimental results have shown the effectiveness and a good tracking capability of the proposed ABC algorithm in a multistring PV array configuration under uniform and nonuniform irradiance.},

According to the house of quality mapping from missions to capabilities and performances, SoS evaluation indicator elements are determined and the requirement analysis framework is primarily formed. Second, the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) is used to capture both symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships between the factors of each level in which priorities are calculated under subjective, vague, and uncertain preference information. And then, weighted by priorities of performance requirements that calculated by integrating FANP and QFD model, a projection gray target model is constructed for SoS capability evaluation under uncertain information and poor data.

  abstract     = {Higher power rating solar photovoltaic systems are emerging in the power system owing to the reduction in the cost of photovoltaic arrays and environmental concerns of the conventional power generation systems. Multilevel inverters are reported at high power levels due to reduced switching frequency and increased efficiency. Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverters have been reported in the literature due to its redundant structure compared to other multilevel topologies. When CHBs with dc sources are in the ratio of 1:3, it is named as a trinary hybrid multilevel inverter, and it generates a maximum number of equal output voltage levels. In this article, a trinary CHB multilevel inverter-based grid-connected solar power transfer system using modified second-order generalized integral control is proposed. A two-stage solar PV system consists of a single-input-multiple-output single-ended primary inductance converter and two CHB structures per phase used to verify the proposed system. A modified second-order generalized integral control is presented for active power control and grid synchronization. The controller is designed to eliminate dc-offset from the sensed load currents and to ensure balanced, sinusoidal, and unity power factor grid currents. Moreover, the shunt-connected system mitigates the reactive power and harmonic demands of the local load, thus maintaining the grid current power quality within the standard prescribed by IEEE-519. The performance of the proposed system is validated with an experimental prototype, and the test results validate the theoretical claims.},

Then, the global container shipping network and the product copurchasing network are discussed as examples, respectively. Main results point to that when the degree distribution of a scale-free network becomes more heterogeneous over time, the robustness will enhance and the vulnerability will aggravate gradually. On the contrary, when the degree distribution becomes less heterogeneous, the robustness will reduce and the vulnerability will mitigate.

It has been well known that theoretical progress under correlated fading cannot be given in closed-form, but single-integral. To the author&#39;s best knowledge, the single-integral proposed results are novel for MRC deployment under multivariate equ.c. Rician fading. Using underlying independent and identically distributed complex nonzero-mean Gaussian random variables, equ.c. Rician envelopes are constructed, leading to the proposed results. Outage probability and signal-to-noise-ratio gains are computed under selection-combining and MRC deployment for validation purposes. Detailed discussion are given. Monte Carlo simulation is shown to match theoretical predictions.},

  abstract     = {Integrated joint operations under the conditions of information make the battlefield environment increasingly complex and with great uncertainty. Link prediction for combat networks is of significant military values for improving the understanding of complicated battlefield situations, helping to identify key enemy targets, and optimizing combat plans. This article proposes a method called heterogeneous combat network link prediction based on representation learning (RLHCN) to predict multiple types of links in the combat networks. First, a heterogeneous combat network (HCN) model is built by abstracting diversified systems and information flows of the combat system of systems (CSoS) into multiple types of nodes and edges. Next, taking into the sparse feature of HCNs into consideration, we proposed a network representation learning-based link prediction method and a solution algorithm to predict links in HCNs. Then, a real-world combat network is taken as an example and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that RLHCN is superior to the baseline methods and can achieve good performance in predicting multiple types of links in HCN.},

Because the docking system is complicated with multiple disturbances and uncertainties, docking safety is difficult to analyze theoretically. Therefore, a data-driven docking safety assessment and optimization method is proposed in this article to improve the AAR docking safety and success rate. First, a comprehensive AAR docking system is established to generate abundant realistic simulation data for the data-driven framework. Then, a deep learning method is used to extract useful information from the docking data. A safety assessment network (SAN) is proposed to predict the final docking success rate according to the current docking state. A motion prediction network (MPN) is proposed to establish the mapping relationship between the expected probe position and the docking state. Furthermore, a novel probe trajectory optimization method is proposed based on the gradient of the MPN and SAN to improve the docking success rate and improve docking safety. Finally, based on the SAN, a novel safety-oriented docking strategy that can predict failed docking attempts and retreat in advance is proposed to further improve docking safety.

However, it cannot guarantee that in an optimal coordination of DOCRs at presence of distributed generations (DGs), the reliability indices will reach the minimum value. The reason is the existence of DGs voltage protection at their connection point to the network. This protection plays a key role in determining participation of DGs in improving network reliability during fault conditions. However, in the previous studies in which the overall operation time of relays is considered as the objective function, the voltage protection of DGs is not taken into account. In this article, coordination between DOCRs and their interactions with the DGs voltage protection is considered in calculation of the energy not supplied (ENS). Also, instead of the overall operation time of the DOCRs, the ENS value is considered as the optimization objective function. A probabilistic hourly seasonal model has been used to model the renewable DGs and the network loads. Various scenarios have been simulated to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method over a standard 33-bus radial distribution network.},

First, we derive the association probability for the ground user affiliated with a UAV and ground SBS. Then, we derive the successful content delivery probability by considering both the intercell and intracell interference. We also analyze the energy efficiency of the hybrid network and compare it with the separate UAV and ground networks. We further propose the caching scheme to improve the successful content delivery by managing the content popularity, where the part of the caching capacity in each UAV and ground SBS is reserved to store the most popular content (MPC), while the remaining stores less popular contents. Numerical results unveil that the proposed caching scheme has an improvement of 26.6\% in content delivery performance over the MPC caching, which overlooks the impact of content diversity during caching.},

A voltage protection scheme with the minimum number of sensors which is capable of detecting, classifying, and locating line-to-line (intrastring and cross string), line-to-ground, and open-circuit faults in a utility-scale PV array is proposed in this article. The proposed protection scheme consists of three steps. In the first stage, by a simple and efficient algorithm occurrence of any disturbance in the system is detected using some voltage sensors. At this stage, faulty strings in the PV array are also identified. In the second step, using a new least squares-based method, fault and shading conditions are discriminated from each other. Finally, in the third step, the faults inside the faulty string are located using a new method based on multiclass artificial neural networks. Fault location methods that have been developed so far require a large number of sensors or additional equipment for the exact location of faulty modules inside the fault string, but in the proposed method, only one sensor is used per string for fault localization. The proposed scheme for detection and location of faults is evaluated by simulating a typical system in different conditions.},

While this cradle-to-grave concept is well documented throughout literature, there has been recent emphasis on evolving and digitally transforming systems engineering methodologies, practices, and tools for the latter phases of system life cycles. This article adapts principles from the software engineering domain DevOps concept (a collaborative merger of system development and operations) into a Systems Engineering DevOps (SEDevOps) life cycle model. This facilitates a merger of systems engineering processes, tools, and products into a surrogate operational environment in which the sustainment of a system is tied closely to the curation of a system model expanded to include the enabling system elements necessary for operations and sustainment (procedures, scripts, etc.). This progression of the systems engineering mindset, focused on digitally transforming and enhancing system operations and sustainment, improves agility in later life cycle phases. A framework for applying SEDevOps is introduced as a new systems modeling language profile. A use-case leveraging this “model-based system operations” framework, shows how merging support elements into a spacecraft system model improves adaptability during operations, exemplifying elements of a DevOps approach to cyber-physical system sustainment.},

Moreover, we also propose a distributed multiarmed bandit-based routing algorithm (MABRA), where each node learns the best next hop(s) to forward its data based on the battery and data information of its neighbors. We study how the number of nodes that generate data or sources, solar panel area, and path exploration probability impacts the end-to-end delays computed by MILP and MABRA. Numerical results show that the end-to-end delays computed by MILP increase with the number of sources. It, however, decreases if nodes use larger solar panels. Critically, nodes experience end-to-end delays that are 55\% lower than the average end-to-end delay of a competing routing algorithm.},

To tackle these problems, we formulate the joint offloading decision, computing and communication resource allocation problem for satellite assisted V2V communication as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem with minimum weighted-sum end-to-end latency, and we decouple it into two subproblems. First, the Lagrange multiplier method is adopted to obtain the optimal computing and communication resource allocation with fixed offloading decision. Then, the results of the resource allocation subproblem are fed into the offloading decision problem, which is formulated as a Markov decision process. To maximize the long-term reward of offloading decision, a deep reinforcement learning based method is adopted to learn the optimal offloading decision.

This article provides objective-driven models for false setting injection (FSI) and false command injection (FCI) type attacks. The proposed classification method uses PCA to deduce truncated z-score sequences [or principal test sequences (PTSs)] capturing distinct spatio-temporal progression patterns of natural disturbances and cyber outages. The PTSs in the training sets are shuffled and sampled using a stratified random sampling technique and classified using an ensemble long short-term memory network.

An innovative definition of the flexibility of a PEV to change its active power is used to achieve efficient optimal active power dispatch to each PEV of a cluster. Real-time optimal dispatch of the reactive power to each PEV is also achieved. A hierarchical multiagent system is designed in order to deal with the increased complexity of the controlled system and collect the necessary information from the network. It is shown that the proposed method requires very small computation and communication times that do not depend on the number of PEVs. The convergence of the method is ensured with only one round of agent negotiations. The efficiency of the method is proved by detailed simulation results of a realistic distribution network and based on processed real data sets of the activity of the drivers.},

  abstract     = {The terahertz (THz) communication has been considered as a promising technique for future 6G wireless networks because of its tens of GHz bandwidth. However, the path direction for THz channel under different subcarrier frequencies is different (i.e., beam squint), which leads to the serious beam gain loss for conventional hybrid precoding design schemes. Thus, the effect of beam squint must be considered for the application of the wideband THz systems. In this paper, we consider the precoding design problem in a wideband THz massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with beam squint. We first design two new sparse radio frequency chain antenna structures, including fully connected and subarray. Based on the designed structure, we formulate an average rate maximization problem by jointly designing the hybrid analog/digital precoding at the transmitter and analog combine vector at the receiver. Since it is a challenge to optimize the precoding simultaneously, we propose an alternatively iterative algorithm to solve it under each antenna structure. Finally, the simulation results are conducted to show the effectiveness of the designed antenna structure and proposed precoding schemes.},

  abstract     = {Traffic violations like illegal parking, illegal turning, and speeding have become one of the greatest challenges in urban transportation systems, bringing potential risks of traffic congestions, vehicle accidents, and parking difficulties. To maximize the utility and effectiveness of the traffic enforcement strategies aiming at reducing traffic violations, it is essential for urban authorities to infer the traffic violation-prone locations in cities. Therefore, we propose a low-cost, comprehensive, and dynamic framework to infer traffic violation-prone locations in cities based on the large-scale vehicle trajectory data and road environment data. First, we normalize the trajectory data by map matching algorithms and extract key driving behaviors, i.e., turning behaviors, parking behaviors, and speeds of vehicles. Second, we restore spatiotemporal contexts of driving behaviors to get corresponding traffic restrictions such as no-parking, no-turning, and speed restrictions. After matching the traffic restrictions with driving behaviors, we get the traffic violation distribution. Finally, we extract the spatiotemporal patterns of traffic violations and build a visualization system to showcase the inferred traffic violation-prone locations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive studies on large-scale, real-world vehicle GPS trajectories collected from two Chinese cities, respectively. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework infers traffic violation-prone locations effectively and efficiently, providing comprehensive decision supports for traffic enforcement strategies.},

Mass production as well as single type of products is the representative characteristics of this production mode. However, by applying prompt equipment adjustments and resets, modern production lines are capable of making different products in small batches with varying processing requirements. This is referred to as flexible manufacturing mode. With the flexible manufacturing mode, which has been widely used in recent years, real-time performance evaluation and prediction, small-batch-based real-time scheduling, and management of such systems, etc., are having important research significance. In this article, by considering adjustments and resets on serial production lines with multitype and small-batch-based production, the transient performance evaluation problem is studied. Specifically, for the system with machines having the Bernoulli reliability model and buffers having finite capacities, the mathematical model is formulated first. Then, we develop a Markovian model and a computational procedure for evaluating various system real-time performance indicators, such as production rates and completion times of different batch-based production tasks, etc. In addition, an order-reduced dynamic decoupling approach is proposed to approximate system real-time performance with high accuracy and computational efficiency.

To this end and to most effectively allocate the maintenance time and resources, the most critical components in the grid, i.e., those needing maintenance the most with massive failure consequences, should be first identified. This article proposes a new multicriteria decision-making scheme to identify critical feeders in power distribution systems. Unlike the previous efforts which have focused on techniques based on the analytical hierarchical process, a best-worst method is employed in this article to prioritize the system reliability criteria based on the experts&#39; knowledge and judgments. The proposed approach can achieve a faster and more accurate outcome in prioritizing the system criteria for maintenance. In addition, fuzzy theory is utilized to address the prevailing uncertainties in the experts&#39; judgments and decisions.

The objectives of this article are, thus, to summarize current research on AEOSSP, identify main accomplishments and highlight potential future research directions. To this end, general definitions of AEOSSP with operational constraints are described initially, followed by its three typical variations including different definitions of observation profit, multiobjective function and autonomous model. A detailed literature review from 1997-2019 is then presented in line with four different solution methods, i.e., exact method, heuristic, metaheuristic, and machine learning.

The transmit power of secondary users is regulated to ensure that it does not violate the target end-to-end outage probability constraint of the N-hop primary network. Potential relays that have harvested sufficient energy are eligible to relay data for other SUs within the network. Using this model, we reveal the impacts of the number of primary hops on the relay selection region and harvested energy.

Existing deduplication approaches designed for primary workloads are locality based with the assumption that I/O requests follow the locality principle. However, primary workloads in cloud systems need not necessarily follow the locality principle, and hence, the existing methods for deduplication are likely to exhibit poor response time. To provide a solution to this challenging problem, we propose and implement a hybrid deduplication system (HDS), a block-based partial deduplication system with similarity-based indexing. The proposed system applies deduplication in the background to decrease the latency and also aims at decreasing the data fragmentation. It applies similarity-based indexing to reduce high number of metadata lookups arising out of random access patterns of the requests. HDS for primary workloads is simulated in the Linux environment using three different types of FIU traces, and the effectiveness of the system is compared with full deduplication based on the parameters-metadata access overhead, average segment length, and response time. The experimental results show that the system has performed consistently better in reducing the metadata overhead and increasing the average segment length for all three sets of I/O trace data.},

Based on this framework, the structural performance of satellite networks including both single-layered and multilayered satellite networks is evaluated systematically. The performance results reveal that it is difficult to design the efficient and feasible transmission protocols for multilayered satellite networks for their high-dynamic topologies with irregular changes, which brings unpractical requirements on the routing update. To cope with this problem, a synchronization mechanism of the interorbital links for multilayered satellite networks is presented, which can significantly reduce and regularize the topological dynamics of multilayered satellite networks. Its advantages can effectively facilitate the realization of transmission protocols for multilayered satellite networks.

However, cyber-attacks in the PMU measurements can lead to permanent communication failure of the WADC channels and, therefore, the dynamic performance of the power system can be damaged. Besides, the signals for this controller are from different locations and thus they present time delays that can also damage the power system dynamic performance. This article introduces a method based on linear matrix inequalities to design a WADC robust to power system operation uncertainties, time-delay uncertainties, and permanent communication failure of the WADC channels.

Therefore, in the last 60 years, a wide range of solutions and methodologies have been developed for optimally allocated shunt capacitors, generation sources, switches, transformers, and many other electrical devices in transmission, distribution, and microgrid systems. This large number of methods are paramount to place any electric device with the ability to influence any network parameter. However, this article concentrates on how these works have wrongly impacted the efficiency of the methods developed for the allocation of renewable distributed generation in public distribution networks. To track down this negative impact, a historical literature review of the optimal placement efforts of electric devices in power systems is proposed. Additionally, the existing research works are reviewed from the perspective of their considered device types, design variables, network type, and objective function. Three cumulated shortcomings are identified and discussed. The main aim of this article is to bridge the gap between the efforts developed in the literature and their implementation with renewable generation units and public distribution networks, and also to reorient future works to develop concrete methodologies able to bring benefits for all distribution market actors.},

  abstract     = {Securing messages and protecting them from tampering during transmission in wireless sensor networks is a challenging task. Using message authentication schemes provides security and authentication, but with a high computational and communication cost. Sensors are highly constrained in terms of computational capabilities and power consumption. Therefore, computation is divided into two phases: online (at the sensor) and offline (at a more powerful central node). Moreover, public keys are generated based on the identities to reduce communication overhead. In this article, we propose a message authentication scheme based on identity that uses online/offline signature. We prove that the scheme provides and protects the integrity of messages during the transmission of data over an insecure network. Our scheme is existential unforgeable against chosen message attack.},

  abstract     = {Microgrids are often considered as the solution for affordable and clean energy in the distribution sector. This article presents the small-signal stability analysis of a distributed generation unit in an autonomous microgrid operation. The purpose of the proposed strategy is to optimally improve the capacity of the power system to restore the reasonable operating condition following a small physical disturbance. The proposed strategy is the joined execution of both the modified antlion optimization algorithm (MALO) and artificial neural network (ANN), and hence it is abbreviated to MALANN. In this article, the proposed controller comprises two control loops, namely the inner current control loop and the outer power control loop. The MALO technique is incorporated to generate the dataset of possible proportional integral (PI) gain parameters. By using the accomplished dataset of MALO, the ANN is trained, and convincing estimate execution is brought out through the entire machine working condition. The proposed strategy is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are examined with two test cases and compared with various solution techniques such as base method and ant-lion optimization. The results prove that the stability analysis is reasonably accurate, and the controller offers a reliable system&#39;s operation.},

Specifically, based on the even-subcarrier received signal, we design a pilot-assisted scheme combined with a partial inverse fast Fourier transform operation to obtain an estimate of the channel impulse response. Then, to alleviate the power efficiency loss caused by discarding the odd subcarriers, a performance-enhanced CE using the Neumann series expansion technique is proposed. This provides a performance comparable to that of the maximum likelihood-based approach involving a prohibitively burdensome computation. A closed-form mean square error expression and computational complexity analysis are derived to quantify the achievable advantages. Simulation study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed CE.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the leader-following exponential consensus control problem for generalized one-sided Lipschitz (OSL) multiagents (MAs) using relative-state information under a directed spanning tree. Previous works have accomplished the consensus protocol design for the globally OSL nonlinear MA systems. Unlike the existing results, the proposed strategy employs a less conservative approach in the form of matrix inequalities and convex routines by assuming that the nonlinear MAs satisfy the OSL condition in a local region by relaxing the so-called quadratic inner-boundedness constraint. A novel algorithm is provided to incorporate the value of generalized OSL constant and to consider the regional consensus protocol computation via Monte Carlo simulations, based on uniform random numbers. The proposed approach is fully automatic, easily solvable, and presented for the consensus control of generalized (locally) OSL nonlinear systems for the first time. The proposed approach also studies the criteria for the exponential consensus convergence rate for attaining a faster convergence of the consensus error. Furthermore, the developed consensus protocol for the generalized OSL systems is then extended for the case of switching topologies. The proposed consensus protocol of locally OSL nonlinear MA systems can also be employed to the global OSL nonlinear MA systems as a special case for attaining the local performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the leader-following consensus of eight moving agents and a practical application of F-18 aircraft.},

Fuzzy logic controllers are at two levels; one at the distribution level and the other at the charging station level. Two types of communication channels are considered between the entities of the V2G network with charging stations at multiple nodes of the electricity grid. The basic access method of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol using the distributed coordination function is used by electric vehicles to transmit their data packets to a charging station aggregator. An in-depth analysis of the system is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink environment by varying the bit error rate, timeout required to send a packet in the WiFi channel for multiple retransmissions, and the number of electric vehicles on the distribution grid node voltage. Root-mean-square error of node voltage is calculated for different values of the mentioned parameters to propose a real-time V2G infrastructure with an integrated communication system.},

  abstract     = {When modeling decision-making in autonomous vehicles (AVs), only a fraction of the required information is usually available at the start due to the presence of uncertainty in the knowledge of the state of the system and the environment. This article presents a probabilistic modeling framework based on a combination of partially observable Markov decision-process (POMDP) models and heuristics. In this article, POMDPs are expanded and redefined as expandable-POMDPs to account for uncertainty and unexplainable observations. Specifically, this approach incorporates new hidden states in the model and expands associated probability distributions in the model to account for partial knowledge and unexplainable observations. An online policy estimation algorithm is presented. This algorithm employs heuristic search combined with distance-based clustering to estimate long-term rewards in a finite-horizon look-ahead scheme for expandable-POMDPs. Specifically, heuristics are employed in model design and online policy evaluation to circumvent state-space explosion and reduce high computational complexity. Finally, the expandable-POMDP models are employed for designing multiple context-specific models for tactical planning and decision-making by AVs in simulated scenarios characterized by partial observability and uncertainty. One (or more) expandable-POMDP model is invoked when the contextual pattern of the ongoing scenario fits the objective of the tactical planning model.},

This aricle proposes a comprehensive framework to establish various procedures for evaluating: (i) transparency and incentive compatibility of different contingency modeling approaches, and (ii) efficiency of two possible stochastic market designs. First, the concept of securitized locational marginal price is presented to solve the issue of how market participants should be compensated for providing N-1 reliability services. Then, pricing implications and settlements of three market models are compared: a deterministic market model with proxy serve policies; state-of-the-art market models with estimated postcontingency states; and (iii) a two-stage stochastic market model. Second, this article evaluates two stochastic market models while accounting for potential adjustments from day-ahead scheduling to real-time operation: (i) minimizing expected operating cost of all N-1 scenarios, and (ii) minimizing the base-case (or no contingency) cost. These analyses are conducted on IEEE 118-bus test system.},

This article establishes a theoretical basis for requirements based on primary source research that describes their use to solve problems and maintain accountability. That theoretical basis is applied to construct a historical basis for requirement statements that shows there has been very little change to the use or formatting in almost 200 years. This lack of innovation is confirmed in an analysis of a series of definitions from a leading systems engineering guideline.

  abstract     = {Most Internet of Things applications rely on wireless communication, which ensures flexibility and scalability. However, an increasing number of these applications have real-time constraints and require mixed-criticality. Indeed, the complexity of distributed systems necessarily calls for data exchanges with different priorities and different failure handling. The design of a reliable protocol supporting different traffic priorities must take into account external interferences that can inevitably affect radio links. This article focuses on LoRaWAN, the currently most famous example of low power wide area network technology. In particular, redundant transmissions offered by the proposed LoRa-REP strategy enhance the communication resilience of sporadic critical message transaction (consisting of message uplink and acknowledgment downlink). The implementation by means of “virtual nodes” assures compatibility with legacy deployments (preserving investments) and offers easy scalability. Experimental results obtained with purposely designed test bench confirm the advantages of the proposed solution in a real-world scenario. Notably, the failure probability of a critical transaction drops from 78\% of single spreading factor scenario to less than 2.5\% with the proposed LoRa-REP.},

We first derive the approximated expressions for the symbol error probability (SEP) of RIM-OFDM-CI. The obtained SEP provides an insight into the impact of system parameters on the error performance, which allows for selection of an optimum constellation rotation angle to minimize SEP. Two enhanced detectors, namely, the log likelihood ratio (LLR) and greedy detector for RIM-OFDM-CI are proposed. The proposed detectors not only achieve nearly same performance as the maximum likelihood detector but also significantly reduce detection complexity of the RIM-OFDM-CI system.

The ever increasing number of handheld mobile gadgets has exacerbated the need for robust and efficient authenticated key agreements. We could witness a number of MCC-based multiserver authentication schemes lately to foster the secure adaptation of the technology; however, the demonstrated solutions are either insecure or employing too costly bilinear pairing operations for implementation. In view of limitations, as illustrated in previous studies, we propose a novel pairing-free multiserver authentication protocol for MCC environment based on an elliptic curve cryptosystem that is not only efficient, but also free from security loopholes as demonstrated.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a hybrid adaptive channel access (HyACA) mechanism for improving the channel access performance of an LTE-U and WiFi coexistence system. To support the HyACA mechanism, a modified time-frequency channel structure as well as a modified LBT functionality is first introduced for channel access in the coexistence system. To ensure channel access fairness, a dynamic channel switch (DCS) functionality and an adaptive almost-blank-subframe (AABS) functionality are further proposed to control the channel access under different traffic loads. Under low traffic load, HyACA uses the DCS functionality. Under high traffic load, HyACA uses the AABS functionality. To judge the traffic load status of the coexistence system, a criterion based on the average channel occupation time is introduced, and a calculation model is derived to determine the average channel occupation time. Moreover, another calculation model is derived to calculate the number of ABSs to be reserved in each LTE-U frame of a frame block. Through simulation results, it is demonstrated that the proposed HyACA mechanism can achieve better fairness and throughput performance than the static ABS mechanism, and better throughput performance than the LAA Cat.3 LBT mechanism while ensuring access fairness.},

On the one hand, multiple-description coding (MDC) is a coding technique with high efficiency and strong antiinterference capabilities that can combat burst interference and solve the problem of unreliable transmission due to link impairments and network congestion. In this article, by combining the principles of MDC and NOMA, we propose a hybrid MDC-NOMA scheme to further improve system throughput and transmission robustness. In the proposed scheme, a base station communicates with two users simultaneously over two orthogonal subchannels. In this setup, one subchannel is sufficient to reconstruct an image of acceptable quality. We derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and ergodic rate and analyze its peak signal to noise ratio, bit error rate, and visual transmission performance. Furthermore, numerical and simulation results are presented in order to validate the analysis.},

The resulting problem is that the accuracy of the existing DOA estimators will significantly degrade with the availability of only a small subset of data entries as the low date rate is employed to reduce the system power consumption. To address that, an efficient approach based on the variant of matrix factorization is devised to complete the underlying data matrix. As a result, the nominal azimuth and elevation DOAs with the corresponding angular spreads are estimated from the underlying data matrix. Numerical results demonstrate that even in the case of missing entries, the proposed method is superior to the existing approaches with full data.},

An IoT-enabled e-health system allows different entities to examine a patient&#39;s health condition anywhere and anytime. However, the deployment of e-health systems in an IoT environment faces various security and privacy challenges. The authentication of participating entities, the confidentiality of information transferred through an insecure channel, and access control are essential issues to be resolved. To settle these challenges, we found many authentication protocols for e-health systems based on the discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems. However, quantum attacks expose all these protocols. In this article, we propose a lattice-based authentication and access control (LAAC) protocol for IoT-enabled e-health systems to mitigate the quantum attacks. We prove that LAAC is robust with the hardness assumption of the inhomogeneous small integer solution problem. Moreover, we provide provable security analysis of LAAC. Besides, performance evaluation shows it is reasonable to execute LAAC in an IoT device.},

MIWO handles the initial stages of MPPT followed by the application of the P&amp;O algorithm at the final stages in view of acquiring the rapid global peak and maximal PV power. The studied microgrid comprises of the PV system, battery, electrolyzer, fuel cell, and load. A coordinated dc-voltage regulation and power management strategy between each subsystem of the hybrid microgrid is implemented to save the battery from the undesirable charging/discharging operation. Additionally, with the monitoring of dc voltage, the dc/dc converter associated with the battery and dc link plays as an MPPT circuit of the PV without the requirement of an extra dedicated circuit. Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy controller is adopted for suppressing/mitigating the voltage oscillations of the microgrid during the variations in the solar irradiance/temperature and power demand.

Based on imperfect channel state information (CSI) available, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the multicell multiuser massive SM-MIMO system with pilot contamination is analyzed. According to the performance analysis, the error probabilities of the transmitted symbol and transmit antenna index are first derived. Then, with these results, an approximate expression of the overall average BER of the system is attained. Based on this, the asymptotic BER performance at large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is analyzed, and the BER will approach an error floor with the increase of the SNR due to the effects of intercell interference and pilot contamination. Besides, the asymptotic performance of the system for very large antenna arrays is also presented, and the corresponding asymptotical BER expression is deduced. Under this analytical framework, the BER performance of the multicell multiuser massive SM-MIMO systems with perfect CSI can be derived as a special case. Simulation results illustrate that the theoretical analysis is valid, and can match the corresponding simulation well. Thus, the error performance of the system is effectively assessed.},

Smart grid is a pertinent common application under a single umbrella of the IoT and it can accomplish the communication via the Internet Protocol to sustain the information exchange between the service provider and the smart meter in the system. However, IP-based communication systems make this task susceptible to several serious security attacks. To prevent these attacks, many security protocols between the service provider and smart meter have been proposed in the literature. Existing security mechanisms allow the smart meters to establish a connection with the service provider, but it is essential to design a security system by which the service provider can communicate with multiple smart meters and establish a connection with them. To establish such connection, all the smart meters need be authenticated with the service provider and agree on an individual session key. In this article, we propose a novel mutually authenticated key establishment protocol between the service provider and the smart meter by which the service provider can initiate the communication. The proposed protocol is proven to be correct using the formal method Gong, Needham, and Yahalom logic. The protocol is also simulated in the automated tool ProVerif and the results are detailed. The proposed protocol and the existing pertinent protocols are compared in several aspects. Comparison results show that our protocol outperforms the others.},

  abstract     = {The network switches and routers need to forward the network packets at a line-rate. The underlying hardware and software implementations may limit the performance of these packet processing devices. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called Lookaside, to increase the performance of the network switches by extracting the payload from the packet and storing it in a nearby standard memory, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM), before the packet is sent for processing. We know that the packet payload has no role in packet processing. We implemented the prototypes of our Lookaside switch model on the state-of-the-art ONetSwitch45 hardware field-programmable gate array board. The simulation results show an increase in the performance of the switch in terms of latency, throughput, switching chip resources, and on-chip resources power consumption as compared to SimpleSwitch.},

  abstract     = {The design of a safety-critical system requires an effective prediction of its reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS). Anticipating the RAMS analysis at the concept design helps the designer in the tradeoff of the system architecture and technologies, reduces the cost of product development and the time to market. This action is rather difficult, because the RAMS analysis deals with the hazard assessment of system components, whose abstraction at concept level is never simple. Therefore, to integrate the system design and RAMS assessment, a clear path to follow is required. This article investigates how the model-based systems engineering supports this task and drives the system reliability allocation, through the functional and dysfunctional analyses. The implementation of the proposed approach needs to set up the tool chain. In the industrial context, it must be compatible with practices, standards, and tools currently used in product development. Defining a suitable process of integration of tools used for the system design and the safety engineering is a need of the industry. Therefore, this task is also discussed, in this article, dealing with some examples of industrial test cases.},

In this article, we present InBlock, a distributed autonomous organization that provides decentralized management of IP addresses based on blockchain, embedding an alternative trust model to the hierarchical one currently implemented by the RPKI. By leveraging on blockchain technology, InBlock requires consensus among the involved parties to change existent prefix allocation information. InBlock also fulfills the same objectives as the current IP address allocation system, i.e., uniqueness, fairness, conservation, aggregation, registration, and minimized overhead. InBlock is implemented as a set of blockchain smart contracts in Ethereum, performing all the functions needed for the management of a global pool of addresses without human intervention. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses to the InBlock registry by solely performing a (crypto) currency transfer to the InBlock. We describe our InBlock implementation and we perform several experiments to show that it enables fast address registering and incurs in very low management costs.},

The basic principle of adaptive mho characteristic-based distance protection is described and the uniform expression of adaptive setting impedance is derived. Subsequently, taking the fault characteristics of PV power plant into consideration, the method of solving the phase angle of fault current is presented, which is the key to calculating adaptive setting impedance. The performances of the proposed protection scheme are evaluated by extensive digital simulations. The proposed protection scheme exhibits satisfactory robustness against the fault resistance and excellent adaptability to different grid codes.

  abstract     = {The expected explosion of video traffic in 5G ultradense networks will pose many challenges to the Internet service providers, e.g., degraded capacity and unfair quality of service (QoS). The most efficient solution is resource allocation that does not require any network architecture changes. This article proposes a social-aware spectrum sharing and caching helper selection (SSC) strategy that exploits the resources of the mobile users (MUs), i.e., downlink spectrum resources for sharing and caching storage resources for multicasting, to offload the videos in dense device-to-device (D2D) 5G networks. Particularly, we consider physical and social attributes of the MUs to formulate an SSC optimization problem. The SSC problem is solved to optimally control: which MUs, namely sharing mobile users (SUs), that share the downlink spectrum resources and which MUs, namely caching mobile helpers, that cache the requested videos for D2D multicast communications by reusing the shared downlink spectrum resources. The objective is to maximize the system capacity while satisfying the constraints on capacity fluctuation among the receiving mobile users (RUs) and target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the SUs, to guarantee the RUs and the SUs high QoS fairness. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the benefits of the SSC strategy.},

To attenuate the noise level in measurement signals that are used in the controller, an improved tracking differentiator is utilized. The proposed controller is implemented locally at individual synchronous generator stations which makes it suitable for practical applications.

However, environmental interference can significantly degrade the visual quality of an image into edge cameras, thereby affecting the overall image and service quality. In order to maintain image stability, image enhancement using complex deep networks has been widely utilized. As edge cameras often have restricted computing power and cannot run complex neural networks efficiently, we design a lightweight residual enhancement network, which incorporates highly efficient convolution operations as basic building blocks. With this modular design on a generative adversarial network training framework, the resultant network can be easily optimized according to hardware specifications of a given edge camera. To accommodate various weather conditions for an edge camera, we further design an environment-aware model deployer that can detect the weather conditions and deploy the most suitable image-enhancement model. The experimental results show that the lightweight residual enhancement network can produce image quality close to what past research demonstrated while increasing running speeds by more than 30\%. In a streaming video to simulate changing weather, the results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed environment-aware model deployer to maintain the quality of the images under a dynamic environment.},

Specifically, these two suspicious nodes broadcast their suspicious data in phase 1 and the relay forwards the amplified version of its received signal in phase 2, according to which two proactive eavesdropping strategies, i.e., “passive eavesdropping first” and “jamming first,” are designed. Using the former strategy, the monitor proceeds eavesdropping with a minimum-mean-squar-error (MMSE) receiver in phase 1 and implements eavesdropping or simultaneous assisting and jamming in phase 2. Using the latter strategy, the monitor implements jamming in phase 1 and performs eavesdropping in phase 2. For these strategies, we provide the detailed analysis and formulate the corresponding optimization problems of sum eavesdropping rate maximization subject to finite transmit power of the monitor, each of which is then solved by carefully designing the power allocation scheme or the assisting/jamming beamformer at the legitimate monitor. In addition, for the “passive eavesdropping first” strategy, we also consider a more advanced MMSE with a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver and concurrently exploit the time-sharing (TS) technique to further improve the eavesdropping rate. Finally, simulation results indicate that the “passive eavesdropping first” strategy is more preferable compared to the “jamming first” strategy, and the SIC and TS are preferable for promoting the more effective eavesdropping.},

  abstract     = {A secure execution of offloaded tasks in the 5G-driven mobile edge computing (MEC) deployment is critical for all societal sectors. To realize it, mobile network operators have to intelligently orchestrate virtual resources in multiple cloud layers to satisfy 5G security requirements. In this article, we formulate a secure virtual machine management (VMM) mechanism using the semi-Markov decision process framework that seeks to jointly minimize the service rejection and the security risk, while meeting the location awareness requirements of latency-sensitive applications in a decentralized fashion. A new metric called mean security risk is proposed to quantify the perceived risk of an offloaded application considering the number of virtual machines (VMs) that is used to execute and to protect it. We also propose a new cost structure that allows for an efficient assessment of the long-term impact of providing additional VMs to foster security services. A comparison with an optimal security-unaware VMM mechanism shows that our model provides a less risky operation at the cost of an increase in service rejection, which is caused by the use of additional VMs to shield the computation task. Finally, we show that the cost of providing security services can be significantly reduced by fine-tuning the economic gains of it.},

  abstract     = {The eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix can capture signal correlations and noise characteristics well, which are widely used for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. Some totally blind spectrum sensing algorithms were proposed, such as maximum eigenvalue-to-arithmetic mean (ME-AM), maximum eigenvalue-to-geometric mean (ME-GM), and arithmetic-to-geometric mean of eigenvalues (AGM) methods. This article makes full use of the advantages of these algorithms and proposes a universal spectrum sensing algorithm based on maximum eigenvalue, arithmetic mean, and geometric mean of eigenvalues. The proposed algorithm takes the weighted geometric mean of the test statistics of the ME-AM and AGM algorithms as new test statistic and includes the ME-AM, ME-GM, and AGM algorithms as special cases. Following the random matrix theory framework, in a similar vein to the ME-AM and ME-GM algorithms, we derive the analytical expressions of false alarm probability, threshold, and detection probability of the proposed method using the Tracy-Widom distribution of maximum eigenvalue. In addition, we discuss the problem of designing the optimal weighting factor through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. Finally, simulation results verify that the universal algorithm can effectively improve the detection performance.},

By taking advantage of good autocorrelation property between cyclic-shifted versions of m-sequence, the search space of SSS hypothesis testing is reduced by decoupling the detection of two m-sequences. The combination of such a sequential strategy with maximum likelihood detection criterion facilitates low-complexity and reliable SSS detection in the 5G NR system. Both numerical and simulation results are presented to justify the effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme. It is demonstrated from presented results that the proposed SSS detector achieves a considerable complexity reduction while incurring slight performance loss, compared to existing SSS detectors.},

  abstract     = {Simulation and stability analysis of power systems are challenging topics due to nonlinear models. Fortunately, most power components are weakly nonlinear and by taking the advantages of this characteristic and also using the first-order term of the Taylor expansion, a general linear time-variant model for such systems is derived. Specifically, this article analyzes islanded inverter-based microgrids (IBMGs) using the proposed linear model driven directly from a general nonlinear model of IBMGs, and it is just as comprehensive as the reference one. Two methods to linearize the weakly and severely nonlinear state-space models are presented. A new time-step simulation is developed to modify the model dynamically and to calculate time-domain response as well as eigenvalues directly, which are much faster and more efficient than numerical methods and small-signal stability analyses. The capabilities of the proposed models make it possible to easily develop a time-saving eigenvalue calculator as well as a fast- and low computational direct power flow analysis. Different time-domain simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and other tests are investigated to verify the performance of the proposed simulations and their applications.},

A secure multiple access method is proposed for single-antenna users by employing space-time line codes (STLCs), which enables noncoherent detection at the legitimate AP without channel state information (CSI) and achieves full spatial diversity. While extending the secure STLC scheme from the single-antenna to two-antenna users by combining the STLC with artificial noise (AN) injection, we design a low-complexity AN signals with the optimal power control scheme. The proposed AN is ensured to be eliminated after STLC decoding at the legitimate AP, while sustained in eavesdropper&#39;s received signals as interference. Theoretical sum secrecy rates are derived by considering time-varying fading channels with the uncertainty of CSI at the users, and the numerical results verify that the proposed STLC schemes outperform the existing secure transmission schemes in terms of the sum secrecy rate.},

Additionally, it presents a unique framework to ensure system stability when communication links are subjected to such attacks.

We envisage that future research direction will be gradually shifted toward the use of artificial intelligence (AI), such as intelligent neuro-fuzzy systems, to achieve adaptive IGC systems that can perform intelligent self-learning and online optimization with minimum human intervention. Finally, this review also delivers an open message to encourage collaborations among experts from multiple disciplines, such as control systems, robotics, and machine learning.

Vehicle to grid (V2G) is an emerging technique used to integrate EVs with electric grid for meeting this demand and mitigating the impact of EV recharging on the grid. V2G use an extensive communication network to exchange data between various entities, including the grid, charging station (CSs), and the EVs. There are possibilities of errors in the data communicated between entities of the V2G system. These errors, if not addressed properly, would create unwanted disturbances in the electric grid. The V2G controller plays a significant role in the integration of EVs to the grid. It does so by deciding the right amount of power to be exchanged between them based on the inputs communicated by the grid and the CSs. Hence, this article proposes a two-layer framework intelligent controller comprising of a data integrity and correction check block in the first layer and a rule-based fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in the second layer. The proposed controller&#39;s effectiveness is validated using a simulation model, which comprises of an electricity distribution network and a communication network. Results demonstrate the intelligent controller&#39;s potential in reducing the impact of errors by deciding the right amount of power to be exchanged between the grid and EVs. A comparison between the conventional FLC and the proposed intelligent controller further corroborates the potential.},

  abstract     = {The emerging trends in the microgrid development and the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the distribution networks urge the modification in the existing conventional protection techniques. The integration of DERs changes the radial nature of the network, and thus, the schemes designed for such networks fail to operate for the microgrid system. Hence, a new fault detection technique is required for the microgrid system. In this article, a new fault detection scheme is developed for detecting the low-impedance faults (LIFs) as well as high-impedance faults (HIFs). The detection of HIFs is of major concern as these faults lead to a very low fault current value, which makes them undetectable by the conventional overcurrent relays. The proposed scheme uses the cumulative sum value of the differential negative-sequence impedance angle (DNSIA) as the fault detection parameter for generating the trip signal. The simulation results show that the proposed method effectively detects LIFs and HIFs accurately. The proposed scheme is independent of the type of faults, type of DGs, and the value of fault impedances. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also discriminates between the switching transients and faults effectively. The IEEE 13-bus test system is modeled and simulated on real time digital simulator (RTDS)/RSCAD platform. The method is further validated for the real-time implementation by developing the experimental setup for performing the control hardware-in-the-loop.},

Automotive software, developed in a traditional/legacy way, currently must be rewritten from scratch to support new features or modifications in associated hardware. Disruptive automotive megatrends: connectivity, electrification, and autonomous driving continue to demand new features in a complex software-base. As a result, greater quality issues are faced when more functionality is added to traditional, nonstandardized automotive software. Several researchers have proposed standardization of automotive software to improve the software quality. However, as yet, the industry lacks a de facto standard. At the heart of the AUTILE Framework, we recommend following automotive open system architecture standard as the basis to design modular and open software architecture. To further realize the benefits of modular software architecture designed in the first phase, AUTILE chooses and integrates Agile methodologies as its software development approach. Widespread adoption of Agile methodologies for automotive software development has not occurred and this research highlights the enablers and barriers in this domain. The proposed framework was applied practically to develop automotive software projects, demonstrating that defect reduction can be accomplished using the steps outlined in this new methodology.},

Here, environment-perceiving sensor systems such as camera, lidar, or radar represent a key technology while posing a major challenge in terms of complex physical interactions that make validation very complicated. Typically, required system tests within dynamic environments are enabled too late, while real-world testing is neither efficient nor sufficient. Striving for a seamless transition from a first digital prototype to the final real system, we propose the use of digital twins and hybrid testbeds. These combine real and simulated components per availability or requirement to continuously enable simulation-based validation in all stages of development. To this end, we present an overall concept of scalable sensor models and simulation methods that meet the varying requirements along the development process by introducing a triple-axis scalability. Here, reusable building blocks allow for scaling across different sensor types and applications with varying level of detail, while natural interfaces and measurement-accurate ground truth annotators ensure a seamless integration into the underlying development process using methods of X-in-the-loop.},

  abstract     = {In the aftermath of disasters, localization of trapped victims is imperative to ensure their safety and rescue. This article presents a novel localization and path planning approach that uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs can extract one-hop neighbor information from the devices that may have run out of power by using directed wireless power transfer (WPT). The one-hop neighbor information corresponds to range measurements, which may or may not contain noise. For the noiseless case, we present a customized online graph traversal approach that minimizes the search energy of the UAV and the number of unlocalized nodes. The lower limits on the various performance aspects of this joint approach are presented. For a noiseless case, the results of UAV travel distance and cells searched show a decreasing trend with an increase in the number of maximum neighbors. These curves approximately approach their corresponding lower limits when the number of maximum neighbors is increased beyond 9. For the case of noisy range measurements, using the same objective function and graph traversal algorithm, the probabilistic region for search is determined that gives the least probability of flip errors. To this end, we further optimize the UAV flight path and its search energy in the probabilistic region through clustering. The proposed method is able to achieve linear scaling of the area searched with respect to the noise level. For a given noise level and increasing number of nodes, the UAV search energy with clustering can reduce the energy cost to 70\%.},

  abstract     = {The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in low-voltage residential feeders has elevated the need for grid support at the distribution level to prevent violations of local voltage constraints. In this article, a coordinated reactive power support (RPS) methodology is presented that utilizes the demand-side flexibilities of the end user to keep local voltage levels within allowed levels. A cloud-based architecture is implemented to optimally coordinate consumers&#39; reactive power capable demand-side resources such as electric vehicles, solar PV systems, flexible home appliances, etc., considering their varying characteristics, ratings, and purposes. An optimization-based two-stage device scheduling and management model is presented for the cloud server that schedules consumers&#39; devices in day ahead for cost minimization, and optimally allocates the required RPS in real time among the candidate devices based on priority. Two device prioritization strategies are proposed that consider the reliability of reactive power capable consumer devices and management complexity, thereby, allowing consumers to either enhance the candidate devices&#39; lifetime or reduce the management complexity while participating in grid support. The proposed RPS methodology is validated using simulation studies, and an experimental setup is established to verify the viability of the proposed cloud-based coordination system for RPS. Case studies indicate that the proposed method can effectively prevent overvoltage situations by using coordinated RPS from consumers&#39; devices while maximizing their reliability. Results also indicate that the proposed methodology is economically more viable than state-of-the-art voltage control strategies.},

A continuous-time Gaussian process is developed to characterize the uncertainty and variability of load, which is used to update the load forecast over each control horizon. The proposed continuous-time problem is solved in a finite-dimensional function space spanned by Bernstein polynomials, which converts the problem into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming problem. The proposed model is implemented on the IEEE reliability test system. Numerical results show the optimal participation of ES in balancing and regulation markets considerably reduces the total real-time operation cost of the system.},

In the TVF-EMD, the adaptively tuned and predefined parameters and variation of the cutoff filter frequencies with respect to time make it more desirable over other decomposition techniques for enhanced resolution-based time-frequency analysis of nonstationary signals. The voltage signal measured at the distributed generation is processed through the TVF-EMD to decompose the signal into various intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The energy of the IMF is further extracted through the Teager energy operator. The computed energy is then used to identify the islanding scenario. In order to assess the performance of the proposed TVF-EMD, a number of simulation studies are performed on two standard test systems under varying islanding (i.e., different power mismatches and load quality factors) and critical nonislanding (i.e., capacitor switching and nonlinear load switching) conditions. The obtained results prove the efficacy of the proposed method.},

However, the existing VLC-based IPSs employ active devices that consume power and are costly. We develop a novel VLC-based IPS that circumvents the requirement of active devices by using the proposed optical identification algorithm, thereby enabling the IPS to be highly scalable, robust, energy efficient, inexpensive, and flexible. To implement this algorithm, we use a wavelength-sensitive receiver whose working is validated by hardware simulations. Another novel feature of our work is the design of a passive optical identifier that consists of a unique combination of optical reflectors and is analogous to a radio frequency identifier tag used for identification and tracking of different objects. We present an analysis of several practical aspects related to the physical realization of the proposed IPS, such as system scalability, target mobility, system reliability, algorithmic complexity, and implementation cost. To analyze the system performance, we determine its spatial resolution and the positioning error for different grid sizes. We conclude that the proposed IPS benefits from a low value of positioning error ( ~ 2-35 cm) and is also cost efficient.},

Typically, realizing mutual authentication and key agreement without active involvement of a trusted third party is expected in this field. Thus, to achieve this aim, several authenticated key agreement schemes for smart grid have been presented; while as investigated in the following section of this work, most of these schemes remain vulnerable to various attacks. Therefore, to design a truly secure authenticated key agreement protocol for smart grid and make some contributions to this field, this work presents our new authenticated key agreement scheme for smart grid using Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certificate as the building block. Our scheme is pairing-free and just uses two passes to realize mutual authentication and key agreement as well as strong credential privacy, making it with high efficiency in both computation and communication overheads. Moreover, its security is formally proved under the widely accepted Canetti and Krawczyk (CK) security model, and is further confirmed by a heuristic security analysis.},

  abstract     = {A distributed charging system based on the Internet of Things can provide important supports to ensure the safe and sustainable operation of electric vehicles (EVs). Usually, drivers prefer to use local charging piles by querying the remote cloud server. Frequent communication with the cloud server will not only produce an unnecessary communication overhead but also increase the latency of response. More seriously, the cloud-based centralized management mode is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which usually leads to privacy leakage. However, previous studies seldom focus on the privacy issue of the charging system for EVs. In this article, a decentralized and privacy-preserving charging scheme for EVs is proposed, which is based on blockchain and fog computing. In this scheme, fog computing is introduced to provide local computing with low latency. Specifically, a fog computing network, which is composed of fog computing nodes (FCNs), is used to provide localized services. Besides, a flexible consortium blockchain architecture is proposed. The blockchain system is deployed on the distributed FCNs, providing a decentralized and secure storage environment. By combining mutual authentication, smart contract, and blockchain-based storage, the security of privacy in the charging process can be ensured. The theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme.},

Then, we use the “global warming” method to extract some valuable subregions quantitatively, which will be visited by AUV in the optimal sequence.

Recent studies focus on using smart methods to deal with these challenges. These methods require access to information that can be provided by distribution network state estimation. However, state estimation in the distribution network is hindered by limited network observability and increased uncertainty due to the presence of DGs. With the threat of false data injection attacks, the security of state estimation is also a concern. To this end, this article proposes an iterative state estimation that uses: 1) an extended state vector that includes DG outputs; 2) pseudo-measurement generation based on DG characteristics and static voltage control modes; and 3) a weight updating algorithm that incorporates bad data detection. Simulations on a 44-node test distribution network show that the proposed iterative method improves the estimation of the status and outputs of the DGs and subsequently increases the accuracy of the fault current calculation.},

We also welcomed two new Senior Editors recently. Moreover, approximately one year ago, we implemented a pilot group of six Senior Associate Editors dedicated to verifying the scope of submitted papers. The pilot was indeed a success. As such, we have decided to make it an ongoing practice; the inaugural members are introduced in this issue and on the journal’s website. In addition, we regularly recruit qualified Associate Editors for the journal to step in once an appointed editor’s term ends or submissions in certain areas increase. Since last year the size of the editorial board has almost doubled. This growth reflects the systems community’s enhanced interest in disseminating research results in the IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL. Additional good news is that the Systems Council has approved an increase in the number of pages for the journal in order to address its growing popularity and to partially reduce the current backlog. We will, therefore, also be considering special issues for the journal once again. This issue, as with our previous issues, has exciting papers on the various system of systems topics, including the practical aspects of microgrids (e.g., in energy storage systems and capacity optimization), IoT (e.g., in e-health and edge cameras), and cloud-edge computing (e.g., in space-air-ground integrated networks and 5G networks). You can find all of these emerging technologies under a complex system of systems configuration. Finally, in this issue, you will also find seven survey papers with various focuses.},

By exploiting the benefit of a space–time line code (STLC) scheme that does not require training for full channel estimation at the receiver, i.e., the UAV, we employ the STLC scheme and design the passband bandwidth. Precisely, the number of symbols within the given frame duration is designed to reduce the total energy consumption at the UAV for the given data volume.

For the STLC encoding, channel state information is estimated before the data transmission. Thus, owing to the channel variation, the discrepancy between the estimated and actual channels degrades the communication performance, particularly at the end of the data frame. Considering the time-varying channels, a frame length is designed to maximize the worst-case throughput of the frame end and numerically validated.},

  abstract     = {With the development of big data and cloud computing, data analysis technologies play an important role to produce huge market values. Customers with limited computing resources may resort to the cloud to perform some association rule mining tasks. Data owners may have a risk of personal sensitive information leakage in this process. To preserve privacy in outsourced data, data owners may encrypt raw data before uploading. Data analysis of encrypted data is a challenge that has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic tool, which is one of the ways to solve this challenge. It allows data processing of encrypted data without decryption. Researching homomorphic encryption schemes that support privacy-preserving data mining in a multikey environment has become a significant direction. In this article, we propose a novel homomorphic cryptosystem, which supports multiple cloud users to have different public keys. Besides, we propose a privacy-preserving association rule mining scheme on outsourced data uploaded from multiple parties in a twin-cloud architecture. Our scheme uses a transaction record representation method in databases for large shopping malls based on real-world situations, and our experiments on a real transaction database show that our technology is reasonably feasible.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum sensing is used to detect whether primary user are using authorized spectrums, which can be regarded as a key and core issue for opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. In traditional information theory and clustering algorithm-based spectrum sensing methods, they need to evaluate noise environment for constructing a reference point. However, the reference point is fixed, which is unreasonable in dynamic cognitive radio environment. Moreover, these methods convert signal feature from manifold onto Euclidean space, which will cause to overall performance degradation, since sensing information losses. To address this problem, an information geometry (IG)-based K-means clustering algorithm, namely IGK, is developed, it clusters samples on manifold instead of Euclidean space with an unsupervised way to train a classifier for spectrum sensing. Specifically, secondary users observe and collect data from a selected authorized spectrum, which needs to be detected, and send these sensing data to a fusion center (FC). Then, the FC transforms these data into samples on the manifold to obtained a classifier by using the proposed IGK algorithm. According to the trained classifier, we can get related result of the authorized spectrum. Finally, in simulation section, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified under different conditions.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising technology in which the spectrum resources are reused efficiently with cellular mobile users (CMUs) in an underlay of the fifth generation network. Using it, network capacity and spectral efficiency increase but it introduces the cochannel interference. Moreover, massive connectivity has not been fully exploited for efficient spectral efficiency usage in the existing solutions. Therefore, to address the aforementioned challenges, we integrate power domain nonorthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique with the D2D mobile groups (DMGs) to maximize their sum rate and to maintain the signal-to-interference noise ratio provided by CMUs. We formulate the problem of spectrum reuse as mixed-integer nonlinear programming and then converted it into two subproblems. First, the DMGs are formed between the D2D transmitter and D2D mobile users to reduce the intrauser interference using successive interference cancellation technique. Second, the resource allocation scheme for both the CMUs and DMGs is designed to mitigate the cross and cochannel interference using many-to-many mapping scheme. Also, to fully exploit the potential benefits of DMGs, the group rate selection criterion based resource block reuse algorithm among DMGs is designed. Finally, for power optimization, we use the difference of two convex functions programming approach based on a successive convex approximation low complexity. To simulate the proposed scheme, the 3GPP urban path loss model based on release 15 and RAN1 is used. Numerical results demonstrated that the proposed scheme has superior sum rate as compared to the existing NOMA and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access schemes.},

  abstract     = {Most applications for small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) have a critical need for appropriate position and attitude control in environments with extreme external dynamic disturbances such as wind gusts. Moreover, to maximize flight time, UAVs have to operate within strict constraints on payload and under computational efficiency. This article presents an optimized robust adaptive controller for a UAV in the presence of realistic wind gusts that are flying in an urban environment at an altitude lower than 400 ft. The position controller is based on two degree-of-freedom proportional-integral-derivative controller tuned with particle swarm optimization, while the attitude controll is based on a robust adaptive integral backstepping controller. By assuming the knowledge of the predetermined limits of the external and unstructured disruptions (for example, wind gusts) at low altitude, a guaranteed quality of transient and steady-state tracking performance were attained. The aerodynamics, wind gust model, and control modules are integrated into a six-degree-of-freedom UAV with a fully nonlinear robust adaptive controller. Optimal power is obtained for UAVs using the radial inflow model in the presence of wind gusts that are compared with the simplified model. Two case studies were performed systematically for two representative flight paths, namely, up-cruise-down and circular paths. The simulation results demonstrate the robustness and adaptive property of controllers against wind gusts. These results are useful for a variety of UAV applications, e.g. accurate trajectory tracking and autonomous waypoint navigation without loss of performance in the presence of wind disturbances under computational efficacy.},

We analyze a closed-form expression of the SOP under this strategy. As our main result, we demonstrate that the SOP of the OF strategy approaches that of the full feedback strategy as the number of legitimate MSs becomes large.

One driving technology to fully utilize the polarization domain is the polarization-agile antennas that allow flexible reconfiguration of the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) polarization. The current state-of-the-art polarization-agile antennas can take several discrete polarization angles. This article proposes and analyzed a practical scheme to determine feasible optimal Tx and Rx polarization among the limited number of polarization angles to converge to theoretical channel capacity supported by the discrete polarization-agile antennas with single-RF front-end systems. Both the theoretical and simulation-based analyses for the capacity outage caused by adopting practical discrete polarization-agile antennas are provided in this article to complement communication system design in balancing channel capacity maximization and hardware cost. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the multipolarization multi-input multi-output communication system toward the late revisions of 5G and beyond-5G, so called, 6G wireless communications can successfully reach the theoretically achievable channel capacity with the practical discrete polarization-agile antennas.},

The conventional perturb and observation (P&amp;O) technique is preferred in most of the PV systems. Nevertheless, it undergoes false tracking of maximum power point (MPP) during the rapid change in solar insolation due to the wrong decision in the duty cycle. To avoid the computational burden and drift effect, this article presents a simple and enhanced P&amp;O MPPT technique. The proposed technique is enhanced by including the change in current (dI), in addition to the changes in output voltage and output power of the PV module. The effect of including the dI profile with the traditional method is explained with the fixed and variable step-size methods. The mathematical expression for the drift-free condition is derived. The traditional boost converter is considered for validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods by employing the direct duty cycle technique. The proposed algorithm is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and validated under various scenarios with the developed laboratory prototype in terms of drift-free characteristics and tracking efficiency. The result proves that the proposed technique can track the MPP accurately under various operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the parallel operation of photovoltaic (PV), battery energy storage (BES), and diesel generator (DG) for standalone ac/dc system. It is known that the maximum penetration of PV systems in DG-based power system is limited in the range of 40\%-60\%. When the PV capacity becomes comparable to DG capacity, the system suffers from stability and synchronization issues. Hence, this article proposes a dc droop-based hierarchical control of the PV-BES-DG system based on dc integration at a common dc bus. The dc integration alleviates the scalability limit on PV and facilitates better control of the hybrid system than ac counterpart. Moreover, an optimal regulator-based secondary control is proposed to ensure optimal load sharing among DG and BES. Further, a power management scheme (PMS) is designed to ensure reliable operation of the standalone system during source and load power imbalances and operation under critical state of charge limit condition of BES. Also, the PMS constraints the operation of DG below a defined low-level loading. Further, small signal stability analysis is presented to analyze the effects of droop and optimal regulator gain on the system&#39;s stability. The laboratory-scale prototype is developed to evaluate the performance of proposed PMS and dc droop-based hierarchical control of the PV-BES-DG system.},

  abstract     = {A generic framework is proposed for fault detection and recovery (FDR) in automated driving systems (ADSs) with inertial sensors, which is based on multitask one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (MONN). FDR plays an important role for safe and robust vehicle controls in driver-assistance and ADSs. Although model-based fault detection and recovery methods are well established in the literature, they need accurate model description and are often designed under ideal conditions. Data-driven fault diagnosis, however, might overlook apparent physical relations among sensors. In order to take advantage of both approaches, dynamic relations among measured physical quantities and temporal finite differences are introduced in a MONN as additional features. The proposed algorithm achieved more reliable performance and outperformed considered state-of-the-art methods under various testing conditions. Extensive experiments were conducted to empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed generic FDR framework.},

Further, an active power curtailment strategy is proposed for DGs to properly integrate OLTCs in voltage regulation when the reactive power support is deficient. The proposed control algorithms rely on the average consensus theory and sensitivity analysis to provide optimized voltage support while satisfying the agents&#39; self-objectives.

  abstract     = {Cloud computing provides an appearing application for compelling vision in managing big-data files and responding queries over a distributed cloud platform. To overcome privacy revealing risks, sensitive documents and private data are usually stored in the clouds in a cipher-based manner. However, it is inefficient to search the data in traditional encryption systems. Searchable encryption is a useful cryptographic primitive to enable users to retrieve data in ciphertexts. However, the traditional searchable encryptions provide lower search efficiency and cannot carry out fuzzy multikeyword queries. To solve this issue, in this article, we propose a searchable encryption that supports privacy-preserving fuzzy multikeyword search (SE-PPFM) in cloud systems, which is built by asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryptions and Hadamard product operations. In order to realize the functionality of efficient fuzzy searches, we employ Word2vec as the primitive of machine learning to obtain a fuzzy correlation score between encrypted data and queries predicates. We analyze and evaluate the performance in terms of token of multikeyword, retrieval and match time, file retrieval time and matching accuracy, etc. The experimental results show that our scheme can achieve a higher efficiency in fuzzy multikeyword ciphertext search and provide a higher accuracy in retrieving and matching procedure.},

First, we study the solution space of azimuth variables with equivalent and neighboring characteristics. A generalized improvement to coverage and capacity optimization (CCO) approaches is proposed only in the light of the pseudometric structure of the solution space. Then, we model the optimization problem as an unconstrained one and propose a pseudometric-driven evolutionary algorithm to optimize the coverage ratio. Experiments are carried out both in the ideal and the practical urban scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm edges out other baseline algorithms belonging to evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence with respect to the convergence speed and the final coverage result. Furthermore, the pseudometric structure, as a fundamental topology on the azimuth solution space, provides a new lens to address other CCO issues concerning the antenna azimuth variables and, thus, provokes rethinking on the coverage optimization of cellular system in general.},

For this purpose, their protection before and restoration after intentional attacks are of great significance. Moreover, in order to keep the prescribed demand continuously satisfied, postdisruption flow redistribution is also necessary. However, due to the severity of intentional attacks, certain components may need to be overloaded as a result of the redistribution and, thus, the network reliability is influenced. To minimize such influence, we first present a new metric of resilience to reflect the incurred reliability changes. Then, a trilevel optimization model integrating protection, restoration, and adaptive flow redistribution to maximize the network resilience is proposed.

To solve this issue, this article uses an analytical model to develop a threshold-based mechanism to establish data provenance in IoT systems. Moreover, using lightweight security primitives, a lightweight security protocol for data provenance is also proposed. The proposed protocol uses physical unclonable functions and fingerprints extracted from the wireless channel to achieve data provenance, mutual authentication, and anonymity. The wireless fingerprints are generated using the link quality indicator values. Experimental validation on MICA Z motes shows that the proposed technique can detect adversarial channels with high accuracy. Security analysis of the proposed protocol using formal proofs as well as simulations shows the robustness against various types of attacks. Moreover, the energy requirements for the proposed protocol are shown to be significantly lower than existing protocols.},

To assess the usefulness of the proposed synchronization method, the mean square error and the detection probability are theoretically derived.

Most current counting schemes have existed in an ideal environment with idealistic people&#39;s behavior. In this article, we propose a more realistic counting scheme called Que-Fi, a queue number identification system based on Wi-Fi channel state information and a deep learning network. In the proposed Que-Fi scheme, the nonnegligible interference of human motion and the surrounding environment is first analyzed based on the Fresnel zone. Then, we proposed a static model based on the convolutional long short-term memory fully connected deep neural network in order to overcome the interference. A dynamic Que-Fi model is proposed to identify the entering/leaving people&#39;s behavior and update the counting number. In this article, different preprocessing methods are analyzed and compared to test and evaluate the proposed Que-Fi. Experiments have shown that the proposed Que-Fi outperforms the traditional support vector machine and provide accuracy up to 95\% and 96.67\% for static and dynamic models, respectively.},

First, by analyzing the game relationship between ensuring the normal operation level and defending against cyber-attacks, a framework of power communication network topology planning based on game theory is proposed. In this framework, the traditional planner tries to maximize the information transmission reachability of normal operation, while the anti-cyber-attack planner wants to minimize the information transmission reachability of cyber-attacks. Second, considering whether there are uncertainties in the planning, a deterministic topology planning model is proposed for the traditional planner, and an uncertainty topology planning model is proposed for the anti-cyber-attack planner. Third, considering the competition between the two planners, an improved particle swarm algorithm is introduced to solve the models. Finally, a standard example and a practical power communication network are used to verify the correction and effectiveness of the method.},

A mathematical formation of the system is provided and an algorithm is proposed, including back-off, carry-on, and optimization procedures. In order to find the best policy for using this algorithm, simulations are conducted to find the best policy in order to lower all the customers’ total cost while bounding the customers’ delays within a fairness range. The simulation results show the best policy under two different simulation setups.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the power quality enhancement of a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) distribution system by employing a fuzzy logic proportional-integrator-derivative multiple complex coefficient filter multiple second-order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop (FLPID-MCCF-MSOGI-FLL) hybrid control scheme based shunt active power filter. The MSOGI-FLL reference current generation strategy is implemented to mitigate the current harmonics by extracting the fundamental constituents (FCs) from the nonlinear load currents, whereas an MCCF is employed to separate the FC from the distorted grid voltages and eliminates the voltage harmonics during extremely polluted grid voltage condition. The main objective of using FLPID is to maintain the stable power between dc and ac sides by regulating the dc-link voltage constant under transient conditions. To track the maximum power from the PV panel under varying environmental condition, the particle swarm optimization based perturb and observe technique is used in this article. The comparative analysis is analyzed to check the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control scheme with existing and adaptive control techniques in respect of power quality, better dc offset rejection, better FC and frequency extraction, and grid synchronization. The system with the proposed control scheme is simulated on MATLAB/Simulink and validated in a real-time field-programmable gate array platform under different test scenarios. In conclusion, the harmonic content of grid currents and voltages is found well within the IEEE-519 standard limits.},

The challenge of expert opinions aggregation is to reduce the subjectivity in the process as much as possible and improve the reliability of the aggregated opinion. Most of the existing literature try to eliminate the subjectivity but seldom consider the reliability of the aggregation result. In this article, we propose a new criterion that contains consensus level and confidence level to improve both objectivity (i.e., consensus) and reliability (i.e., no absurd result) with the experts&#39; opinions being represented as probability density functions. Subsequently, the expert opinion aggregation problem is formulated as a biobjective optimization model. The Survey of Professional Forecasters is used as an example to examine the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach and the result shows that the new approach can provide a better estimation than that of the single objective model in the literature. To our best knowledge, the proposed criterion is new in the literature of GDM along with relevant problems. The proposed criterion is actually a pilot work to probe the problem of the quality of a GDM process, which is largely ignored in the field of GDM.},

The APs apply minimum mean-square error channel estimation to obtain the uplink channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, in order to obtain DL CSI at users, this article considers the use of maximum-ratio transmission to beamform DL pilots in the DL beamforming training (BT) phase. For such a system, we derive the closed-form expressions of the sum spectral efficiency (SE) and total energy efficiency (EE). Based on the obtained closed-form expressions, we develop two successive approximation algorithms to improve the sum SE and total EE by optimizing the power control coefficients of DL data and pilot. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in improving the sum SE and total EE. In addition, the numerical results also show that the sum SE of a cell-free massive MIMO system with exploiting the BT scheme can be significantly improved over the system without employing the BT scheme.},

In IoT, physical layer security is potential due to the vulnerability of wireless broadcasting in low computation capability and limited power source of the sensor nodes. In this regard, this article presents a secure and energy efficient V-MIMO enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer framework. The security framework uses beamforming and cooperative jamming signal to maximize the secrecy rate of the IoT systems. An optimization problem is formulated by collectively optimizing the beamforming vector, power splitting ratio, and time switching ratio. Since the maximization problem is nonconvex, to find solution of the problem an iterative algorithm is presented, which inherently uses the penalty function to find the solution. It is evident from simulation results that the secrecy rate optimization of the proposed framework is better as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques considering various metrics.},

However, effective beam alignment between senders and receivers requires accurate knowledge of the vehicles&#39; position for fast beam steering, which is often impractical to obtain in real time. We address this problem by leveraging the traffic signals regulating vehicular mobility: as an example, we may coordinate beams with red traffic lights, as they correspond to higher vehicle densities and lower speeds. To evaluate our intuition, we propose a tractable, yet accurate, mmWave communication model accounting for both the distance and the heading of vehicles being served. Using such a model, we optimize the beam design and define a low complexity, heuristic strategy. For increased realism, we consider as reference scenario a large-scale, real-world mobility trace of vehicles in Luxembourg. The results show that our approach closely matches the optimum and always outperforms static beam design based on road topology alone. Remarkably, it also yields better performance than solutions based on real-time mobility information.},

In order to maximize the benefits of CVR, the method has been implemented in multiple stages of slow and fast time scale control periods for planning and real-time operations, respectively. The stochastic multiobjective Volt/VAR optimization considering uncertainty and forecasting errors has been formulated for the planning stage. However, in real-time operation, an adaptive Volt/VAR droop-controlled approach has been proposed for fast time controllers to mitigate voltage fluctuations during the sudden change in PV active power output. Besides, the economic impact of CVR in terms of cost savings has been investigated. The proposed control algorithms have been validated in real-time co-simulation platform. The simulated results demonstrate a higher reduction in peak demand, daily energy demand, and system losses. Further, a higher reduction in power purchase cost has been achieved in the presence of PV system with CVR in comparison to PV alone.

Specifically, an ergodic capacity analysis of NOMA-aided multi-UAV communications in FD-HetNets is conducted through a moment generating function (MGF) approach within a stochastic geometry framework. By employing the MGF approach to evaluate ergodic capacity, exact expressions that are simpler to evaluate are obtained. When compared against half-duplex HetNets, i.e., HD-HetNets, FD-HetNets with effective interference management enable higher ergodic capacity to be obtained by the macro base station and UAVs. Furthermore, we show that it is possible for NOMA-aided multi-UAV communications in FD-HetNets to achieve higher ergodic sum capacity and ergodic capacity gains than HD-HetNets while supporting more UAVs at low altitude due to a stronger desired signal. Even with lower levels of self-interference suppression and strong phase noise, NOMA-aided multi-UAV communications in FD-HetNets is still able to achieve higher ergodic sum capacity over HD-HetNets. Therefore, the attractiveness of NOMA-aided multi-UAV communications in FD-HetNets is highlighted as a promising solution toward improving spectrum utilization in UAV communications.},

  abstract     = {Volt/VAR optimization (VVO) is one important operation in distribution systems to maintain acceptable voltage profiles. However, the high penetration of renewable generation poses severe challenges to VVO, leading to voltage deviation and fluctuation. This is further complicated by the growing coupling between the electricity and natural gas systems. To resolve the unacceptable voltage deviation under energy system interdependency, this article proposes a cooptimization of VVO for an integrated electricity and gas system (IEGS) with uncertain renewable generation. A two-stage data-driven distributionally robust optimization is developed to model the coordinated optimization problem, which determines the two-stage VVO and operation schemes with dispatch and corrective adjustment through active power regulation and reactive power support in both day-ahead and real-time stage. A semidefinite programming is reformulated to ensure the tractability and the proposed problem is solved by a constraint generation framework. Simulation studies are conducted on a 33-bus-6-node IEGS. Case studies demonstrate that the interdependency between electricity and gas systems reduces the significant operation cost and voltage rise. It, thus, can benefit integrated system operators with a powerful operation tool to manage the systems with fewer costs but integrate more renewable energy while maintaining the high supply quality.},

  abstract     = {Conventional directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) may fail to protect microgrids formed using inverter-based distributed generation (IBDG) units, as IBDGs have limited fault current contribution. Maloperation of DOCRs can be due to: 1) inability to distinguish load and fault currents; 2) incorrect fault direction identification; or 3) miscoordination of primary and backup DOCRs. This article proposes employing harmonic current injection capability of IBDGs to design a novel harmonic DOCR (HDOCR). In the proposed method, during fault conditions, each IBDG injects a harmonic current with an order different from the ones injected by its neighboring IBDGs. The magnitude of this current is modulated by an equivalent impedance that is locally computed at the terminals of each IBDG. New time-harmonic-current characteristic, directional element, and protection coordination optimization model are devised for the proposed HDOCRs. The proposed protection scheme is applicable to radial and ring microgrids with multiple IBDGs and does not require communication. Simulation studies in PSCAD/EMTDC verify the performance of the proposed scheme under various faults.},

  abstract     = {Bitcoin-NG (next generation), a scalable blockchain protocol, divides each block into a key block and many microblocks to effectively improve the transaction processing capacity. Bitcoin-NG has a special incentive mechanism (i.e., splitting transaction fees to the current and the next leader) to maintain its security. However, this incentive mechanism ignores the joint effect of transaction fees, mint coins, and mining duration lengths on the expected mining reward. In this article, we identify the advanced mining attack that deliberately ignores microblocks to enlarge the mining-duration length to increase the likelihood of winning the mining race. We first show that an advanced mining attacker can maximize its expected reward by optimizing its mining-duration length. We then formulate a game-theoretical model in which multiple mining players perform advanced mining to compete with each other. We analyze the Nash equilibrium for the mining game. Our analytical and simulation results indicate that all mining players in the mining game converge to having advanced mining at the equilibrium and have no incentives for deviating from the equilibrium; the transaction processing capability of Bitcoin-NG at the equilibrium is decreased by advanced mining. Therefore, we conclude that the Bitcoin-NG blockchain protocol is vulnerable to advanced mining.},

  abstract     = {Wireless power transmission (WPT) is one of the breakthroughs in effortless electric vehicle (EV) charging technology. Different types of wireless charger topologies were proposed and implemented to meet various constraints like power transfer efficiency, wireless transfer distance, and misalignment tolerance. Yet the coupling separation and the transfer efficiency are still underdeveloped for contactless charging of medium- and low-power EVs like e-cycles and e-scooters. For achieving the high-distance WPT in the vehicles which are prone to misalignment issues, series-series (SS) compensated WPT is used. The conventional SS-compensated WPT uses a voltage-fed converter for the power conversion. But the combination of these topologies allows reverse current flow in the system, which will affect the transfer efficiency and life span of the source. To prevent this, a reverse blocking diode or a current-fed converter can be used. Though the reverse current problem can be solved, these approaches seem to reduce the power transfer efficiency further. This article tries to optimize the current-fed converter-based SS-WPT to achieve higher coupling separation, higher power transfer efficiency, and higher misalignment tolerance than the conventional designs. To achieve this, the input inductor of the current-fed converter and the primary coil of the SS-WPT are tuned without affecting the magnetic resonance condition. The transfer efficiency was found to be 94\% at a coupling separation of 200 mm, which is 20\% more than the conventional voltage source inverter-based, renewable energy-powered SS-WPT charging efficiency. After proving the concept in prototype design, the results are validated by testing the same in a real-time electric cycle.},

  abstract     = {Certificateless signcryption can simultaneously provide certificateless signature and encryption. In recent years, many certificateless signcryption schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes are based on traditional mathematical theory and not have the ability of resisting the quantum computing attacks. Up to now, lattice-based certificateless signature or encryption schemes have been proposed; however, these schemes only have one function and cannot fulfill two functions of certificateless signature and encryption at the same time. In consideration of this reason, in this article, a certificateless signcryption scheme from lattice (L-CLSS) is constructed. L-CLSS has three advantages. First, in the random oracle model, it is provably indistinguishable against adaptive ciphertext-chosen attacks under the intractability of the learning with errors (LWE) problem and unforgeable against adaptive message-chosen attacks under the hardness of small integer solution (SIS) problem. Second, comparison with the cryptographic algorithms under the difficulty of large integer decomposition, L-CLSS can resist the quantum computing attacks. Third, L-CLSS has higher computation efficiency and a lower communication cost than the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Integrated modular avionics architecture has become the most attractive idea to enhance system capability as well as improve efficiency. However, this architecture makes designing a system configuration scheme difficult because multiple resources are shared to support different functions that may have been irrelevant before. This article introduces a method to optimize the configuration scheme for an integrated modular avionics system while considering functional redundancy requirements. Not only the allocation scheme, which illustrates the relationships between functions and shared resources is taken into account, but also the resource scheme, which illustrates how many shared resources are enough to cover the functional requirements is considered as a part of the configuration scheme. Toward a generic integrated modular avionics system with functional redundancy requirements, we first give a configuration scheme model as well as its related schedulability and reliability constraints. Then, the optimization process of the configuration scheme is formalized as a combination of a constraint satisfaction problem and a constraint optimization problem. Specifically, it is decomposed into two steps including: 1) finding a resource scheme which has the lowest cost but still satisfies the constraints based on a forward checking algorithm; 2) finding its corresponding allocation scheme which distributes the targeted functions to different resources as evenly and low-coupled as possible based on the NSGA-II algorithm. Finally, an example is used to prove the effectiveness of the method. The optimization method can serve as a guide to design a configuration scheme for the integrated modular avionics system.},

To reduce network cost and enrich end-user quality of experience, Internet service providers (ISPs) and content providers (CPs) are expected to collaborate to improve content delivery services. However, the influence of content popularity has been generally overlooked, and profit split problem between ISPs and CPs has not been studied. We investigate the novel economic behaviors between ISPs and CPs in the presence of edge caches, and formulate the profit split problem as a centralized model, which can achieve optimal content caching and maximal network benefits. A Stackelberg game is designed to obtain its distributed win–win solution, where a feasible backward induction is proposed and the influence of edge caches and content popularity is analyzed. Simulation results show that the performance of our proposed Stackelberg game model is comparable to the centralized alternative and much better than existing ISP-CP cooperative schemes not considering cache deployment in the network.},

The traditional directional overcurrent relays utilize the reference voltage phasor for the detection of the fault direction, which increases total cost due to the need for both current and voltage measurement units. In this article, a new current only directional algorithm based on the instantaneous frequency is introduced. The proposed method is robust to noise and changes in the grid parameters, such as a change in the power frequency and direction of normal power flow. To evaluate the algorithm, plenty of simulations and actual experiments are carried out in different fault conditions. Also, its performance is compared with some other directional algorithms.

Investigation indicates relationships between school-trip commutes, i.e., students&#39; trips to and from school, and traffic congestion. Therefore, optimizing traffic in terms of the school-trip commute is considered as an important practice of smart cities. This article proposes a long-coding adapted genetic algorithm for large-scale school district replanning. Moreover, the fitness function takes into account both the congestion coefficient model and the grayscale difference model, which can reduce the traffic congestion as well as balance the traffic load on school-trip routes. Based on the above results, the school-trip route optimization is formulated as the school bus routing problem (SBRP) and the split demand school bus routing problem (SDSBRP). A max-min ant system with a pheromone smoothing mechanism is proposed for the SBRP and the SDSBRP. Considering the large scale of the problem, a high-compactness K-means algorithm is proposed to determine bus stops before school bus routing. Besides, a public bus allocation strategy is proposed to allocate a fleet of public buses to serve school-trip routes with low allocation costs. The proposed algorithms are tested on a realistic and challenging dataset from real world. Experimental research results show the advantage of our proposed strategies in reducing overall rush-hour traffic and optimizing school-trip routes.},

As compared to the physical attack or cyber attack carried out independently, a coordinated cyber-physical attack has a larger impact on the market operation. This article proposes a coordinated cyber-physical attack to maximize the electricity market disruption in terms of deviation in the generation cost between the day-ahead market and real-time market operations. The identification of physical attack causing maximum unintended deviation in the electricity market operation has been formulated as a binary optimization problem. The second stage of the proposed attack involves injecting a state preserving attack vector into the communication channel. The false data injection hides the impact of the physical attack, thereby, refraining the control center from taking necessary actions. The impact of the attack has been quantified in terms of variation in the generation cost and nodal prices between the preattack and postattack scenarios for IEEE 9, 14, and 39-bus power systems.},

Fast orthogonal search and finite action-set learning automata are used to tune model coefficients and objective function weights, respectively.

Simulation results confirm the efficiency and effectivity of the proposed framework in terms of economic benefits, technical aspects such as power losses, and congestion management compared with the independent operation of transmission and distribution systems. If compared with a centralized approach and other decentralized methods, computational advantages are also confirmed, such as achieving the optimal solution with reasonable accuracy and time.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing efficiency greatly depends on the efficiency of the virtual machines (VMs) placement strategy used. However, VM placement has remained one of the major challenging issues in cloud computing mainly because of the heterogeneity in both virtual and physical machines (PMs), the multidimensionality of the resources, and the increasing scale of the cloud data centers (CDCs). An inefficiency in VM placement strategy has a significant influence on the quality of service provided, the amount of energy consumed, and the running costs of the CDCs. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a greedy randomized VM placement (GRVMP) algorithm in a large-scale CDC with heterogeneous and multidimensional resources. GRVMP inspires the “power of two choices” model and places VMs on the more power-efficient PMs to jointly optimize CDC energy usage and resource utilization. The performance of GRVMP is evaluated using synthetic and real-world production scenarios (Amazon EC2) with several performance matrices. The results of the experiment confirm that GRVMP jointly optimizes power usage and the overall wastage of resource utilization. The results also show that GRVMP significantly outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of the performance metrics used.},

However, in order to realize this, a critical issue that should be addressed first is how to predict and utilize vehicle-to-grid (V2G) schedulable capacity accurately and reasonably. This article proposes a novel V2G scheduling approach that considers predicted V2G capacity. First of all, with the concept of dynamic rolling prediction and deep long short term memory (LSTM) algorithm, a novel V2G capacity modeling and prediction method is developed. Then, this article designs a brand-new rolling prediction-decision framework for V2G scheduling to bridge the gap between optimization and forecasting phases, where the predicted information can be more reasonably and adequately utilized. The proposed methodologies are verified by numerical analysis, which illustrates that the efficiency and resiliency of the grid can be significantly enhanced with V2G services managed by the proposed methods.},

While it guarantees time precision, it is vulnerable to cyberattacks, which may modify the time offset and results in mismatches in time. This modification (GPS spoofing attack) changes the phase angle of signals measured by PMU. This article deals with three important challenges in GPS spoofing attack detection; first, multiattack detection while there are probable attacks on different PMUs, second, attack detection considering the dynamic model of power systems, and third, measurement correction. For providing solution to the abovementioned problems, an anti-GPS spoofing attack mechanism is suggested, in which, a dynamic filter with the help of PMU and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems measurements estimate the phase shifts caused by spoofing attacks. The results of data fusion of PMUs and SCADA in the detection method are shown. Numerical results demonstrate that this approach can detect dynamic spoofing attacks in a reasonable time and as soon as multiple attacks are detected, corrected measurements are provided.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a generalized uplink cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with nonideal radio frequency (RF) chains and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is investigated. Specifically, the RF impairments and ADC imperfections not only hinder the accuracy of channel estimation but also deteriorate the strength of received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Achievable closed-form rate expressions are first derived by leveraging on the Gaussian RF impairment model and linear additive quantization noise model, after that, we explore the uplink achievable rate surrounding the key design parameters, i.e., the quality of RF chains, the precision of low-resolution ADCs, and the number of total antenna arrays. Considering channel estimation, we find employing poor RF chains and ADCs could fetch finite ceilings on estimation accuracy. Besides, the RF scaling law is also established, which suggests that the access points (APs) can tolerate lower receiver quality as the number of total antenna arrays increases, and the receiver quality can be cut down at most by 1/√{MN}, where M and N are the number of APs and the number of antennas of each AP, respectively. Moreover, we observe 5-bit ADCs are enough to substitute infinite-bit ADCs with scarce performance degradation. Finally, the compensation between RF impairments and ADC imperfections is presented. The resultant analysis provides insights for designing a more economical cell-free massive MIMO system while keeping the achievable rate at an acceptable level.},

According to the control design, a subsystem controller only communicates with its neighboring controller(s) when a certain condition evaluated using local measurements is triggered. Thereafter, control signals are updated when such events are triggered locally or at its neighboring subsystem(s). Since the algorithm can significantly lower the requirements for communication and computation, it is efficient and easy to implement. Lyapunov synthesis is performed to show that the reduced communication does not compromise the control performance.

First, a distinct strategy of peer clustering is adopted to maximize network capacity and meet peer traffic demand. The peer clustering problem is formulated as a 0/1 integer linear programming (ILP). Then, an approximation algorithm is proposed to determine the feasible solution of the 0/1 ILP. Second, in order to provide timely data dissemination among peers, another method for estimating propagation delay is proposed, where we use the estimated value and the actual historical value simultaneously to alleviate the incorrect problem of the estimated value. Third, based on the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the service, a different distributed data scheduling algorithm between peers is designed, which effectively utilizes the limited bandwidth of the network.

This involves identifying constituent systems that can provide the services, optimizing the use of the services driven by extra-functional properties, performing admission control for service provision, reserving resources for provided services, and recursively using services from subcontracted constituent systems to realize service provisions. In this article, new conceptual models with service provisioning for reliable and deterministic SoS applications, as well as, distributed algorithms for the discovery, optimized selection, and admission of service provisions are introduced. The proposed models will result in a two-step admission control algorithm with short- and long-term admissions based on schedulabiliy tests, resulting in service provisions between constituent systems.

At first, information seems as an abstract entity completely separated from the physical world. However, when information is transmitted, it must be recorded by a receiver using energy and reading it from a mass equilibrium entropy state. The majority of research works is based heavily on the definition of information and transmission without interference from other channels and/or information packages. However, in this article, we develop a relationship between energy, mass, and information as physics properties.

To support diversified viewing qualities of multimedia video services, each video file is encoded into a base layer (BL) and multiple enhancement layers (ELs) by scalable video coding (SVC). A super layer, including the BL and several ELs, is transmitted to every user. We define and quantify the service delay of multiquality videos by deriving successful transmission probabilities when a user is served by a D2D helper, a small-cell base station (SBS), and a macrocell base station. We formulate a delay minimization problem subject to the limited cache sizes of D2D helpers and SBSs. The structure of the optimal solutions to the problem is revealed, and then an improved standard gradient projection method is designed to effectively obtain the solutions. Both theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations validate the successful transmission probabilities. Compared with three benchmark caching policies, the proposed SVC-based random caching scheme is superior in terms of reducing the service delay.},

  abstract     = {Arbitrary deployment of mobile or static sensor nodes has been a challenging issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) over the years. It is difficult to identify the accurate location for mobile sensor nodes due to their time-variant movement. Global position system (GPS) for each sensor node costs high power consumption, mainly in large scale WSNs. Hence, designing an energy-efficient localization algorithm is very crucial for sensor nodes. In this article, we adopt a meta-heuristic algorithm known as Krill Herd (KH) inspired by the behavior of krills. KH is selected to find the location of nonanchor nodes by using mobile anchor nodes. Mobile anchor nodes have GPS units and broadcast their exact locations at regular time intervals to find the location of nonanchor nodes. The time-variant location of the nonanchor node is calculated by movement generated by the existence of all sensor nodes in the neighborhood range, foraging motion of anchor nodes, and random diffusion of all the sensor nodes. Two genetic operators namely crossover and mutation are added to the algorithm to analyze the behavior of mobile anchor nodes. The experimental results are carried out for minimizing localization error, propagation error, roo-mean-square error, and mean absolute error. The results demonstrate the outperformance of KH-based localization algorithm with minimum error rate when compared with particle swarm optimization algorithm and improved amorphous localization algorithm.},

In this article, the concept of compatible decentralized control (CDC) based on synchronous local measurements is first proposed for the decentralized AVR and PSS to improve the power system stability. The mathematical models on IDC and CDC are, respectively, modeled to represent the compatible characteristics of CDC. The distinguishing feature of the proposed CDC is that the decentralized AVR and PSS can be compatible with one another in regulating generator dynamics.

In this article, we propose a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA system, where all users in the whole system are divided into multiple clusters to reduce the inner interference. Next, the superpositioned signals at base station are beamed to the relays, and then, the relays communicate with the users through superposition coding in the power domain. We derive the exact expressions of the outage probability of each user and the ergodic capacity (EC) of each cluster in both cases, i.e., perfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) and imperfect SIC, taking into account the Nakagami-m fading channels and imperfect channel state information (CSI). We also compare the outage performance and the EC of our proposed MIMO-NOMA relay system with an orthogonal multiple access (OMA) relay system. Monte Carlo simulations are used validate the derived mathematical expressions. Numerical results show that the outage performance and the EC of each user and the whole system are reduced remarkably due to the imperfect CSI but get better as the fading severity is less. Moreover, the EC of our proposed MIMO-NOMA relay system is higher than that of the OMA relay system.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of sensor nodes distributed over a certain target area. The WSN plays a vital role in surveillance, advanced healthcare, and commercialized industrial automation. Enhancing energy-efficiency of the WSN is a prime concern because higher energy consumption restricts the lifetime (LT) of the network. Clustering is a powerful technique widely adopted to increase LT of the network and reduce the transmission energy consumption. In this article (LT) we develop a novel ARSH-FATI-based Cluster Head Selection (ARSH-FATI-CHS) algorithm integrated with a heuristic called novel ranked-based clustering (NRC) to reduce the communication energy consumption of the sensor nodes while efficiently enhancing LT of the network. Unlike other population-based algorithms ARSH-FATI-CHS dynamically switches between exploration and exploitation of the search process during run-time to achieve higher performance trade-off and significantly increase LT of the network. ARSH-FATI-CHS considers the residual energy, communication distance parameters, and workload during cluster heads (CHs) selection. We simulate our proposed ARSH-FATI-CHS and generate various results to determine the performance of the WSN in terms of LT. We compare our results with state-of-the-art particle swarm optimization (PSO) and prove that ARSH-FATI-CHS approach improves the LT of the network by ~ 25\%.},

The objective is to maximize the secure EE for the primary satellite network while satisfying the allowable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements of the secondary and primary users along within the transmit power limitation of both satellite and the terrestrial base station. Owing to the nonconvexity and intractability of the original optimization problem, a beamforming scheme and associated transformation algorithms are proposed by jointly applying the Taylor approximation, fraction programming, and alternating search to cope with the implementation difficulty. The key is to convert the original optimization problem into a simple convex framework and obtain the optimal solution step by step. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the feasibility and practicability of the proposed optimization algorithms.},

We consider a UAV-based low-altitude platform (LAP) to deploy an aerial hotspot to provide Wi-Fi coverage without infrastructure and severe shadowing by urban or mountainous terrain. To address the performance degradation of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) by increasing packet collisions with the number of clients, we exploit nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To the best of authors&#39; knowledge, there are no previous studies on uplink NOMA in CSMA/CA networks. In the considered system, owing to the distributed architecture and small channel difference of stations, conventional NOMA methods in cellular systems are not suitable. In this paper, we propose a power allocation scheme for uplink transmissions using predetermined power levels with a stochastic power selection to reduce the probability of packet collisions. A new medium access control procedure for uplink NOMA with CSMA/CA is also presented. The analytic results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better saturation throughput and average packet delay than conventional CSMA/CA.},

In addition, customers&#39; characterization plays an undeniable role in the implementation of demand response (DR) programs, as any changes in the consumption patterns could affect DR programs. Therefore, an accurate algorithm for detecting changes in the consumption patterns is very useful in not only the implementation of DR but also in other fields, such as load forecasting and peak shaving. This article proposes a reliable procedure for detecting changes in customers&#39; consumption patterns. For this reason, an adaptive algorithm is introduced to improve the clustering quality of customers&#39; consumption patterns by determining the optimum number of clusters, using a locally weighted entropy-based segmentation. Moreover, considering the customers&#39; consumption records in different time slots as the features, another adaptive algorithm is introduced for feature selection based on the mutual information concept. The proposed method is evaluated by applying a real dataset provided by the Irish Social Science Data Archive. The results corroborate the efficiency of the proposed procedure.},

  abstract     = {There have been significant advances in the technologies for robot-assisted lower limb rehabilitation in the past decade. However, the development of similar systems for children has been slow despite the fact that children with conditions, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and spinal cord injury (SCI), can benefit greatly from these technologies. Robotic-assisted gait therapy (RAGT) has emerged as a way to increase gait training duration and intensity while decreasing the risk of injury to therapists. Robotic walking devices can be coupled with motion sensing, electromyography, scalp electroencephalography, or other noninvasive methods of acquiring information about the user&#39;s intent to design brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for neuromuscular rehabilitation and control of powered exoskeletons. For users with SCI, BCIs could provide a method of overground mobility closer to the natural process of the brain controlling the body&#39;s movement during walking than mobility by wheelchair. For adults, there are currently four Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lower limb exoskeletons that could be incorporated into such a BCI system, but there are no similar devices specifically designed for children, who present additional physical, neurological, and cognitive developmental challenges. The current state-of-the-art for pediatric RAGT relies on large clinical devices with high costs that limit accessibility. This can reduce the amount of therapy a child receives and slow the rehabilitation progress. In many cases, the lack of gait training can result in a reduction in the mobility, independence, and overall quality of life for children with lower limb disabilities. Thus, it is imperative to facilitate and accelerate the development of pediatric technologies for gait rehabilitation, including their regulatory path. In this article, an overview of the U.S. FDA clearance/approval process is presented. An example device has been used to navigate important questions facing device developers focused on providing lower limb rehabilitation to children in home based or other settings beyond the clinic.},

We consider a discrete Poisson channel with transmit power constraints. While focusing mainly on the development of a UV-based indoor communication, an indoor UV channel model is first proposed. Based on this, physical characteristics of the UV indoor channel using on-off keying modulation are analyzed with direct detection in terms of bit error rate, channel dc gain, and delay spread. As the proposed UV indoor communication exhibits some limitations, we provide a brief discussion on design implementation and challenges. From the performance analysis, it is found that the proposed UV indoor communication can provide ubiquitous link connectivity in indoor applications, while keeping network structure and management simple.},

Like the EE is a noteworthy aspect in ultra low power devices, energy harvesting (EH) is an active approach from surrounding electromagnetic sources. This article deals with EE maximization for SWIPT using PS mode. In the SWIPT system, this article presents a tradeoff between EE and spectral efficiency and proposes an algorithm, which allocates optimal power to each distributed antenna port. For an IoT device, the PS scheme implements EH and information decoding operations. The proposed algorithm is based on the Lagrangian multiplier method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to find the optimal solution without iterative computation compared to the conventional iterative method.

  abstract     = {Since a large number of videos have sprung up, the human-centric visual understanding tasks especially human action recognition (HAR) is under great demand. The key issue of the HAR is to capture spatial-temporal collaborative representations by mining abstract and discriminative high-level features. In this article, we propose a cross-modal learning framework that mainly includes an alignment net and a fusion net to improve the performance of the HAR. First, extracted different modal information is mapped into a common subspace to align, which compensates for the spatial-temporal discrepancies. Then, the aligned features are further fused to generate complementary, correlated, and consistent representations. Finally, the learnt features are input to the classifier for recognition. The experimental results have shown that our proposed approach can outperform several state-of-the-art baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {Stroke survivors with chronic paralysis often have difficulties to perform various activities of daily living (ADLs), such as preparing a meal or eating and drinking independently. Recently, it was shown that a brain/neural hand exoskeleton can restore hand and finger function, but many stroke survivors suffer from motor deficits affecting their whole upper limb. Therefore, novel hybrid electroencephalography/electrooculography (EEG/EOG)-based brain/neural control paradigms were developed for guiding a whole-arm exoskeleton. It was unclear, however, whether hemiplegic stroke survivors are able to reliably use such brain/neural-controlled device. Here, we tested feasibility, safety, and user-friendliness of EEG/EOG-based brain/neural robotic control across five hemiplegic stroke survivors engaging in a drinking task that consisted of several subtasks (e.g., reaching, grasping, manipulating, and drinking). Reliability was assumed when at least 75\% of subtasks were initialized within 3 s. Fluent control was assumed if average “time to initialize” each subtask ranged below 3 s. System&#39;s safety and user-friendliness were rated using Likert-scales. All chronic stroke patients were able to operate the system reliably and fluently. No undesired side effects were reported. Four participants rated the system as very user-friendly. These results show that chronic stroke survivors are capable of using an EEG/EOG-controlled semiautonomous whole-arm exoskeleton restoring ADLs.},

To evaluate the spatiotemporal characteristics of vehicles with and without a warning system, objective measures were analyzed, including a spatiotemporal diagram of the curvature of obtained data and speed adjustment behaviors. This article also evaluated the impacts of connected vehicles on the traffic capacity based on the converging pattern mining method. The results indicated that the in-vehicle human-machine interface (HMI) improved driving behavior and traffic capacity. Notably, the in-vehicle HMI helped drivers better prepare for speed adjustments when approaching the tunnel and when the vehicle in front of the study vehicle made a sudden operational change. Moreover, the system contributed to a more stable operation speed, especially near the tunnel entrance, than that without the system. The findings suggest that connected vehicle environments enable drivers to change from traditional visual stimuli response behaviors to proactive response behaviors based on psychological expectations. Besides, based on the best-converging patterns from the spatiotemporal trajectories of 35 drivers, the results revealed that the traffic capacity could be improved by 22.19\% under the experimental traffic flow conditions. Moreover, the differences in the benefits of the in-vehicle HMI among individuals were found to be statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {In online social networks (OSNs), detection of malicious social bots is an important research challenge to provide legitimacy of user profiles and trustworthy service ratings. Further, spam-influential users must be minimal to control the fake information-spread in OSNs. Learning from example patterns using supervised learning may not provide accurate results in cases where existing data items are biased and bot behavior dynamically changes over a period of time. Moreover, deep reinforcement learning provides improved learning by repeated interactions with the environment. However, a typical deep reinforcement leaning algorithm converges slower to find an optimal sequence of actions to reach out a goal state. In this article, we design a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based deep Q-learning algorithm for detecting social spam bots by integrating PSO with Q-value function. In addition, spam-influential users are identified using the proposed spam influence minimization model and it helps in restricting the flow of illegitimate tweets in Twitter network. Further, an influential community detection algorithm has been proposed to reduce the spreading of spam content through influential communities in Twitter network. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms by considering two Twitter datasets and performance metrics such as precision, recall, and modularity.},

Unlike previous works, in addition to considering random channel access, both the HAP and these devices have imperfect channel state information. We present two distributed Q-learning based channel access strategies to help sensor devices determine their transmission power. Specifically, these two channel strategies exploit conventional and stateless Q-learning. To investigate the influence of centralized and distributed learning on throughput, we further employ the aforementioned channel strategies in the paradigms of independent learner (IL) and joint action learner. The simulation results show that IL outperforms all other strategies. When there is no channel variation, the IL strategy has up to three times higher throughput than Aloha with SIC. The IL strategy can also achieve 100\% higher throughput than Aloha with SIC when the frame size is one.},

This article documents the first part of the research which aims to develop a means to rationalize defined alarms in operations through use of the causal modeling approach that is linked with the graph modeling technique that involves graph analytics to provide metrics to evaluate the alarm system performance.

Power electronic-based distributed generators (DGs) operating in parallel are the main constituents of these systems, which extract, control, and convert electric power from renewable sources. Broadly, the approaches for controlling these systems are categorized under centralized, decentralized, and distributed strategies. Under the decentralized category, droop control and several variants of the same have been proposed in the literature over the years. A large portion of the work reported, considers linear loads. This article compares the performance of four commonly employed droop control techniques for inverter-based distributed generators, for their performance under nonlinear loading conditions and during plug and play functionality in the islanded mode of operation. The work attempts to investigate the performance of these strategies under both uniform (i.e., same control structure in the DGs) and nonuniform (DGs operating with different control structures) scenarios from the perspective of output power sharing and transients during the plug and play functionality. The evaluation is carried out through simulations of cases with constant impedance, constant current, and dynamic nonlinear loads on the modified 13-bus system using MATLAB-Simulink, and experiments on a laboratory scale microgrid.},

LRs are first grouped multiple clusters according to their channel correlations and gains, and the LRs of each cluster are served by one beam with the NOMA technique. Two sparse radio frequency chain antenna structures are adopted. Based on this, we formulate an SEE maximization problem by optimizing the hybrid analog/digital precoding, while the minimum secure rate requirements of LRs and the transmit power constraints of the base station are imposed. Due to its difficulty to directly solve the formulated problem, we first design the analog precoding based on the discrete phase and digital precoding according to the zero forcing technique, and then, the original problem is transformed into a power allocation problem. By applying the first-order Taylor approximation and successive convex approximation, the transformed problem becomes a convex one, and an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it. Finally, numerical results are conducted to evaluate the SEE performance of the proposed algorithm in the mmWave-NOMA system.},

A large set of practical channel measurements was performed in an indoor work environment in order to encompass a wide panoply of user positions, antennas, and jammer configurations. Then, three strategies were studied for the selection of subbands, antennas, and transmit powers so as to alleviate the influence of jamming. First, a configuration where the paired users are served by a unique antenna was considered. Then, two other configurations were studied, where paired users are served by two different antennas. It was shown that, in these two strategies, under specific channel and power conditions, it is possible to allow both paired users to perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) to remove interuser interference. The dual-SIC strategy, when applied with joint antenna transmission, presents a good robustness to jamming and yields important throughput gains, compared to the classical single-SIC scenario and single-antenna dual-SIC transmission.},

  abstract     = {An increasing share of uncertain distributed generations is being integrated into the ac/dc hybrid distribution network (HDN) with the partitioning characteristic. In this article, we propose a distributed optimization framework where the exchange power is regarded as coupling variables being the consensus on both sides of voltage source converters between ac and dc subnetworks. An improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with the varying penalty parameter is applied to solve the proposed distributed operation problem in ac/dc HDN. In each ac or dc subnetwork, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for optimal operation is formulated considering wind power uncertainties addressed by 1-norm and ∞-norm based data-driven methods. The DRO model is solved by the column and constraint generation algorithm, where the polyhedral-based linearization method is introduced to approximate the second-order cone power flow constraints with a series of linear constraints to improve the computational speed. Numerical results based on a real-world 152-bus system including three ac subnetworks and two dc subnetworks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a fault location algorithm for double-circuit transmission lines compensated by a generalized unified power flow controller (GUPFC) in the phasor analysis domain. The suggested algorithm is able to locate the fault point in three stages at each circuit of a double-circuit line equipped with a GUPFC between two terminals. The first stage determines the faulty section with respect to the location of the GUPFC using the positive sequence voltages of two terminals of the line. In the second stage, the faulty circuit among the circuits of the double-circuit line is identified through analysis of sequence components of the line currents at the terminals. After determining the faulty section and faulty circuit of the line, the fault location is calculated at the third stage with high accuracy based on the analysis of synchronous current and voltage phasors that rule the circuitry equations in the GUPFC compensated double-circuit transmission line. Finally, the equations required for determining the fault location for 11 types of faults in these lines are presented based on the distributed parameter model of the line in sequence components considering the coupling between the two lines. The considered GUPFC, based on the detailed model method, is modeled along with the test network in MATLAB/Simulink. Moreover, the presented algorithm is programmed in MATLAB software for evaluation and test. The obtained simulation results verify the accurate performance of the presented algorithm under different fault conditions.},

Different from the related works, we assume that only imperfect channel information of the mobile user (MU) and earth station (ES) is available. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective to degrade the possible wiretap channels within the private signal beampattern region, while imposing constraints on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the MU, the interference level of the ES and the total transmit power budget of the BS and CT. To solve this mathematically intractable problem, we propose a joint artificial noise generation and cooperative jamming BF scheme to suppress the interception.

This article proposes a robust communication framework for state estimation/tracking of unstable microgrids, which is a key component of a smart grid. We present an IoT-integrated smart grid system to monitor the status of microgrids over a wireless network. A delay-universal-based error correction code is utilized to achieve a reliable and real-time estimation of microgrids. To exploit the features of the delay-universal coding scheme, we propose an iterative estimation technique. Through numerical results, we show that the proposed scheme can closely track the state of an unstable microgrid. We also show the impact of wireless network parameters on the estimation performance. The estimation performance of the proposed scheme is compared with the estimation performance of a traditional error correction coding scheme. We show that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms the traditional scheme.},

A virtual power-based control (VPC) is developed for the DGU to ensure zero power exchange with the grid, for smooth grid synchronization (GS). The proposed controller is generating the required magnitude and angle of the inverter voltage without use of the phase-locked loop. The load-side voltage source converter is controlled by the VPC during GS and GC operation. Variation in power reference, in GC mode of operation, is also established with necessary change in the angle of the inverter voltage vector. The machine-side voltage source converter is controlled by three-stage control technique, to maintain the dc-link voltage, throughout the operation. Implementation of the proposed control is performed in simulation environment successfully. The effectiveness of the control is demonstrated experimentally on a scaled laboratory prototype.},

  abstract     = {Integration of distributed generating (DGs) units helps in reducing the extreme loading on the main power grid. DGs are convoyed with high fault currents. High fault currents exceed the ratings of circuit breakers. This article proposes optimal allocation of different types of DGs units correlated with fault current limiters (FCLs) in single stage. The proposed method is assessed with two-stage approach that is carried out based on coyote optimization algorithm (COA) and electrical transient analyzer program (ETAP) at normal and faulty operating conditions, respectively. For this target, a fuzzy-based multiobjective (FBMO) formulation is proposed for enhancing the distribution system performance in both operating conditions. It aims at minimizing the power losses, reducing the fault currents in the network with economizing the installed FCLs sizes. To handle FBMO formulation, the COA has been employed to search for the optimal combination between DGs and FCLs. The proposed methodology is studied on IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus, and the Egyptian East Delta distribution systems. Acceptable power losses and fault level reduction are achieved for normal and faulty operating conditions. Therefore, the effectiveness and capability of the employed single stage for DG units correlated with FCLs allocation are proved compared with bistage approach.},

The fifth-generation (5G) standard introduces the sophisticated concept of network slicing as one of its design principles. The concept enables the creation of logical networks on a common infrastructure with appropriate isolation, resources, and optimized topology to serve a particular use case. In this article, studies on network slicing conceptual framework are summarized. Moreover, the characteristics of a public safety network alongside the current solutions in the 4G system to realize such characteristics are discussed. Furthermore, recent literature that proposes enhancements to 5G system functionalities, which are essential for the efficient and agile management of diverse resources, is examined.

A novel control strategy is presented to resist the influence of the wind field and then achieve a precise strike on the ground targets in the process of UAV air-to-ground strike mission. It is theoretically proved that the proposed controller system can be asymptotically stabilized. Both the dynamic response and steady-state error can converge to zero, respectively. The main contribution of this article is to establish a theoretical framework for designing an integrated controller to ensure that the UAVs precisely attack ground targets by adjusting the relevant parameters of the designed controller. The integrated controller we designed can control the consensus of the velocity for the UAV formation, and the distance between any two UAVs in three-dimensional space remains unchanged so that the UAV formation keeps a fixed geometry in case of decoupling. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is fully proved by a three fixed-wing UAVs formation flight. The simulation results show that the integrated control method integrates the advantages of the robust control with uncertain factors and the proportion-integration-differentiation control with rapid response.},

The transmission line is the longest component in a power system and sometimes it passes through forest areas where the occurrence of cross-country faults (CCFs) associated with high-impedance fault (HIF) syndrome is more due to thunderstorms, cyclones, and poor vegetation management/tree trimming. Detection and classification of CCFs which are associated with HIF syndrome is the most challenging task. In this article, maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT) has been employed to extract the characteristics of the signals during CCF with HIF syndrome which are more complex and aperiodic/asymmetric/nonlinear. Thereafter, maximum change in wavelet packet energy of MODWPT coefficients of currents/voltages have been deliberated as unique features to design proposed fault diagnosis scheme for a dual-circuit transmission line. The efficacy of the proposed scheme has been investigated on the Chhattisgarh State Power Transmission Network. The proposed scheme is appraised with exclusive case studies such as switching of capacitor bank, switching of reactor string, switching of load/feeder, effect of power swing, nonlinear loads, lightly loading conditions, and measurement noise. The proposed scheme has been also validated on standard IEEE 13 bus distribution system with nonlinear loads to confirm its adaptability.},

  abstract     = {The increased integration of light-duty electric vehicles (EVs) into low-voltage (LV) residential networks imposes capacity issues for the grid operators. For example, the uncoordinated and clustered charging of residential EVs can often overload grid assets, jeopardize network reliability, and violate local voltage constraints. This article proposes a coordinated management system for EVs in LV residential networks with power grid support functionalities to address grid overloading and local voltage constraints violation. The charging and discharging of EV batteries in the network are coordinated via a local EV aggregator. The coordination is realized using multiagent system architecture that provides the EV owners with full decision-making authority and preserves their privacy. The EV coordination and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) resource optimization of the EV aggregator is formulated as a mixed-integer programming-based optimization model to minimize the electricity cost for the EV owners based on a real-time tariff while complying with local grid constraints. The proposed methodology is evaluated via simulation of an LV residential network in Sydney, Australia with actual load demand data. The simulation results indicate the efficacy of the proposed strategy for the electricity cost reduction of the EV owners while mitigating grid overloading and maintaining desired bus voltages.},

  abstract     = {Data quality (DQ) concept should play an important role in decision-making and engineering systems. Underestimation of DQ may lead to resource waste, wrong conclusions, or inefficient decisions. Unfortunately, current approaches to DQ incorporating into data management systems are limited to particular applications. This problem is aggravated by the DQ inequality of data sources. This is especially critical in mobile crowd-sensing applications where data may come from unverified data contributors using the smartphones and other mobile devices. To facilitate the expansion of DQ evaluation to a wider spectrum of applications, this article presents a framework for integral DQ and security evaluation in Android-based smartphones. The developed framework provides support for selecting the DQ metrics and implementing their calculus by integrating diverse sensor DQ and security metrics. We present multiple calculi for DQ and security evaluation such as hierarchical fuzzy rules expert system, neural networks, and algebraic functions. Case studies that demonstrate the framework&#39;s performance in addressing real-life tasks are presented and the achieved results are analyzed. The implementation results validate the framework&#39;s capability of performing comprehensive DQ evaluations.},

  abstract     = {False data injection attack (FDIA) is a critical cyber-attack that can cause disrupt operations and subsequently blackouts in smart grid networks. Cleverly constructed stealthy false measurement vectors can circumvent the bad data detector unit and mislead the state estimation process. This article proposes a novel belief propagation (BP)-based algorithm to detect both random and stealthy-type FDIAs in smart grids with higher detection rate than the state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, support vector machines, Random Forest, OneR, and AdaBoost. Another novel feature of the proposed algorithm is to detect FDIAs without using any historical cyber-attack data, which are sketchy due to security constraints and infinitesimal in occurrence numbers. The proposed BP method utilizes local sensor measurement data to calculate local belief and send it as a message signal to the control center. Then, the control center determines final/global belief and compares the result with a predefined threshold value derived from the uncompromised measurement database. The real-time steady-state load data are utilized for dc state estimation. From the obtained results, performance parameters such as detection rate, receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, and F-measure of the proposed BP algorithm are found superior to the aforementioned state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.},

We make use of various analytical tools of stochastic geometry to provide an analytical framework to access the performance for both vehicular-radio frequency (V-RF) communication and vehicular-visible light communication (V-VLC) for dense, medium, and sparse traffic scenarios. The developed framework is also precise in terms of capturing the impact of reducing field-of-view (FOV) of receiver on the level of interference experienced from interferers for V-VLC. The performance has been evaluated and compared under normal atmospheric conditions as well as different environmental deterrents viz., light fog, dense fog, and dry snow conditions in terms of probability of successful transmission as a performance metric. Irrespective of any traffic scenario, the performance of V-VLC communication under normal atmospheric condition always outperforms V-RF communication. However, the performance of V-RF communication is comparatively better than V-VLC under various environmental deterrents. The proposed result motivates the benefit of employing RF-based or VLC-based vehicular-to-vehicular (V2V) communication which takes into account different environmental conditions as well as meets the diverse application requirements for future intelligent transportation system.},

  abstract     = {In multistatic passive radars (MPR), multiple measurements from different bistatic pairs are usually used to locate the target due to the inaccurate direction of arrival estimation. In the real-world scenarios, the available bistatic pairs may be not enough and the probability of detection for each bistatic pair may be relatively low. It cannot be guaranteed that multiple simultaneous measurements will be available. In this case, the existing tracking algorithms face problems in the fast track confirmation, track continuity, and accuracy. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid tracking algorithm for the MPR. To handle the above-mentioned problems, we construct two classes of tracks, namely the high-precision track and low-precision track, for both the track initialization and track maintenance stages. The low-precision track can be converted into the high-precision track under certain conditions. This design facilitates the fast confirmation of high-precision tracks. Combined with the independent management of the high-precision tracks, the track continuity and accuracy metrics will be enhanced as well. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is validated via theoretical analyses and Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, the experimental results using real data also demonstrate the practical effectiveness.},

The faulty lines within the faulty regions are then identified by employing a heuristic index extracted from the wavelet multiresolution analysis of corresponding modal components. The fault location on the faulty lines is finally estimated by the regression analysis of two novel graph regularization-based learning models. This fault location proposal has been evaluated over numerous simulated scenarios on the IEEE 39-bus system with the measurements subject to sampling rate, fault resistance, and noise issues.

  abstract     = {Next-generation multibeam high throughput satellite (HTS) systems aim at achieving Terabits/s throughputs with thousands of spot beams. Conventional radio frequency (RF) Ku-/Ka- band feeder links, between gateways and satellites, are unable to achieve such throughputs due to limited spectrum availability in these bands. Free space optical (FSO) feeder links present a promising alternative to RF feeder links and have gained increased attention lately in the satellite community. This article presents performance analysis of multibeam HTS systems where the feeder link operates in the FSO band and the user link, between the satellite and the user terminal, is in the RF Ka-band. We consider that the FSO feeder link is impaired by the scintillation fading due to atmospheric turbulence and the RF Ka-band user link is attenuated by the rain fading. In multibeam HTS systems, frequency reuse in the user link creates interbeam interference (IBI) due to overlapping side lobes of the multibeam antenna radiation pattern. Considering a forward link with a fixed gain transparent satellite payload, we use the zero-forcing precoding technique to mitigate IBI in the user link. We derive exact and approximate statistics of the end-to-end signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. Also, by capitalizing on these results, we analyze information-theoretic metrics including the outage probability and ergodic capacity. Our results provide various important insights, e.g., 1) outage performance and ergodic capacity is typically restricted by rain fading in the RF link, and 2) outage diversity of rain fading in the RF link is 0, hence outage performance only increases marginally with power at high signal-to-noise ratio.},

Therefore, this article aims to determine the most economically beneficial alternative to attain a sustainable energy supply.

In order to properly monitor power network, an effective cyber attack detection and state estimation method are required to know attack and system states. This article considers the problem of robust grid state estimation and suggests a technique for distributed state estimation in power networks. First, the distribution power system incorporating multiple synchronous generators is modeled as a state-space framework, where attack occurs in measurements. Basically, the false data injection attacks can interfere with state estimation process by tampering with sensor measurements. Using mean squared error principle, the distributed dynamic state estimation algorithm is designed where local and neighboring gains are obtained using optimal filter and graph theory. For local gain computation, the attack parameter is obtained using the Bayesian learning process. The convergence condition of the proposed approach is derived. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed approach is able to estimate the system state within a short period of time. Hopefully, the proposed methodology can be used to tolerate the cyber attacks for improving the confidence of the grid state estimation process.},

By analyzing and extracting the underlying feature of unweighted and undirected networks, we propose a structured compressive sensing method that reconstructs the topology of complex network globally. Through intensive numerical simulations of an artificial small-world network, an artificial scale-free network, and two real networks, we find that the proposed method is efficient for complex network topology reconstruction, and it is also robust against weak stochastic perturbations.},

To alleviate this difficulty, we concentrate on a hybrid beamforming architecture consisting of less number of radio-frequency chains with variable-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for mmWave massive multiuser MIMO uplink systems. Our objective is to design the ADC resolution profile to maximize system performance while reducing total receiver power consumption. However, the resulting ADC resolution profile design problem incurs high combinatorial complexity and is known to be computationally intractable. We address this problem by devising a simple yet computationally efficient algorithm, namely a coordinate update algorithm, to design the ADC resolution profile. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only provides nearly the same sum rate as full-precision ADC receiver systems but also achieves much higher energy efficiency than existing state-of-the-art receiver architectures.},

  abstract     = {In microgrid, hierarchical control requires an advanced communication network. In order to meet stringent communication latency requirement, we use cellular-assisted underlay device-to-device (D2D) communications to connect control devices directly to central controller. Compared to the literature, this scenario is unique because control devices and central controller are not located within a same cell. Thus, a D2D link may span across multiple cells, and a single D2D transmission may impose interference on multiple cellular transmissions in different cells. This article aims to guarantee a minimum throughput to each control unit over D2D link to satisfy its latency requirement, while maximizing the spectral efficiency, which is measured in term of sum-rate of all cellular users. A 2-tier resource allocation scheme has been proposed. Tier-1 assigns channels to static control units. Tier-2 operates more frequently in assigning channels to mobile cellular users and control transmit power for both cellular and D2D nodes. Tier-1 optimization has been solved using the Hungarian algorithm. Tier-2 optimization is originally a complex nonconvex problem, and has been transformed into a combination of convex optimization and linear assignment problem. The proposed scheme has been evaluated through extensive simulations, and comparisons with a benchmark scheme that assigns communication channels randomly. Results have confirmed the efficiency and superiority of the proposed scheme, as well as its ability in finding the smallest D2D transmit power necessary in fulfilling a given latency requirement.},

  abstract     = {This article aims at proposing a multisystem gradient method (MSGM) for solving the integrated nonlinear optimal control problem with multiple systems and unspecified terminal time. This method is based on the influence functions, which are used to predict changes in performance indices and terminal conditions caused by changes in control and terminal time, so as to update the improvements of control and terminal time. To improve the computational efficiency, the linear Gauss pseudospectral technology is employed, which successfully transfers the nonlinear differential equations into a set of linear algebraic equations. In addition, all systems are discreted in the orthogonal points, which leads to the fact that the coupling degree among the systems is very low. In most calculations, each system is independent of the other, and only the multiplier associated with terminal time needs to be solved simultaneously. In other words, the computational complexity will be significantly reduced, which is suitable for online applications. Finally, MSGM is applied to the multimissile cooperative guidance with the same attack time. The simulation results show that the algorithm has high computational efficiency and fast convergence rate. In addition, the stability and robustness of the algorithm are also excellent.},

  abstract     = {Multipedestrian Online Tracking and positioning are the research hotspots and difficulties in the field of computer vision. In this article, we propose a multipedestrian online tracking method based on social force-predicted deformable key-points mapping and compressive sensing. First, part affinity fields are utilized to detect body key-points of pedestrians, and then rectangle boundaries of moving pedestrians can be constrained based on these key-points, the outer rectangle of the key-points replacing the conventional bounding box. Since pedestrian tracking is vulnerable to occlusion and dynamic deformation, a deformable convolution network is applied to extract delicate features. There is one more point, based on the theory of compressive sensing, a very sparse measurement matrix is designed to efficiently compress the features for the pedestrians, which maps features from high-dimensional space to low-dimensional space and preserves the structure of the image feature space of pedestrians. Compressed features are used to measure the similarity between pedestrians in adjacent frames. Furthermore, a pedestrian social force model is adopted, which can predict the trajectory of pedestrians to deal with the problems of partial occlusion and similar appearance, meanwhile making the estimated location more accurately. Finally, extensive experiments on the MOT16 benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed tracking method. The main tracking performance parameters are significantly improved, with multiobject tracking accuracy and multiobject tracking precision reaching 62.8\% and 81.2\%, respectively.},

Additionally, power allocation and NOMA-secondary user (SU) assignment technology is an efficient way to enhance the resource utilization efficiency at the power domain and the spectral domain for underlaying cognitive NOMA networks. In this article, first, a joint power allocation and SU assignment problem is formulated for the NOMA downlink transmission in an underlaying cognitive radio network. The worst-case achievable rate for the NOMA-SU is maximized. To solve this mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we divide the original optimization problem into two subproblems: NOMA-SU assignment and power allocation. Next, a heuristic algorithm is adopted to solve the NOMA-SU assignment subproblem, and successive convex approximation based method is utilized to design a suboptimal power allocation algorithm. Furthermore, an alternative joint NOMA-SU assignment and power allocation scheme are proposed with its average computational complexity analysis given. Finally, numerical results show that the total throughput for the proposed algorithm outperforms more than 30\% compared with an existing benchmark scheme at least.},

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum capacity of femtocells while satisfying the EH requirements of energy users, and information quality of service (QoS) requirements of macrocell users by adaptively controlling the transmit power of femtocell HetNets, where nonlinear EH model is adopted. Due to the discrete variables of transmit power, the formulated optimization problem is with combinatorial computational complexity, and cannot be solved with known solution methods. Thus, a Q-learning-based algorithm is presented, and a segmented reward function based on the distance factor, and the penalty parameter is designed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed Q-learning-based algorithm, and the presented segmented reward function. It is also demonstrated that by using the nonlinear EH model can effectively avoid the deviation brought by the traditional ideal linear EH model. Additionally, it shows that the convergence time of our proposed scheme grows linearly w.r.t. the number of femtocell BSs, and the number of selectable transmit power levels of femtocell BSs roughly.},

In the standard for architecture description, ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011, a definition was adopted that has been subsumed into later standards. In 2018, the working group JTC1/SC7/WG42 on system architecture began a review of the adopted definition, holding sessions late in the year. This article extends and complements a position paper submitted during the meetings, in which Tarski model theory and ISO/IEC 24707:2018 (logic-based languages) were used to better understand relationships between system models and concepts related to architecture. Independent from the working group, it now contributes intuitive fundamental definitions of the terms architecture and system that are used to specify a mathematically based technical process for architecture definition. The engineering utility and benefits to complex system design are demonstrated in a diesel engine emissions reduction case study.},

  abstract     = {Distributed virtual inertia is an approach of providing synthetic inertia in small-scale modern grids dominated by converter-based generators. In this method, the inertial response of synchronous machines is emulated by the energy stored in the dc-link capacitors of grid-tied converters. Nonetheless, it results in instability of the interfaced converter in weak grids. To overcome this problem and get the most benefit out of the acceptable dc-link capacitor voltage deviations, a new compensation technique is proposed in this article. The grid-interactive converter in the presented framework is controlled in the current control mode, compositing of two conventional inner and outer control loops, distributed virtual inertia controller, and a novel compensator. The detailed small-signal representation of the whole control scheme in state-space form is derived. Then, it is revealed that the coupling between d- and q-axis controllers introduced by the distributed virtual inertia gain and its differential operator gives rise to the system instability in weak grids, which can be eliminated through the ancillary compensator. The time-domain simulation model is built to confirm the efficacy of the proposed control technique. The results depict that the ancillary active power provided by the proposed approach during frequency disturbance is 14\% of the converter power rating of 20 kW, which yields the improvement of frequency rate of change by 18.82\%.},

However, few previous studies have used such a model to investigate the connectivity probability for VANET freeway traffic. In this article, a new approach for cooperative communication is proposed for a bidirectional two-lane freeway that utilizes a CTM to dynamically describe the variety of vehicle flows with on-ramp/off-ramp and effectively repair broken chains. The mathematical formulas of the connectivity probability for VANET freeway traffic are derived. Some parameters of traffic flow, such as the vehicle flow, path loss exponent, the communication radius, the message size, and the data rate, are dynamically set and studied. The numerical simulation results are consistent with the actual situation that confirms the accuracy of our theoretical results.},

It is difficult to express the complicated nonlinear mapping relationship between decision results and hybrid situations. This proposes the decision-making scheme M-HSTPN-DL with a three-tier architecture based on modified hybrid stochastic timed Petri net (M-HSTPN) and deep learning (DL). Among them, M-HSTPN describes the various hybrid situations, and DL models are taken as the decision model to express the nonlinear relationship between decision results and hybrid situations. Then the training and calling mechanism of decision models is introduced. Taking the hybrid system of bearing fault diagnosis as an example, we compare the decision-making ability of multiple decision models and analyze the advantage of M-HSTPN-DL.

Because of their flexibility and mobility, UAV base stations (UAV-BSs) can be deployed according to the ground user distributions and their quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Although there has been quite some prior research on the UAV deployment, no work has studied this problem in a 3-D setting and taken into account the UAV-BS capacity limit and the QoS requirements of ground users. Therefore, in this article, we focus on the problem of deploying UAV-BSs to provide satisfactory wireless communication services, with the aim to maximize the total number of covered user equipment subject to user data-rate requirements and UAV-BSs&#39; capacity limit. First, we model the relationship between the air-to-ground path loss (PL) and the location of UAV-BSs in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, which has not been considered in previous works. Unlike the conventional UAV deployment problem formulation, the 3-D deployment problem is decoupled into a 2-D horizontal placement and altitude determination connected by PL requirement and minimization. Then, we propose a novel genetic algorithm-based 2-D placement approach in which UAV-BSs are placed to have maximum coverage of the users with consideration of data rate distribution. Finally, numerical and simulation results show that the proposed approach has enabled a better coverage percentage comparing with other schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a distributed secure spatial modulation (DSSM) is proposed to improve the secrecy performance of transmission system in high-speed railway (HSR) scenario. N-remote antenna units are connected with central processing unit to build a cooperative DSSM system. Considering the influences of correlated shadow fading, spatial-temporal correlated fading and Doppler shift, the expressions of secrecy capacity (SC) and bit error rate (BER) are derived. Based on the design of artificial noise, two power allocation algorithms are jointly proposed as security schemes in HSR scenario. At first, a joint optimal secrecy capacity algorithm (JOSCA) is proposed to maximize SC. Another Lagrange constraint extreme algorithm (LCEA) is proposed to maximize inhibition of eavesdropper&#39;s BER performance. The numerical results show that compared to conventional spatial modulation, the proposed DSSM with JOSCA brings higher SC and keeps a high value of cooperative SC as the advance of train. Moreover, the proposed LCEA brings better BER performance of legitimate receiver while greatly limiting that of eavesdropper. In terms of the tradeoff between SC and BER, the DSSM gets better balance at the viaduct of high-speed railway scenario.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a joint user pairing and secure resource allocation scheme for cognitive radio inspired nonorthogonal multiple access (CR-NOMA) femtocells in the presence of a jammer base station (JBS) is proposed. In the considered CR-NOMA-based femtocells, femto base stations (FBSs) serve their femto mobile station (FMS) by sharing the resource block (RB) with macromobile stations (MMSs), while the JBS in each femtocell secures the data rate of a weak user from the eavesdropping capability of the strong FMS. The strong FMS intercepts the data rate of the weak FMS using a successive interference cancellation technique to decode their own data as per the NOMA principle. The weak FMS protects its data from the strong eavesdroppers through the JBS. The JBS generates artificial noise to confuse the strong eavesdroppers. The problem of the joint user pairing and resource allocation is formulated as an optimization problem, whose main goal is to maximize the secure sum rate of the FMS while guaranteeing the secure data rate of the weak FMS and MMS. For RB allocation, CR at the FBS senses the best RB for its FMS using the Greedy approach. To optimize the power of the FBS and JBS, a successive convex approximation scheme with a low complexity is applied. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme provides an improvement in the secure sum rate of the FMS in comparison to the conventional NOMA and preexisting orthogonal multiple access schemes.},

The localization scenario is established by utilizing the information about energy domain, time domain, and frequency domain. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds are derived, and the performance improvement is proved in different domains. By substituting NLoS bias with the statistical average, the localization equations of information fusion are established. A nonconvex localization problem is transformed into a generalized trust domain subproblem by introducing the squared range and the weighted least squares. The position and velocity of the source are obtained by using the bisection procedure. An iterative method is used to estimate the NLoS deviation and refine the position accuracy simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

One of these proposals mixes multipulse pulse-position modulation (MPPM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). We present here a new way to demodulate it, and, for the nonturbulent free space optical (FSO) channel, we provide accurate analytical expressions for its error probabilities, both in the case of the traditional and the new detector. We also provide simplified expressions for the estimation of the error probabilities. We show that the new detector offers a gain of some tenths of dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with respect to the previously defined one, and that our error probability estimations are more accurate than previously published results. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to provide simulation results validating the study of the error probability performance of QAM-MPPM.},

There have been recent empirical and/or theoretical research with the focus on multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-PLC. This article analyzes the effects of correlation between different paths in MIMO-PLC on the performance of bit error rate (BER) and the channel capacity in the PLC system. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is an effective method to mitigate the effect of the frequency selective multipath fading channel in the PLC system. However, OFDM is susceptible to the imperfect orthogonality among its subcarriers caused by the frequency offset at the receiver. Intercarrier interference cancellation technique such as parallel cancellation (PC) scheme is implemented in MIMO-PLC scenario to study the effect of correlation based on the latest research in MIMO-PLC. 2 × 1 and 2 × 2 space-time (ST)-OFDM and 2 × 2 STPC-OFDM channel models are investigated for the performance of the BER and channel capacity in additive impulsive Gaussian noise via computer simulations. It shows that the BER and channel capacity of both 2 × 1 and 2 × 2 STPC-OFDM outperforms 2 × 1 and 2 × 2 ST-OFDM, respectively, regardless of the correlation between different paths in MIMO-PLC.},

Similar protocols found in the literature either proven to be insecure or carry the burden of high communication and computational costs. The proposed ID-2PAKA protocol is analyzed in the random oracle model to achieve provable security based on the hardness assumptions of computational Diffie-Hellman and bilinear Diffie-Hellman problems. The performance analysis of the proposed ID-2PAKA protocol is performed using the pairing-based cryptography library. The comparative results from the perspective of the computation and communication costs against the competing protocols showed that the proposed ID-2PAKA protocol is secure and efficient.},

  abstract     = {With the evolution of wireless communication networks (WCNs), the absolute fulfillment of security occupies the fundamental concern. In view of security, we have identified another research direction based on the attenuation impact of rain in WCN. An approach is initiated by an eavesdropper in which a secure communication environment is degraded by generating artificial rain (AR), which creates an abatement in the secrecy rate, and the cybersecurity gets compromised. By doing so, an attacking scenario is perceived, in which an intruder models a half-duplex (HD) attack. HD specifies the attack on the downlink instead of targeting both uplink and downlink. This allows the attacker to alleviate the miss rate of the attacking attempts. The layout for the HD attack is explained using radio resource control (RRC) setup. Further, we have determined and examined the performance parameters such as secrecy rate, energy efficiency, miss rate, and sensitivity in the presence of AR. Further comparison of rural and urban scenarios in the presence and absence of AR is carried out concerning the variation in secrecy rate with respect to the millimeter-wave frequencies and distance. Lastly, the methodology of the HD attack is simulated, revealing that the HD attack maintains a low miss rate with improved performance as compared to the performance and miss rate attained by the full-duplex attack.},

During a fault, the WECS necessitates to operate in islanded mode with voltage regulation to supply the local loads continuously. The unified control strategy is developed for selecting the mode of operation, which are MPPT and voltage regulation in grid-connected and islanded mode, respectively. Harmonic spectrum analysis is carried to justify the selection of diode bridge rectifier over semicontrolled/controlled rectifier. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system is verified by means of MATLAB/Simulink.

Under both a peak and an average optical power constraints, finding the channel capacity of VLC is formulated as a mixed continuous-discrete optimization problem without an analytical expression of the objective function. To solve this challenging problem, we first adopt the numerical integration method to approximate the objective function and its gradient. Here, we prove that the gaps between the original functions and the approximations can be arbitrarily small. Then, based on the approximated functions, we describe the method, and theoretically show that the obtained solution sequence converges to the channel capacity-achieving discrete distribution of VLC. We also provide simulation results to verify the effectiveness and optimality of the proposed method. More importantly, the simulations numerically reveal that on-off keying (OOK) modulation achieves the capacity of VLC channel at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) achieves the capacity at high SNR.},

  abstract     = {An intelligent software defined network (ISDN) based on an intelligent controller can manage and control the network in a remarkable way. In this article, a methodology is proposed to estimate the packet flow at the sensing plane in the software defined network-Internet of Things based on a partial recurrent spike neural network (PRSNN) congestion controller, to predict the next step ahead of packet flow and thus, reduce the congestion that may occur. That is, the proposed model (spike ISDN-IoT) is enhanced with a congestion controller. This controller works as a proactive controller in the proposed model. In addition, we propose another intelligent clustering controller based on an artificial neural network, which operates as a reactive controller, to manage the clustering in the sensing area of the spike ISDN-IoT. Hence, an intelligent queuing model is introduced to manage the flow table buffer capacity of the spike ISDN-IoT network, such that the quality of service (QoS) of the whole network is improved. A modified training algorithm is introduced to train the PRSNN to adjust its weight and threshold. The simulation results demonstrate that the QoS is improved by (14.36\%) when using the proposed model as compared with a convolutional neural network.},

  abstract     = {Modern systems, that are often constituted of different interacting components, have increasing requirements for improving availability and safety when suffering unanticipated failures. Therefore, one needs to continuously monitor them, estimate and predict their health states through the implementation of prognostics and health management processes. To make this estimation and prediction more relevant and accurate, different issues, such as the component interactions, the profile mission impacts, and the uncertainties, should be considered. Compared to component level, these issues are more challenging in system-level prognostics. Their resolution is then essential to improve reliability, accuracy, and precision of the prognostics results. In this article, the problems of component interactions, profile mission impacts, and uncertainty quantification in system-level prognostics are addressed. For this purpose, a method using the modeling framework of the inoperability input-output model and composed of three steps is proposed. First, the system inoperability is estimated using particle filtering while considering the interactions between its components. Then, the estimated inoperability is propagated for long-term predictions. Finally, the system remaining useful life is calculated depending on the system configuration. The proposed methodology is applied to a mechatronic system to show its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The bulk of the research on long term evolution/long term evolution-advanced [(LTE)/(LTE-A)] packet scheduling is concentrated in the downlink and the uplink and is comparatively less explored. In uplink, channel aware scheduling with throughput maximization has been widely studied while considering an infinitely backlogged buffer model, which makes the investigations unrealistic. Therefore, we propose an optimal uplink packet scheduling procedure with realistic traffic sources. First, we advocate a joint channel and buffer aware algorithm, which maximizes the actual transmitted bit-count. Thereafter, we introduce delay constraints in our algorithm to support real-time traffic. We further enhance our algorithm by incorporating the varied delay and throughput requirements demanded by mixed traffic classes. Finally, we introduce priority flipping to minimize bandwidth starvation of lower priority traffic in the presence of higher percentage of high priority traffic. We observe that a delay constraint may render the optimization-based proposals infeasible. Therefore, to avoid infeasibility, we replace the delay constraint with delay outage minimization (DOM). DOM aims at minimizing the packet drop due to delay violation. Moreover, DOM also helps in reducing the problems to a well-known assignment problem, which can be solved by applying the Hungarian algorithm. Hence, our approach delivers an optimal allocation with low computational complexity.},

A new framework of uncertainty expression is proposed in this article to properly express different uncertainty sources that exist in the system, where the uncertainty theory is used to express epistemic uncertainties and frequentist probability is used to express aleatory uncertainties. A general propagation method is further developed to address the joint calculations of proposed uncertainty expressions, which can be degenerated into pure probabilistic approach and pure uncertainty-based approach. A case study is conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed method, whose results indicate that the application of proposed method will lead to a result which is easier to be understood than results of theories such as evidence theory and possibility theory, and is more robust than results of Bayesian approach.},

Recently, sphere decoding (SD) has been adopted for multiuser detection whose complexity is polynomial in nature with the number of users, and it does not rely on the number of bits in the modulation. In this article, first we provide a construction of large size quasi-complementary sequence sets (QCSSs), and then a low-complexity optimum SD algorithm is proposed to detect the multiuser communication in QCSS-based MC-CDMA (QCSS-MC-CDMA) system. The complexity analysis has shown that the proposed SD-based QCSS-MC-CDMA receiver for multiuser communication provides lower complexity than that of ML-based QCSS-MC-CDMA receiver. We also show that peak to average power ratio of the proposed system is lesser than that of complete complementary code (CCC) based MC-CDMA (CCC-MC-CDMA) system. The proposed system overcomes the fractional delay problem which is noticed for CCC-MC-CDMA receiver. The bit error rate performance of the proposed SD-based QCSS-MC-CDMA system is compared with maximum ratio combining based MC-CDMA, ML-based MC-CDMA, frequency domain equalization based MC-CDMA, and CCC-MC-CDMA receivers over Rayleigh frequency selective fading channels.

Digital rights management (DRM) systems aim to ensure the authorized content usage. As the digital content broadcasts through the public network, a secure and authorized content access mechanism is required. As digital media users are increasing, data centers draw vast amounts of power to manage consumer demands for instant access. Thus, design of efficient protocols is required for digital industry. Several authenticated content key distribution frameworks have been introduced for DRM systems to support efficient computing and mutual authentication. The main focus of recent devolvement is security and energy consumption by increasing communication and computing efficiency. Most of the existing DRM models efficiently address the consumer concerns and make the system user-friendly and computationally efficient. Thus, it is essential to analyze the security, efficiency, and related issues in the existing framework before adopting them for a DRM system. This article presents a study on the existing authenticated content key distribution frameworks of DRM systems. It proves the vulnerabilities of the existing structures against known attacks and challenges in their implementation. It also discusses the desirable attributes of DRM systems and provides possible future direction.},

While BCI is a promising interdisciplinary tool, researchers are confronting network lifetime as an obstacle to further development. Furthermore, the medium access control (MAC) protocol is the bottleneck of the network reliability. There are many standards for MAC protocols that can be utilized for productive and dependable transmission by altering the control parameters. Modifying these parameters is another source of concern due to the scarcity in knowledge about its effect. In addition, there is no instrument accessible to receive and actualize these parameters on transmitters embedded inside the cerebrum. In this article, we give the transmission instrument to both ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) and ultra-wideband (UWB) signals for multiple transmitters and ultrasonic technology mimicking the neural dusts by modifying the superframe structure. In this article, a hybrid MAC protocol is proposed, and the results show that the traffic received can be increased by 700\% for UHF-RFID and more than 100\% for UWB and ultrasonic technology. Comparative results for wireless channel MAC protocols using these different transmission techniques are discussed in terms of network delay, data dropped, traffic sent, and traffic received.},

This limits the applicability and practicality of noninvasive brain/neural robot control on an everyday basis. It would thus be very desirable to minimize the number of necessary recording sites paving the way for miniaturized, headset-like EEG/EOG systems that users with hemiplegia can mount by themselves. Here, we introduce a novel EEG/EOG brain/neural control strategy using only scalp electrodes placed near cortical sensorimotor areas. The strategy was tested across 16 healthy volunteers who engaged in an EEG/EOG brain/neural control task. Classification accuracies were compared using scalp electrodes only versus the conventional electrode placements across the scalp and face. To evaluate whether cranial muscle artifacts impede classification accuracy, participants were asked to clench their teeth during the task. We found that brain/neural classification accuracy was comparable and that clenching had no impact on classification accuracy across both conditions. Our results suggest that the proposed new strategy allows for reliable EEG/EOG-based brain/neural control, a critical prerequisite to broaden the use of noninvasive brain/neural assistive and rehabilitative technologies.},

Nevertheless, the associated transparency property caused a hazard to real-world applications because every on-chain information is exposed to the public. That implies those applications involving sensitive data or personal information, which require security and privacy protection, are not suitable to be implemented in Blockchain, directly. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes have been treated as one of the end-to-end solutions to data security and privacy protection problems. In this article, we examine the possibility (or cost) of embedding the ideal lattice-based FHE into the Ethereum Blockchain for building up a new trustworthy framework with security and privacy protection capability. Due to the limitations of current Blockchain, the execution of FHE is conducted off-chain; at the same time, on-chain members can call FHE-based functions to directly compute the ciphertext domain operations after their Smart Contracts have been deployed to the Blockchain. To illustrate and benchmark the examining results of our framework, an FHE and Blockchain-based Vickrey auction system is also developed, in which the online bidding prices are kept in secret. Simultaneously, the determination of the winner and the transferring of payments are conducted autonomously by Smart Contracts.},

This article first proposes a bi-level optimization model to find an optimal allocation of ESs for distribution networks, where the upper-level model is to minimize the total risk of all N-1 contingencies and the lower-level model is to compute the load loss for each contingency. Then, the proposed bilevel model is equivalently transformed into a single-level model using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The simulation results on two test systems show the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Inspired by the immune technology of allograft transplantation, this article proposes for the first time the mechanism of antirejection induced by immune tolerance (IT) to solve the problem of signaling recognition and fusion between the heterogeneous mobile communication systems. First, with transplantation immunity as the technical background, a 5G NSA fusion architecture based on the adaptive IT mechanism was constructed. Then, the deep learning (DL) algorithm is used to efficiently identify the type of donor protocol, and the affinity calculation between the recipient and the donor is used to further enhance the correctness of the model recognition results. Meanwhile, the antibody concentration calculation was used to maintain the diversity of antibodies, which realized the complementarity between the IT mechanism and the DL algorithm. Finally, the donor signaling is decoded based on xor and encoded again based on the gene bit field. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively identify donor signaling, improve the affinity between the heterogeneous signaling and the efficiency of encoding and decoding, and broaden the research boundary of artificial immunity.},

  abstract     = {The multimicrogrid system is a complicated nonlinear system, which brings performance degradation due to deficient damping under the unexpected fluctuation in power generation due to the presence of renewable sources, dynamically changing loading conditions, and parameter variations. Owing to this, to provide consistent electric power with superlative attribute, sturdy and intelligent control techniques are amazingly imperative in the automatic generation control of microgrid (MG). The application of imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA)-based fractional-order integral proportional derivative with filter (IPDF), i.e., integral tilt derivative with filter controller (ITDF) controller in frequency control in two areas interconnected MG (isolation mode) with renewable penetration, is a novel work. A maiden attempt of the ICA is proposed to optimize the gains of the ITDF controller utilizing the integral time absolute error criterion. To demonstrate the supremacy of ICA, its outcomes are contrasted with two existing optimization strategies, namely the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is revealed by contrasting the dynamic responses of multi microgrid (MMG) with proportional integral derivative with filter (PIDF) and tilt integral derivative with filter (TIDF) controllers. At last, a sensitivity investigation is performed to exhibit the power of the studied strategy to wide variations in the MG parameters, magnitude as well as the location of step/random load disturbance. The proposed MMG is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment.},

Existing local controllers for these resources are communication-free, robust, and cheap, but with suboptimal performance compared to centralized approaches that heavily rely on monitoring and communication. Data-driven local controls can bridge the gap by providing customized local controllers designed from historical data, offline optimization, and machine learning methods. These local controllers emulate the optimal behavior under expected operating conditions, without the use of communication. However, they exhibit high implementation overhead with the need of individual programming of DER controllers, especially when there are many DERs or when new units are installed at a later stage. In this article, we propose a clustering method to decrease the implementation overhead by reducing the individual DER controls into a smaller set while still achieving high performance. We show the performance of the method on a three-phase, unbalanced, low-voltage, distribution network.},

It involves the high necessity for reducing the power losses besides their related costs, enhancing the voltage profile, and minimizing the investment costs of allocated shunt capacitors. Uncertain power demand is also augmented to achieve reliable operation of distribution systems. To fulfill the previous techno-economic merits, this article proposes a multiobjective framework. In this line, a multiobjective salp swarm optimizer (MSSO) is developed. MSSO is characterized by its simplicity, good convergence, and high capability of driving the solutions toward true optimal Pareto front. The developed MSSO optimizes the technical and economical objective functions considering integer, discrete, and continuous natures of control variables. The proposed MSSO is successively tested on two Egyptian distribution networks. Significant merits are achieved with reduction of 20-25 k$/year in the total costs for single and multiobjective cases. In addition, it preserves the voltage deviations at very low levels compared with the flat value. The superiority and scalability of the proposed MSSO are satisfied for large-scale 118-node radial system. Best compromise solutions at acceptable convergence rates and competitive statistical indices are achieved.},

  abstract     = {Multipath transmission control protocol (MPTCP) is a transport protocol that allows the simultaneous use of multiple transmission control protocol subflows across the existing IP addresses between peers. Since each subflow undergoes the bottleneck link condition of its path, selecting the best subflow to schedule an outgoing packet plays a key role in the multipath performance. While good scheduling decisions can significantly improve throughput, wrong decisions prevent users from benefiting the aggregating capacities of available subflows. To deal with this concern, in the last years, several scheduling solutions were proposed to achieve different goals and applications. Different from other surveys and tutorials, in this article, we provide a tutorial of packet scheduling in the MPTCP that brings not only its fundamentals but also a detailed analysis of multipath performance from a consistent experimental methodology. In a multipath network setup, we compare single-criterion and multicriteria schedulers under different bottleneck conditions and multipath congestion controls. From a comprehensive experimental analysis that unveils several performance issues, we discuss the lessons learned and research opportunities regarding the multipath throughput improvement as the central motivation. In this way, this article provides a comprehensive analysis of packet scheduling in the MPTCP, not only in theory but in practice as well.},

For shaping the CSK input symbols, four different source distributions are considered viz., uniform, exponential, Maxwell-Boltzmann, and Pareto. The article comprises of developing algorithms to obtain the optimum probability order for maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain. The proposed systems have been analyzed for computational complexity. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for symbol error rate (SER) have been derived for the proposed PS-CSK schemes. It has been observed that proposed PS-CSK schemes provide different SNR gain for different source distributions at a given SER. The results show that PS based on Pareto distribution gives the best performance gain at unity achievable information rate among all considered source distributions.},

First, the minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio needed to complete the task is obtained with the given maximum computing resources. Second, the optimal power allocation is carried out by using convex optimization theory, and the throughput gain is calculated, and the offloading decision is made by comparing the throughput gain. Finally, the channel allocation problem is solved by using the maximum matching algorithm of the bipartite graph, and the computation resource allocation is studied. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than that of the contrast algorithm.},

Attempts to assess the overall effect of the ADS, considering the presence of EVs, and VVO on ATC of the system have been investigated in this article. A framework for assessing the impact of ADS on a transmission system (TS) has been employed to emulate IEEE 24-bus reliability test system (RTS) at transmission level and IEEE 123-bus system at distribution level. Two indices ATCEfactor and ATCVRfactor have been introduced for assessing the impact of ADS on ATC.

In this article, we first propose a hierarchical information system evolution model for spatial power grids. Then, a spatial CPPS model is established by combining power and information systems that accounts for overlapped power and information lines. Finally, the structural vulnerability under global and localized failures is investigated based on direct current (dc) power flow. Under global failures, different types of components have distinguishing effects, and the power-node failure is the most serious case. For localized failures, key zones can be identified by the cascading failure scale, and similarly, different failure modes affect different areas. Furthermore, considering power system scenarios with only defenders and those with both attackers and defenders, we investigate two resource allocation situations. For defenders, increased resources and appropriately dispersed allocation can work effectively. However, in the attack-defense scenario, the perfect subgame equilibrium suggests that both attackers and defenders must concentrate all their resources on the most vulnerable zone. These findings may establish a foundation for future efforts to model and protect spatial CPPSs.},

  abstract     = {In the advanced technological world, vehicular communications are used in numerous business and safety applications for smart traffic management. With the help of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, users can transfer substantial information directly to the reachable vehicles. Generally, the movement of vehicles on the highway is faster than crossroads, thus, to communicate securely and efficiently, a robust vehicular communication system is required. Therefore, a number of message dissemination protocols have been designed by the researchers, but distinct interests (i.e, storage cost, high communication overhead, more execution time, and security threats) are sought in these systems, which lead toward unreliability for on-the-fly communication. Very recently, Limbasiya-Das (Ieee System Journal, pp 1937-9234, 10.1109/JSYST.2019.2932807) introduced a hash-based secure and efficient V2V data dissemination protocol to transfer significant information at the receiver end. Limbasiya-Das claimed the security of their protocol against numerous security attacks. However, in this comment, we highlight the loopholes of Limbasiya-Das protocol and show that their protocol is vulnerable to impersonation attack. Moreover, it has irrelevant usage of timestamp and does not offer user&#39;s anonymity. In addition, it lacks message confidentiality because an adversary can determine and view the messages exchanged among the legitimate vehicles by intercepting the messages disseminated over public channel. Finally, we provide probable remedy to mitigate the deficiencies of Limbasiya-Das protocol.},

  abstract     = {While wide-area communication networks facilitate the exchange of measurements and control signals for wide-area damping controllers, they bring in new threats of cyberattacks. This article formulates the dynamic interaction between an intelligent spoof attacker and the wide-area damping control (WADC) center as a zero-sum two-player Markov game. In this Markov game, the attacker intelligently spoofs the communication links sending wide-area control signals to selected generators while the WADC selectively encrypts transmitted control signals with limited cyberresources. The successful spoof of specific communication links leads to the degradation of the WADC performance and even to system instability indicated by the real part of the targeted interarea oscillation mode. The potential performance degradation in the physical layer is uniquely included in the cost function of this game while the other two parts of the cost function are the cybersecurity investments of both the attacker and the WADC (defender). The minimax Q-learning approach is used to obtain the optimal defense and attack strategies. Simulation results show that the strategies for the attacker and the WADC converge within 3000 iterations by using the minimax Q-learning approach. The proposed Markov game provides a cyberphysical framework to make the optimal defense strategy for the WADC.},

However, for the relatively limited resources and capabilities of the edge nodes, such as computing resource and storage resource, it is hard to highly and comprehensively satisfy the high real-time requirements of cable online monitoring tasks. To solve this problem, effectively dynamic task allocation is needed on the basis of efficient utilization and optimization of resource and capabilities of the edge nodes. In this article, a task allocation mechanism for cable real-time online monitoring business based on edge computing is proposed. First, considering the linear distribution characteristics of the cable, the statuses of edge nodes, the processing overhead of tasks, and the scheduling strategy of delay-sensitive tasks, we establish a task allocation model based on edge computing. Second, a task allocation strategy based on improved discrete particle swarm optimization is proposed. In our strategy, we focus on the task queuing problem in edge nodes and the optimized task allocation problem among edge nodes. Simulation results show that the task allocation mechanism proposed in this article can effectively reduce the average delay of cable real-time online monitoring businesses, and further improve the security and reliability of the smart grid.},

Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultrareliability low latency communication (uRLLC) are considered as two main scenarios. Different from the eMBB, which requires high data rate, the uRLLC requires extremely high reliability and very low latency. With multiple demands, the coexistence of eMBB and uRLLC will be an urgent challenge for the 5G networking strategy. In this article, a dynamic multiconnectivity (MC)-based joint scheduling framework with traffic steering for eMBB and uRLLC is proposed. The eMBB and uRLLC are specifically sliced with each other, which avoids the queue of uRLLC. A modified effective capacity (EC) model is proposed to measure the performance of our framework, which improves the throughput of eMBB under the guarantee of uRLLC latency. The proposed EC model turns the analytical target to the queue of users, different from the queue of base stations in traditional EC model. By a two-step optimization, the typical mixed integer nonlinear programming conducted by the EC model is decomposed into the integral programming and the nonlinear programming. The system-level simulation results show the proposed framework enhances the system throughput effectively while guaranteeing the uRLLC latency.},

  abstract     = {Inhabited isolated areas require independent power systems called isolated microgrids. Conventional protection schemes are not suitable for isolated microgrids due to their dependence on significant fault current. This article introduces an adaptive differential feature-based protection scheme for fault detection and faulty phase identification for isolated microgrids. Instead of differential currents, it proposes differential features, where edge computing is used to extract the features at point of measurement. The most informative one-dimensional feature is extracted from each phase at both ends of the line. The line differential feature is compared with an adaptive threshold to perform fault detection. The threshold is updated every second and is immune to system noises. Faulty phase identification is performed with a logical comparison. An in-memory circular buffer is proposed to store the local features in case of communication delay. Communication and synchronization are experimentally validated, and the worst-case latency is reported along with individual processing time for data acquisition, feature extraction, communication, and fault detection. Extensive validations are done with IEC-based and IEEE 13-node-based isolated microgrid. The test results are compared with state-of-the-art methods and proved that the proposed scheme is practical to be adopted in real- world isolated microgrids of different sizes and topologies.},

To address this issue, in this article, we propose a charging scheduling scheme, termed Partial Charge, which can partially charge a sensor node to minimize the overall node dead time so as to prolong the network lifetime. At first, we determine the appropriate ratio for nodes, which needs to be charged partially. Then we prioritize sensors based on their contributions to the charging tasks and always select core nodes to serve. Afterwards, a node delete scheme is proposed to exclude nodes that cannot be saved or degrade the charging performance. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to show the merits of the proposed scheme, revealing that our scheme outperforms other competing schemes in terms of shorter service time, bigger survival rate, and smaller waiting queue.},

In this article, we propose a novel predictive autoscaling method for microservices running on the fog MDC to satisfy the application response time SLO. Initially, our proposed approach uses a reactive rule-based autoscaling method to gather the training dataset for building the predictive autoscaling model. The proposed approach is efficient, as it can learn the predictive autoscaling model using an increasing synthetic workload. The learned predictive autoscaling model is used to manage the application resources serving different realistic workloads effectively. Our experimental evaluation using two synthetic and three realistic workloads for two benchmark microservice applications on a real MDC shows excellent performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art baseline rule-based autoscaling method. The proposed autoscaling method yields 75.51\% reduction in the number of rejected requests and 77.53\% fewer number of SLO violations compared to the baseline autoscaling methods by using only 9.20\% additional data center resources at the fog layer.},

In order to enhance the utilization effectiveness of radar power resource, we present a cognitive design based on control framework incorporating an actor-critic variation of deep reinforcement learning called deep deterministic policy gradient. Specifically, at each tracking interval, the transmit power is allocated with control framework based on prior information, which is represented by the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of prior information of target&#39;s state computed using target&#39;s dynamic models. However, as targets are maneuvering, the dynamic models are always unavailable. Thanks to the sequential manner of target tracking, we consider to integrate a memory based on recurrent neutral network into the control framework for the estimation of FIM of prior information by characterizing the output as parameters for a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution of target&#39;s state instead of a deterministic state. Theoretical analysis has established that the derived covariance matrix is essentially the inverse of the FIM of prior information.

  abstract     = {In this article, the optimal transmission switching (OTS) problem is solved in order to optimize the operation cost of an electrical power system. This is accomplished by disconnecting some transmission lines, which enables a change to the profile of the power flow distribution in the system, allowing for increased generation at the buses with lower costs; thus, the hourly operation cost of the generation is minimized to meet the demand of the system. This article presents contributions to topics related to the issue of the high number of transmission lines that are disconnected when the OTS problem is solved, the problem of system islanding, and the causes of Braess&#39;s paradox, in the context of the OTS problem. Finally, tests are conducted using the 41-bus southern Brazilian system and the 92-bus Colombian system. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposals for reducing the number of lines disconnected from the system and for avoiding islanding.},

  abstract     = {Load shedding is performed, as last option, for emergency measure when system frequency drifts below the allowed limit. Utilities use underfrequency load shedding schemes to bring back frequency within limit. In this article, an adaptive underfrequency load shedding scheme is proposed for the power system in the presence of solar photovoltaic plants using wide-area measurements. Stepwise load shedding is performed at selected buses with consideration of any change in photovoltaic power output and load/generation at each step. Share of load to be shed at a bus is based on the voltage stability index of the buses at that instant considering predefined load priority. The voltage stability index at a bus is obtained using the Thevenin equivalent of the system. For a solar photovoltaic plant integrated system, the Thevenin equivalent changes with solar power variation, where available methods become inaccurate. A Thevenin equivalent calculation approach is proposed in this article using an equivalent model of synchronous generators and photovoltaic plants. The proposed load shedding method is tested on the New England 39-bus system and the 233-bus North Eastern Indian grid with integrated photovoltaic plants. It is compared with available methods and found to be a better technique in bringing system frequency to normalcy with adaptive load shedding.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) suffers from RF hardware complexity, cost, and circuit power consumption. The high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the RF front end is one of the major contributors in power depletion. Thus, one-bit massive MIMO becomes an effective solution. However, the availability of accurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose a semiblind channel estimator for one-bit massive MIMO systems and evaluate its uplink (UL) performance. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages: initialization and iteration. The initial channel estimate is obtained from a pilot-aided initialization stage, which is refined in the iteration stage with the help of both pilot and a few data symbols. The semiblind approach simultaneously improves the estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency with minimum pilot length. We also derive a theoretical lower bound on the UL achievable rate under perfect and imperfect CSI. Through simulations, we show that the semiblind scheme achieves a considerable improvement in mean square error, bit-error-rate, spectral efficiency, and bit energy against the existing one-bit pilot based estimators at the cost of a nominal increase in computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large number of cameras are able to generate large amounts of real-time data. This has attracted increasing attention to streaming-image analytics incorporating edge computing. Since streaming images do not have ground-truth labels, their outputs may become untrustworthy once any concept drift or uncertainty occurs. To keep analytics models updated in response to concept drift, much human intervention is required, particularly in system maintenance for IoT-enabled applications with a plethora of smart cameras. To address this issue and follow the trend of anthropomorphic machine learning, this article incorporates self-regulated learning from human pedagogy, which comprises forethought, performance, and reflection. Our article proposes counterparts for streaming-image analytics, including siaForethought, siaPerformance, and siaReflection, respectively. The experiment results show that siaForethought can effectively blur the detected pedestrians or the whole image to improve privacy awareness. Next, siaPerformance can help reduce the model adaptation time by 38\%, even when using blurred pedestrians or images. Finally, siaReflection reduces about 50\% of human intervention for labeling data, thus greatly reducing human interventions in case of concept drift.},

A manufacturing system is continuously evolved to make new products at different time scales and ensure uninterrupted productions when internal or external changes occur. System evolution relates to add, remove, upgrade components, and reconfigure the system at different levels and scopes. However, scientific methods and tools are lacking to support designers in reconfiguring a system subject to given changes. This becomes a big hurdle to adopt automated solutions in small- and medium-sized enterprises. To support system reconfiguration, we propose a generic framework and methods to assess the performance of heterogeneous robotic systems or components. The proposed methods can also help 1) designers to select components for an integrated solution based on the needs and 2) robot manufacturers to identify the weaknesses of their products.},

  abstract     = {Comprised of multiple belief rules that are close to human knowledge representation, the belief rule base (BRB) has the ability to make full use of both data obtained from historic records and experts&#39; knowledge under uncertainty. When applied in fault diagnosis, the final diagnostic results are inferred by first activating the matching degrees and activation weights, and then integrating the activated rules with the evidential reasoning algorithm. In this study, a novel BRB prediction approach is proposed for concurrent fault diagnosis. In the proposed approach, the indicative factors are modeled as attributes with customized attribute weights to represent their relevance to a known system fault and vice versa. Second, a tradeoff analysis is conducted by comparing the beliefs for different faults. The diagnosed faults with bigger beliefs within a predetermined valve would be considered as concurrent faults. To further improve the prediction accuracy, an optimization approach with the differential evolutionary algorithm as the optimization engine is designed with model constraints reflecting the complex correlations between the indicative factors and concurrent faults. A marine diesel engine fault diagnosis case is studied for validation. Case study results show that: first, both single and concurrent faults can be diagnosed with high accuracy by the proposed BRB prediction approach; second, the BRBs with optimized attributes weights has shown superior performance than with equal and fixed attribute weights; and third, the new BRB prediction approach outperforms the previous approach with multiple sub-BRBs as well as other approaches to achieve a higher modeling accuracy.},

Unlike traditional differential protection, the proposed algorithm can be applied to detect and recognize the faulted poles directly without the requirements for long time delay. The currents at both line ends are sampled at 1 kHz and the noise in the current signals is removed utilizing the stationary wavelet transform. To activate the proposed backup protection algorithm, initialization unit is proposed. In addition, the internal faults can be discriminated from external faults and the faulted poles can be recognized using adaptive signed correlation indices. Comprehensive studies are simulated on PSCAD/EMTDC software considering several cases for external and internal faults. In addition, the frequency dependent phase model is employed to simulate the HVdc transmission line. The simulation results assure the satisfactory performance of the proposed backup protection algorithm for several fault locations, all fault types, and several fault resistances up to 1000 Ω.},

  abstract     = {A Click-based network function (NF) has significant advantages for pipeline development, including modularity, extensibility, and programmability. Despite these features, its internal architecture has unfortunately not kept up with some specific problems of the software upgrade. To motivate our article, we analyzed a series of use cases to identify the limitations of native Click. These limitations include the inefficiencies in modifying modules, integrating modules, and recovering states. To bridge the gap, we present three novel enhancements in our Click upgrade (Click-UP) system: 1) modular state abstraction refines each type of stateful operations as an atom operation and decouples it from the pipeline, letting separately managing logics for stateless operations and stateful operations become practical; 2) essential module integration manages dependencies between modules, avoiding shipping unnecessary modules with neutral functionalities to the target NF; and 3) local state migration migrates needed states seamlessly from the old NF to the target NF at local memory. Our evaluation demonstrates that Click-UP reduces the context code required for module modification by 12-81\%, cutting down the NF integration time by 78-96\% and the service disruption time by 76-93\%, as compared to the software upgrade performance represented by native Click.},

A network can totally lose its functionalities due to nodes/edges failures. It is, therefore, of great significance to assess the robustness of complex networks confronted with failures. The network robustness analysis is helpful for assuring the reliability of complex networks. In our previous work, we had experimentally investigated the robustness of a special type of networks called k-partite networks. Simulation results have discovered that k-partite networks are robust to random node failures. In this work, we aim to investigate the underlying mathematical principle for the robustness property of k-partite networks. To do so, we have developed the mathematical theory to calculate the robustness of k-partite networks to random node failures. The developed theory mathematically uncovers the continuous phase transition of the robustness of k-partite networks under random node failures. In order to check if the developed theory is correct, we experimentally test the robustness of computer generated k-partite networks. The experimental results and the one calculated using the proposed theory comply with each other, which proves that the proposed theory is correct.},

It integrates discipline-specific submodels through key linkages that are derived from the intrinsic properties of a system case study and intangible assets such as knowledge, communication, culture, and process maturity. It captures the techno-socio-economic and cultural factors involved in design change decisions and project management. The simulator provides immediate feedback on whether a change is going to help or disrupt design integrity through the monitoring of system attribute trends and cues. It also provides the impact on lifecycle management curves using a system dynamics submodel. From this feedback, several system, policy, and process levers are available within the simulator for what-if scenarios with the goal to improve product, organizational, and project performance.},

  abstract     = {Designing energy-efficient security techniques for Internet of Things (IoT) networks is particularly vital due to its limited battery capacity and the flow of information via broadcasting. In this article, we propose retrodirective frequency diversity array (RDFDA) based on directional modulation (DM) concept in a time-modulated way to enhance security in IoT. Different from the existing IoT security, in the proposed scheme, the prior knowledge of the intended receivers’ location is not required for the transmitter and no need of channel state information. Leveraging on this feature, we design time controlling switch sequences, which require a single radio frequency chain. To facilitate the DM operation in the proposed RDFDA, the connecting–disconnecting switching functionality for each element branch needs to be judiciously selected. Furthermore, we give insights on how the useful messages can be leaked along the eavesdropper (Eve) direction when an outage has occurred as well as Eve error detectability by analyzing the following metrics such as secrecy outage probability, Eve detecting error probability, and leakage rate of noncolluding Eves. Other metrics, such as secrecy energy efficiency, economic efficiency, and cost efficiency were also analyzed. We give numerical results to disclose the proposed scheme achievements.},

The main goal of this article is to select from all possible compositions the optimal one without knowing a priori the users&#39; quality of service (QoS) preferences. From a theoretical point of view, we give bounds on the problem search space. As the QoS user&#39;s preferences are unknown, we propose a vector-valued MDP approach for finding the optimal QoS-aware services composition. The algorithm alternatively solves MDP with dynamic programming and learns the preferences via direct queries to the user. An important feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is able to get the optimal composition and, at the same time, limits the number of interactions with the user. Experiments on a real-world large size dataset with more than 3500 web services show that our algorithm finds the optimal composite services with around 50 interactions with the user.},

  abstract     = {In-band full-duplex (IBFD) technology is a promising solution to boost the throughput of wireless networks. To bring IBFD to reality, the modem has to cancel the self-interference (SI) signal, which includes the strong direct Tx leakage signal and the weaker reflected Tx signal from the surroundings. Adaptive analog and digital SI cancelation schemes have been proposed. It becomes then interesting to understand, although, how the echoed SI could be exploited for enabling radar functionality while reusing the waveform and the already-existing hardware. This article formulates the monostatic radar system model starting from the communication system model. Beside simulation-based assessment, the performance is also evaluated by an IBFD system prototype, which consists of both analog and digital SI canceller modules, enabling &gt;85 dB Tx-Rx isolation. The system is enhanced with Doppler radar functionality, reusing as much as possible the existing IBFD functional blocks. The experimental result shows the accuracy of the proposed system to measure the velocity of mobile objects at various speeds between 0.2 and 1 m/s while the device is simultaneously served as a node to perform in-band bidirectional communication. This ability suits the proposed system for a broad spectrum of opportunistic remote sensing applications, such as body and hand gesture detection.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device communications have been considered as an indispensable enabler, which reduces the traffic burden associated with fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. To improve the radio spectrum utilization under such a communications scheme, cognitive spectrum sensing can be used to identify temporarily available spectrum chunks for direct interconnections among user devices. Although various sensing techniques have been proposed during the last decade, improving the sensing efficiency (SE), such as energy reduction and positive sensing ratio, remains an open challenge. The problem becomes more pronounced in 5G networks, wherein battery-constrained Internet-of-Things devices (IoTDs) are densely interconnected. In this article, we optimize the SE by leveraging a lightweight yet effective adaptive medium learning method with a probabilistic decay feature. Specifically, the wireless channels that are likely available for IoTDs are sorted and sensed in the descending order of their availability likelihood/probabilities, which indicate the estimated percentage of the availability of the sensed channels. These probabilities learn from the preceding sensing results, and they decay with time. Numerical results show that the proposed sensing approach achieves significant SE improvement compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The matrix-splitting techniques are employed to carry out the extensive matrix inversion of the gain matrix in a distributed way to achieve efficient computation.

  abstract     = {As the penetration of renewable energy, generally, uncertainties, increase in microgrids, a more dynamic and complex system is emerging that makes the load frequency control (LFC) of islanded microgrids more challenging due to their stochastic dynamic nature. This stochastic nature can create oscillatory frequency response, which eventually leads to deteriorating control function and instability even under primary and traditional secondary controllers. Due to the uncertainties, the measurements and microgrid states are continually perturbed; hence, they cannot be directly utilized for feedback control. Therefore, it is required to utilize an observer-based stochastic feedback control that correctly recognizes these uncertainties and sieves incorrect states, frequency deviation here, and can properly maintain the balance between the energy sources and the demand. This article develops an optimal observer-based secondary control for LFC, framed in two layers that are the stochastic unknown input observer (SUIO) and linear quadratic regulator. The proposed SUIO not only can address the uncertainties, e.g., renewable energy, load, and measurement noise, with efficient control effort but also performs robust against parameter changes of the microgrid. The simulation results confirm the efficacy of this proposed control as compared to the traditional secondary control method.},

A novel arrangement of the “full” equalizer matrix allows data/channel estimation, with fewer received OFDM blocks (in channels with short coherence time). The “reduced” equalizer then further reduces the number of OFDM blocks for estimation. The novel, reduced-rank filters are analyzed and shown to be equivalent to some nonblind Bayesian and “natural gradient” methods, widely used for sparse estimation. Thus, the novel method can be considered a blind Bayesian method, which is not available in the literature, and whose perturbation analysis is performed. Simulation results illustrate that the novel semiblind estimators perform much better than existing blind/training-based sparse methods (even including the popular compressed sensing and Bayesian methods), when few training subcarriers are available (which may occur in futuristic, pilot-starved massive MIMO-OFDM systems), at much reduced complexity.},

Therefore, it is essential to consider a more suitable methodology of voltage regulation for the consumers placed at the end of the feeder when the network is predominantly resistive. With this background, this article investigates the capability of dynamic PEV load transfer within the three phases of a distribution network to propose a new hybrid PEV coordination approach. In addition to the online centralized battery charging and var discharging, this approach performs local voltage profiles improvement by switching PEV at selected single-phase residential houses such that a PEV can be switched from a heavily loaded phase to a (relatively) lightly loaded phase. This results in better voltage regulations and VU reductions.

To support massive number of users, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising solution to achieve increased number of connections and higher spectral gains as compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). However, studies show that weak users (WU) and strong users (SU) served using NOMA (referred as NOMA-group) experience different throughputs. In a NOMA group, an SU achieves higher throughput than a WU. Further, as the number of users in a NOMA group increases, due to superposition of signal of multiple users in NOMA, the intra-group interference dominates, thereby reducing throughput of the WUs. This article proposes novel time slotting (TS) techniques that aims at user fairness amongst the users by increasing the throughput of WUs, especially when the number of users increases in a NOMA group. The power allocation coefficients and the time slot duration for the proposed TS techniques are optimized to satisfy the minimum throughput of each user in a NOMA group while maximizing the throughput of WUs. The fairness between the users is measured by calculating both quality of service fairness and quality of experience fairness experienced by the user. It is observed that the proposed TS technique improves the fairness measures significantly. Furthermore, energy efficiency (EE) is also calculated for the TS techniques using the optimized power allocation coefficients and time duration. The numerical results suggest improvement in the EE of the system along with enhancing user fairness amongst the users.},

  abstract     = {With the substantial growth in vehicle population, the road safety problems, such as congestions and accidents, have become serious. To improve driving safety, efficient and rapid road safety data retrieval becomes a significant measure. As a new type of network, the named data networking (NDN) can effectively improve the data retrieval efficiency. Therefore, NDN might help improve the road safety data retrieval efficiency if it is introduced to the vehicular network, namely vehicular NDN. However, in the vehicular network, each vehicle works as a content router and high mobility of vehicles leads to frequent changes in network topology, which makes it hard to maintain forwarding information and achieve aggregation. Moreover, a large number of vehicles are involved in reverse paths, which leads to frequent reverse path disruptions and even data retrieval failures. To reduce the data retrieval latency and cost and improve the success rate, we propose an efficient road safety data retrieval approach that achieves push-based and pull-based data retrieval. In the approach, a forwarding network is constructed to improve the network stability. Based on the forwarding network, only a small number of vehicles are involved in pushing data, and consumers employ aggregation to pull data without depending on forwarding information. Moreover, the disrupted reverse paths can be effectively repaired to guarantee the successful receipt of data. Finally, this method is evaluated, and the experimental results show that it achieves the aforementioned objectives.},

The stochastic output of wind turbines makes the optimization problem more challenging. Using the probabilistic methods for such analyses proves efficient to yield more reliable results. The data clustering-based Monte Carlo simulation is used to bunch the output powers of wind farm into clusters. The network loss and voltage profile are then evaluated to achieve the optimal candidate bus for the placement of WF with the optimal number of turbines. To accelerate the procedure, a technical constraint is used so as to eliminate the nonimportant samples in WF size evaluation, which results in a reduction in computational burden. In addition, two methods for load flow calculations are investigated, namely the direct load flow and indirect backward/forward sweep load flow methods to evaluate the time burden of load flow method on the proposed problem. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustated by conducting case studies.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an uplink hybrid multiple access scheme (HMAS) in order to support a highly overloaded multiuser system. In HMAS, for a fixed K-orthogonal resources, there are K-near users (NUs) adopting orthogonal frequency division multiple access and J &gt; K far users (FUs) adopting sparse code multiple access for uplink transmission. To improve the performance of HMAS, we propose two deep learning-based detectors via deep neural network (DNN) models, one for NUs symbol detection, and the other for FUs symbol detection. Both DNN models are trained offline via simulated data and-then-applied for online symbol detection. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of HMAS in terms of symbol error rate performance over Rayleigh fading channels. In particular, it shows that the HMAS with DNN-based detections outperforms significantly the one using conventional message passing algorithm and successive interference cancellation-based detection.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a risk-constrained stochastic framework is presented for joint energy and reserve scheduling of a resilient microgrid considering demand side management. The optimization problem is formulated to schedule the system operation in both normal and islanding modes by addressing the prevailing uncertainties of islanding duration as well as prediction errors of loads, renewable power generation, and electricity price. In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator&#39;s profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode, which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a security-constrained power flow method by considering system&#39;s objectives and constraints. Moreover, to properly handle the uncertainties of the problem, conditional value-at-risk metric is incorporated with the optimization model to control the risk of profit variability. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test microgrid and various case studies are presented to verify its effectiveness in normal and resiliency operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Dual-function radar-communications (DFRC) system has been recognized as a promising solution to alleviate the radio frequency spectrum congestion and the shortage of spectrum resources. In this article, we address the problem of designing the joint subcarrier selection and power allocation scheme to minimize the power consumption of a DFRC system, under a general scenario in which the DFRC system is capable of performing a primary radar purpose and a secondary communications purpose in the meantime. In particular, the key mechanism is to minimize the total radiated power of the multicarrier DFRC system by jointly selecting the best possible subcarriers for radar and communications purposes in sequence and allocating the optimal power resource on the corresponding subcarriers, under the constraints of a predefined mutual information for target characterization and a desired communications data rate for information transmission. The resulting problem is formulated as a two-variable nonconvex optimization problem, one for subcarrier selection and the other for power allocation. Then, after convex relaxation reformulation and problem partition, an efficient three-step solution technique is developed for the joint optimization scheme, which combines the cyclic minimization algorithm and Karush-Kuhn-Tuckers optimality conditions. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical findings and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization scheme.},

New solutions that do not require complex calculations, such as identity-based cryptography, attract great attention from researchers. To meet these demands, we design a new authentication architecture for MEC environment, which provides secure and efficient communication. Based on this authentication architecture, an anonymous identity-based scheme is proposed for lightweight devices. In the meantime, user anonymity is also fully protected. The proposed scheme is proved to be secure under a specific security model. In addition, we describe the security properties our scheme meets.

In this method, when the operating point (OP) leaves the normal operation state, the proposed SPS is initiated to execute the required corrective remedial actions to bring the OP back to a normal state and maintain bus voltages above prespecified thresholds. Considering the local nature of Volt/Var control and in order to execute fast remedial actions, in this approach, the required generation rescheduling or load shedding procedures were selected based on the electrical distance concept. This allows for remedial actions with the highest impact on volt/var control. In addition, in generation rescheduling procedures, the proposed method uses the ability of utility-scale photovoltaic resources, which can change their generation quickly. This plays a major role in maintaining stability of power systems. Efficiency of the proposed algorithm was validated through several scenarios performed in IEEE 39-bus, Nordic32, and PST 16 test systems using DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. Results of these dynamic simulations and their comparison with some previously published methods show the effectiveness of this method in timely executing appropriate remedial actions to maintain system stability.},

In addition to the power system aspects, the proposed resilience framework employs the type and severity of natural disasters to achieve realistic results. To model the impact of multiple-microgrids, at first, the discrete-time multistate transition model of the power system under an extreme event is obtained. Then the probability of system states (normal, microgrid, and emergency) is calculated using the time-independent transition matrix and according to the time-homogeneous Markov chain.

In this article, a novel modulation parameter estimation method of LFM interference is proposed for the DSSS communication system in alpha-stable noise. To accurately estimate the modulation parameters, the alpha-stable noise should be eliminated first. Thus, we formulate a new generalized extended linear chirplet transform to suppress the alpha-stable noise, for a robust time-frequency, transformation of LFM interference is realized. Then, using the Radon transform, the maximum value after transformation and the chirp rate according to the angle related to the maximum value are estimated. In addition, a generalized Fourier transform is introduced to estimate the initial frequency of the LFM interference. For the performance analysis, the Cramér-Rao lower bounds of the estimated chirp rate and the initial frequency of the LFM interference in the presence of alpha-stable noise are derived. Moreover, the asymptotic properties of the modulation parameter estimator are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed parameter estimation method significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in a low SNR regime.},

In order to get authenticated from servers, the users must disclose their secret information to the server such as password and username so that they can access distinct applications on the Web. Due to distinct security attacks, such secret credentials should be discouraged from being revealed. Moreover, it is vibrant to secure the systems from known attacks. In contrast to all known security attacks, the insider attack is considered devastating because the privileged insiders of a system can violate the secret credentials, which may lead towards irrecoverable damage to both the system and the user. Therefore, to ensure the security of the system from insider attacks, different protocols have been proposed. Very recently, Rajamanickam et al. “Insider attack protection: Lightweight password-based authentication techniques using ECC,” presented novel authentication scheme for insider attack protection. They claimed that their protocol not only prevents insider attack but it is also immune to several known security attacks. This comment discloses the non-trivial weaknesses in the authentication phase between client and server. We have identified that the adversary can successfully impersonate the entities communicating with each other through this protocol. Moreover, their protocol fails to offer forward and backward secrecy. Consequently, we suggest possible solution for attack resilience.},

First, the network environment of a WBAN changes rapidly due to changes in human body movements, which leads to unguaranteed service quality, delivery probability, and delay. Second, energy is limited due to the small size of the sensors. To solve these problems, in this article, we first propose an optimization method for the sampling start time of sensor nodes. We comprehensively consider sampling rate, sampling time, transmission rate and other factors and set the appropriate sampling start time for the nodes through quantitative analysis of the relationship between these factors, which greatly reduces the waiting time delay of the nodes. Furthermore, an optimization method for the data frame length is proposed, where the relationship between the optimal data frame length and the average delivery probability is given quantitatively by considering the channel model. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme, relative to the compared schemes, achieves substantial improvements in QoS and energy efficiency and has more obvious advantages when the channel conditions of the nodes are worse.},

  abstract     = {Message authentication and conditional privacy preservation are two critical security issues in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which have been extensively studied in recent years. To achieve these security issues, many information security technologies have been proposed so far. Among them, pseudonyms-based and group-based messages signing and verifying are two of the main methods adopted in recently published literature. However, analysis points out that both of the two technologies have their downsides. To address these issues, a secure and efficient message authentication protocol (SEMA) is proposed in this article, which aims to achieve mutual authentication among vehicles and road-side units (RSUs) in VANETs by combining the advantages of pseudonyms-based and group-based methods. Security analysis shows that SEMA is robust to various security attacks. Performance evaluation demonstrates that SEMA is computationally lightweight on both vehicles and RSUs. Finally, simulations are performed to prove the feasibility in highway and urban environment.},

  abstract     = {Advanced cyber attackers can penetrate enterprise networks and steal critical documents containing intellectual property despite all access control measures. Cyber deception is one of many solutions to protect critical documents after an attacker penetrates the network. It requires the generation and deployment of decoys such as fake text. The comprehensibility of a fake text document can affect the required time and effort for an attack to succeed. However, existing cybersecurity research has given limited attention to exploring the comprehensibility features of text for fake document generation. This article presents a novel method to generate believable fake text documents by measuring and manipulating the comprehensibility of legit text within a genetic algorithm (GA) framework. For measuring text comprehensibility, we adopt a set of quantitative measures based on qualitative principles of psycholinguistics and reading comprehension: connectivity, dispersion, and sequentiality. Our user-study analysis indicates that the quantitative comprehensibility measures can approximate the degree of human effort required to comprehend a fake text document in contrast to a legit text. For manipulating text comprehensibility, we develop a multiobjective, multimutation GA that modifies a legit document to Pareto-optimally alter its comprehensibility measures and generate hard-to-comprehend, believable fake documents. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates fake documents for a broader class of legit documents with varied text characteristics when compared to baselines from previous research. Hence, the application of our method can help improve cyber deception systems by providing more believable yet hard-to-comprehend fake documents to mislead cyber attackers.},

According to the method, all parameters are designed in a fully distributed fashion, which does not depend on any centers or leaders. To further achieve decentralization and to meet the flexible requirement of DGs, the strategy is adaptable to time-varying communication topologies (time-varying digraphs) and is proved to be convergent. During the communication process, the stochastic noise is introduced to imitate a nonideal communication environment, and the convergence rate is accelerated via coupling designed gains of noise and feedback (mismatch). Meanwhile, the cost of reactive power generation and reactive power compensation are considered for a comprehensive optimization, which guarantees the locally reactive power balance and reduces the cost. Simulations based on a test microgrid are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the dynamic characteristics and robustness are evaluated and compared by numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {A modular reconfigurable robot (MRR) is considered as a system of systems; that is, a robot control system consists of modular systems. For an MRR, onboard tracking of multiple objects is one of the most challenging tasks. This is because the task requires lots of computation resources, but an MRR system is constrained by several physical limitations. To enhance the computing performance of an MRR control system, a novel approach to organizing a distributed computing system is proposed. The key components of the proposed approach are FPGA-based specialized computational cores (SCCs). An SCC for tracking objects is designed to utilize spare resources of the MRR module&#39;s control devices. Analysis and experiments on a real testbench are performed to illustrate that the proposed approach can enhance overall computing performance of an MRR control system without adding additional components. As such, weight and dimensional parameters are saved; unnecessary power consumption and heat generation are reduced. One experimental example shows that the proposed SCC enables a Kalman filter to track objects up to 100 times faster than a comparable solution implemented with microcontrollers, while the whole distributed computing system can outperform a similar one built on high-performance CPUs.},

This article proposes a means of analyzing the quantitative reliability of the satellite communication network systems. First, we identify the four major factors that affect the quality of network services: the OBP states, uplink channels, downlink channels, and uplink packet collision losses. Based on these four factors, a Markov model is derived to analyze the probability distributions of various network states. Analytic results show the network reliability with respect to the OBP structures and space radiation environments. The relationship between network reliability and throughput according to the packet traffic load is also quantitatively analyzed. Finally, based on the developed model, a method is suggested for iteratively updating the reliability distribution of network systems affected by changes in the four factors as well as network access time changes. The numerical results show an indication of the satellite network reliability to provide references whether adjusted elements of the four factors are eligible to sustain reliable end-to-end services.},

This QoSC-RA scheme can not only divide radar sensors into several groups to illuminate multiple targets separately but also optimize the transmit resource of the radar sensors in different groups. In such a case, we can minimize the total resource consumption of a radar sensor network while achieving the desired MTT accuracy. The QoSC-RA scheme is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem and is shown to possess two sets of conflict constraints (the QoS constraints and the resource constraints). When the problem is feasible, we analyze its optimality based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and subsequently design appropriate solution methods to solve it efficiently. When the problem is infeasible, we relax it as a feasible one by enlarging its feasible domain and use a gradient projection method to achieve a compromise solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the QoSC-RA process can achieve predetermined MTT performance with smaller resource consumption than the uniform allocation scheme.},

Obviously, the players&#39; costs are considered as private and sensitive and the training status are also sensitive. Therefore, the private information might be revealed in the process of data sharing and processing in this distributed manner. Considering the privacy-revealing issues in the above-mentioned scenario, this article proposes a privacy-preserving optimization for distributed fractional knapsack (PPO-DFK) problem, in which it achieves the secure footballer configurations, i.e., it is able to win the game but the sum of cost does not exceed the budget, without revealing either the expenditure/money owned by the club boss or the players&#39; training status owned by the team coach. In the proposed PPO-DFK scheme, it employs a novel transformation approach (TA), a secure comparison protocol and a secure sorting protocol as the building blocks to ensure the privacy protection of distributed optimization procedure, then it uses the greedy algorithm to find an efficient solution. The security of proposed PPO-DFK scheme is strictly analyzed and its effectiveness is demonstrated by the experimental results on concrete examples.},

This article develops and analyzes a novel family of multistep PF solution techniques. The introduced solution paradigm just involves an LU decomposition along with other cheap computations each iteration. In addition, it is proved that its convergence order is equal to the number of steps considered. A comparison with other high-order PF techniques available in the literature reveals that the introduced paradigm is more efficient when more than three steps are taken. Hence, two PF methods with fourth and fifth convergence rate are developed and validated in 12 systems under different demand conditions. Results prove that the developed PF solution methods are able to notably outperform NR and the other high-order PF solvers proposed in the literature.},

However, data transmission through vulnerable channels poses security threats such as man-in-the-middle, playback, impersonation, and asynchronization attacks. To address these threats, we define an explicit security model that can precisely measure the practical capabilities of an adversary. A systematic methodology consisting of 16 evaluation criteria is used for comparative evaluation, thereby leading other approaches to be evaluated through a common scale. Finally, we propose a dynamic reciprocal authentication protocol to secure data transmission in mobile cloud computing (MCC). In particular, our proposed protocol develops a secure reciprocal authentication method, which is free of Diffie-Hellman limitations, and has immunity against basic or sophisticated known attacks. The protocol utilizes multifactor authentication of usernames, passwords, and a one-time password (OTP). The OTP is automatically generated and regularly updated for every connection. The proposed protocol is implemented and tested using Java to demonstrate its efficiency in authenticating communications and securing data transmitted in the MCC environment. Results of the evaluation process indicate that compared with the existing works, the proposed protocol possesses obvious capabilities in security and in communication and computation costs.},

Specifically, we focus on the joint impact of nonideal oscillators and nonlinear high-power amplifiers, which can be quantified in terms of multiplicative and additive nonlinear distortions as well as phase noise, which causes inter-channel interference (ICI). We first derive the signal-to-distortion-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SDINR) and then utilize the SDINR to derive the closed-form expressions for symbol-error-rate and the average capacity of the aforementioned system. Our analysis shows that the statistics of an additive nonlinear distortion and additive white Gaussian noise are not affected by phase noise. However, the phase noise itself significantly deteriorates the performance of the MU-MIMO-OFDM system even in the absence of the nonlinear distortions. We further show that nonlinear distortion and ICI cause an irreducible error floor which considerably degrades the system error performance and also adversely affects the total capacity of the MU-MIMO-OFDM system. Comparisons are drawn between the performance of an ideal MU-MIMO-OFDM system and a MU-MIMO-OFDM system in presence of above impairments. In the end, we present the simulation results to validate the efficacy of our theoretical analysis.},

Based on this structure, the WPP can determine the optimal buying reserve from DRAs to offset part of wind power deviation. The proposed framework is formulated as a bilevel stochastic model in which the upper level maximizes the WPP&#39;s profit based on the optimal bidding in the day-ahead and balancing markets, whereas the lower level minimizes DRAs&#39; costs. In order to incorporate the risk associated with the WPP&#39;s decisions and to assess the effect of scheduling reserves on the profit variability, conditional value at risk is employed.},

  abstract     = {The “defocused transmit-focused receive” (DTFR) mode in the distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar network is very effective in multitarget tracking. In this mode, a completely defocused beam is transmitted and a focused receive beam is synthesized so that the MIMO radar is capable of tracking targets independently. A joint target assignment and power allocation (TAPA) strategy is developed for multiple distributed MIMO radar networks in cluttered environment using the DTFR mode. Our aim is to achieve the better system tracking accuracy under the constraints of receive beam direction capability and power budget. We derive the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) and adopt it as the objective function, since it quantifies the precision of target state estimates. It is shown that the TAPA problem is a mixed integer programming and NP-hard problem, where two involved parameters, i.e., the target-radar assignment and power allocation, are both coupled in the objective and in the constraints. By introducing an intermediate variable, we propose an efficient two-step-based solution for solving this problem. The simulation results show the superior performance and adaptivity compared with existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Accommodating a high penetration of intermittent photovoltaic (PV) in distribution systems can potentially cause several operational problems, most importantly, voltage violations. An optimal probabilistic approach is proposed in this article to optimally host high penetrations of PV units considering their stochastic nature. A benefit of the proposed approach is that it provides wider planning options since it optimizes the interfacing inverter oversize with smart watt-var functionalities. These smart functionalities include: 1) active power curtailment and 2) inverter reactive power. The utilization of these functionalities in the optimization model yields an optimal PV hosting that maximizes the benefits to distribution systems. The optimal probabilistic model of PV incorporates the probabilities of the PV power output and load while optimizing the inverter oversize and the two functionalities simultaneously. The proposed approach complies with the recently released IEEE 1547:2018 standard which regulates the reactive power support via the interfacing PV inverters. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparisons with existing approaches. The results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach to optimally accommodate high PV penetration at single or multiple locations while minimizing voltage violations. The proposed approach is also applied to maximize the hosting capacity of PV.},

In this environment, on the one hand, the electricity price has a significant influence on the federations formed, and, thus, on the profit earned by the cloud providers, and on the other hand, the cloud cooperation has an inevitable impact on the performance of the smart grid. In this regard, the interaction between independent cloud providers and the smart grid is modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg game interleaved with a coalitional game in this article. In this game, in the first stage the smart grid, as a leader chooses a proper electricity pricing mechanism to maximize its own profit. In the second stage, cloud providers cooperatively manage their workload to minimize their electricity costs. Given the dynamic of cloud providers in the federation formation process, an optimization model based on a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) has been used by the smart grid to achieve the optimal policy. Numerical results show that the proposed solution yields around 28\% and 29\% profit improvement on average for the smart grid, and the cloud providers, respectively, compared to the noncooperative scheme.},

  abstract     = {In the future, electric vehicles (EVs) are anticipated to dominate the urban transportation sector. To lessen the operational risk of existing distribution networks due to massive deployment of EVs, optimal planning and operation are vital as EVs elevate new charging demand. This article conducts a comprehensive study on the feasibility of integrating EVs into the existing distribution system, considering both slow and fast charging schemes. The problem is formulated as an objective function that minimizes the total price of charging incurred by the charging stations and the peak-to-average ratio. To diminish the negative impact of EVs on the node voltage in the distribution system, EVs are also modeled as a reactive power compensating device. Simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network and an in-depth study is presented on the maximum feasible EV penetration to the existing system without augmentation. The problem is solved using a novel metaheuristic optimization called the water cycle algorithm. The proposed charging/discharging strategy works well and results in the housing of higher penetration of EVs in the distribution network along with a reduction in the charging price. Moreover, with the proposed coordinated strategy, the node voltage variation is found within the permissible limits.},

This article designs a novel two-stage approach to minimize hurricane impact on distribution networks by automatic system operation. A dynamic hurricane model is developed, which has a variational wind intensity and moving path. The article then presents a two-stage resilience enhancement scheme that considers predisaster strengthening and postcatastrophe system reconfiguration. The pre-disaster stage evaluates load importance by an improved PageRank algorithm to help deploy the strengthening scheme precisely. Then, a combined soft open point and networked microgrid strategy is applied to enhance system resilience. Load curtailment is quantified considering both power unbalancing and the impact of line overloading. To promote computational efficiency, particle swarm optimization is applied to solve the designed model. A 33-bus electricity system is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results clearly illustrate that the impact of hurricanes on load curtailment, which can be significantly reduced by appropriate network reconfiguration strategies. This model provides system operators a powerful tool to enhance the resilience of distribution systems against extreme hurricane events, reducing load curtailment.},

Existing studies on this issue usually utilize the static road network, which implies the spatial features, whereas the temporal characteristics of the dynamic urban traffic have not been explored in depth. In this article, we propose a spatio-temporal reachable area calculation scheme, named STRC, based on a tremendous amount of vehicle trajectory data. In STRC, the objective trajectory fragments are extracted according to the starting node and the query time period, and then mapped to reachable nodes to reduce the computational complexity. From those reachable road segments having reachable nodes on, a boundary segment is selected in each sector area by using the arrival-based one segment policy for time-sensitive applications or the arrival-and-distance-based k-segment policy for distance-related applications. The experiments based on large-scale trajectory data from 34 040 taxis in Beijing for one month show that STRC outputs more accurate reachable area, which covers the trajectory points with much smaller area, than compared schemes.},

The interference from the primary data transmission can increase the amount of harvested energy at SS and SR. After harvesting and accumulating energy for a number of successive time blocks, the CR will be performed in two continuous time blocks. In CR-Block-One, SS will transmit the secondary data to SR by exhausting its available energy. In CR-Block-Two, SR will forward the secondary data to SD if it has correctly decoded the data from SS; otherwise, it will stay silent. We properly model the energy accumulation process of SS and SR by defining a group of discrete energy levels. We analyze the approximate throughputs of both systems by considering various transmit powers of SS and SR. The optimal number of time blocks used for the wireless power transfer is determined through maximizing the secondary throughput while slightly degrading the primary performance. Numerical results show that the secondary data transmission can be well accommodated.},

As Big data is massive, it needs an effective security framework with energy-efficient computing environment. Signcryption technique combines both encryption and signature to present an efficient solution. To address threats to data security, chosen cipher security and chosen message security are two important attributes. This means that it is very important to design an efficient framework where we can address these issues. This article introduces an identity-based signcryption technique by combining encryption as well as signature, which provides a solution for secure and authenticated communication in the Big data environment, called SFEEC (security framework for energy-efficient computing). SFEEC fulfills the requirements of less computation and communication overheads by offering pairing-free computation at the user end.

To solve these problems, a wireless charging electric tram system has been developed to replace the overhead lines, catenary, and pantograph. With wireless charging segments installed underground, a tram can operate freely without any support from overhead lines. In order to successfully commercialize a wireless charging tram system, it is essential to minimize the energy cost of the wireless charging tram system. In this article, a model of a wireless charging electric tram system and an energy cost minimization algorithm are proposed. The Manchester Metrolink tram network is modeled using the Google Maps API, the Google Transit API, and the Metrolink API to simulate the wireless charging system under massive public transportation network. To determine the minimum energy cost, an energy cost minimization algorithm for the wireless charging tram system is proposed based on decentralized multiagent reinforcement learning with feedback.

Formal security verification under the random oracle model, which uncovers the proposed protocol&#39;s capability to resist the critical attacks is given. Moreover, simulation study for security verification is performed using the broadly accepted “automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications,” which indicates that the protocol is safe. Moreover, the detailed comparative study with related protocols demonstrates that it provides better security and improves the computational and communication efficiency.},

  abstract     = {AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs) represent a promising architecture that allows the hosting of a mix of ac/dc energy resources and ac/dc loads. Despite their potential, when islanded, HMGs impose operational challenges among of which are precise and stable power sharing, frequency restoration, and voltage regulation. Imprecise power sharing can result in some distributed generators (DGs) being overloaded, while others being underloaded. This article proposes an optimal-power-flow-based optimal power sharing (OPS) scheme to optimize the droop characteristics of DGs and interlinking converters for global power sharing in a multi-DG HMG regardless of DG location and type. The optimized droop parameters might jeopardize the microgrid stability. Thus, the proposed OPS scheme preserves stable power sharing through stability-constrained optimization of the droop characteristics. In addition to DG overloading because of unequal power sharing, voltage-sensitive loads could possibly suffer from voltage deviations because of drooping the voltage with the load increase. The proposed OPS strategy enjoys the ability to regulate the ac/dc voltage within a desired range and restore the nominal frequency. Steady-state and time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed sharing scheme in achieving the underlying objectives. Test results also prove the capability of the OPS scheme in zonal power sharing in the case of a distribution grid with multizone ac/dc microgrids.},

  abstract     = {Industry 4.0 is a concept aimed at achieving the integration of physical parts of the manufacturing process (i.e., complex machinery, various devices, and sensors) and cyber parts (i.e., advanced software) via networks and driven by Industry 4.0 technology categories used for prediction, control, maintenance, and integration of manufacturing processes. Industry 4.0, which is expected to have a great impact on manufacturing systems in the future, is attracting attention in both industry and academia. Although academic research on Industry 4.0 is growing exponentially, evidence of Industry 4.0 implementation in practice is still scarce. Moreover, the challenges industry faces when implementing the Industry 4.0 concept seem to be even less addressed. At the start of the present survey, a preliminary literature review identified a lack of comprehensive analysis of the Industry 4.0 implementation challenges. Thus, the purpose of the present article is to provide an overview of the reported Industry 4.0 implementation challenges in the relevant literature by conducting a systematic literature review. Specifically, while the present study differentiates between managerial and technological Industry 4.0 implementation challenges, the focus of the present article is on the managerial Industry 4.0 implementation challenges. This overview is performed by deriving an inductively coded Industry 4.0 technology framework that classifies Industry 4.0 technologies into ten categories: cyber physical systems, Internet of Things, big data analytics, cloud computing, fog and edge computing, augmented and virtual reality, robotics, cyber security, semantic web technologies, and additive manufacturing. The present article identifies, codes, and defines the managerial Industry 4.0 implementation challenges and derives opportunities for overcoming them.},

Since in the considered system, called generalized CIM-SM (GCIM-SM), incoming information bits determine modulated symbols, activated transmit antenna indices as well as their corresponding spreading code indices, data bits are conveyed not only by modulated symbols but also by the indices of the active antenna and spreading codes. Hence, a GCIM-SM scheme accommodates faster data rates while spending less transmission power and possessing better error performance compared to the conventional direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS), SM, quadrature SM (QSM), and CIM-SS systems. The mathematical expressions of the GCIM-SM system for bit error rate, throughput, energy efficiency, and the system complexity are derived to analyze the overall system performance. Besides, it has been shown via computer simulations that the GCIM-SM system has lower transmission energy, faster data transmission rate, and better error performance than DS-SS, SM, QSM, and CIM-SS systems. Performance analysis of the considered system was performed on Rayleigh block-fading channels for quadrature amplitude modulation technique.},

  abstract     = {The power consumed by the Internet has been growing sharply in recent years, which accounts for a considerable proportion of the overall power consumption. To reduce high power consumption in the network, numerous proposals on power saving are proposed. Unfortunately, most of them have some side effects, such as load imbalance and even link congestion. Power saving and load balance are two conflicting optimization objectives, and the optimization solutions of them cannot be achieved at the same time. To achieve the desired tradeoff between power saving and load balance, in this article, based on software-defined networking, we first propose a Power-efficient and Load-balanced Online Flow Route framework. Then, we formulate the optimization problem of jointly taking power saving and load balance into account. After proving the problem is NP-hard, we propose the power-efficient and load-balanced flow scheduling algorithm to address it. In addition, we propose a route updating algorithm to enable path updating caused by flow scheduling. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmarks on power saving, load balance, and reduces the possibility of link congestion.},

To satisfy the low latency, the short packet length is exploited and accordingly, the achievable rate under the finite block-length codes is considered in the analysis of the packet loss probability in downlink URLLC distributed antenna system. Specifically, the packet loss probability is approximated as a sum of the channel OP and the finite blocklength coding error probability. By using a stochastic geometry approach, we analytically derive the packet loss probability in terms of the system parameters (i.e., the densities of the DA ports and the receiving sensor nodes, the number of receive antennas, and the packet size/duration, etc.), when the sensor nodes and the DA ports are randomly distributed in a given area. From the analytic results, we show how to optimize the short blocklength coding error probability to minimize the overall packet loss probability. Furthermore, we also derive the required DA port density to satisfy the packet loss probability constraint for a given distributed antenna system parameters, which gives us a useful insight into the design of downlink distributed antenna system for URLLC.},

Within the Department of Defense (DoD), the effects of these decisions are evident in the long life span of systems like the B-52 bomber. Are there attributes of systems that make them more prone to lifecycle extensions? If so, can we calculate the real age of an engineered system to provide insight into the retirement decision? This article draws inspiration from the literature on aging of biological systems, software systems, and the medical field to understand the aging process and identify ways to slow or reverse aging. The systems engineering ilities provide the basis for developing a mathematical representation for real system age. The real system age is a factor of the number of changes to a system and changes to the interoperability, robustness, and versatility of a system. When combined in a mathematical equation, these factors produce a logical output and demonstrate how changes, internal and environmental, affect the age of a system. Future work could explore the theoretical real system age as it applies to DoD systems to determine if it can improve the retirement decision.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a downlink transmission in a multiuser massive multi-input-multi-output (massive-MIMO) system in both the large-scale and small-scale fading environments. While the base station has many antennas, the associated circuit costs require some antennas to be turned off, thus necessitating antenna/RF-chain selection. Furthermore, the users have quality-of-service (QoS) constraints and cannot be served within the specified power budget and also with arbitrarily low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios. Instead, the base stations seek to schedule only a subset of users for which the QoS-constraints can be met, while the remaining users must be scheduled in other time-frequency slots. The problem is considered under both long and short time-scales. The longer time-scale problem entails solving for the power, user allocation, and number of active antennas to be used over multiple coherence intervals. While the need to select the optimum set of users makes the problem combinatorial, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed that allows us to solve it in polynomial time. For the more computationally intensive per-coherence interval problem, we employ a convex relaxation-based approach in order to obtain an approximate solution. Detailed simulations are carried out to establish that the proposed algorithms outperform standard greedy approaches and are close to optimal for several settings.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an analytical approach based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for nodal pricing in distribution networks containing private distributed generation (DG). An appropriate nodal pricing policy can direct active distribution network (ADN) to optimal operation mode with minimum loss. However, there are several crucial challenges in nodal pricing model such as: equitable loss allocation between DGs, obtain minimum merchandising surplus (MS), and equitable distribution of remuneration between DGs, which is difficult to achieve these goals simultaneously. However, in the proposed method, the issue was embedded in the form of the EKF updates. The measurement update reduces the MS, and in the time update, DG&#39;s nodal prices as state variables are modified based on their contribution to the loss reduction. Therefore, all aspects of the problem are considered and modeled simultaneously, which will prepare a realistic state estimation tool for distribution companies in the next step of operation. The proposed method also has the ability to determine the nodal prices for distribution network buses in a wide range of power supply point prices (PSP), which other methods have been failed, especially at very low or high PSP prices. Eventually, using the new method will move system towards to the minimum possible losses with the equitable condition. The application of the proposed nodal pricing method is illustrated on 17-bus radial distribution test systems, and the results are compared with other methods.},

Second, to approximate the unknown inputs and disturbances such as changes in the controlled output voltages of BILPCs, an adaptive high-gain proportional-integral observer is designed for BILPCs. Based on a linear quadratic regulation approach, the high gains of this observer change dynamically during the approximation process, to achieve the best result.

The problem is more challenging than the conventional patrolling problem because the Euclidean traveling salesmen problem (ETSP) solution provides poor estimates of the actual travel time and vehicle location in this case. An algorithm called the pulley algorithm (PA) is developed to convert the ETSP optimal solution to a kinematically feasible optimal Dubins path that can be tracked by Dubins&#39; vehicles. The PA guarantees that its corresponding optimal path is suitable for patrolling, i.e., for repetitive tracks among the way points. In addition, an upper bound for the PA is presented to show the difference between it and the ETSP optimal solution. This article also introduces enhancements to some of the existing algorithms in the literature in terms of the solution approach.

  abstract     = {The motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is in charge of the real vehicle motion feeling regeneration for the driver of the simulation-based motion platform (SBMP) with respect to its limitations. The model predictive control (MPC) has been newly employed in developing MCAs to calculate the optimal input signals for delivering the best motion feeling to the SBMP&#39;s drivers while respecting the boundaries of the platform. The stability of the MCA based on MPC has become one of the main issues for some scenarios, such as an urban driving scenario, which involves sudden decelerations/accelerations (stop and start moving), sharp and large turn, and slalom movement. The urban driving scenario destabilizes the current MCA based on MPC and leads the undesired motion fluctuations, which create an unpleasant motion artifact for the SBMP drivers. Therefore, the displacement of the SBMP should be penalized conservatively to respect the workspace boundaries for all driving scenarios. This will make the motion conservative and can cause some motion-feeling error. In this article, the concept of terminal conditions (weights and states) are employed for the first time to design and develop a new generation of MCA based on MPC to enhance the performance of the model for different scenarios, such as the heavy-traffic scenario in the urban areas. Also, the stability of the MPC by considering the terminal conditions is investigated in the MCA domain. Then, the MCA based on MPC by considering terminal conditions is developed using the MATLAB software with a presentation of the urban motion scenario. The outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed model with a common MCA based on MPC without the consideration of the terminal conditions.},

  abstract     = {In research, process descriptions provide causal mechanisms and context as a basis for establishing phenomena and enabling reproducibility and generalization, and are therefore considered essential to scientific progress. Process descriptions are a principle form of describing systems. However, process descriptions are typically unstructured and complex, presenting challenges with respect to the assessment of their quality, and eventually to their usability. Inspired by modern systems engineering approaches, we propose a model-based analysis approach to analyze complex process descriptions, and consequently improve the communicability and the applicability of said processes. We apply the approach to real-life case studies, and detail its contribution. Finally, we discuss how using the model-based approach can promote the quality of research-related process descriptions, specifically for supporting evaluation of research publications as well as for describing processes by the researchers themselves.},

  abstract     = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in a blockchain framework has revealed an imminent potential to complement the conventional trading mechanisms. To that end, this article proposes a new framework for the economic consortium of energy storage systems. A new formulation is presented that would create operational and economic feasibility areas for choosing feasible bids traded in a blockchain framework. The former indicates the area in which the request for the energy trade is within the operational/physical limitations of the energy trader, while the latter is related to the area where the operation of the trader is economically profitable. Although the formulation provided for the feasibility areas is generic and can be utilized as a tool in various P2P applications, it is tailored in this article for energy storage scheduling. Using the proposed formulation for feasibility areas, the concept of feasibility area estimator is presented. The estimator is, then, integrated with the optimal scheduling model in order to capture operationally and economically viable bids traded in a blockchain system. Through numerical results, the efficacy and validity of the proposed model in this article are evaluated. It is demonstrated that different characteristics can be created for filtering the feasible bids to be utilized for storage scheduling. It is also shown that storage can effectively respond to and operate based on such feasible bids. Storage can exploit the arbitrage opportunities and trade energy with other peers to maximize its revenue.},

Due to 2-D spectral peak searching, the computational complexity of the existing 2-D DOA estimation methods based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is too high. Motivated by this, we propose a novel low-complexity 2-D DOA estimation method based on MUSIC, where the 2-D spectral peak searching is converted to 1-D searching by constructing a transform domain. Moreover, the proposed method makes full use of the received signals to calculate the noise subspace, which can take advantages of the large array aperture and mutual information of the UCLsA and, significantly, improve the estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed method achieves similar performance to the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB); 2) the proposed method outperforms the existing 2-D DOA estimation algorithms; and 3) the implementation cost of the proposed method is lower than those of the existing methods.},

However, traditional multidimensional data aggregation schemes depend on the trusted authority and cannot resist the coalition attack from the gateway (GW) and the control center (CC), which may cause the users&#39; fears about privacy violations. Therefore, this article proposes a privacy-preserving multidimensional data aggregation scheme without trusted authority in smart grid based on the ElGamal homomorphic cryptosystem with distributed decryption, which can resist the coalition attack from the GW and the CC. What is more, the proposed scheme does not depend on the trusted authority which is not fully trusted in the real world. The detailed security analysis indicates that our scheme can satisfy the security requirement of smart grid. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves the lowest computation and communication costs in data encryption phase and data aggregation phase, thus it is appropriate for many practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) is being pursued in recent times as a suitable wireless transmission technology for use in high-mobility scenarios. In this article, we propose nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based OTFS which may be called NOMA-OTFS system and evaluate its performance from a system-level and link-level perspective. The challenge lies in the fact that while OTFS transmission technology is known for its resilience to high-mobility conditions, while NOMA is known to yield high spectral efficiency (SE) in low-mobility scenarios in comparison to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). We present a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-successive interference cancellation based receiver for NOMA-OTFS, for which we derive expression for symbol-wise postprocessing SINR in order to evaluate system sum SE. We develop power allocation schemes to maximize the sum SE in the high-mobility version of NOMA. We further design a realizable codeword-level SIC (CWIC) receiver using low-density parity check (LDPC) codes along with MMSE equalization for evaluating link-level performance of such practical NOMA-OTFS system. The system-level and link-level performance of the proposed NOMA-OTFS system are compared against benchmark OMA-OTFS, OMA-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OMA-OFDM) and NOMA-OFDM schemes. From system-level performance evaluation, we observe interestingly that NOMA-OTFS provides higher system sum SE than OMA-OTFS. When compared to NOMA-OFDM, we find that outage SE of NOMA-OTFS is improved at the cost of decrease in mean SE. The link-level results additionally show that the developed CWIC-based NOMA-OTFS receiver performs significantly better than NOMA-OFDM in terms of block error rate, goodput, and throughout.},

Although traditional encryption schemes could solve some problems, data owners (DOs) might lose the access control over the data, which is important in some specific application scenarios, such as the smart medical cloud system. In order to address these problems, some ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) schemes have been proposed to protect the privacy and security of data; but these schemes still have the following defects: 1) most of the existing hidden policy CP-ABE schemes only enable restricted access structure, such as “AND” gate; 2) several schemes supporting flexible access control are inefficient in decryption, because most of them are constructed in the composite order bilinear group; and 3) many of the proposed schemes fail to check the correctness of decryption message. In this article, we construct a “test-decrypt-verify” CP-ABE scheme based on prime order bilinear group to solve the above-mentioned problems. The proposed scheme supports secure outsourcing decryption, because the return value is an intermediate value unrelated to the encapsulation value of message encrypted by the DO.},

We adopt a distributionally robust chance constraint (DRCC)-based approach, where the DRCC holds (with high probability) as long as the true distribution of uncertainty belongs to a distribution family or the ambiguity set (constructed based on the known information). We approximate the DRCC with the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraint, which bounds the expected constraint violation with respect to all distributions in the ambiguity set. The worst-case CVaR problem is known to be computationally tractable under linear decision rules (LDRs). To improve the performance of LDRs, we propose to apply the segregated linear decision rules (SLDRs) on dynamical control systems with the worst-case CVaR approximation. To deal with the tractability issue of the worst-case CVaR constraint, we construct a special group of segregation (of the random disturbance) that is shown to be without loss of optimality. The proposed segregation method enables us to establish the equivalence between the stochastic control problem (with worst-case CVaR constraints and under SLDRs) and a tractable semidefinite program.},

Although the renewable power plants are considered as flexible tools, they are somehow uncertain by themselves. In this article, the uncertainty of power generation of renewable resources has been resolved by incorporating the DR programs and PEVs. A stochastic decision making model for the coordinated operation of renewable resources and some virtual power generation is presented to solve a risk-constrained optimal bidding strategy for a smart grid. The participation of DR and PEV aggregators in the day-ahead market is considered. The uncertainty in day-ahead prices associated with renewable power generation is discussed throughout this article. As a well-known measure, the conditional value at risk is employed in the model to cope with all aforementioned uncertainties.

We aim to find the optimal resource leasing scheme for a VMO in order to maximize utility within the uncertainties of harvested energy, request arrivals, and resource prices. We first formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, during which the VMOs compete with each other for the radio resources by dynamically announcing their resource requirements to the MNO. We, then, employ a deep Q-learning algorithm so the VMO can find the optimal solution by interacting with the environment. With this algorithm, artificial neural networks are used to approximate the Q-value function, which can work effectively with large state and action spaces. We further employ the idea of transfer learning, which exploits the strategies learned in historical periods to speed up the learning process of the target task. Finally, we present comprehensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under various configurations.},

  abstract     = {Spherical wavefront and array nonstationarity due to physically large antenna array are two typical characteristics specific to massive multiple-input-multiple-output (M-MIMO) propagation. Unfortunately, traditional MIMO channel models need to be enhanced to better characterize these two new propagation features. In light of this limitation, this article proposes an enhanced two-dimensional geometry-based stochastic channel model for 5G M-MIMO communications in real propagation environments. Specifically, a coordinate-based channel model framework is first introduced. Based on this, the impact of spherical wavefront can be mathematically described with the aid of some spatial geometric manipulations. Moreover, a general Markov process is developed to model the array nonstationarity characteristic due to cluster appearance and disappearance along the array. Meanwhile, the associated approach to derive the state transition probabilities of the proposed Markov process is detailed. Finally, capabilities of the proposed channel model in characterizing spherical wavefront and array nonstationarity of M-MIMO channels are shown by the numerical simulations. Moreover, validity of our proposal is verified by the measurement data.},

The nonlinear fluctuations of output power due to unpredictable variation of wind speed and the different operating modes of the UPFC greatly affect the performance of the conventional distance relaying-based TL protection scheme. This article investigates the impact of such TLs on distance relay performance and proposes a two criteria-based new fault detection and classification scheme. The method utilizes the sign of the change in the magnitude of positive-sequence current at both ends of the line for fault detection and the transient monitor index derived from the locally measured three-phase current for fault classification. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated on different fault and nonfault transients generated on two standard test systems through EMTDC/PSCAD during different operating modes of UPFC and at different wind speed. The performance of the proposed scheme is further validated through dSPACE DS 1103-based real-time digital simulation platform. Finally, the comparative assessment results with some important existing methods justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, due to limited hardware capabilities of such small devices, the IoT networks are inherently vulnerable to security attacks. In this context, the analog cooperative beamforming (ACB)-based physical layer security (PLS) technique can be a suitable solution to guarantee security in the IoT networks by creating a virtual antenna array with multiple IoT devices. Nevertheless, such techniques suffer from poor secrecy performance, when an eavesdropper is located within the main beam toward the legitimate receiver. Motivated by this limitation, in this article, we propose a fully distributed null-steering beamformer, which is suitable for IoT networks following decentralized architecture. Through analysis and simulation, we show that the proposed PLS algorithm outperforms the existing ACB-based PLS scheme. Furthermore, we show that there exists an optimal degree of nulling that maximizes the secrecy performance, which can be estimated based on the analytical results.},

  abstract     = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a cellular IoT communication technology standardized by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for supporting massive machine type communication and its deployment can be realized by a simple firmware upgrade on existing long term evolution (LTE) networks. The NB-IoT requirements in terms of energy efficiency, achievable rates, latency, extended coverage, make the resource allocation, in a limited bandwidth, even a more challenging problem w.r.t. to legacy LTE. The allocation, done with subcarrier (SC) granularity in NB-IoT, should maintain adequate performance for the devices while keeping the power consumption as low as possible. Nevertheless, the optimal solution of the resource allocation problem is typically unfeasible since nonconvex, NP-hard and combinatorial because of the use of binary variables. In this article, after the formulation of the optimization problem, we study the resource allocation approach for NB-IoT networks aiming to analyze the tradeoff between rate and latency. The proposed suboptimal algorithm allocates radio resource (i.e., SCs) and transmission power to the NB-IoT devices for the uplink transmission and the performance is compared in terms of latency, rate, and power. By comparing the proposed allocation to a conventional round robin (RR) and to a brute-force approach, we can observe the advantages of the formulated allocation problem and the limited loss of the suboptimal solution. The proposed algorithm outperforms the RR by a factor 2 in terms of spectral efficiency and, moreover, the study includes techniques that reduce the dropped packets from 29\% to 1.6\%.},

This article proposes an enhanced grey wolf algorithm (EGWA) for allocating the distributed generation units (DGUs) which is coordinated with the capacitor banks (CBs) and the voltage regulators (VRs) to achieve the target. Diversified tasks aim at minimizing the investment expenses of the coordinated equipment, and maximizing the benefits resulted from power losses reduction and the purchased power from the grid. In the technical direction, it is investigated through ameliorating the voltage profile and the loading capacity. Also, the loading variations are incorporated via light, shoulder, and peak levels of demand. A dynamic adaptation mechanism is used for updating the control parameters of the GWA. The proposed EGWA is employed for solving the optimal allocation problem (OAP) for two Egyptian distribution systems. Simulation results declare the proposed EGWA capability for solving the coordinated allocation of CBs, DGUs, and VRs. Great reduction of power losses is achieved with high improvement of the minimum voltage and loading capacity. Also, a comparative and statistical analysis is executed for the application of the proposed EGWA with different optimization techniques, which derives superior capabilities of the proposed EGWA over the others in the literature.},

In order to meet these challenges, we propose an efficient certificateless aggregate signature scheme with conditional privacy preservation in this article. Our scheme utilizes the technique of full aggregation to reduce the bandwidth resources and computing overhead. Besides, the conditional privacy preservation in IoV system is realized by using pseudonym mechanism. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure against the Type-I and Type-II adversaries in the random oracle under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. In addition, the proposed scheme is compared with related works from aspects of computation cost, communication efficiency, and security requirements. The comparison results show that the proposed scheme is efficient, and it is suitable for resource-constrained environments.},

Degeneracy for INC is defined as the structural multiplicity of possible options available within the network to perform the same function with a given macroscopic property (e.g., delay). Two degenerate structures can partially overlap. Redundancy, on the other hand, does not allow overlapping between the functional graphs. We present an efficient algorithm to determine all these multiple options and compute both degeneracy and redundancy. Our results show that by exploiting the set of possible degenerate alternatives, we can significantly improve the successful computation rate of a symmetric function, while still being able to satisfy requirements such as delay or energy consumption.},

In this article, intelligent algorithms are introduced in a distributed fashion, which encapsulates cooperation and competition to coordinate the overall goal of the cellular system with individual goals of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. First, the utility function of the cell and IoT users are designed, respectively. For the former, an incentive mechanism is constructed, where a novel deep actor-critic learning algorithm is developed with a prioritized queue for continuous action space in the differentiated decision-making procedure. For the latter, the energy model is taken into account. Furthermore, the coalition game combined with deep Q-learning framework is explored so as to model and incentivize the cooperation and competition process. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies demonstrate that the improved algorithms perform better than the original version, and they can converge to a Nash-stable optimal or asymptotically optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {Recent increase in the number of natural disasters resulting in widespread, long-duration, and costly outages have brought the energy system resilience to the forefront. As system owners and operators seek to improve the system resilience, they often find it challenging to assess the costs and benefits of resilience investments. Costs are fairly well understood and measured, but benefits are less so. There are many resilience metrics that attempt to measure resilience benefit, but the existing methods for calculating metrics and incorporating value of resilience in energy decisions are not easily executed. To address this, we developed a method for modeling the value of resilience that is flexible and scalable across multiple types of models. This article describes a framework for incorporating duration-dependent customer damage functions (CDFs) into grid- and campus-scale planning and operations models. In two case studies, we consider how the duration-dependent value of resilience influences the investment and operation decisions. We find that in both cases, knowledge of the value of lost load provides opportunities to reduce the lifecycle cost of energy through adjusted investment or operational decisions. The primary contribution of this research is to integrate the duration-dependent value of resilience in energy decisions. This study will be useful to grid operators interested in reducing the value of customer losses during grid outages, as well as campus or site owners evaluating resilience investments.},

Herein, a secondary terrestrial user acts as a cooperative relay to assist the transmission of primary satellite user. In return for this kind of favor, the secondary user gets access to the primary&#39;s spectrum for its own communication. Further, we consider the distortion noises induced by all the hardware-impaired terrestrial nodes and demonstrate their detrimental impact on the system performance. We manifest analytically that, for the higher data rates, the HIs invoke ceiling effects which reprehensibly cap the fundamental capacity of the system. To mitigate the effect of HIs, we propose an adaptive relaying (AR) protocol for both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward operations and compare its performance with the competitive fixed relaying schemes. The proposed AR protocol efficiently utilizes the available degrees-of-freedom to enhance the system performance. We comprehensively analyze the overall system performance by deriving closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the primary and secondary networks under heterogeneous fading environments.

  abstract     = {We present an online expectation maximization (EM) based algorithm for the problem of model parameter estimation and hypothesis testing based on observations from a network of heterogeneous sensors. The sensors&#39; measurements are assumed to be correlated and copula theory is used to model this correlation. Moreover, it is assumed that the statistical model for the sensors&#39; data is not completely known. We first develop the batch-mode EM to estimate the parameters of the underlying distributions of the sensors&#39; measurements and to detect the hypothesis. Next, we develop an online EM-based method that processes the data on a sample-by-sample basis. Numerical results are presented for both simulation data and two different real-world datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method showing significant improvements for both parameter estimation and hypothesis testing compared to the method that ignores the correlation in sensors&#39; measurements. Hypothesis testing results from the real-world data are also compared with several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. It is shown that the proposed methods outperform the unsupervised and even some supervised methods.},

  abstract     = {Increasing penetration of uncertain and variable renewable generation in power system necessitates enhanced generation flexibility, to mitigate frequent system imbalances. Generation flexibility can be enhanced by market-based flexible ramp products (FRPs). FRPs facilitate generators up and down ramping support to the system. FRPs are available from conventional and wind generators. However, lower time frame of FRP markets and uncertain wind ramp availability weaken conventional and wind ramp products, respectively. This necessitates wider investigation of ramp availability from alternative sources like solar generation. Solar power providers (SPPs) can participate in FRP markets in addition to energy markets due to the coherency of system ramping requirements with solar generation. In this context, this article proposes a novel multi-interval solar flexible ramp product (SFRP) design. The proposed model uses Gumbel copula-based joint probability distribution of load and wind forecasting errors for FRP estimation. Max-stable property of Gumbel copula considers extreme forecasting errors, to avoid imbalances. The proposed SFRP design also considers both start and end time uncertainty of each interval, as compared to existing end time uncertainty-based renewable FRPs. Case studies indicate that the proposed SFRP design is beneficial to system and SPPs to reduce dispatch cost and increase profits, respectively.},

Manipulation and increasing market price decrease social welfare and then market efficiency. This article intends to provide independent system operators (ISOs) with a tool to analyze day-ahead market data so as to identify generator units who intend to exercise collusion and raise the market prices. Toward this goal, all possible collusion and competition scenarios are simulated and then the generated data are used to train a supervised learning algorithm. By applying the proposed approach to the IEEE 57 and 30 bus test systems, the efficiency of the proposed approach was assessed. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how colluding generators choose between maximizing their colluded profit and reducing the risk of being detected by ISO. The results show machine learning is capable of identifying colluding companies with accuracy of 95\%. Also, it was rightly obvious that the closer the bidding price of companies is to competitive level, the more downward the efficiency of the machine is.},

The objective of this article is to efficiently identify the failed sensors in a large-scale sensor network. The problem addressed is overcoming information constraints in identifying the location of a failed sensor using only local interactions between low-cost sensors and a network maintainer. The proposed method in this article allows the sensors to self-organize into a functional structure in which a supporting sensor set facilitates the autonomous maintainer (AM) to find the failed sensors. The supporting sensor set presents the failure information to the AM, which then rescales its search area for quick discovery of the failed sensor. Both a qualitative analysis and simulation evaluation are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that an appropriate presenting area of the failed sensor facilitates fast and localized discovery of failed sensors by the AM.},

In our system, the digital counterpart rendered with virtual reality technology is created and updated by the real environment information. A 3-D graphic model is reconstructed first using the geometric information of surroundings captured by the depth sensor. During interaction, a fast and efficient approach is proposed to generate the contact force and render the object deformation in the virtual environment. The virtual space also provides the sequential rule that is based on the danger field, which helps to constrain the operation of digital twin. At last, the experimental platform is established in which the virtual space is at an update rate of 100 Hz, while the automatic sorting task is performed and verified; the results show the effectiveness and applicability of the method to digital twin system.},

The smart home daily energy operation problem is formulated in the second stage with the help of multiobject home energy management (MOHEM). In the second-stage operation problem, the MOHEM is implemented with two different objective functions such as minimization of consumer&#39;s daily energy cost and maximization of consumer&#39;s total comfort level index. The particle swarm optimization algorithm and a mixed-integer linear programming technique are, respectively, used in this article to optimize the proposed two-stage optimization model. A typical smart home which consists of various controllable appliances is considered in this analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed two-stage optimization model. Three different case studies are considered in the simulation to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Collected IoT data are subjected to centralized computation, processing, and storage. Such centralization can be problematic, as it can be a single point of failure, mistrust, data manipulation and tampering, and privacy evasion. Blockchain can solve such serious problems by providing decentralized computation and storage for IoT data. Therefore, the integration IoT and blockchain technologies can become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized IoT-based e-healthcare systems. In this article, first, we give a brief background on blockchain. Second, popular consensus algorithms used in blockchain are discussed in the context of e-health. Third, blockchain platforms are reviewed for their appropriateness in IoT-based e-healthcare. Finally, few use cases are methodologically given to show how key features of the IoT and blockchain can be leveraged to support healthcare services and ecosystems.

Our results show that both our distributed and centralized solutions significantly reduce the signaling between core and RAN compared to the traditional approach based on geographical proximity.

The VLC technology is used as a primary technology and the RF technology is used when the primary technology cannot satisfy the imposed limit. In particular, a novel secure-link selection mechanism is proposed to select the secure technology (i.e., either VLC or RF technology) based on the availability or nonavailability of instantaneous channel state information of both legitimate and eavesdropping links. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of average secrecy capacity, connection outage probability, and secrecy outage probability.

  abstract     = {Motivated by enormous highway-lighting energy consumption, smart lighting development is crucial to better manage available resources. While existing literature focused on ensuring cost-effective lighting, an equally important requirement, namely the visual comfort of motorists, is almost disregarded. This article proposes a novel Internet of Things-enabled system that can be intelligently controlled according to the traffic demand. Cooperative relay-network architecture is the central element that leverages upon placement of cyber-enabled lampposts to allow for sensing-exchanging highway traffic information. Data accumulation is exploited to automate adaptive switching on/off the lighting and provide backtracking detection of faulty lampposts. From the service provider&#39;s perspective, we envision to deploy low-cost highly durable sensing and network components to significantly cut down the operating cost. From the road user&#39;s perspective, the relay-network is envisaged to provide seamless driving experience where sufficient lighting is always perceived along the road. A critical analysis quantitatively evaluates the seamless driving experience considering car arrival rate, outage probability, and device malfunction probability. A road occupancy-based cost estimation analysis demonstrates the effective cost reduction of the proposal compared to existing systems.

  abstract     = {Landing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on static or mobile platforms (such as an unmanned ground vehicle-UGV) is challenging since the UAV should hover exactly over the platform. This article presents a solution to this problem based on the virtual structure control paradigm. The problem is addressed as the control of a heterogeneous formation of a UGV and a UAV, with the UAV landing on or taking off from the UGV. The formation is characterized as a three-dimensional straight line linking the two vehicles, which start navigating cooperatively, keeping a desired formation shape (the desired straight line). Subsequently, the structure is changed to make the UAV hover above the UGV, to land on it. Then, the distance between the vehicles is gradually reduced to a suitable altitude, and the UAV drops on the UGV. The UAV can then takeoff, if required, either resuming the formation structure or flying independently of the UGV, and land back on the UGV after finishing the mission, if required. The stability of the control structure proposed to guide the vehicles during the cooperative navigation and landing is proven, based on the theory of Lyapunov, and its effectiveness is checked through experimental results.},

  abstract     = {Energy constraint is one of the main design issues of wireless sensor networks. Over the past few years, the concept of the wireless mobile charger (WMC) has been proposed in order to improve the energy efficiency of the networks. In such schemes, optimizing the moving trajectory and charging time of WMC are considered as two main problems. Several schemes attempt to optimize the moving trajectory of WMC without considering the balanced energy depletion time of nodes, which leads to degrading the energy efficiency and network lifetime. Thus, a route optimization of WMC algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal trajectory of WMC to move along sensor nodes in such a way that the balanced energy depletion time of the nodes is achieved. Moreover, in most of the existing schemes, WMCs charge the nodes as long as their batteries are fully charged. However, not considering the remaining lifetime of the other nodes leads to premature network death and decreases the network performance. Therefore, a charge time optimization of WMC algorithm is proposed to overcome the mentioned problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme remarkably enhance the network performance in terms of different evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Wireless ad hoc networks are widely useful in locations where the existing infrastructure is difficult to use, especially during the situations like flood, earthquakes, and other natural or man-made calamities. Lack of centralized management and absence of secure boundaries make these networks vulnerable to various types of attacks. Moreover, the mobile nodes used in these networks have limited computational capability, memory, and battery backup. Flooding-based denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which results in denial of sleep attack, targets the mobile node&#39;s constrained resources which results in excess consumption of battery backup. In SYN flooding-based DoS attack, the attacker sends a large number of spoofed SYN packets which not only overflow the target buffer but also creates network congestion. The present article is divided into three parts: 1) mathematical modeling for SYN traffic in the network using Bayesian inference; 2) proving the equivalence of Bayesian inference with exponential weighted moving average; and 3) developing an efficient algorithm for the detection of SYN flooding attack using Bayesian inference. Based on the comprehensive evaluation using mathematical modeling and simulation, the proposed method can successfully defend any type of flooding-based DoS attack in wireless ad hoc network with higher detection accuracy and extremely lower false detection rate.},

  abstract     = {Complex product manufacturing faces a great challenge in coordinating the supply of components. Manufacturers of complex products are highly sensitive to supply chain delays as insufficient delivery of any components would suspend the entire assembly line. This article focuses on the capacity planning decisions of the supplier and manufacturer for coordinating the component supply of complex product manufacturing. A system dynamics model is developed to capture the dynamic interaction of supplier&#39;s production capacity planning and manufacturer&#39;s component inventory expansion capacity planning. Based on simulation results and analysis, the following guidelines are proposed for making capacity planning policies: 1) Information sharing should be advanced to help the manufacturer and supplier make capacity planning policies; 2) With only limited information about supplier&#39;s production capacity, it may not be favorable for the manufacturer to coordinate component supply by acquiring replenishment from backup suppliers; and 3) With only limited information about manufacturer&#39;s component inventory expansion capacity, it is better for the supplier to keep a higher production capacity.},

  abstract     = {I am very pleased to announce that we have a new editorial structure for the journal, as I had noted in my column in our last issue in 2020. Consequently, since November 2020, seven experienced editors have joined the journal as Senior Editors in order to distribute the papers in their areas of expertise to Associate Editors, and monitor the review process in a more focused manner. Moving forward, authors can now consult a list of keywords representing the expertise of each Senior Editor at the time of submission in order to select the one whose expertise best aligns with their paper. I am grateful to these Senior Editors for their dedication to the IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL and for their commitment to elevate the journal&#39;s standing in the systems engineering community. This current issue spans diverse topics in complex systems and system-of-systems engineering, and, as always, it also includes many interdisciplinary papers. These topics include complex product manufacturing (as illustrated on the cover page), collaborative resource sharing, vehicular ad hoc networks, fault detection in different types of power grids, energy management in smart cities and smart distribution systems, road safety improvement, radar sensor networks, digital data markets, body area networks, and many others as well. There are also several papers on the application of machine learning to various types Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/JSYST.2021.3059465 of complex systems such as mobile networks, IoT-enabled systems, and wireless charging systems. I am certain that some of these articles will initiate further research in related topics, an established trend that we are now familiar with in the IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL.},
