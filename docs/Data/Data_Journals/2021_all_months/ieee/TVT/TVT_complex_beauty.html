  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) as a promising technique is able to address the privacy issues in machine learning. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless channel, one of the key challenges of FL is its vulnerability to wireless security threats. Thus, in this paper, we consider the model update security in FL. In particular, we propose to adopt a covert communication technique with which a friendly jammer transmits jamming signals to prevent a warden from detecting local model update transmissions of mobile devices in FL. The use of jamming signals reduces the transmission rate of the devices. Thus, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly determines the jamming power, local model transmission power, and local training accuracy to minimize the FL latency, given a security performance requirement. The problem is non-convex, and we propose an alternating descent algorithm to solve it. Extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and network performance improvement of the proposed algorithm.},

In such a network, a UAV transmits wireless power to a group of WSNs which exploits the harvested power to transfer their own information towards the UAV in the uplink. For practical scenarios, a nonlinear energy harvesting saturation model is considered at WSNs. We aim to design resource allocation which maximizes the achievable sum rate in the uplink and minimizes the downlink transmit power simultaneously. The design is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) which optimizes the UAV&#39;s 3D position, its transmit power, the time splitting ratio, the uplink transmission time and the beamwidth angle of the UAV. The formulated problem is a non-convex problem which is generally intractable. To address the MOOP, a weighted Tchebycheff method is proposed.

Subsequently, we derive closed-form expressions to characterize the UAV&#39;s optimal 3D location and its optimal transmit power, taking into account the impact of finite blocklength coding. Our numerical results show that the developed optimal design can achieve a better covertness performance compared with an optimal two-dimensional (2D) UAV deployment, especially when the warden is close to the receiver.

By jointly optimizing sub-carrier and power resource allocation, the proposed scheme can take full advantage of the channel capacity, and maximize the system performance while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of each user. Simulation results show that when compared with the joint resource allocation (JRA) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA), the FDRA algorithm can achieve the best performance on the complexity and the sum rate of the system.

Specifically, we optimize the transmit power and passive beamforming vectors at all the IRSs to obtain the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region in IFC, subject to the unit-modulus constraints for the passive beamforming vectors at the IRSs and transmit power budgets at the transmitters. To solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem efficiently, we resort to optimize each variable alternatively until convergence. The optimization of transmit power is based on a locally optimal fixed-point iteration method. Instead of using the conventional high-complexity and sub-optimal Gaussian randomization-aided semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique for the passive beamforming design, we first propose a novel locally optimal homotopy optimization based majorization-minimization method. To further reduce the computational complexity, a locally optimal log-sum-exp approximation based manifold optimization method is also proposed.

In this paper, we present a new metric for MPCs’ clustering in time-variant channels, which considers MPC’s evolution in time domain and clusters MPCs based on the fluctuation and multi-dimension distance of MPC’s trajectories. The performance of the new metric is verified by comparing measurements and simulations.

The main challenge in deploying UAV-BS lies in the fact that the limited battery in UAB-BS cannot support long-time reliable services. Therefore, a serving UAV-BS being running out its power needs to be replaced with a new fully-charged UAV-BS. This is called UAV-BS replacement process. However, most existing UAV-BS replacement methods ignore the link outage problem during the replacement. Thus the outage-free replacement problem (OFRP) for UAV-BSs arises. We provide a method to calculate the outage probability of the UAV replacement approach. We further formulate the Outage Probability Minimization Problem (OPMP) for UAV-BS replacement. To solve this problem, a 3-Dimensional Outage-Free Replacement Approach (3D-OFRA) is presented, which exploits different heights of swapping UAV-BSs during the replacement process. More importantly, we provide the guidelines of determining the distance between two UAV-BSs to minimize the link outage possibility during the UAV-BS replacement process. Our numerical results show that with the recommended distance between two UAV-BSs based on 3D-OFRA, the outage probability of the served UEs approaches to zero, compared with 40% of the traditional direct replacement approach.},

  abstract     = {Submarine pipelines are among the most efficient methods of marine oil transportation, and they are widely used in offshore oil exploitation. However, the complex environment of the ocean and malicious attackers may damage the pipeline. They can be efficiently monitored by deploying a multiplicity of sensor nodes, organized in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). UASNs is located near oil wells, so that UASNs can sense, broadcast, and receive data surveying the status of the submarine infrastructure timely. Inevitably, UASNs may experience security problems, owing to the open nature of the underwater environment. To address these security issues, this paper proposes a new source location privacy protection scheme based on an offshore oil acquisition platform. In the proposed scheme, the nodes are defined as pipeline and environment locations, and are allocated to different clusters. The concept of forming anonymous clusters by exchanging the identities of a source and a cluster head is introduced to determine fake confounding sources. In addition, a data fragmentation method is devised to reduce the energy consumption resulting from fake packet transmission. Particularly, we propose the deployment of disguised AUVs that collect data from fake sources, as to conceal and protect the location of the actual sources. Simulation results show that the safety time of the network is increased by about 6%. Due to the adoption of the data fragmentation method, the energy consumption of nodes is also decreased.},

In this paper, we study a mobile edge computing system consisting of a service platform, cloudlets joining the system, and mobile users. In this study, we focus on a profit-driven perspective such that the service platform purchases computation resource from the resource-rich cloudlets and makes profit by processing tasks from user side. The design objective is to maximize the platform profit subject to budget constraint and stringent delay requirements for task processing. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming problem. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we design a logic based Benders decomposition algorithm as the offline solution. We further study the scenario where the task arrivals from user side and resource availability at the cloudlets are both stochastic and unknown in advance. We accordingly propose a Multi-Armed Bandit learning based resource purchasing and greedy task scheduling algorithm for the online scenario. Simulations results show the high performance of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), computational intensive applications can be offloaded to the nearby edge servers to support latency-sensitive applications on mobile devices. Different from the cloud, edge servers usually have limited resources, and then selecting which edge server to run the offloaded computation becomes an important issue. Although server selection has received considerable attention, not much work has been done to consider the limited coverage of the edge server and the frequent user movement, which introduce many dynamic changing factors affecting the workload of the edge server and making it hard to achieve long-term optimum in the edge server selection. To deal with these challenges, we model the problem of continuous server selection as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The difficulty of this problem is that achieving long-term optimum requires future knowledge, such as user mobility, server workload, etc, which is not known a priori. We do not have such knowledge and thus cannot find the optimal policy through traditional methods. To address this problem, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based algorithm to learn the selection policy based on the observed performance of past server selections. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based neural network is exploited to encode the historical information which helps infer future knowledge of the dynamically changing factors. Then the DRL model selects the optimal server automatically based on the extracted system states. Extensive trace-driven evaluations demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based algorithm has the lowest overall cost compared to existing solutions.},

However, the complex road structures and increased vehicles cause traffic congestion and road safety, which eventually leads to horrible accidents. Cooperative driving of AVs, a groundbreaking initiative of vehicle platooning, epitomizes the next wave in vehicular technology through minimizing accident risks, transport times, costs, energy, and fuel consumption. However, the traditional machine learning-based platooning approaches fail to regulate the policy with the dynamic feature of AVs. This paper proposes a hybrid Deep Reinforcement learning and Genetic algorithm for Smart-Platooning (DRG-SP) the AVs. The leverage of the deep reinforcement learning mechanism addresses the computational complexity and accommodates the high dynamic platoon environments. Adopting the Genetic Algorithm in Deep Reinforcement learning overcomes the slow convergence problem and offers long-term performance. The simulation results reveal that the Smart-Platooning effectively forms and maintains the platoons by minimizing traffic congestion and fuel consumption.},

In vehicular visual 3D perception, camera position uncertainty can often degrade the perception and localization performance, and the information coupling and propagation among 3D points and cameras exist ubiquitously. However, these factors do not receive the deserving concern in previous algorithms which mainly focus on the consideration of efficiency. In this paper, we develop a statistical framework for visual 3D perception in vehicular networks from the perspective of information gains. Specifically, we first derive the influence of camera position uncertainty on perception and localization quality with geometric interpretations given by the information ellipsoid, and also present the perception loss caused by uncertainty in the camera deployment application. Then we determine the information coupling and propagation among 3D points and cameras in the vehicular network, propose the visual information graph to characterize the coupling, and derive the hierarchical structure in propagation. Moreover, we also propose the equivalent circuit for the quasi-tree network to interpret the hierarchical structure and derive the blocking and the end-link effects for network reduction. Our results provide guidelines for the development of efficient uncertainty- and coupling-aware visual 3D perception techniques in vehicular networks.},

This paper presents a novel radio map learning scheme for online learning a set of kernel density functions, which function like a traditional radio map in WiFi fingerprint-based localization systems. To be specific, each kernel density function corresponds to one specific access point (AP) and predicts the probability of having a received signal strength (RSS) measurement from this AP at any position. In the offline phase, a set of coarse-grained kernel density functions are initially established by the Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation (MKDE) through a fast site survey. In the online phase, these kernel density functions are recursively refined through Incremental-MKDE (IMKDE) using freshly crowdsourced fingerprints, which essentially fuses the historical features in the previous kernel density functions and up-to-date features in the current fingerprints. A compression technique is applied to improve the computation and storage efficiency. In addition, pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is leveraged to calibrate the location labels of crowdsourced fingerprints.

Recently, secure data dissemination schemes based on attribute-based encryption in VANETs have received considerable attention for their ability of fine-grained access control. Therefore, how to enforce accurate access policy in dynamic VANETs becomes significant yet very challenging. In order to achieve timely, flexible, and accurate data dissemination, we propose a policy enforcement framework for secure data dissemination, which enables data-sender vehicles with high mobility and RSUs with broad perception ability to co-design access control policy. Also, we design a policy combination method, which enforces an expressive access control policy based on the disjunctive norm form (DNF) formed by different attributes. Then we propose a policy conflict resolution based on confidence weights to deal with conflict policies. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is applicable and efficient for secure data dissemination in VANETs.},

These devices have finite computation resources and cannot handle the applications that require extensive computation with minimal delay.

The objective is to minimize the task duration by optimal allocation of the resources like local and edge computational capabilities, transmission power, and optimal task segmentation. For optimal allocation of resources, an algorithm name E stimation of O ptimal R esource A llocator (EORA) is designed to optimize the function by keeping track of statistics of each candidate of the population. Using EORA, a comparative analysis of the hybrid approach (partial offloading) and edge computation only is performed. Results reveal the fundamental trade-off between both of these models. Simultaneously, the impact of devices’ computational capability, data volume, and computational cycles requirement on task segmentation is analyzed.

  abstract     = {Currently, self-driving, emerging as a key automatic application, has brought a huge potential for the provision of in-vehicle services (e.g., automatic path planning) to mitigate urban traffic congestion and enhance travel safety. To provide high-quality vehicular services with stringent delay constraints, edge computing (EC) enables resource-hungry self-driving vehicles (SDVs) to offload computation-intensive tasks to the edge servers (ESs). In addition, caching highly reusable contents decreases the redundant transmission time and improves the quality of services (QoS) of SDVs, which is envisioned as a supplement to the computation offloading. However, the high mobility and time-varying requests of SDVs make it challenging to provide reliable offloading decisions while guaranteeing the resource utilization of content caching. To this end, in this paper we propose a co llaborative com p utation offlo a ding and c ont e nt caching method, named CoPace, by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in EC for self-driving system. Specifically, we first introduce OSTP to predict the future time-varying content popularity, taking into account the temporal-spatial attributes of requests. Moreover, a DRL-based algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the offloading and caching decisions, as well as the resource allocation (i.e., computing and communication resources) strategies. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets in Shanghai, China, are conducted to evaluate the performance, which demonstrates that CoPace is both effective and well-performed.},

  abstract     = {Due to the fact that most user equipments (UEs) do not have enough computation power, time-sensitive tasks should be offloaded to other computation resources. In such cases, a cloud is an ideal destination to which computation tasks can be offloaded because of its huge data processing power. However, the distance between a UE and the cloud may increase the latency of data transmission. At the same time, edges and vehicular-fogs (consisting of electric vehicles with computing resources) are closer to UEs and mostly remain under-utilized. To address this issue, a federated architecture with UEs, vehicular-fogs (parking lot fog and traffic intersection fog), edges, and cloud is proposed along with a probabilistic offloading strategy. The quality of service (QoS) violation probability can be minimized by finding the optimal offloading probabilities while satisfying the delay constraint through an optimal offloading probability estimation algorithm based on the subgradient method proposed in this paper. Our results show that the QoS violation probability and the average waiting time can be decreased by 10%-12% and 45%, respectively, for a federated architecture with two vehicular-fogs as compared to an architecture without any fogs. As offloading to edges and cloud has longer communication delays than offloading to vehicular-fogs, the offloading probabilities to the edges in the architecture with two vehicular-fogs in the case of heavy traffic are reduced by nearly 35% as compared to the architecture without any fogs.},

In device-to-device (D2D) enabled caching cellular networks with time-varying content popularity distribution and user terminal (UT) location, we model these dynamic networks as a stochastic game to design a cooperative cache placement policy. The cache placement reward of each UT is defined as the caching incentive minus the transmission power cost for content caching and sharing. We consider the long-term cache placement reward of all UTs in this stochastic game. In an effort to solve the stochastic game problem, we propose a multi-agent cooperative alternating Q-learning (CAQL) based cache placement algorithm. The caching control unit is defined to execute the proposed CAQL, in which, the cache placement policy of each UT is alternatively updated according to the stable policy of other UTs during the learning process, until the stable cache placement policy of all the UTs in the cell is obtained. We discuss the convergence and complexity of CAQL, which obtains the stable cache placement policy with low space complexity.

  abstract     = {Massive Machine-type Communications (mMTC) is one of the principal features of the 5th Generation and beyond (5G+) mobile network services. Due to sparse but synchronous MTC nature, a large number of devices tend to access a base station simultaneously for transmitting data, leading to congestion. To accommodate a large number of simultaneous arrivals in mMTC, efficient congestion control techniques like access class barring (ACB) are incorporated in LTE-A random access. ACB introduces access delay which may not be acceptable in delay-constrained scenarios, such as, eHealth, self-driven vehicles, and smart grid applications. In such scenarios, MTC devices may be forced to drop packets that exceed their delay budget, leading to a decreased system throughput. To this end, in this paper a novel delay-aware priority access classification (DPAC) based ACB is proposed, where the MTC devices having packets with lesser leftover delay budget are given higher priority in ACB. A reinforcement learning (RL) aided framework, called DPAC-RL, is also proposed for online learning of DPAC model parameters. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheme increases successful preamble transmissions by up to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$75 \%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; while ensuring that the access delay is well within the delay budget.},

However, the limited capacity of solar energy, VEC server&#39;s computing, and SBS&#39;s bandwidth resources may prohibit vehicle users (VUs) from offloading their vehicular applications to VEC server for better service quality. We address this challenge by dynamically determining vehicular task partitioning and offloading, VEC server&#39;s system configuration, and vehicular application level adjustment decisions. We aim at minimizing the end-to-end delay of vehicular applications while maximizing their application level performance (e.g., accuracy). We also implement an object detection vehicular application on an edge computing platform and measure the corresponding energy consumption, computation delay, and detection accuracy performance to establish empirical models for the SRSU-assisted VEC system. We then propose a dynamic programming-based heuristic algorithm which jointly makes the task partitioning and offloading, as well as system and application-level adaption decisions in real-time. We build a simulation framework with the above empirical models to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed approach can significantly reduce the end-to-end delay while maximizing the detection accuracy compared to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Multicasting does not work well for video applications such as video on demand, where individual users request video content at discrete and unpredictable moments. In this paper, we study a concurrent video multicast orchestration solution for the caching-assisted and centrally controlled mobile networks. The proposed solution strives to obtain rapid video prefetch and effective traffic reduction. By rapid video prefetch, user devices can cache required contents in advance, which can effectively improve the streaming fluency in unsteady wireless environments, especially the highly mobile vehicular environment. We introduce a maximum-rate concurrent multicast (MRCM) problem whose solution is intended to maximize the total video delivery rate by a concurrent multicast manner, and prove that the MRCM problem is NP-hard. Then, we propose a dynamic concurrent multicast tree construction algorithm and a global concurrent multicast tree optimization algorithm to approximately solve the MRCM problem in polynomial time. We also introduce a cache competition mechanism that strives to maximize the total cache hit rate when the cache space is insufficient. Performance evaluations show that compared with the existing cache-assisted multicast delivery solutions, the proposed solution significantly reduces the video delivery duration and the traffic stress of backhaul links.},

By utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers, we propose a joint RSUs selection and resource allocation (JRSRA) algorithm.

  abstract     = {Due to the dynamic nature of connectivity in terrestrial vehicular networks, it is of great benefit to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in these networks to act as relays. As a result, a remarkable number of studies have exploited UAVs to bridge the communication gaps between terrestrial vehicles, and sometimes despite their unoptimized mobility, their restricted communication coverage, and their limited energy resources. However, it was noted that for an intermittently connected vehicular network, UAVs could not cover all sparse areas all the time. Even worse, when deploying enough UAVs to cover all these areas, the probability of inter-UAV collisions increases, and it will be complex to control their movements efficiently. Consequently, it is required to dispatch an organized and intelligent group of UAVs to perform communication relays in the long term while keeping their connectivity, minimizing their average energy consumption, and providing an efficient coverage strategy. To meet these requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, called DISCOUNT (Dispatch of UAVs for Urban VANETs). Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. It has been shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms two commonly-used baseline techniques and some reinforcement learning methods in terms of energy consumption, coverage, and routing performances.},

In this paper, we consider the sum power minimization problem by jointly optimizing resource allocation, user association, and power control in an MEC system with multiple UAVs. Since the problem is nonconvex, we propose a centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to solve it. However, the centralized method ignores essential issues like distributed framework and privacy concern. We then propose a multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL) algorithm in a semi-distributed framework. Meanwhile, we introduce the Gaussian differentials to protect the privacy of all UEs.

These resource-demanding tasks can be transferred to another vehicular node with idle computing resources for processing. Due to high mobility and limited resources of vehicular nodes, it is challenging to execute lengthy computation-intensive tasks until completion within the delay constraint. There is a need to provide an efficient task offloading strategies to support these applications. In this paper, an efficient distributed task offloading scheme is proposed to select nearby vehicles with idle computing resources, to process the tasks in parallel by considering some vital metrics, including link reliability, distance, available computing resources, and relative velocity. In order to complete the lengthy computation-intensive tasks in vehicular edge computing networks, a task is divided into several subtasks before offloading. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in several VEC network conditions. Results show that the proposed computation task offloading scheme achieves better performance in latency, throughput, resource utilization and packet delivery ratio than the existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the massively growing applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and the new requirements of the six generation (6G) wireless network, the amount of terrestrial mobile devices (TMDs) and data traffic in wireless communications have increased explosively. Consequently, the integrated terrestrial-satellite relay networks (ITSRNs) have emerged to address the issue of the huge wireless traffic with limited allocated resources, which attracts extensive research attention to the field of IoT. Limited improvement of system throughput is realized by configuring terrestrial relays (TR) in the previous works. In this paper, by introducing an aerial relay (AR), we propose a novel structure of ITSRN and investigate the system throughput maximization and energy consumption minimization problems by jointly optimizing power allocation and AR altitude. Specifically, the system implementation includes two periods: satellite to relay (S-R) period and satellite to devices (S-D) period. To maximize the overall system throughput, we propose a joint optimization scheme of the power allocation and altitude of AR. Due to its non-convexity, a bilevel programming method is proposed to obtain the global optimal solution, where the closed-form expressions of power allocation and the optimal altitude of AR are derived. Subsequently, we investigate the energy consumption minimization problem during S-R period, which is formulated as a convex problem. We propose a low complexity algorithm and derive the optimal closed-form solution based on the rigorous mathematical analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and solutions are verified by extensive simulations.},

The AUV monitors a set of physical processes, where the status of each process can be sensed by one or more devices and each device is capable of sensing one or more processes. The AUV needs to maintain freshness of its information status about the monitored processes. To quantify the freshness of the information at the AUV, we consider the concept of the age of information (AoI), which represents the amount of time elapsed since the most recently delivered update information was generated. A framework is proposed to optimize the AUV&#39;s linear movement trajectory and scheduling of process status updates with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum of the average AoI of the monitored physical processes. The formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed integer problem, which cannot be solved by the standard optimization techniques. We develop a solution approach based on the technique of deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

Such a mechanism tightly integrates with the adjustment of computation capability and transmission power of MDs. Considering that the finally formulated problem is in a nonlinear and mixed-integer form, we design an effective algorithm to solve it. Specifically, by utilizing the powerful global searching capability of genetic algorithm (GA) and the accurate local searching capability of particle swarm optimization (PSO), the adaptive GA with diversity-guided is firstly used for coarse-grained search, and then adaptive PSO is utilized for fine-grained search. After that, some detailed analyses on the convergence, computation complexity and parallel implement are provided for algorithms. Simulation results show that the designed algorithm can achieve a lower network energy consumption than other offloading algorithms in general. At the same time, the numerical simulation also reveals that the designed algorithm may be more suitable for ultradense networks than existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) is deemed to be an essential service in 5G systems and beyond (also called 6G) to accommodate a wide range of emerging applications with stringent latency and reliability requirements. Coexistence of URLLC alongside other service categories calls for developing spectrally efficient multiplexing techniques. Specifically, coupling URLLC and conventional enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) through superposition/puncturing naturally arises as a promising option due to the tolerance of the latter in terms of latency and reliability. The idea here is to transmit URLLC packets (typically sporadic and of short size) over resources occupied by ongoing eMBB transmissions while minimizing the impact on the eMBB transmissions. In this paper, we propose a novel downlink URLLC-eMBB multiplexing technique that exploits possible similarities among URLLC and eMBB symbols, with the objective of reducing the size of the punctured eMBB symbols. We propose that the base station (BS) scans the eMBB traffic’ symbol sequences and punctures those that have the highest symbol similarity with that of the URLLC users to be served. As the eMBB and URLLC may use different constellation sizes, we introduce the concept of symbol region similarity to accommodate the different constellations. We assess the performance of the proposed scheme analytically, where we derive closed-form expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) of the eMBB and URLLC services. We also derive an expression for the eMBB loss function due to puncturing in terms of the eMBB SER. We demonstrate through numerical and simulation results the efficacy of the proposed scheme where we show that 1) the eMBB spectral efficiency is improved by puncturing fewer symbols, 2) the SER and reliability performance of eMBB are improved, and 3) the URLLC data is accommodated within the specified delay constraint while maintaining its reliability, 4) and the proposed strategy has linear time complexity making it an efficient solution to be used in practice.},

This paper presents a new Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based design of multi-hop multi-frequency mesh. A new lightweight hardware platform is developed to support adaptive routing and frequency selection, by modifying and integrating commercial-off-the-shelf WiFi modules. We also extend the celebrated Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm in support of the new multi-hop multi-frequency platform, where non-overlapping frequency bands are selected together with the routing paths by maintaining &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N^2$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; Dijkstra processes for &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; frequency bands.

  abstract     = {Ultra reliability and low latency communications (URLLC) are considered as one of the most important use cases for computation tasks in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) edge computing networks. To meet the task requirements in IoV networks, communication and computing resources are allocated in an effective and efficient way. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-objective reinforcement learning strategy, called intelligent communication and computation resource allocation (ICCRA), which combines communication and computing resource allocation to reduce the total system cost consisting of latency and reliability. Specifically, this strategy can be decomposed into three algorithms. The algorithm called joint computation offloading and collaboration is a general framework of the strategy, it first uses the K-nearest neighbor method to select offloading layers for computation tasks, such as cloud computing layer, mobile edge computing layer, and local computing layer. Then, when selecting the local computing layer to perform the task, the algorithm called collaborative vehicle selection is used to find the target vehicle to execute collaborative computing. The allocation of communication and computing resources is defined as two independent objectives, the algorithm called multi-objective resource allocation uses the reinforcement learning to achieve the optimal solution, at the mobile edge computing layer. Simulation results show that compared with local computing, edge computing, and random computing strategies, the proposed strategy reduces the total system cost effectively. For instance, compared with edge computing strategy, the total system cost of the proposed strategy can be reduced about 50% on average with the different number of vehicle tasks.},

  abstract     = {Spectrum efficiency is a critical performance metric in wireless communications due to an increasing demand for radio spectrum to support high data rate applications. Direct sequence spread spectrum technology enables a code division multiple access (CDMA) system a strong anti-interference capability but with a relatively low spectrum efficiency. To address this issue, complementary coded scrambling multiple access (CCSMA) (X. Liu et al ., in 2018) was proposed to use three-dimensional (space-time-frequency) resources for performance enhancement. However, in a CCSMA system, if the number of multipath returns is larger than the number of transmit (Tx) antennas, a code reuse problem occurs to degrade bit error rate performance significantly. This work designs a new scrambling code, namely generalized complementary coded scrambling multiple access (GCCSMA) codes, to overcome the code reuse problem in CCSMA. GCCSMA uses complementary codes, scrambling modulation, and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques jointly, which works well even in multipath channels with more paths than the number of Tx antennas. The analysis and simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GCCSMA system.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is considered as the key technology for 5G wireless communications networks. In the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands, directional beamforming is essential to the establishment of an efficient radio link for signal transmission. However, in wireless mobile environments, the effective beam direction is generally unavailable in the initial access phase. Hence, beam alignment (BA) is crucial for link establishment in initial access. In this work, we propose an efficient BA technique, referred to as the multi-modal pattern BA scheme, to improve the performance and efficiency of initial access in massive MIMO systems. Unlike the conventional sequential search scheme using single-modal patterns, the transmission of synchronization signals in the proposed scheme is based on the use of multi-modal patterns, each of which specifies multiple main lobes with distinguishable directions. Incomparison with the conventional scheme, our scheme can greatly enhance the achieved angular resolution after BA under the use of a fixed number of synchronization signals. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the established link is significantly improved. By contrast, if the same angular resolution is desired, the proposed scheme can greatly reduce the number of required synchronization signals to conserve the radio resources, including transmission power and bandwidth, and to decrease the searching delay in the BA procedure. In addition, considering multi-modal pattern construction for the transmission using a single radio-frequency (RF) chain, we propose an effective approach to generate the desired beamforming vectors fulfilling the essential constant amplitude constraint.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the three-dimensional (3D) path planning problem for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) taking into account the impact of 3D antenna radiation patterns. The cellular-connected UAV has a mission to travel from an initial location to a destination. In this process, there is a trade-off between the flight time and the expected communication outages duration, which requires planning a suitable route to avoid the weak coverage region. However, as the existing cellular networks are primarily designed for ground coverage, the communication coverage in the sky tends to be intermittent and irregular due to the potential for severe interference and obstructions (such by buildings), which brings great challenges to 3D path planning. To address this challenge, we first construct a 3D coverage map that stores the expected outage probability over each locations. We then propose a multi-step dueling DDQN (multi-step D3QN) based algorithm to design the local optimal UAV path by leveraging the constructed coverage map. In this algorithm, the UAV acts as the agent to learn the appropriate action to complete the flight mission. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for connectivity-aware UAV path planning and the superiority of 3D path design over its 2D counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Satellite high-mobility communications can provide global communication services for mobile terminals, which plays a vital role in today&#39;s world of wireless communications. Different from traditional terrestrial-satellite communications, high-mobility terminals impose more challenges on the direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signal acquisition in satellite communications. On the one hand, the spread spectrum sequence used in satellite communication systems is relatively long, which inevitably increases the computational complexity. On the other hand, high Doppler frequency offsets and time-varying Doppler rates caused by high-mobility terminals make satellite DSSS signal acquisition become the bottleneck. To solve such a problem in high-mobility satellite communications, we propose a new acquisition algorithm based on the new factor graph where time-varying Doppler rate is modeled by the random walk model, named the turbo iterative acquisition algorithm. It consists of the constraint-detection loop and the Doppler-estimation loop. By means of soft messages passed between these loops, the negative influence of time-varying Doppler frequency offsets can be eliminated effectively. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves acquisition performance more than 1.3 dB with low computational complexity, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of acquisition performance and complexity.},

Furthermore, to improve legitimate link&#39;s capacity, the partial relay selection (PRS) scheme is applied to choose the best relay. To evaluate the secrecy performance, we derive the closed-form expressions of the secure outage probability (SOP) of each user, the overall SOP and the sum effective secrecy throughput (EST) of the considered FD-NOMA relay system. We compare the SOP of the FD-NOMA relay system with that of the half-duplex (HD)-NOMA system and the SOPs of FD-NOMA relay system in the cases that PRS and multiple-relay (MR) schemes are employed at multiple relays. Monte-Carlo simulations verify the correctness of all derived mathematical expressions. Numerical results show that thanks to utilizing FD relays and PRS scheme, the considered FD-NOMA relay system has superior secrecy performance than other systems. Furthermore, increasing the number of FD relays, enhancing their self-interference cancellation capability, and selecting a suitable transmission power help to reduce the SOP of the considered FD-NOMA relay system. Meanwhile, the EST rapidly increases with the equivocation rate of the eavesdropping channel then gradually reaches the saturated maximum value.},

In order to satisfy the measurement matrix property to perform sparse signal reconstruction, a preprocessing approach of measurement matrix is proposed based on singular value decomposition (SVD), which theoretically guarantees the feasibility of utilizing CS based sparse signal detection method in indoor GSSK-VLC system. Then, by adopting classical orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm and compressed sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm, the GSSK signals are efficiently detected in the considered indoor GSSK-VLC system. Furthermore, a more efficient detection algorithm combined with OMP and maximum likelihood (ML) is also presented especially for SSK scenario. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sparsity aided detection algorithms in indoor GSSK-VLC system are verified by computer simulations. The results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve better bit error rate (BER) and lower computation complexity than ML based detection method. Specifically, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain as high as 12 dB is observed in the SSK scenario and about 5 dB in case of a GSSK scenario upon employing our proposed detection methods.},

  abstract     = {It is widely believed that the channel reciprocity holds in time division duplexing (TDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, so the uplink channel feedback is unnecessary. However, due to the constraint of transmission power and hardware complexity, users may use more receiving antennas than transmitting antennas in practical wireless communication systems. In this practical yet important scenario, only partial channel reciprocity holds, and thus channel feedback is still required in TDD massive MIMO systems. Unfortunately, this important topic has not been investigated in the literature. To fill in this gap, we propose an angle-domain support (ADS) based channel feedback scheme for TDD massive MIMO systems with unequal number of receiving and transmitting antennas. Firstly, by utilizing the angle-domain channel sparsity, we illustrate that a small number of elements in angle-domain channel, which are indexed by ADS, can capture the most power of the channel. Then, we propose the base station (BS) can obtain full downlink channel by decomposing the channel into two parts: the ADS and the low-dimensional angle-domain representation indexed by the ADS. At first, due to the partial channel reciprocity, the ADS is obtained by an angle-domain windows based support detection method at the BS without channel feedback. Then, the low-dimensional angle-domain representation indexed by the ADS is quantized and fed back to the BS. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve the near-optimal achievable sum-rate performance with low channel feedback overhead.},

We release an open implementation of the standard ECQV scheme to benchmark its execution time on automotive-grade boards. Moreover, we evaluate its performance in real road and traffic scenarios and show that compliance with strict latency requirements defined for C-ITS requires computational resources that are not met by many automotive-grade embedded hardware platforms.

To enable high-quality service point-to-point transmission through optical wireless communication, an efficient and reliable backhaul link is essential. Towards this objective, this paper proposes a novel optical backhauled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in VLC systems. Unlike earlier works, our model considers the effects of various transmission parameters in a mixed cooperative FSO/radio over a fiber backhaul link with NOMA-VLC to serve two users. The closed-form expressions of outage probability, sum throughput, ergodic sum capacity, and average bit error rate are delivered for a variety of channel conditions using Meijer&#39;s G and Gaussian hypergeometric functions. More specifically, both the theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the performance gain of the proposed optical-based NOMA systems can improve the performance of the users in comparison with the conventional OMA systems at medium to high SNR ranges. Furthermore, a deep learning-based framework is proposed to accurately estimate the ergodic capacity of the proposed system and significantly reduce the complexity cost of the theoretical analysis.},

We introduce the new idea of symbiotic modulation: the modulation constellation design allows a receiver to simultaneously detect the data transmitted in the RIS-assisted cellular link and the additional IoT data transmitted by the RIS. We propose three specific modulation schemes all having the feature of receive-antenna index modulation, and hence, called symbiotic spatial modulation (SSM). The first scheme is a coherent SSM scheme with a star-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) constellation. Its detection performance is analyzed using either an optimal maximum likelihood detector or a suboptimal successive greedy detector. We then extend the design to two noncoherent SSM schemes and analytically derive their detection performances as well. Simulation results corroborate the analysis and illustrate good detection performance of the proposed SSM schemes for both the cellular and IoT data transmissions in the considered SR system.},

  abstract     = {Secure message transmission in vehicular communications in smart cities is still a challenging task. Most of the related work employed the Public Key Infrastructure, Certification Revocation Lists (CRLs) for ensuring security, privacy. However, these work suffered from some issues such as: 1) the time-consuming checking process, huge size of CRLs, 2) traceability attacks by linking unencrypted Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), 3) extracting secret keys from the storage of parked vehicles or road-side units (RSU) by an adversary. To address the aforementioned issues, we thus propose a physically secure privacy-preserving message authentication protocol using Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), Secret Sharing. The proposed protocol guarantees security, privacy against passive, active attacks even under memory leakage. The entities (i.e., vehicles, RSU) make use of their PUF to reconstruct a secret polynomial-share so that pairwise temporal secret keys (PTKs) can be established with other entities. Unlike existing protocols, BSMs are also encrypted in our protocol (by PTKs) to provide a higher level of security, thwart vehicles traceability attacks. To revoke a vehicle, RSU needs not broadcast CRLs. Instead, RSU distributes only a secure offset key using threshold Secret Sharing. Consequently, our revocation checking process has computation complexity &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {O}(1)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . Our protocol also eliminates the need for a third party in Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication to ensure expeditious transmission. Security analysis, performance evaluation show that our proposed protocol outperforms existing schemes in terms of security features, computation, communication cost.},

  abstract     = {Air ground integrated mobile cloud computing (MCC) provides unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the capability to act as an aerial relay with more flexibility and resilience. In the cloud computing architecture, the data generated by ground users (GUs) can be offloaded to the remote server for fast processing. However, the heterogeneity of mobile tasks makes the data size distributed among GUs unbalanced. Besides, the energy efficiency of UAVs movement should be carefully considered for sustainable flight and obstacle avoidance. In general, such a joint trajectory issue can hardly be formulated as a convex optimization in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper proposes a potential game combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize multiple UAVs&#39; trajectory with the consideration of GUs&#39; offloading delay, energy efficiency as well as obstacle avoidance system. In specific, we first model the issue as a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINP), in which the service assignment between multi-user and multi-UAV is solved by potential game. The convergence to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) can be achieved by distributive service assignment update with infinite iteration. Then, we optimize the trajectory with obstacle avoidance at each UAV by MADDPG approach, which has a great advantage of centralized-training and decentralized-execution to reduce the global synchronized communication overhead. UAVs movement can be optimized in continuity rather than other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches generating discrete simple actions. Experiments demonstrate the proposed game-combined learning algorithm can minimize the offloading delay, enhance UAVs’ energy efficiency and avoid the obstacles at the same time.},

However, a random UC certainly results in a suboptimal solution while an exhaustive search method comes at the cost of high complexity, especially for systems of medium-to-large size. To address this problem, we develop two efficient unsupervised machine learning based UC algorithms, namely k-means++ and improved k-means++, to effectively cluster users into disjoint clusters in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) system. Adopting full-pilot zero-forcing at access points (APs) to comprehensively assess the system performance, we formulate the sum SE optimization problem taking into account power constraints at APs, necessary conditions for implementing successive interference cancellation, and required SE constraints at user equipments. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex, and thus, it is difficult to obtain the global optimal solution. Therefore, we develop a simple yet efficient iterative algorithm for its solution. In addition, the performance of collocated massive MIMO-NOMA (COmMIMO-NOMA) system is also characterized. Numerical results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed UC algorithms compared to baseline schemes. The effectiveness of applying NOMA in CFmMIMO and COmMIMO systems is also validated.},

Therefore, inspired by the benefits of interference cancellation (IC) and the unique characteristics of SM, an enhanced AMP (EAMP) detector is proposed for mitigating BER degradation without increasing the detection complexity. Finally, the classic expectation propagation (EP) is intrinsically amalgamated with our EAMP detector, leading to a novel EAMP-EP detector, which further reduces the detection complexity of the EAMP algorithm. The three detectors are compared both in terms of their coded and uncoded BER, as well as complexity.},

However, this method will not work without any knowledge about the pilot sequence and active eavesdropping can be detected by constructing random pilot sequence. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), with the real-time programmable features for wireless channels, provides new possibilities for effective pilot spoofing. In this paper, the IRS is deployed near the legitimate users and the legitimate signal can always be passively reflected. Then the control strategy is embedded into the communication process under time-division duplex mode to assist eavesdroppers to conduct pilot spoofing. By setting different phase shifts at the IRS during the uplink phase and downlink phase, the channel reciprocity disappears, and thus secure beamforming vector is biased towards the eavesdropper. Furthermore, in order to overhear more information, the average secrecy rate minimization problem based on statistical channel state information is established by carefully designing the phase shifts, which is non-trivial to solve. With alternating optimization and Charnes-Cooper transformation technique, the original problem is transformed into convex form and a near optimal solution is achieved. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed scheme can pose serious secure threat without any energy footprint. What&#39;s more, if the IRS is not utilized by the internal users properly, it will bring more threat.},

In this paper a small-batch verification and identification scheme is presented to speed up the signature verification and the invalid signature identification. In the proposed scheme, according to the signature number and the historical signature error rate, we first build an optimization model, which transforms the problem how to divide a batch of signatures into several appropriate small-batches into an integer programming problem, and then stores the optimal batch solution table in roadside units (RSUs). Moreover, in view of the current task, RSU can automatically divide a batch of signatures into several appropriate small-batches. After then, any invalid signature in these small-batches can be quickly identified by using of the exponentiation method. Finally, by comparison with the existing schemes, the total time delay is reduced to 50% in optimal circumstances. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve fast signature verification and invalid signature identification.},

Finally, in order to further decrease the computational complexity, we propose the third algorithm, where the channel estimation is split into two separate steps of tap detection and gain estimation. The proposed algorithms exploit the entire available training sequence to estimate all channel parameters, and can capture channel variations across the entire training frames without requiring a feedback channel. The Cramer-Rao lower bound and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms are also addressed. Intensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approaches, showing that they can significantly improve the mean squared error performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

To further improve the detection performance in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) and deep fading scenarios, we propose an improved label-assisted (ILA) method, which integrates the label-assisted (LA) information into the blind detection algorithm.

To maximize the minimum weighted rate among all users and ensure the base station (BS) transmit power and backhaul capacity constraints, we jointly optimize the dynamic BS clustering, message splitting, and beamforming vectors. More specifically, users requesting the same content are collected to a multicast group and served by a cluster of BSs. Each BS has limited storage space and connects to the central processor (CP) via a backhaul link. However, the resulting optimization problem is discrete and nonconvex and has a non-smooth objective function. To alleviate these problems, we construct two surrogates to approximate the objective function locally. These surrogates are strictly lower bounds and concave. Also, we build an upper-bound convex surrogate function to handle the backhaul cost constraint and derive a minorization-maximization (MM)-based iterative algorithm. Besides, we adopt a quadratic transform method to recast the achievable rate and binary BS selection problems to a more tractable form to reduce time cost. We transform the resulting problem into a two-tier alternating optimization problem; the outer-tier problem is handled with closed-form expressions while the inner-tier one is solved by a convex framework. We thus develop a quadratic transform-based alternating (QTA) algorithm. Extensive simulation results confirm the superiority of our proposed transmit strategy and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Coded Slotted ALOHA (CSA) is a random access scheme based on the application of packet erasure correcting codes to transmitted packets and the use of successive interference cancellation at the receiver. CSA has been widely studied and a common assumption is that interference cancellation can always be applied perfectly. In this paper, we study the design of CSA protocol, accounting for a non-zero probability of error due to imperfect interference cancellation (IC). A classical method to evaluate the performance of such protocols is density evolution, originating from coding theory, and that we adapt to our assumptions. Analyzing the convergence of density evolution in asymptotic conditions, we derive the optimal parameters of CSA, i.e., the set of code selection probabilities of users that maximizes the channel load. A new parameter is introduced to model the packet loss rate of the system, which is non-zero due to potential IC errors. Multi-packet reception (MPR) and the performance of 2-MPR are also studied. We investigate the trade-off between optimal load and packet loss rate, which sheds light on new optimal distributions that outperform known ones. Finally, we show that our asymptotic analytical results are consistent with simulations obtained on a finite number of slots.},

To prepare the background for MISO NOMA-based vehicular systems, we first derive the exact outage probability (OP), average bit error rate (ABER), and ergodic capacity (EC) expressions for the single-input-single-output (SISO) NOMA-based vehicular systems over independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.ni.d.) double Nakagami- m fading channels. Furthermore, we propose two transmit antenna selection schemes at multiple-antenna source vehicle for both far user and near user. Based on these antenna selection strategies, we derive the exact expressions for the OP, ABER, and EC, of the MISO NOMA-based vehicular systems over i.ni.d. double Nakagami- m fading channels. The derived ABER expressions for both SISO and MISO NOMA-enabled vehicular systems can be applicable for various modulation schemes. Moreover, to reveal better insights into the diversity orders of SISO and MISO NOMA-enabled vehicular systems, we present the asymptotic OP analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The numerical and simulation results corroborate our theoretical and analytical findings, and demonstrate the effects of transmit power, power allocation factor, fading severity parameters, and number of antennas, on the system&#39;s performance. We further compare the performance of both systems, and show that the multiple antennas can improve the performance of vehicular systems, which can be further improved significantly with the simultaneous improvement in fading severity parameters.},

Since each MTD has different data demands and the ultimate goal of communication is to provide personalized services for MTDs, we propose an air-ground collaborative deployment strategy focusing on optimizing users’ satisfaction. In the proposed strategy, the hierarchical game model is proposed. Specifically, the 3D position deployment of multiple UAVs is at the upper layer and the access UAV selection of ground MTDs is at the lower. Since there is no central controller and the users are autonomous, we structure a local interaction game to achieve global optimization for the network satisfaction problem. We design a hierarchical deployment access based log-linear learning (HDALL) algorithm to achieve the desirable solution. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of air-ground collaborative deployment strategy as well as HDALL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A novel low-profile wideband antenna is proposed with high-gain, high-isolated, and dual-polarized properties. It consists of two mutually-orthogonal bowtie-shaped dipole radiators, four rectangular parasitic elements, and a cylindrical artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) cavity. By introducing parasitic elements, additional resonance is generated, and the bandwidth is widened. The gain is mainly improved by the cylindrical metallic wall and wideband AMC of the cavity. The AMC operates in ±90 o reflection phase band-gap bandwidth of 2.35-4.25 GHz, and its equivalent circuit model is developed to understand the working mechanism. The orthogonal placement of two dipole radiators ensures polarization diversity and high isolation. The impacts of various environmental conditions on antenna performance are investigated. To verify the concept of design and demonstrate its excellent performance features, a prototype is fabricated and measured. The proposed wideband antenna has a height of 0.18 wavelength at the center frequency. The measured -10-dB impedance bandwidth is from 2.16 to 3.96 GHz, where the realized gain is 8.34-10.96 dBi and the radiation efficiency is more than 81.8%. High isolation of &gt; 28.65 dB and low envelop correlation coefficient (ECC) of &lt; 2.74 × 10 -3 are also achieved between antenna elements.

In this paper, we study the string stability of a one-vehicle look-ahead CACC platoon under different network loss scenarios, and propose to adapt the time headway parameter of the model according to a network reliability metric that we defined based on packet burst loss length to maximize traffic flow efficiency while maintaining a string-stable platoon.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an improved Quadrature Multi-carrier Differential Chaos Shift Keying (QMC-DCSK) based on Chaotic Shape-forming Filter (CSF) and Cross Correction (CC) is proposed. The chaotic signal generated by CSF is used as reference spreading sequence in QMC-DCSK. Quadrature multi-carriers are used to carry the reference and multiple information bearing signals simultaneously in order to improve the Bit Transmission Rate (BTR). By this way, the proposed system is able to transmit &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$2M-1$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; bits Traditional Data Stream (TDS) during one traditional DCSK bit duration, where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of carrier frequencies. Meanwhile, the reference signal transmits Additional Data Stream (ADS) encoded by CSF together with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$2M-1$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; identical or inverse data stream carried by the rest &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$2M-1$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; channels (information bearing signals). By this system configuration, the channel redundance can be used to improved bit error rate (BER) performance of ADS, after decoding TDS. In turn, the TDS reliability can also be improved by checking most ADS polarity of the corresponding carrier. This process is referred to as CC. The contribution of this work lies in the CC operation, by which the reliability of both TDS and ADS is improved significantly. It is the CSF and multi-carrier that make CC possible. The analytical BER is derived for the proposed method. The merits of the proposed system include, first, it improves the BTR as compared to that of QMC-DCSK, because ADS conveys more information bits; second, the ADS reliability is improved dramatically because the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\text{2}\,M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; duplication can be used to improve the signal to noise ratio; third, the TDS reliability is improved as well because the information bits conveyed by each carrier frequency is enhanced and corrected by the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\text{2}\,M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; repetitions. By this way, not only TDS and ADS are transmitted (i.e., the higher BTR is achieved), but also both reliability are improved (i.e. the lower BER is achieved). In order to testify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method, simulation and wireless open-access research platform (WARP) experiment are conducted. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method is superior to other comparison methods.},

Using the proposed DE framework, we formulate an optimisation problem to find the optimal AFC code parameters, including the weight-set, which minimises the bit error rate at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our results show the superiority of our AFC code design compared to existing designs of AFC in the literature and thus the validity of the proposed DE framework in the asymptotically long block length regime. We then focus on selecting the precoder to improve the performance of AFC at short block lengths. Simulation results show that lower precode rates obtain better realised rates over a wide SNR range for short information block lengths.

Spatial modulation (SM) is a scheme used in multi-antenna transmission scenarios where the data is transmitted in the amplitude, phase and spatial domains through selected antennas. In the coherent domain, generalized SM (GSM) employs multiple antennas in combination during every time slot to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE). In this paper, we propose two differential schemes which activate two or more antennas at a time to transmit the modulated symbol. These schemes achieve higher SE using a lesser number of antennas and lower order modulation schemes instead of the higher number of antennas required for conventional SM schemes based on differential modulation. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed schemes have better bit error rate performance than traditional differential SM schemes. We also derive the analytical union bound for the proposed schemes and is satisfied from medium to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges.},

We present the framework and analysis of the RA success probability of the pattern-domain based scheme with massive MIMO systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pattern division random access (PDRA) scheme achieves an appreciable performance gain over the conventional one, while preserving the existing physical layer virtually unchanged. The extension of the “superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks” scheme to “superposition of quasi-orthogonal-building-blocks” is straightforward.},

The short-distance transmission nature between SBS’s and UEs makes the millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication empowered with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) hybrid precoding techniques particularly attractive for MEC. In this work, we consider the UE-SBS association, precoding design and power allocation for MEC networks endowed with mmWave MIMO.

Furthermore, the monotonic convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm is analytically proven.

Subsequently, the k-means clustering algorithm optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to realize the cluster analysis of driving behaviors, and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to complete the identification of driving behaviors. Next, through the analysis of the boost characteristics of the self-designed Ebooster, driving behaviors are matched with boost characteristics, and a personalized basic boosting control strategy based on the driver behavior is designed. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) bench and a real-vehicle test platform are designed and built to verify the effectiveness of the personalized control strategy of the Ebooster. The results show that this method can effectively identify the type of driver and make personalized adjustments to the basic boosting strategy of the Ebooster, which effectively improves the personalization of the braking system, resulting in a higher pedal response and user acceptance.},

The AGV with a four-wheel-steering four-wheel-driving (4WS4WD) structure is controlled with a steer and velocity input for each wheel. The tracking problem is implemented by the standard NMPC framework and the referenced trajectory is planned by the Reeds-Shepp algorithm. A Large load creates a considerable load transfer effect which is dangerous for the wheels; hence, the controller limits the lateral acceleration to reduce load transfer. To realize online numerical computation for NMPC, the continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) method is applied. A semismooth transformation based on the Chen-Harker-Kanzow-Smale (CHKS) function is introduced to handle inequality constraints since C/GMRES only solves standard equality forms. Trajectory tracking simulations are carried out in contrast to the quadratic programming method without lateral load transfer optimization, and practical experiments on an AGV carrying 13 tons of steel are also performed. The results indicate the accuracy, efficiency, safety and applicability of the proposed method on heavy-duty AGVs.},

For these systems, timely detection of an approaching vehicle and the detection of strong coupling conditions between transmitter and receiver coils are of prime interest. A novel method is proposed in this article, which utilizes the existing embedded transmitter coil and power electronics modules to establish a precise detection system based on the power footprint of a traveling receiver. Next, a control algorithm is proposed to control charger activation and deactivation time accurately and deliver the required energy during the maximum coupling of the coils. The proposed sigmoid-curve-based control algorithm achieves a robust, speed-independent, smooth transition between two states while providing fast dynamics for aligned and misaligned conditions. Finally, a novel approach to test high-speed dynamic charging in laboratory conditions based on the receiver emulator is developed and used for experimental validation. The vehicle detection and control techniques have been validated through simulations and experimentally on a speed-controlled dynamic charging test station for a wide speed range. The proposed method does not require any additional hardware, sensing devices, or high-speed communication between the vehicle and the charging infrastructure.},

So, it is advantageous not only for agile responsiveness in the tire slip stage but also for simple implementation that does not require reference vehicle speed information. The MTC model consists of a traction force observer and a target parameter defined as the acceleration ratio to estimate the maximum transmissible traction force. It is based on earlier studies, but overcomes the pain points and demonstrates more effective traction control performance through quarter-vehicle simulation.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges for the energy management of heavy-duty fuel cell/battery hybrid vehicles is to control the battery charge within safe operating levels without hindering fuel efficiency. This article proposes a novel method that uses basic route information from navigation systems to implement an optimal and predictive energy management scheme to improve battery charge control, fuel economy, and fuel cell system lifetime. Indeed, it is possible to obtain a rough estimate of the electric load profile using elevation and speed forecasts and optimize the power split before starting the trip. The result of this offline optimization is saved as a location-based battery state of charge (SoC) reference for the online power-split strategy. The novelty of this work is related to the formulation of a quadratic program to generate the predictive SoC reference by optimizing the hydrogen economy while respecting the battery charge constraints. Afterward, a simple but effective online energy management strategy is used to track the predictive references during the simulations. The use of real-world driving cycles is essential to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method. In particular, it is critical to consider the road elevation because it highly influences the power demand of heavy-duty vehicles. The simulation results prove that using the predictive SoC reference significantly improves the hydrogen economy and battery charge control compared to a non-predictive energy management scheme. In addition, the high-power operation time of the fuel cell system is reduced, resulting in slower system degradation compared to the non-predictive strategy. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are tested against 1750 hours of real-world driving scenarios, considering uncertain speed and vehicle mass information for the reference generation. Statistical and global analyses of the results prove that the implementation of the predictive SoC reference generation method is highly beneficial for the performance of heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles.},

  abstract     = {An unbalance in the electromagnetic torque and the load torque occurs when Electric Vehicles (EVs) are driven through uneven terrains. This leads to non-periodic and time-varying speed oscillations. As a result, torsional vibrations increase and leads to passenger discomfort and mechanical stress on the EV body. The EV drive control should be designed to mitigate these speed oscillations. In this paper, an Integral Sliding Mode Control Based Direct Torque Control (ISM-DTC) of Induction Motor (IM) is proposed to inherit the intrinsic properties of disturbance rejection, robustness against parametric variations, operational uncertainties, and improve the conventional Proportional-Integral (PI)-based DTC (PIDTC) performance in uncertain EV drive conditions. The proposed control is integrated with PIDTC, which maintains the speed and acts as a nominal control. The non-linear ISM loop cancels out the speed fluctuations by balancing the electromagnetic torque with dynamic load torque demand. The proposed control cancels out the matched uncertainties without amplifying the unmatched uncertainties in system dynamics. An analysis of the uncertainty decomposition and control gain derivation is presented. The proposed ISMDTC is verified through simulations and experiments considering different scenarios of torque, reference speed variations, uncertainties, and the standard New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (US) drive test cycles.},

The queueing model is built, providing a theoretical basis to the development of the minimum hydraulic brake-by-wire system involving one eActuator + s valves. Based on the minimum hydraulic brake-by-wire system, the equivalent queueing model is proposed and the evaluation index is defined as average waiting time of wheel cylinder pressure (AWT of WCP).

In accordance to the IEHB physical system, the comparison verifications for the proposed queueing disciplines are conducted via simulations and experiments. The correlation analysis and sensitivity analysis are carried out respectively. Several typical pressure-tracking experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the IEHB control system. This work has two original contributions: 1) The topological and conjoint analysis of the novel hydraulic brake-by-wire system configuration (eActuators+valves) is conducted via Queueing Theory. 2) The performance of the minimum hydraulic brake-by-wire system is improved by using the balanced algorithm, compared with the round-robin scheduling algorithm and rotary control algorithm proposed in the previous study.},

  abstract     = {Multi-UAV is a complete system represented by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) through collaborative technology. Besides, the UAV group has the advantages in the number and functions that a single UAV does not have. In a complex environment, a single UAV cannot complete a large number of material transportations and escort functions. This paper, from the perspective of cooperative control and material escort of the UAV group, solves the escort problem in the UAV group cruise. Then, an autonomous cooperative flocking algorithm for heterogeneous UAV swarm (ACHF) is proposed. Firstly, the movement control factor of the escort UAV is proposed, and the escort UAV is deployed in the periphery of the transport UAV in the flocking process. Secondly, the system loss function including position and angle is proposed to make the escort UAV deployed as evenly as possible in the periphery of the transport UAV. Finally, in the case of different numbers of UAVs and different environments, the effectiveness of ACHF is supported by theoretical analysis and demonstrated by experiments. The results show that the escort UAVs can be evenly distributed in the periphery of the transport UAVs, forming a group of UAVs with autonomous cooperative capability.},

A sampled-data feedback controller is proposed for platoons to eliminate the effect of stochastic packet dropouts and external disturbance, where the controller gain depends on the IVCT. To guarantee the stability requirement of a platoon with the minimized cost function, a unified control framework is established to jointly determine the optimal IVCT from all the available ones and the associated feedback controller gain. This co-design procedure is based on the optimal control and dynamic programming technique, where both fixed and periodic switching IVCTs are available. A useful algorithm is proposed to implement the established co-design framework. Furthermore, we present numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The hybridization of energy storage imposes the need for an efficient power-sharing strategy. This article proposes the interval type2 fuzzy logic controller-based power-sharing strategy to utilize hybrid energy storages in the solar-powered charging station effectively. Under this study, the hybrid energy storage system consists of a battery and supercapacitor with solar power generation as a primary source. The battery supports the slow varying power and the supercapacitor supports the fast-varying power. Electric vehicles are connected as load and a multi-step constant current charging technique is proposed to charge its battery. In order to inject/absorb the power, the hybrid energy storage utilizes bidirectional DC-DC converters. The perturb and observe algorithm is used to track the maximum power from the solar panel. The proposed system is designed in MATLAB/Simulink platform and the real-time validation has been carried out through the dSPACE (DS1202) real-time processor. An obtained result demonstrates the performance of the interval type2 fuzzy logic controller-based power-sharing strategy under variable generation and load scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The urban rail transit system has the characteristics of wide voltage fluctuation, intermittent and strong impact load, limited heat dissipation capacity. The high-speed flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is used to provide network voltage stability and regenerative braking energy recovery due to its high power density, unlimited number of charge-discharge cycles, fast response and environmental friendliness. When considering the design of high-speed FESS converter with 3.6 kHz fundamental frequency and 330 kW rated power used in 1500 VDC urban rail transit system, the two-stage topological converter reduces the efficiency and increase the cost and size, meanwhile, the series-connected converters and the multilevel converter increase the difficulties of control and insulation, so the two-level and I-type three-level converters of high-speed FESS are designed and evaluated. Several comparisons are made by detailed experimental data from the perspective of the traction load characteristics of the 1500 VDC urban rail transit system and the technical and economical requirements of the high-speed FESS. It is found that the three-level converter has significant advantages in matching the traction load characteristics for its higher duty cycle capability, as well as improving the technical and economical performances such as efficiency, du/dt value, THD, voltage stability, and reducing the cost by 40% when compared to the two-level converter. While in the future MW class high-speed FESS development, the maximum output power capacity of the three-level FESS is relatively lower than that of the two-level FESS. The theoretical analyses were verified by experiments.},

In order to solve this problem, this paper investigates the cooperative control strategy for high-speed trains subject to DoS attacks through a resilient control scheme. A secure control framework is proposed to restore the communication network of the multi-train system caused by DoS attacks to the initial communication network by proposing an acknowledgment-based attack detection strategy and a recovery mechanism. Then, distributed controllers with considering input saturation are proposed under this framework by applying the Lyapunov theory and low-gain feedback method. In addition, the speed error and position error constraints can be guaranteed during the operating process of trains.

Especially with the development of data-driven technology, the combination of data-driven VO and model-based VO has achieved accurate tracking performance. However, the lack of generalization of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNN) limits the robustness of such a combination in unseen environments. In this study, we introduce a novel framework with appropriate usage of DNN prediction and improve the robustness in the self-driving application. Based on the characteristic of on-road self-driving motion and the DNN output, we propose a two-step optimization strategy with a variable degree of freedom (DoF), i.e., the use of two types of DoF representations during pose estimation. Specifically, our two-step optimization operates according to the residual of the optimization with the motion label classification from the pre-trained DNN, as well as our proposed Motion Evaluation by essential matrix construction. Experimental results show that our framework obtains better tracking accuracy than the existing methods.},

In such case, the question of how close two operations could be conducted while sharing an airspace must be answered to ensure the safe and efficient use of the urban airspace. The lateral separation needed to prevent inadvertent intrusion by neighboring tracks is especially important when designing airspace corridors constrained by the urban landscape. This paper documents a series of flight tests conducted in open fields with the goal of assessing the along-track (longitudinal), cross-track (lateral),and altitude (height) deviation under two different flight conditions: operator guided operation within Visual Line of Sight (VLoS), and the waypoint-guided mission analogous to operating Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLoS). The flight test statistics were also compared to the Monte-Carlo based path prediction model that was used in earlier studies for collision prediction. The goal is to determine the Flight Technical Error (FTE) that forms a part of the Total System Error (TSE) for Performance Based Navigation (PBN) of UAS to support the establishment of separation requirements in urban airspace.},

TRSM with target position determination (TRSM-TPD) is a new generation of TRSM with the advantages of speeding enforcement by lane, high accuracy of speed measurement and target position determination, high efficiency, low cost, etc. This paper proposes a new verification method for TRSM-TPD in road vehicle speeding enforcement. The proposed verification method includes the simulated speed calibration method for initial verification in the laboratory, and the online speed and position calibration method for subsequent verification in the field. The range of simulated radial speed is up to (1∼400) km/h and the maximum permissible error is within ±0.03 km/h, which can satisfy the full-range and high-accuracy speed calibration requirements for TRSM-TPD. The uncertainty of the reference facility in actual traffic is 0.12% within the speed range of (60∼250) km/h, where coverage factor k = 3. The simulated and online calibration results validate the effectiveness of the proposed verification method and the feasibility of the realized target speed simulator and the established reference facility.},

The communication inside the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is typically encoded using proprietary formats in order to prevent easy access to the information exchanged on the bus. However, it is still possible to decode this information through reverse engineering, performed either manually or via automated tools. Existing automated CAN bus reverse engineering methods are still time-consuming and require some manual effort, i.e., to inject diagnostic messages in order to trigger specific responses. In this paper, we propose CANMatch – a fully automated CAN bus reverse engineering framework that does not require any manual effort and significantly decreases the execution time by exploiting the reuse of CAN frames across different vehicle models. We evaluate the proposed solution on a dataset of CAN logs, or traces , related to 479 vehicles from 29 different automotive manufacturers, demonstrating its improved performance with respect to the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {With the popularization of the geo-positioning technologies and Location Based Service (LBS), the spatial range query has gained increasing attention in VANET. To eliminate local data storage and computation burden, the data owner outsources his/her spatial data and the processing of range query tasks to location based service providers. However, outsourcing tasks may bring the risk of privacy leakage as location based service providers and clients, including data owner and data users are not in the same trusted domain. Besides, malicious service providers may forge or tamper retrieval results due to interest incentives such as saving storage or computational capacity. Therefore, we first propose and construct the Verifiable Spatial Range Query (VSRQ) scheme in VANET by using the hierarchical cell based encoding method, G-tree and the accumulator. To guarantee the correctness and completeness of search results, we leverage an accumulator-based technology. Then, we develop an improved G-tree to accelerate query processing and extend it to support multi-dimensional range queries. Security analysis shows that basic VSRQ and extension of VSRQ schemes are secure in terms of the privacy of index and confidentiality of spatial data. Extensive experiments further show that, basic (or extension of) VSRQ scheme can achieve result integrity while supporting spatial range query and lower computational and storage burden compared with existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) communication is now being considered as one of possible technologies for the sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) space-time-frequency non-stationary theoretical channel model is first proposed for 6G THz wireless communication systems employing ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies with long traveling paths. Considering frequency-dependent diffuse scattering, which is a special property of THz channels different from millimeter wave (mmWave) channels, the relative angles and delays of rays within one cluster will evolve in the frequency domain. Then, a corresponding simulation model is proposed with discrete angles calculated using the method of equal area (MEA). The statistical properties of the proposed theoretical and simulation models are derived and compared, showing good agreements. The accuracy and flexibility of the proposed simulation model are demonstrated by comparing the simulation results of the relative angle spread and root mean square (RMS) delay spread with corresponding measurements.},

  abstract     = {Advanced driver-assistance system features in current vehicles (as precursor to fully autonomous, connected vehicular systems) will rely on 5G network links. Specifically, enabling various real-time operational aspects (e.g. emergency messaging), performance of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) specified by 3GPP Release 16 is of direct relevance. A key challenge in achieving URLLC goals is the natural tension between simultaneously achieving high reliability (low block error rate or BLER) and low latency. When operating in a dynamic (i.e. significant time-varying channels due to vehicular mobility) environment, link adaptation is fundamental to URLLC implementation. In this paper, we introduce a new Markov Chain model for link adaptation that predicts the three key performance indicators (KPIs): end-to-end link latency, throughput and BLER as a function of the modulation and coding scheme used. The predictions from the Markov Chain model are supported by Monte Carlo simulations for various mobility scenarios, to explore how 5G network parameters may be adapted to achieve desired benchmarks, e.g. maximizing link throughput while providing strict latency and BLER bounds.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attacted much attention in the field of wireless communication due to its agility and altitude. UAVs can be used as low-altitude aerial base stations (UAV-BSs) to provide communication services for ground devices (GDs) in various scenarios, such as emergency communication and traffic offloading in hotspots. However, due to the limited communication ranges and high prices of commercial UAV-BSs, covering a target area all the time with sufficient UAVs is quite challenging, especially under dynamic environment. We need to design the trajectory of the UAV-BSs to optimize system performance. Most existing works focus on the energy-efficient coverage and throughput maximization but ignore the fairness of communication service, especially the fairness at user-level. Besides, reinforcement learning is suitable for solving decision problems in dynamic environments. However, most existing works use centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches. Due to the scalability and low time complexity, a distributed DRL approach is more suitable for multiple UAV-BSs communication system in dynamic environment. Unlike previous works, we characterize the fairness at user-level based on proportional fairness scheduling and formulate a weighted-throughput maximization problem via designing UAV-BSs’ trajectory. Then we model the dynamic deploymentproblem of UAV-BSs as a Markov game and propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based distributed UAV-BSs control approach named MAUC. MAUC approach adopts the framework of centralized training with distributed execution. Simulation results show that the MAUC can improve fairness of communication service by sacrificing a small amount of throughput.},

From this condition, we define a new measurement parameter called Interference to Background Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (IBINR) and design a practical NOMA-HO procedure for the measurement of IBINRs and the handover decision.

To this end, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure and training methodology, in which artificially distorted CSI is used to compensate for the effect of imperfect CSI, such that a robust transmit power control strategy against channel error can be derived. Our simulation results show that even when the CSI is inaccurate, in our proposed scheme the degradation of the average SE can be kept low whilst maintaining negligible QoS violation, thereby confirming its effectiveness and robustness.},

Specifically, we seek to maximize the system throughput of the scheduled users by jointly optimizing their transmit power level and hybrid combiners as well as the number of quantization bits, subject to practical constraints. By relying on fractional programming (FP) techniques, we first covert this problem into a form amenable to optimization and exploit the specific structures in its solutions with the aid of the so-called Ky Fan &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm.Then, the resultant optimization problem is solved using a penalty block successive concave approximation (P-BSCA) algorithm.

  abstract     = {This work investigates the secrecy capability of energy harvesting based overlay cognitive networks (EHOCNs). To this end, we assume that a message by a licensed transmitter is relayed by an unlicensed sender. Critically, the unlicensed sender uses energy harvested from licensed signals, enhancing the overall energy efficiency and maintaining the integrity of licensed communications. To secure messages broadcast by the unlicensed sender against the wire-tapper, full-duplex destinations – unlicensed recipient and licensed receiver – jam the eavesdropper at the same time they receive signals from the unlicensed sender. To this effect, we derive closed-form formulas for the secrecy outage probability, which then quantify the security performance of both unlicensed and licensed communications for EHOCNs with jamming-assisted full-duplex destinations, namely EHOCNwFD. In addition, optimum operating parameters are established, which can serve as essential design guidelines of such systems.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the short wavelength at high frequency (HF), it is promising to combine massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) with HF communications. In particular, HF massive MIMO differs from the conventional MIMO in array structure and radio propagation. In this paper, we investigate the HF massive MIMO system with a compact planar array (CPA) deployed at the base station (BS) in the presence of electromagnetic mutual coupling (MC) for the asymptotic case under unlimited antenna elements assumption. Specifically, the HF sparse channel is analyzed asymptotically to show that the randomness characteristic of channel decreases in the asymptotic regime, which is conducive to the design of communication systems. Moreover, on the basis of the asymptotic analysis results, the optimal beamforming to maximize the minimum user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is derived by applying random matrix theory. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the asymptotic analysis, indicate the performance superiority of the proposed scheme to the traditional minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) schemes, and reveal the robustness of the proposal to electromagnetic MC.},

In several specific modules, the regular convolutional and grouped convolutional layers are leveraged with different filter sizes to enrich diversified features and reduce network complexity besides adopting residual connection to prevent vanishing gradient. For performance evaluation, we generate a synthetic signal dataset for DOA estimation under the multipath propagation channel with the presence of additive noise, propagation attenuation and delay. In simulations, the effectiveness of RFDOA-Net is investigated comprehensively with various processing modules and antenna configurations. Compared with several state-of-the-art deep learning-based models, RFDOA-Net shows the superiority in terms of accuracy with over 94% accuracy at 5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with cost-efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This correspondence discusses the estimation of direction-of-arrival (DOA) in a magnitude-aided antenna array (MA-AA), where magnitude-only radio frequency (RF) chains are introduced into the classical AA to acquire magnitude measurements. DOAs are initially estimated by the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm based on the complex-valued measurements from the conventional antennas. After griding the neighborhoods of these initial DOAs, the DOA estimation problem with the hybrid observations in MA-AA is converted as the recovery problem of sparse signals, which can be resolved by generalized approximate message passing (GAMP). Due to the “spatial leakage” effect, non-zero clusters appear around true DOAs. Their positions (i.e., non-zero supports) provide DOAs estimations. Moreover, DOAs and supports remain unchanged in several snapshots, then common supports are shared. Therefore, the cluster-sparse property of sparse signals is exploited by modeling a hidden Markov-tree (HMT) in the shared supports, on which belief propagation (BP) is executed to recover the binary probabilities of supports. Some unknown hyper-parameters in GAMP and BP are learned by expectation-maximization (EM). In comparison to existing estimators, EM-BP-GAMP shows advantages on DOA estimation, computational complexity, and DOA resolution. With the EM-BP-GAMP estimator, MA-AA is more energy-efficient than the classical AA. These advantages are successfully validated by experimental results.},

The obtained results over Rician shadowed fading for FD-enabled UAV system are also compared with it&#39;s half-duplex counterpart over Rician fading channels.

  abstract     = {Multiple signal classification (MUSIC) has been widely applied in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. To reduce the cost of radio frequency (RF) chains at millimeter-wave bands, hybrid analog-digital structure has been adopted in massive MIMO transceivers. In this situation, received signals at the antennas are unavailable to the digital receiver, and as a consequence, the spatial covariance matrix (SCM), which is essential in MUSIC algorithm, cannot be obtained using traditional sample average approach. Based on our previous work, we propose a novel algorithm for SCM reconstruction in hybrid massive MIMO systems with multiple RF chains in this paper. By switching the analog beamformers to a group of predetermined DOAs, SCM can be reconstructed through the solutions of a set of linear equations. Furthermore, a low-complexity algorithm, as well as a careful selection of the predetermined DOAs, will be also presented in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can reconstruct the SCM accurately so that MUSIC algorithm can be well used in hybrid massive MIMO systems with multiple RF chains.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel indoor localization system with channel state information (CSI) fingerprints is proposed, which learns the spatial and frequency features of CSI in the fifth-generation (5G) cellular network by a Siamese convolution neural network. In particular, considering that the CSI continuously collected by a moving target possesses the implicit spatial association, we locate the target by the successive CSI data gathered within a time interval which can be regarded as an information subspace of the fingerprint database. Therefore, the fingerprint localization can be modeled as a subspace matching problem and solved by the Siamese network-based similarity learning. In the proposed system, we design a structure of CSI fingerprint which includes the information from multiple base stations in spatial and frequency domains. Then, the proposed Siamese architecture extracts the CSI feature and estimates the location of the target by feature similarity comparison. Compared with the existing algorithms, it can increase the positioning accuracy significantly by the feature relevance among the CSI data collected at different positions. The field tests indicate that compared to other CSI fingerprint-based positioning methods, our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the localization error.},

  abstract     = {The concept of the smart city and the extensive use of vehicles are evolving progressively. This evolution makes vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) a widely used network for inter-vehicular communication to get information about speed, traffic congestion, road condition, and vehicle location. This information is obtained from a public network, which is prone to various attacks. Generally speaking, data security in VANET is one of the most crucial tasks. We found many authentication protocols for VANETs; however, most of these protocols are insecure due to impersonation, replay, denial of service attacks, etc. Moreover, the existing protocols utilized heavy computation and communication costs, making them incompatible for resource-constrained VANET applications. This article presents a lightweight privacy-preserving authentication protocol for VANETs to offer a secure and efficient data transmission mechanism over a public channel. We analyze that our protocol is lightweight, safe, and scalable compared to related protocols. The communication and computation cost of our protocol is less concerning the state-of-the-art protocols. Hence, it is overt from the observed facts that our protocol is more reliable, convenient, and practical for secure data transmission in VANETs.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN) has been deemed as a promising architecture for the fifth generation wireless networks. In H-CRAN, small remote radio heads (SRRHs) are deployed underlaying the macro remote radio head (MRRH) to boost the spectral efficiency. H-CRANs with dense RRHs suffer from severe inter-cell interference due to the random deployment of dense SRRHs, which limits its performance. In this paper, we propose an Edge-Aware RRH-Cooperation (EARC) scheme to mitigate the impact of both the cross-tier and co-tier interference. We partition the users into two groups, Cell Edge Device (CED) and Non-cell Edge Device (NED). These two groups, CED and NED, are mapped into two association modes, dual-association and single-association mode, respectively. In single-association mode, the NED associates with the RRH that provides the maximum received signal. On the other hand, in the dual-association mode, the CED associates with the two strongest RRHs where the two RRHs may belong to the same or different tier(s). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we quantify the performance gains of the proposed EARC scheme in terms of outage probability and ergodic rate. To further show the efficacy of the proposed scheme, we compare it to four schemes developed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Efficient traffic control center (TCC) management requires roadside units (RSUs) to frequently update vehicles with traffic messages (TMs). RSUs are costly to road operators in terms of deployment and maintenance. Therefore, vehicular users expect the TCC to deliver high-quality and rapid responses to query requests on TMs through RSUs. This paper presents a novel RSU selection scheme based on a software-defined network (SDN) for traffic message transmission. In the proposed scheme, the RSU selection is determined by comparing the utility function calculated at the SDN controller. The SDN controller discovers the network connectivity topology through a cluster approach in which a cluster head (CH) is elected to report the network topology to the SDN controller. Furthermore, the SDN controller relies on the RSU selection manager to load existing RSU deployment techniques. In addition, a distance vector hop localization algorithm (DV-hop) is used to locate hidden RSUs to control signaling between the SDN controller and local controllers at RSUs. The proposed scheme achieves minimum latency and appropriate RSU management within a higher packet reception rate, which improves the selection of RSUs and traffic message delivery.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of connecting massive devices to the Internet, especially for remote areas without cellular network infrastructures, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) emerge and offload computation-intensive tasks. In this paper, we consider a SAGIN, where multiple low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites providing connections to the cloud server, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and nearby base stations (BSs) providing edge computing services are included. The UAV flies along a fixed trajectory to collect tasks generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and forwards these tasks to a BS or the cloud server for further processing. To facilitate efficient processing, the UAV needs to decide where to offload as well as the proportion of offloaded tasks. However, in practice, due to the variability of environment and actual demand, the amount of arrival tasks is uncertain. If the deterministic optimization is utilized to develop offloading strategy, unnecessary system overhead or higher task drop rate may occur, which severely damages the system robustness. To address this issue, we characterize the uncertainty with a data-driven approach, and formulate a distributionally robust optimization problem to minimize the expected energy-constrained system latency under the worst-case probability distribution. Furthermore, the distributionally robust latency optimization algorithm is proposed to reach the sub-optimal solution. Finally, we perform simulations on the real-world data set, and compare with other benchmark schemes to verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) band, i.e., 30 to 300 GHz, is characterized by short range transmissions and vulnerability to path blockage necessitating the use of relaying. Probing more relays finds out the best relay having the highest spectral efficiency but at the expense of increasing the probing overhead due to excessive beamforming training (BT) causing a decrease in the overall throughput. In this paper, mmWave two-hop relaying will be formulated as a single player multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem enabling one relay probing while maximizing the achievable spectral efficiency. Moreover, the relays could not establish the mmWave link due to blockage for instance will be identified as sleeping relays and eliminated from the rest of the MAB game. Thus, sleeping non contextual MAB (S-MAB) algorithm, namely sleeping Thompson sampling (S-TS) will be proposed to handle the problem. Furthermore, by utilizing the multiband capability of standardized WiGig devices containing both 2.4/5 GHz WiFi and 60 GHz mmWave bands, WiFi information will be used as contexts of the MAB game. Therefore, sleeping contextual MAB (S-CMAB) algorithm, namely S-CTS, will be proposed as well. Numerical and regret analysis ensure the superior performance of the S-CMAB algorithm over the S-MAB counterpart and the existing mmWave relay probing solutions accompanied with high convergence rates.},

UAVs are particularly vulnerable to physical capture, cloning attacks, eavesdropping, and man in the middle attacks. To address some of these security problems, this paper develops an authentication protocol for use in UAV swarms. To ensure physical security and rapid authentication, the proposed protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The protocol achieves high scalability compared to the state of the art by authenticating multiple devices at once. The proposed protocol supports dynamic topologies and multi-hop communication by using spanning tree-based traversal. It is also resistant to mobility, device tampering attack, etc., and its improvements are achieved at significantly lower communication and communication cost as compared to state-of-the-art protocols.},

In this paper, we address the topic of resource allocation in interference-prone 5G small-cell networks (SCNs). We formulate a state based potential game for resource sharing problems to fulfill and maximize users’ quality of experience (QoE). The designed game uses knowledge exchange among players through a communication graph to solve the optimization problem. We employ the time-invariant and time-varying structure of the communication graph in the proposed game. In addition, we propose a decentralized scheme for the joint optimization of spectrum allocation, power selection, and user scheduling. Through extensive simulations, we show that our algorithm surpasses the existing schemes in terms of QoE, computational complexity, and convergence rate for stable resource allocations. Furthermore, it is robust to wireless link failure and state transition in the communication graph. Besides, under imperfect channel state information, it suffers relatively less performance degradation compared to the existing schemes.},

By integrating cooperative NOMA into wireless caching, a popularity-oriented cooperative NOMA pushing (POC-NOMA-P) strategy is proposed for content pushing, while a dynamic cooperative NOMA delivery (DC-NOMA-D) strategy is proposed for content delivery. A new analytical framework is designed to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies. Particularly, unlike existing works that purely focused on the analysis of cache hit probability (CHP) and outage probability, our analytical framework further introduces content diversity gain and delivery diversity gain to characterize the performance gain achieved by the use of cooperative NOMA. Moreover, the tradeoff analysis between performance and energy consumption is also included in our analytical framework. To ensure the analysis accuracy and mathematical tractability, a new tight approximation is developed for the cumulative distribution function of channel gain between two spatially random nodes, with which theoretic results are approximately derived for various performance metrics of our analytical framework. Our analytical results demonstrate that compared with the non-cooperative counterparts, the proposed strategies are guaranteed to achieve higher CHP/lower delivery outage probability and largely reduce the energy consumption incurred by content pushing/delivery. Simulations verify the accuracy of our derived approximations for various performance metrics and demonstrate the superiority of POC-NOMA-P and DC-NOMA-D over existing strategies.},

  abstract     = {In typical wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets), users are clustered around known hotspots, e.g., shopping centers or schools, but such a non-uniform distribution of nodes is difficult to analyze. This paper explicitly models this scenario, with macro base stations (MBSs) modeled by a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), and millimeter-wave small base stations (mmWave SBSs) and users clustered around the hotspot centers, forming two Poisson cluster processes (PCPs), respectively. Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP) are assumed since they help to limit the co-tier interference and enhance the coverage and capacity of the network. We present a distance-based approach for grouping macro user equipments (MUEs) from the cell center (CC) and cell edge (CE) regions for FFR analysis. We first derive some distance distributions, including joint distance distribution from the typical user to the cooperative open-access mmWave SBS and distance distribution from the typical user to the non-cooperative open-access mmWave SBS. We obtain expressions for various performance metrics, including association probability, signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability, and ergodic capacity, under these conditions. Due to the complexity of the exact expressions, we derive novel approximations, using Alzer&#39;s lemma, to obtain the lower bounds on coverage and ergodic capacity, which are shown to be accurate through Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation results analyze the effect of different parameters on the network performance to give some guidance for the design of future networks. Numerical optimization of a key parameter, in terms of association probability, coverage probability, and ergodic capacity, is enabled by our analysis.},

VNFs consume computational resources of the network&#39;s servers, while vLinks utilize the communicational resources of the network. The efficient utilization of network resources remains a challenge in NFV-based networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose an analytical framework for the Admission Ratio (AR) calculation in NFV-based converged optical-wireless 5G networks. The proposed methodology employs a network slicing architecture in which different network slices form end-to-end logically isolated networks and each slice delivers a specific service type to the users through its SFC(s). In the proposed analysis, we not only take into account the occupancy distribution in both the network&#39;s computational and communicational domains (servers and fiber links), but we also consider the SFC establishment AR by taking into account different sub-service-classes belonging to different slices. The accuracy of the model is evaluated through the comparison of analytical and simulation results and was found satisfactory. Furthermore, the proposed model is employed for the determination of the optimal (minimum) capacity for all SFCs elements (VNFs and vLinks), in a way that users belonging to a specific slice experience a predefined value of AR as minimum. Additionally, our calculations deploy recursive formulas, which have a low computational complexity, as opposed to time-consuming simulations, without requiring the application of complex optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We are seeing a growth in the number of connected vehicles in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) to achieve the goal of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This is leading to a connected vehicular network scenario with vehicles continuously broadcasting data to other vehicles on the road and the roadside network infrastructure. The presence of a large number of communicating vehicles greatly increases the number and types of possible anomalies in the network. Existing works provide solutions addressing specific anomalies in the network only. However, since there can be a multitude of anomalies possible in the network, there is a need for better anomaly detection frameworks that can address this unprecedented scenario. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework for VANETs based on deep neural networks (DNNs) using a sequence reconstruction and thresholding algorithm. In this framework, the DNN architectures are deployed on the roadside units (RSUs) which receive the broadcast vehicular data and run anomaly detection tasks to classify a particular message sequence as anomalous or genuine. Multiple DNN architectures are implemented in this experiment and their performance is compared using key evaluation metrics. Performance comparison of the proposed framework is also drawn against the prior work in this area. Our best performing deep learning-based scheme detects anomalous sequences with an accuracy of 98%, a great improvement over the set benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication enables ultra-high rate data transmission in wireless environments, but its performance depends on blockages between the transmitter and receiver significantly. To overcome the blockage problem, we consider two approaches: multi-connectivity and network densification. The multi-connectivity opens up a new paradigm for user centric communication, where each user autonomously chooses multiple base stations (BSs) to attain high quality services. The network densification allows network operators to deploy many BSs in a limited area, thereby providing qualified communication services to users. In this paper, we study user equipment (UE) association control in user centric mmWave communication environments. When a UE arrives, the network provides the UE with information on the resource status of adjacent BSs, and the UE generates a set of candidate BSs. For access control, we formulate two optimization problems that aim to minimize peak load and sum load, respectively. They are non-convex and combinatorial, so their computational complexity grows exponentially with the problem size. As a solution, we develop an access pricing and peak load limit control scheme.

  abstract     = {Drone Base Station (DBS) is expected to play an important role in next generation cellular networks due to its maneuverability in establishing air-to-ground Line of Sight (LoS) links. Working as a mobile relay node between the Macro Base Station (MBS) and the ground users, the DBS can significantly reduce the latency of ground users by offloading traffic loads from the MBS to the DBS since a better channel condition can be provided. In this paper, we focus on how to determine the 3D location of the DBS, the user association and the bandwidth allocation policy between the MBS and the DBS in order to minimize the total average latency ratio of all users with the constraint of each user&#39;s QoS requirement and total available bandwidth. The formulated problem is a mixed integer nonconvex optimization problem, a very challenging and difficult problem. We propose a cyclic iterative algorithm to efficiently solve it by decomposing the primal problem into two subproblems, i.e., the user association and bandwidth allocation problem and the 3D DBS placement problem. In each iteration, the two sub-problems are alternatively optimized by using the output of one as the input for the other. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the significant latency ratio reduction of our proposed algorithm as compared to other baseline schemes.},

The effect of a link disruption on reliable data transmission of BP is currently under study. In this paper, a study of the effect of link disruption on BP&#39;s reliable data delivery in deep-space vehicle communications, from spatial and temporal perspectives, is presented employing both analytical and experimental methods. The effect is modeled in various transmission cases by considering the physical distance the bundle has traversed when the link disruption starts and ends, the duration of link disruption in time, and the physical span of the link disruption. The models are built to quantify the number of transmission attempts that fail due to link disruption, the total number of transmission attempts, bundle delivery time, and transmission goodput performance for successful bundle delivery in presence of a link disruption. The models are validated by realistic bundle delivery over a PC-based experimental testbed. The validation indicates that the analytical models predict the transmission performance of BP in presence of random link disruption in various aspects of successful bundle delivery.},

  abstract     = {The problem of disseminating continuous data flow from a given source node to all other network nodes is known as the dynamic broadcast problem, which is also a fundamental problem in multi-hop wireless networks (e.g., wireless ad hoc and sensor networks). Due to link unreliability and node mobility, the topology of a network typically changes with time. Little work has been conducted to address the dynamic broadcast problem in time-varying wireless multi-hop networks, especially under the popular Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) interference model. In this paper, we study the dynamic broadcast problem in SINR-based time-varying directed acyclic multi-hop wireless networks formed by point-to-point wireless links. We consider the SINR-based link transmission rate model involved in the slot-based link scheduling. We first prove a tight upper bound for the broadcast capacity of the multi-hop wireless networks under study. We then propose an online max-weight Throughput-Optimal Dynamic Broadcast algorithm (TODB) which performs link weight allocation, link scheduling, and data forwarding for each time slot according to the current network connectivity and data reception rates of nodes. We derive the throughput-optimality of the TODB algorithm by proving that the broadcast throughput of TODB can achieve the aforementioned upper bound of the broadcast capacity. We evaluate the performance of TODB in terms of throughput and latency via simulations and the results validate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the secure transmission problem in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted mmWave networks in the presence of an eavesdropper. The UAV base station (UAV-BS) and IRS are deployed to overcome the blockages. Artificial noise (AN) is exploited against the eavesdropper. Aiming to maximize the secrecy rate, we jointly design the positions and beamforming of UAV-BS and IRS, where the positions here represent the deployed position of the UAV-BS and the activation position of the IRS. Meanwhile, the maximum transmits power, minimum height constraint for UAV-BS, and the legitimate receiver minimum rate constraint are required. To obtain the optimal UAV-BS position, the elevation angle-dependent probabilistic LoS air-to-ground channel is exploited in this network. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we divide it into two subproblems: (1) design UAV-BS and IRS positions; (2) design UAV-BS and IRS beamforming. Moreover, to reduce the complexity, we propose an ideal beamforming model to find the near-optimal positions of UAV-BS and IRS. Then, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized to cope with the highly coupled and high-dimensional variable vectors. Finally, we obtain a sub-optimal solution by an efficient and low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the improvement of secrecy rate by jointly designing the positions as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed schemes over benchmark schemes.},

In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation and time scheduling algorithms for a NOMA based D2D communication system. In addition, to overcome the problem of energy at D2D transmitter and receivers, wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is used. Considering these issues, the objective of the proposed scheme is to maintain energy efficient communication among D2D transmitters and receivers without compromising energy efficiency (EE) of cellular users. To solve the fractional form of an optimization problem, we employ the Dinkelbach method. A many-to-many matching game approach is used for channel allocation and successive convex approximation for low complexity (SCALE) is used to control the power of the D2D transmitter. The simulation results demonstrate that by maximizing the EE and optimizing the time and transmission power of D2D groups, the energy efficiency of the network can be significantly improved in comparison to the other competitive schemes in the existing literature.},

The availability of energy in EH-WBANs, however, is challenged by uncertainty of harvested energy sources and limited charging efficiency, and thus the energy saving is still of great importance. To improve energy efficiency, this paper studies the sleep scheduling problem in EH-WBANs, which is of fundamental importance for network lifetime and connectivity while being not systematically addressed. Technically, this problem is proved to be NP-Complete, and thus needs non-trivial efforts to deal with. To that end, we present a series of approximation algorithms with proven performance from perspective of constructing minimum dominating set (DS), where energy saving and energy harvesting techniques are combined to prolong the network lifetime while guaranteeing real-time requirement of EH-WBANs. Specifically, we first propose a centralized algorithm that can construct DS with minimum size and discover the maximum number of DSs. We then design two distributed algorithms independent of prior global knowledge to improve network scalability, namely EEU and Improved EEU respectively.

This game-changing technology is especially important for stepping into the Internet of Everything (IoE) era, where high performance is demanded with very limited available resources. In this paper, we study a backscatter-assisted wireless powered communication network (BS-WPCN), in which a number of energy-constrained users, powered by a power station (PS), transmit information to an access point (AP) via backscatter and active wireless information transfer, with their communication being aided by an IRS. Using a practical energy harvesting (EH) model which is able to capture the characteristics of realistic energy harvesters, we investigate the maximization of total network throughput. Specifically, IRS reflection coefficients, PS transmit and AP receive beamforming vectors, power and time allocation are designed through a two-stage algorithm, assuming minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver at the AP. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed via extensive numerical simulations. We also show that our proposed scheme is readily applicable to practical IRS-aided networks with discrete phase shift values.},

The widely used Diffie-Hellman key exchange is vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack due to its lack of mutual authentication. This paper presents a novel in-band solution for defending the MITM attack during the key establishment process for wireless devices. Our solution is based on the insight that an attacker inevitably affects the link layer behavior of the wireless channel, and this behavior change introduced by the attacker can be detected by legitimate users. Specifically, we propose a key exchange protocol and its corresponding channel access mechanism for the protocol message transmission, in which the Diffie-Hellman parameter is transmitted multiple times in a row without being interrupted by other data transmissions on the same channel. The proposed key exchange protocol forces the MITM attacker to cause multiple packet collisions consecutively at the receiver side, which can then be monitored by the proposed detection algorithm. The performance of the proposed solution is validated through both analysis and simulations and the results show that the proposed solution is secure against the MITM attack and can achieve a low false positive ratio. The proposed solution is in-band, and can be implemented on off-the-shelf wireless devices.},

Such status quo motivates the development of new radio (NR) based access to the unlicensed band, which is a promising solution for system performance enhancement. In this paper, we focus on the coexistence between the NR system and the WiFi system based on the duty cycle mechanism. Firstly, an optimization model is formulated to maximize the throughput of the NR system in the unlicensed band (NR-U) via the joint bandwidth and transmission opportunity allocation under the fairness requirement. Then, to solve this optimization problem, we convert it into a Markov decision process with continuous action space, based on which a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based coexistence algorithm is proposed. At last, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can ensure the coexistence between the NR-U system and the WiFi system from three aspects. Firstly, the throughput improvements of the NR-U system under different fairness thresholds and different number of user equipments and access points are illustrated. Secondly, the proposed algorithm adapts to the dynamic situations of varying fairness thresholds and channel conditions. Thirdly, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated with at least 5.01% throughput improvement by comparing with proportional scheme, average scheme and Q-learning scheme.},

Moreover, in order to obtain further insights on the impact of key parameters on the system performance, asymptotic EC expressions which become very tight at low- and high-signal-to-noise ratio regimes, are obtained. Using the proposed EC lower bound as well as these asymptotic results, simple closed-form expressions for the optimal time split that maximize the achievable EC are derived. Numerically evaluated results accompanied with Monte-Carlo simulations are further presented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is one of the driving forces for revolutionizing wireless communications in the modern era. Although there are many unique features of UAV networks, their widespread use is still hampered by the short battery life. As a result, most of the research efforts in this domain mainly have focused on the efficient use of energy through trajectory planning and cooperative communication. While there have been a few proposals to use energy harvesting techniques for UAV networks, a complete understanding of the performance limits of such networks is still missing in the literature and needs further investigations. Within this context, our paper provides a comprehensive performance evaluation of UAV relay networks (UAVRNs) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, a cooperative communication system, where a UAV serves as a mobile relay, is fully considered. The UAV relay is considered to be wirelessly-powered and harvests energy from the radio signals received from a nearby base station. For the sake of comparison, both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols are considered. Subsequently, the closed-form expressions of outage probabilities and ergodic capacities are provided for each UAV relaying protocol. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions. The results provided in this work characterize the outage and ergodic capacity performance of NOMA-enabled UAVRNs.},

  abstract     = {Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) finds various applications like assisted living and driver behavior monitoring. As radar data are heavily environment-dependent, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a transfer learning mechanism that enables a radar-based HAR system with desirable cross-environment adaptation feasibility. This paper concerns the issue of how radar-based HAR system can adapt to a new environment without source data. To this end, we devote to using the source hypothesis transfer learning architecture to build such an environment adaptation mechanism towards cross-environment radar-based HAR. In doing this, it is a challenging task to develop a reliable self-supervised labeling strategy for generating pseudo labels associated with the unlabeled target data, which is crucial to facilitate the learning of a target-specific feature extractor being responsible for environment adaptation. This paper presents the neighbor-aggregating-based labeling method and incorporates it with the existing clustering-based labeling method to perform the self-supervised labeling task. The logic behind our approach is that the above two labeling methods are complementary to each other in terms of making use of both local and global structures of adaptation data to supervise the labeling task. The coordination of both labeling methods is motivated to be implemented in the weighted combination form, which contributes to improving the reliability of generated labels. Experimental results on a public HAR dataset based on the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {It is known that interference alignment (IA) plays an important role in improving the degree of freedom (DoF) of multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) systems. However, most of the traditional IA schemes suffer from the high computational complexity and require the global and instantaneous channel state information (CSI), both of which make them difficult to be extended to cellular MIMO systems. To handle these issues, two new IA schemes, i.e., the retrospective interference regeneration (RIR) scheme and the beamforming based distributed retrospective interference alignment (B-DRIA) scheme, are proposed for cellular &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -user MIMO downlink networks. For the RIR scheme, it adopts interference elimination algorithm to erase redundant symbols in inter-cell interference (ICI) signals, and then uses interference regeneration algorithm to avoid secondary interference. The RIR scheme obtains greater DoF gain than the retrospective interference alignment (RIA) scheme, but incurs performance degradation when the transceiver antennas ratio (TAR) approaches 1. Therefore, the B-DRIA scheme is further proposed. For the B-DRIA scheme, the cellular beamforming matrix is introduced to eliminate the ICI, and meanwhile distributed RIA algorithm is adopted to align inter-user interference (IUI). The simulation results show that the B-DRIA scheme obtains larger DoF than the RIR scheme locally. Specifically, when TAR approaches 1, two schemes obtain the same DoF. While TAR approaches 2, the DoF of the B-DRIA scheme is superior than the RIR scheme.},

Examples of such multi-function system include joint radar and communication (JRC) systems and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. By abstracting the system functionalities as a joint optimization problem of multiple queues, we achieve effective resistance against jammers for the multi-functions simultaneously. We incorporate different anti-jamming techniques into one framework. Deception mechanism is adopted to lure the jammer to attack and make its actions more predictable, and ambient backscatter technology is used to leverage the jamming signals. Since conventional Markov decision process (MDP) has only one decision epoch at every time slot, it cannot be used to model the deception strategy which needs two decision epochs to leverage the jamming signals. We therefore formulate the problem using an advanced two-step MDP. After that, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with a prioritized double deep Q-Learning architecture is proposed to learn optimal strategies in different system states. We show that by jointly considering the multi-functions of the system with potential jamming attacks during design phase, significant improvement can be achieved for both of the system functionalities.},

  abstract     = {The previous Photodiode-only (PD-only) VLP systems might not provide an accurate positioning solution in an interference environment. Meanwhile, the previous camera-only VLP systems might need a specific camera with a high resolution and a large Field Of View (FOV). This article proposes a Visible Light Positioning (VLP) system (FusionVLP) based on the fusion of the measurements from a standard PD and a low-cost camera to compensate their individual deficiencies, thus improving VLP accuracy and achieving great potential for low-cost deployment. FusionVLP has an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) module for real-time positioning and a Fixed-Lag Ensemble Kalman Smoother (FLEnKS) module for semi-real-time positioning for different application requirements. Furthermore, a new two-step adjusted PD Received Signal Strength (RSS) model with adaptive parameter training is proposed to mitigate the model error of the traditional model, thus improving VLP accuracy. To further enhance the positioning accuracy, a novel positioning method based on a typical rectangular ceiling pattern is proposed, thus providing a camera-based specific position measurement for data fusion and improving the positioning by 36.27% (2D) and 35.61% (3D). The field experiments in an interference environment show that FusionVLP achieves the accuracy of 8.67 cm (2D)/12.15 cm (3D) using FLEnKS.},

We use a posterior beam based statistical channel model which includes the channel aging and the spatial correlation. We consider the problem of maximizing the expected sum-rate under a total power constraint. By replacing the expected sum-rate with their deterministic equivalents, we obtain the structure of the optimal linear precoders. The columns of the optimal precoding matrices are the generalized eigen-vectors of two matrices. One of the two matrices is related to the transmitted signal of the intended user, and the other is related to the power constraint and the leakage to other users. Furthermore, the two matrices are also functions of the precoders, thus iterative updates of the precoder are needed. Then, we investigate the power allocation and the computation of the Lagrangian multiplier, and propose an iterative algorithm based on the structure of the optimal precoders. Simulation results show that the proposed precoders can achieve significantly performance gain than the widely used regularized zero forcing (RZF) precoder and signal to leakage plus noise ratio (SLNR) precoder.},

In particular, a fractal ME dipole antenna with four modified second-order Minikowski structures is firstly designed, where an aperture size of 0.38λ 0 ×0.38λ 0 is achieved. Herein, the antenna gain is dropped with the size reduction. Then a capacitive RIS structure is designed and loaded to improve the antenna gain and further lower down the antenna operating frequency range. With the RIS structure, the antenna gain is increased by around 4 dB, and the operating center frequency is shifted to left side by 9.0 GHz, thus achieving a further size reduction. Simulation and measurement results are provided to demonstrate the excellent properties of the proposed antenna. Subsequently, the antenna is arranged into a 5 mm-spaced (half wavelength at 30 GHz) 16-element uniform linear array.

OTFS is a recent two-dimensional transmission scheme with promising robustness against the time and frequency selectivity of the time-varying wireless channel, and IQ impairment arises from inevitable imperfections between in-phase and quadrature branches in the transceiver design. In this paper, the mathematical model is presented to illustrate the physical effect of the IQ mismatched transmitter in OTFS, which results in a new type of interference named mirror-Doppler interference (MDI), occurring only along the Doppler axis. Moreover, a closed-form expression for the average bit error rate (BER) of OTFS with IQ imbalanced transmitter is derived taking into account M-ary symbol with a constant envelope and maximum likelihood (ML) detection principle. Importantly, our findings prove that IQ imbalanced transmitter causes a significant reduction in the diversity gain of OTFS transmission, but does not lead to an error floor in the BER performance as in one-dimensional current communication systems. Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to validate the derived mathematical formulas for OTFS transmission with constant envelope M-ary symbols under different system configurations.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to its low transceiver complexity, mode division multiplexing (MDM) using orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been recently investigated as a new physical layer wireless transmission technique. This is due to the fact that different OAM modes are spatially orthogonal to each other, thus, perfectly suitable for spatial multiplexing and/or diversity. The orthogonality amongst different OAM modes is achieved in the absence of any mode offset between the transceivers’ phase-shifting feeding networks. However, the inherent presence of OAM mode offset destroys the orthogonality between different modes, which gives rise to inter-mode interference (IMI). Therefore, in this paper, in order to theoretically analyze the negative impact of OAM mode offset of MDM-OAM systems on the spectral efficiency of line-of-sight free-space wireless communication systems, an explicit signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio expression for each OAM mode is derived, through which the spectral efficiency degradation is evaluated. Furthermore, in order to support our theoretical analysis, a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$9\times 9$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; MDM-OAM practical communication experiment for different OAM mode settings is carried out at a microwave frequency of 5.8 GHz. In addition, by leveraging the fact that all circulant matrices always have the same eigendirections, regardless of the entries of the matrix, a low-complexity optimal OAM mode selection scheme is proposed which significantly improves the spectral efficiency of the system. Finally, in order to completely null-out the impact of OAM mode offset, a baseband zero-forcing stage is embedded at the receiver.},

They are to be deployed in densely crowded environments, where the traffic load has a high degree of variability, which may introduce capacity bottlenecks. One of the options to alleviate the latter is to concurrently utilize the radio resources available in unlicensed mmWave bands, e.g., at 60 GHz. In this work, we address the coexistence of mmWave-based NR Unlicensed (NR-U) and WiGig technologies and account for the mmWave-specific directionality, propagation, and blockage effects. By further incorporating the features of duty cycling and random access operation, we construct a mathematical framework, which is capable of characterizing the achievable data rates of the NR-U users that operate over both licensed and unlicensed mmWave spectrum simultaneously. Our numerical results demonstrate that the rate attained by such devices is primarily regulated by the initial contention window size that, in its turn, heavily depends on the system and environmental parameters. We report the optimal contention window values for a wide range of blocker and user densities as well as antenna array configurations.},

In particular, we consider a real scenario in which the sampling clock offset is randomly changing and, in addition, the receiver has no information about the instantaneous channel coefficient as well as instantaneous timing error. Moreover, we consider a general case with signal dependent noise. For the considered scenario, for a conventional receiver with one sampler, we propose an iterative detection method based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the presence of large values of sampling clock offset, shifted error is the dominant error. Hence, in order to reduce the impact of shifted error probability, we propose an iterative data detection method for a receiver which utilizes two shifted samplers. The proposed iterative detection method only requires a series of simple addition and multiplication operation and does not require to solve any integral equations. A set of simulation results are provided to study the system performance for the proposed detection methods. Simulation results demonstrate that for a receiver with two samplers, by using the proposed EM-based detector, we can achieve bit error rate performance very close to the ideal receiver that perfectly knows the instantaneous channel coefficient and sampling clock offset.},

  abstract     = {Analysis on the exact error rate of jointly optimal (JO) maximum likelihood (ML) multiuser detection is limited in the existing literature owing to its high computational complexity. In this paper, the JO ML detection of two quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signals with an arbitrary relative phase offset is investigated. Exact, analytical symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER) formulas are derived for two users with no less than 3 dB power difference between them. Closed-form union bounds on the user SER and BER with an arbitrary phase offset and an arbitrary user power ratio are also given as a simpler approach to acquire the asymptotic error rate performance. Furthermore, insights on the potentials and properties of the JO ML detector regarding its error rate behaviors for each user are revealed through comparisons with the successive interference cancellation receiver. The accuracies of the obtained formulas are demonstrated through simulation. The results show the error rates for the two-user QPSK case no longer follow the classic knowledge on the error rate behaviors in the single signal detection. In addition, the performance and dB penalty employing different modulation types are also compared and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Indoor location-based services (LBS) have exhibited large commercial and social values in smart cities, and urgent demands of which have spurred many localization techniques. Existing indoor localization approaches mostly rely on fingerprint techniques, leveraging either spatially discrete fingerprints or temporally consecutive ones for localization. However, these approaches often suffer from large errors or high time overhead in practice due to signal ambiguities or long input sequences. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a framework utilizing multiple adaptive representations of signal sequences for localization, where each representation indicates a corresponding signal structure with underlying location clues. As an example, the proposed approach takes geomagnetic signal sequences as input and infers location features from two intuitive representations, e.g., spatial and temporal ones. With adaptive signal representations, the proposed approach takes specifically optimized neural networks to extract corresponding location clues respectively and fuses them to generate more distinguishing features for more accurate localization. Furthermore, the ensemble learning mechanism is adopted in the approach and a weighted k-NN based location estimation algorithm is devised to enhance the robustness. Extensive experiments in three different trial sites demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art competing schemes by a wide margin, reducing mean localization error by more than 46%.},

Moreover, a noise decontamination method is designed for the GCI-DM-DCSK-FM system to enhance the BER performance. To confirm the validness for our proposed systems, we derive the BER expressions of the GCI-DM-DCSK-FM system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels.

Further, we use the alternating optimization technique to determine the jointly optimal power allocation and time switching factors that minimize the system outage probability.

Specifically, we first develop the architecture for the asymmetrical transceiver where the number of receive RF chains is different from that of the transmit RF chains. Due to this unequal number of RF chains, channel inconsistency appears. To overcome the channel inconsistency and thus fully harness the system&#39;s downlink data transmission capability, we propose two uplink-to-downlink channel transfer algorithms. The cost and power consumption models for the asymmetrical transceiver are also developed and the uplink signal-to-noise loss due to the channel inconsistency is investigated. Through analyzing system spectral, cost, and energy efficiency, we demonstrate that the proposed asymmetrical transceiver-based massive MIMO system can achieve excellent downlink spectral efficiency while maintaining a reasonable energy efficiency.},

Thus, in this paper, we propose a UAV-aided covert communication scheme assisted by a multi-antenna jammer to maximize the transmission rate between a ground transmitter and a UAV receiver against several randomly distributed wardens. The transmitter adopts the maximum ratio transmission, while the jammer zero-forces its transmitted signal at the UAV to disturb the monitoring at wardens without interfering the legitimate transmission. First, we analyze the detection performance and derive the optimal threshold for each warden to minimize its detection outage probability (DOP). Then, with the worst situation in which all wardens set their respective optimal thresholds to achieve the minimum global DOP, the location and the transmit power of the jammer are optimized to maximize the DOP. The location of UAV and the transmit power of the ground transmitter are also optimized to maximize the transmission rate with the minimum DOP requirement satisfied.

However, the quality of service (QoS) of RWCS is affected by external interference and jamming seriously in railway transportation. The external interference and jamming generated from intentional and/or unintentional sources can disturb the transmission of RWCS and be extremely dangerous for the trains’ safety. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) approach is proposed to suppress the interference and jamming in RWCS. By taking the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) as the QoS metrics, the interference suppression problem with RIS is transformed into a maximizing receiving SINR problem. Two optimum solutions, which one is based on Charnes-Cooper transformation and the other is based on single linear programming, are provided. In order to deploy the RIS in RWCS practically, two low-complexity sub-optimum solutions, which one is to bypass the channel estimation for interference links and the other is to maximize the receiving desired power, are also discussed. The simulations results show that the RIS can be employed in RWCS with considerable anti-interference gain.},

It leverages the unique influence of the target&#39;s gait on surrounding wireless signals to achieve identity recognition in a contact-free and device-free manner. Existing device-free gait recognition methods could achieve good accuracy when a target walks along a predetermined path. However, the accuracy will drop dramatically when a target walks along an arbitrary path. This is due to the fact that different paths will exert different influence on the wireless signals. In order to address this issue, we develop a path-independent device-free gait recognition system, which can recognize the identity of a person no matter what path he/she walks. Specifically, we propose a novel robust path-independent gait spectrogram construction method, which leverages location information and doppler spectrogram to generate corrective velocity spectrogram so as to approximate the actual velocity spectrogram, and utilizes an energy normalization strategy to eliminate the influence of path on spectrogram energy so as to achieve the independence of the walking path. Based on the path-independent gait spectrogram, we use a convolutional neural network to extract deep features and accomplish the gait recognition task. Experimental results conducted on a 77 GHz mmWave testbed, and achieve the average accuracies of 91% and 87% in the non-radial straight path and curve path, respectively, when 10 targets are trained in the radial path.},

  abstract     = {Free-space optics (FSO) communication is often unreliable, especially for long distances, as it suffers from attenuation due to foggy weather, atmospheric turbulence, and pointing errors. To avoid communication link failure, radio frequency (RF) communication, which is unaffected from these effects, is utilized when FSO communication is in outage. Diversity is known to counteract the adverse fading effects, therefore, this paper presents a transmit aperture/antenna selection (TAS) and selection combining (SC)-based multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) hybrid FSO/RF system. The proposed system consists of a MIMO FSO and RF sub-systems. The MIMO FSO sub-system is given higher priority to transmit and receive using the selected best link. The best link of the MIMO RF sub-system is used when the FSO sub-system is in outage. The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) expressions for TAS/SC-based MIMO FSO and RF sub-systems are derived. The derived PDF and CDF expressions are used further to derive the exact and asymptotic expressions for outage probability, average symbol error rate (SER), and capacity of the hybrid system. From the asymptotic SER expressions, the diversity order of the proposed system is determined. The optimum values for the threshold SNR and transmit beam waist, which minimize the average SER, are obtained. Further, the obtained optimal values using analytical expressions are verified using numerical optimization technique. The effect of multiple apertures/antennas, pointing errors, and atmospheric attenuation over the system performance is analyzed extensively by varying the FSO and RF channel parameters. The results show that the proposed hybrid FSO/RF system is more reliable compared to the individual MIMO FSO and RF systems and achieves higher capacity compared to the MIMO RF system.},

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve performance close to the exhaustive search algorithm, comparable to the hierarchical decomposition algorithm using the optimal subcarrier allocation scheme, and better than other benchmark algorithms.

Overall, the results indicate that IEEE 802.11p can satisfy safety-related requirements even as vehicles move with high velocity in heavily congested networks. For other kinds of applications, the performance might be compromised, especially under congestion, but figures attest that these networks may also serve additional purposes unanticipated when the standard was introduced.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design a kind of robust rateless multi-user code, which is called spatially coupled repeat-accumulate-repeat (SC-RA-R) code, for the interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) system. The code is constructed by serially concatenating a fixed outer spatially coupled repeat-accumulate (SC-RA) code with an adjustable inner irregular repetition code. It achieves rateless property by simply adjusting the parameters of the inner repetition code. The IDMA system with the proposed SC-RA-R multi-user codes can adapt to varying channel qualities and varying number of users via rateless property while keeping encoder and decoder implementation unchanged. Analytical extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions are derived to determine belief propagation (BP) decoding thresholds of SC-RA-R codes on the IDMA system. The optimization expression is also given under the constraint that repeat parameters are monotonically non-decreasing with the sum rate decreasing. The numerical results show that the maximum achievable sum rates of the SC-RA-R codes can be close to the Shannon bound for arbitrary channel qualities. Besides, our proposed SC-RA-R codes have better BP thresholds and bit-error-rate (BER) performances than the conventional optimal parallel-concatenate codes (PCC) and the optimal partially repeated spatially coupled low-density parity-check (PR-SC-LDPC) codes on IDMA systems.},

  abstract     = {To achieve ultra-low latency for ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) in fifth-generation (5G) systems, open-loop communications (OLC), which removes the time-consuming feedback procedure, has been proposed as a promising technique, especially for uplink transmission (UL). The performance of the OLC has been commonly analysed under a uniform user distribution model. Since the users are commonly clustered around highly populated areas, a clustered or non-uniform user distribution model is more realistic. However, the performance analysis under a clustered user distribution model is not trivial. In this paper, we therefore aim to analyse the OLC network performance under a clustered user distribution. We also investigate how to achieve URLLC by jointly employing the OLC mode, short packet transmission, multi-cell association and diversity schemes such as selection combining (SC) and maximum ratio combining (MRC). We provide a tractable approach to analyse the UL reliability and its approximated closed form. The simulation results show that the derived closed form can provide a reasonable approximation for the UL reliability when the SC algorithm is employed. Moreover, for the case of MRC, the analytical results can provide a tight approximation on the uplink reliability when the number of the associated BSs is lower than 2, while serving as a corresponding upper bound when the number of the associated BSs is larger than 2.},

  abstract     = {Radar radio source (RRS) recognition plays an important role in the fields of military electronic support systems (ESM) and civilian autonomous driving. The rapid development of machine learning technology, especially deep learning, has effectively and efficiently improved RRS intelligent recognition performances when operating in the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment. However, the data sampling limitation and computation cost are still severe challenges in real RRS recognition scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel network based on meta-transfer learning, called RRSARNet, to achieve effective adaptive RRS recognition in the context of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). First, by using the short-time Fourier transform, a six-type small samples RRS simulation dataset with different SNR levels is constructed. Then, a novel RRSARNet, based on metric learning, is proposed, which consists of a four-layer embedding module and a four-layer relational module. Finally, the RRS dataset is divided into training, supporting and testing subsets, which are used to train and test the RRSARNet in a meta-transfer learning method. Experiments on the RRS dataset show that the proposed RRSARNet can achieve an overall accuracy (OA) above 96% and 99% when the SNR is above −15 dB and −10 dB, respectively. Even when the SNR is -30 dB, OA can reach more than 70%. For 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot experiments, the inference time of an image is about 0.043 and 0.140 milliseconds, respectively. Besides, experiments on the RRS simulation dataset and the two benchmark datasets, the RRSARNet performs better or more competitive than many existing state-of-the-art technologies in terms of recognition accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes and analyzes the performance of two simple transmission protocols for a multiuser massive multiple input multiple-output relaying system, where K single-antenna users transmit data to a massive-antenna destination through an N-antenna relay node. In the first transmission protocol, the relay does not need to know the CSI. It just amplifies and forwards the received signals to the destination. In the second protocol, the relay first estimates the channels from all users. It then uses the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) technique to combine all received signals and forwards them to the destination. In both protocols, the destination estimates the channels and employs MRC to decode the signals. We propose an efficient channel estimation method at the destination in which the destination estimates only the effective channels gains. As a consequence, the channel estimation overhead does not depend on the numbers of relay and destination antennas. We derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the two transmission protocols. These results allow us to further analyze the system performance and to allocate the transmit powers. Particularly, a max-min power control algorithm is proposed which selects the transmit powers at the relay and users to maximize the lowest spectral efficiency of all users. We show that, by using the max-min power allocation algorithm, the spectral efficiency can be increased significantly, compared to uniform power allocation. Furthermore, if the distance between the users and the relay is large, the first transmission protocol is better and vice versa if this distance is small.},

Although the sensor fusion is often carried out by Kalman filter, graph optimization can obtain better state estimation.

In this paper, an improved preintegration method for GNSS/IMU/in-vehicle sensors navigation using graph optimization is proposed. Different from current methods, the preintegration that involves total error parameters of in-vehicle sensors is derived. The improved factors are subsequently fused with GNSS measurements and kinematic models using graph optimization, which can allow to yield a total parameters estimation. Thereby, more accurate relative constraints provided by the proposed method can improve the positioning accuracy compared with traditional preintegration methods. Meanwhile, the estimation accuracy of the proposed method for these error parameters can be superior to Kalman filter. The KITTI datasets and field tests are carried out to validate the competitive performance of the proposed method. Finally, the computational load of the proposed method is also discussed to verify its applicability for real-time operations.},

This paper applies advanced multi-factors coupling aging model and bi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to derive suitable charging patterns for LIBs at low temperatures. Based on the results of orthogonal experiments, which consider the effects of charging rate, charging temperature and charging cut-off voltage on battery aging, the low-temperature capacity degradation model was established. Furthermore, two important yet competing charging objectives, including battery health and charging time, are taken into account simultaneously. These two conflicting charging objectives are traded off by solving a bi-objective optimization problem based on battery electrothermal and aging behavior. Combined with PSO algorithm, the optimal low-temperature charging strategy is obtained. As a result, the three-stage constant current and constant voltage (CC-CV) charging strategy is optimized to balance various combinations of charging objectives. Different tradeoffs are compared and analyzed based on the Pareto frontiers. The verification results show that the optimized three-stage CC-CV charging strategy can effectively offer feasible health-conscious charging with desirable tradeoffs among charging speed and battery health under low-temperature charging conditions.},

The limitation not only comes from the restriction of their own torque output capacity, but also comes from the additional constraints that are established to avoid power reverse undershoot. In order to improve the system performance under time-varying torque constraints, a real-time model predictive controller (MPC) that manipulates the torque commands of the engine and the generator to track the reference power is designed. Different from the traditional penalty function method, the quadratic function is taken as the penalty function in this paper, which greatly improves the efficiency of solving the optimal solution. Meanwhile, the steady-state torque command in the feasible region is taken as the extreme point of the quadratic penalty function, which avoids the penalty coefficient tending to infinity. By adjusting the penalty coefficients of different constraints, the overall optimal solution approaches the boundary of the active inequality constraints. And according to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, it is proved that the optimal solution of the original problem can be obtained through iteration. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed strategy are evaluated through numerical simulations on Simulink and experiments on a range extender.},

The GNSS/INS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems/Inertial Navigation System) is currently the most widely-used integrated navigation scheme for land vehicles, which is capable of provide high-accuracy and continuous positioning results in the open-sky environments. However, under the GNSS-denied conditions, the existing GNSS/INS integrated system often fails to provide reliable positioning results due to various and nonlinear errors contained in the MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements. To improve the positioning accuracy during GNSS outage, deep learning has been introduced into the GNSS/INS integrated system in recent years. In this paper, we propose a residual attention network-based confidence (i.e., measurement noise covariance) estimation algorithm for non-holonomic constraint in GNSS/INS integrated navigation system, which adopts a residual attention network to dynamically estimate the noise covariance of the pseudo-observation (i.e., non-holonomic constraint) for optimal Kalman filtering (KF) fusion. To emphasize the more representative features with larger weights for accurate noise covariance estimation, we introduce an attention mechanism to automatically assign proper weights to the learned features according to their contributions. We evaluate our proposed method on three practical road datasets and compare it with other seven methods including the traditional KF, Pure INS, KF with three deep learning networks, K-means, and the Input-Delayed Neural Networks based method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RA-NHC bounds the errors associated with velocities and achieves reasonable accuracy improvement in position and velocity estimation.},

First, to optimize the total harmonic distortion of the traction grid-side current, the inner loop controller is designed as the feedback linearization control. Then, the voltage outer loop is designed as a combination of the VIC designed in this paper and SMO, which enhances the system inertia and reduces the impact of external interference on the system, while reducing the controller&#39;s demand for electrical power on the DC-side. Furthermore, a small-signal model is established to analyze the stability of the single-phase vehicle-grid system under the proposed control. The influence of the control parameters on stability is discussed in detail. Finally, the comparison of software simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimental results between traditional PI control, feedback linearization control, feedback+SMO, feedback+VIC and the proposed control method shows that the proposed control has better dynamic and static characteristics, and can effectively inhibit the occurrence of LFO.},

In order to identify the parameters of the equivalent electric model, the identification current profile is often a pulse of charge or discharge. Subsequently, these models are validated with a current verification profile. However, the verification profile compared to the identification profile is more dynamic in amplitude and frequency, producing validation errors due to the identification signal&#39;s limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a novel Pulse – Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (Pulse – PRBS) identification current profile, with similar spectral characteristics to the verification profile, in order to improve the modeling accuracy. The parameters of a Lithium-ion battery and a supercapacitor are obtained with this new identification current profile and the Optimization Toolbox of Matlab, using the electrical models in Simulink or Simscape. Finally, the models are validated with the Urban Driving Cycle ECE-15 and the Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) for electric vehicle applications.},

  abstract     = {One of the challenges with the dynamic inductive power transfer (DIPT) technique is the electric vehicle detection (EVD) that helps the DIPT system to control the power supply of the transmitter. The EVD method applying auxiliary coils is a promising candidate because the flat shape of the auxiliary coils is suitable for the compact design. However, the EVD may fail when the metallic foreign object (MFO) is present. Therefore, the desire emerges in the integration design of the EVD and foreign object detection (FOD). The FOD can ensure the reliability of the EVD as well as the highly efficient operation of the DIPT system without MFOs. In this context, this paper proposes an integrated solution to the EVD and FOD well suited for DIPT systems. The integrated solution utilizes both passive coil sets (PCSs) and active coil sets (ACSs). Additionally, a novel detection resonant circuit (DRC) is proposed to realize EVD and FOD using the same coil sets and to amplify the measurement sensitivity. The operation mechanisms, the detection coil sets architecture, the design of the proposed resonant circuits and the detection procedure are detailed. Finally, a printed circuit board based prototype is built to validate the integrated functionality of the EVD and FOD in a DIPT prototype processing 1 kW output. Experiments considering the practical DIPT application scenarios are conducted, and the proposed detection method is able to achieve advantageously high sensitivity and no blind zone.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a path tracking controller to assist the electronic-four-wheel drive (e-4WD) vehicle in following the desired path profile. It utilizes only readily available in-vehicle sensors and a standalone global positioning system (GPS). Noteworthy, both the lateral distance error and the heading angle error between the desired path profile and the vehicle are calculated using only a standalone GPS. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can be easily applied to mass-produced e-4WD vehicles. A model predictive control (MPC) is selected as the controller type, which derives optimal control input considering both state and input constraints of in-wheel motor (IWM) in the e-4WD vehicle. Due to the advantage of this MPC predicting the vehicle&#39;s future dynamic behavior in advance, it is possible to output a more preemptive and stable yaw moment for vehicle path tracking. Finally, a weighted least square (WLS) allocation that is suitable for redundant actuator configuration is utilized to distribute the optimal IWM torques to the front left and right wheels of the e-4WD vehicle. The major contributions of the proposed control algorithm are as follows. 1) It is the first time in this paper that the MPC is applied to path tracking of e-4WD vehicles. 2) The condensed constraint matrix of the proposed MPC has a structure that can be easily applied to the linear programming. Using the CarSim simulation and the real-car based experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed MPC algorithm is verified by a comparative analysis. Thus, the high path tracking accuracy of the proposed algorithm is confirmed.},

With this vision in mind, security researchers have proposed diverse authentication protocols vital for the electric vehicle charging system to protect the information exchanged between the various principals involved. Several existing authentication techniques, on the other hand, are either vulnerable to significant security threats or are limited to static charging. This article proposes a robust authentication mechanism for charging electric vehicles while driving, a scenario that is rapidly approaching in the future. The proposed protocol makes use of secure and lightweight primitives such as elliptic curves and hash functions. The proposed protocol&#39;s security is being analyzed to demonstrate that it is capable of withstanding relevant attacks.

  abstract     = {An electronic toll collection (ETC) system is one of the most important parts of an intelligent transportation system (ITS), but existing ETC systems are not efficient and have vehicle fee evasion complications. Owing to the traceability and tamper resistance of a blockchain, the combination of a blockchain and ETC system is a feasible way to solve the above problems. However, traditional blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) has high power consumption and low efficiency. Hence, it cannot be used in ETC systems with high throughput and is not suitable for power-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this study, therefore, we propose a blockchain architecture for the ETC system. To curb vehicle fee evasion behavior, thereby reducing the economic loss caused, we propose a vehicle behavior management mechanism based on credit value. Furthermore, to reduce the burden of storage and build a chain of evidence for auditing purposes, we propose an evidence chain framework. To protect the data security in the transaction process, we designed a data protection method to encrypt the transaction data. Additionally, this system is based on an open-source alliance blockchain framework called Hyperledger Fabric, which is more in line with the current application scenarios of ETC systems. We implemented the system on a Raspberry Pi and carried out simulations. The comprehensive evaluation results and analysis show that the system effectively reduces the number of illegal acts, completes the evidence inspection, and improves the security of the data.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular fog computing (VFC) pushes the cloud computing capability to the distributed fog nodes at the edge of the Internet, enabling compute-intensive and latency-sensitive computing services for vehicles through task offloading. However, a heterogeneous mobility environment introduces uncertainties in terms of resource supply and demand, which are inevitable bottlenecks for the optimal offloading decision. Also, these uncertainties bring extra challenges to task offloading under the oblivious adversary attack and data privacy risks. In this article, we develop a new adversarial online learning algorithm with bandit feedback based on the adversarial multi-armed bandit theory, to enable scalable and low-complexity offloading decision making. Specifically, we focus on optimizing fog node selection with the aim of minimizing the offloading service costs in terms of delay and energy. The key is to implicitly tune the exploration bonus in the selection process and the assessment rules of the designed algorithm, taking into account volatile resource supply and demand. We theoretically prove that the input-size dependent selection rule allows to choose a suitable fog node without exploring the sub-optimal actions, and also an appropriate score patching rule allows to quickly adapt to evolving circumstances, which reduce variance and bias simultaneously, thereby achieving a better exploitation-exploration balance. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention architecture (HSTA), which activates the utilization of spatial interactions with different weights, and jointly considers the temporal interactions across time steps of all agents. More specially, the graph attention mechanism (GAT) is presented to capture spatial interactions, the multi-head attention mechanism (MHA) is conducted to encode temporal correlations of interactions and a state gated fusion (SGF) layer is used to integrate spatial and temporal interactions. We evaluate our proposed method against baselines on both pedestrian and vehicle datasets. The results show that our model is effective and achieves state-of-the-art achievements.},

In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight LiDAR-based localization system for autonomous vehicle in this paper. The proposed system only relies on lightweight poles and curbs landmark map, which is highly robust and efficient compared to other localization systems. Poles and curbs are selected as landmarks because of their commonality and stability. We novelly propose a Branch-and-Bound (BnB)-based global optimization method to tackle the data association problem of poles. Motion decoupling is adopted to decouple translation and rotation to improve the efficiency of the BnB-based algorithm. Besides, we propose a new local grid map-based representation for curbs to make better use of curb information. Cost functions for pole and curb are defined respectively and then fused for the subsequent non-linear optimization method to obtain the vehicle location.

The on-board grounding sub-system contains working and protective grounding modes, both of which share the rails as the common path for discharging current. Current reflux occurs frequently, which can contribute to the circumflux in the ‘train body – grounding wheel set – rail’ circle, due to the dynamic coupling effects between grounding points. The path and value of the circumflux vary transiently because of the changing impedance between the grounding wheels and rail under the dynamic conditions. In our previous work, a 2D grounding model was built to evaluate the impact from the current reflux, but the lateral and vertical impedances of train bodies and rails were ignored. In practice – when the protective and working grounding is applied independently to rails on the left- and right-hand side separately – the current reflux can be restricted by benefitting from the impedance existing in train bodies and rails. It therefore becomes essential to build a 3D ‘train–rail’ coupling grounding model accounting for the full-dimension impedances, while different grounding distribution protocols is considered to improve the grounding performance.},

Trajectory planning and tracking algorithms often rely on a simplified vehicle model to predict future vehicle states based upon control inputs, hence requiring accurate modeling and parameterization. On off-road deformable terrains this is a challenging task due to unknown terrain parameters and the complex interactions at tire-terrain interfaces, which pose issues in continuous differentiability, operating conditions, and computational time. To address these difficulties, in this paper, a neural network deformable terrain terramechanics model and its implementation within a terrain adaptive model predictive control algorithm is presented to improve vehicle safety and performance through more accurate prediction of the plant response. It is shown in simulations that the neural network is able to predict the lateral tire forces accurately and efficiently compared to the Soil Contact Model as a state-of-the-art model and is able to yield accurate bicycle model predictions. It is demonstrated that the implementation of the neural network within model predictive control can outperform both a baseline Pacejka-based and a rapidly exploring random tree controller by improving performance and allowing for more severe maneuvers to be completed that otherwise lead to failure when terrain deformations are not explicitly taken into account. The improved performance achieved through estimating terrain parameters online in an adaptive controller is highlighted against the nonadaptive realization.

The proposed architecture is robust strongly against different types of disturbances in the path tracking process by means of hierarchical decoupling. Firstly, in the upper-layer path tracking module, a robust model predictive control (MPC) method with a feedback correction term calculates the expected front-wheel steering angle. Secondly, in the lower-layer SBW module, a nonlinear high gain rack force observer is proposed to compensate for the generalized rack force disturbance. Then, an improved non-singular fast terminal sliding mode auxiliary control law based on the super-twisting algorithm is presented to attenuate the norm-bounded rack disturbance effectively. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed control architecture can improve the path tracking accuracy and has strong interference resistance and robustness against both modeled and unmodeled disturbances.},

Following the critic-actor scheme of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), cost function approximation and control policy generation are combined to formulate MPADP. The infinite horizon cost function of ADP is stacked over predictive horizon of model predictive control (MPC), and then the infinite horizon cost function is converted to the finite horizon-stacked cost function in MPADP. By minimizing the approximation error within predictive horizon, the approximation accuracy is enhanced. Considering the limitation of energy consumption, the event-triggered mechanism is designed based on the mismatch of cost function approximation. Three triggering conditions are designed, and the corresponding boundedness of approximation error is proved. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness, efficiency and feasibility in application of the event-triggered MPADP method for path planning at road intersection.},

Majority of existing models only focus on the interaction between the historical trajectory of the vehicle and the surrounding vehicles in the spatial domain, and do not pay attention to the interaction between the vehicle and the non-Euclidean correlation structure (graph structure) that exists in the environment. In order to overcome the deficiencies in the existing models, this paper proposes the Environment-Attention Network model (EA-Net) to obtain the full interactive information between the vehicle and its driving environment. In the proposed model, a new type of parallel structure consisting of Graph Attention network (GAT) and Convolutional social pooling containing Squeeze-and-Extraction mechanism (SE-CS), is constructed as the environmental feature extraction module and embedded in LSTM encoder-decoder. This structure solves the limitation of the dimension and structure influence when constructing the interaction model between the vehicle and the surrounding environment, making the extracted feature information comprehensive and effective. The prediction accuracy of the model with the RMSE loss function is tested on two public datasets– NGSIM and highD, and compared with several state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithm models. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed Environment-Attention Network in the two datasets is more than 20% higher than that of the single structure model, which indicates that the proposed model proposed has superior performance and better adaptability to different traffic environments compared with the existing models.},

  abstract     = {Recent improvements in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication and onboard computing power have enabled the development of control algorithms that jointly optimize the vehicle velocity and powertrain control in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), commonly referred to as the Eco-Driving problem. This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient algorithm to optimize the velocity planning and energy management in a CAV with a hybrid electric powertrain. The Eco-Driving problem is formulated as a dynamic, constrained optimization problem in the spatial domain, where information about the upcoming speed limits and road topography is assumed known. This problem is solved by embedding an Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) into a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimization to obtain a sub-optimal solution that provides results close to the global optimum at a fraction of the computational cost. Further, a multi-layer hierarchical control architecture is proposed as a path to a causal, real-time implementation. The DP-ECMS algorithm is converted into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework by using principles of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). This causal implementation is finally benchmarked to a global optimal solution obtained with DP for different scenarios.},

In this study, we use a wheel-mounted MEMS IMU (Wheel-IMU) to substitute the odometer, and further, investigate three types of measurement models, including the velocity measurement, displacement increment measurement, and contact point zero-velocity measurement, in the Wheel-IMU based DR system. The measurement produced by the Wheel-IMU along with the non-holonomic constraint (NHC) are fused with INS through an error-state extended Kalman filter (EKF). Theoretical discussion and field tests illustrate the feasibility and equivalence of the three measurements in terms of the overall DR performance. The maximum horizontal position drifts are all less than 2% of the total travelled distance. Additionally, the displacement increment measurement model is less sensitive to the lever arm error between the Wheel-IMU and the wheel center.},

  abstract     = {Considering the advantages of contactless fault diagnosis, a novel sound based fault diagnosis method for railway point machines (RPMs) is proposed. Firstly, a denoising method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is proposed. The useful intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are selected using kurtosis and energy criteria to reconstruct the denoised signal. Then, multi-scale fractional permutation entropy (MFPE) is proposed inspired by fractional calculus, which is more powerful than the classical multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE). And a two-scale algorithm is developed to avoid neglecting the information contained at the end of the signals in the coarse-graining process. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method (D-FMPE-T) based on denoising method and two-scale algorithm are verified using support vector machine optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM) through comparing with some commonly used feature extraction and classification methods. Besides, CWRU is also utilized for verification of the superiority of the proposed method. Experiment results show that the proposed method performs best. The identification accuracies on normal-reverse and reverse-normal switching processes, and CWRU data sets reach 99.3%, 99%, and 99.17% respectively, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The ACS-UEP index can accurately and consistently capture UEP properties over all ranges of SNR.

In this paper, we relax the linear trajectory restriction and present a temporally non-stationary channel model for UAV-to-ground communication scenario. The temporal non-stationarity of the channel stemming from time-varying heading directions of the UAV is properly modeled. This is achieved by combining a geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) and an aeronautic random mobility model (RMM), which is introduced to characterize the movement pattern of UAVs. Based on UAV and ground station (GS) trajectories, time-varying model parameters and statistics including space-time-frequency correlation function (STF-CF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), delay PSD, and stationary interval are derived. The influences of the RMM-related parameters on the statistics are presented and analyzed. Some of those statistics are verified by measurements, showing the practicability of the model.

The sparse signal reconstruction algorithm is used to obtain the optimal time-frequency reconstruction value of the original signal. Numerical simulations show the feasibility of this method. We simulate the effects of measurement noise, sampling rate, and time-frequency analysis parameters on the reconstruction accuracy. Our method can carry out time-frequency reconstruction for undersampled signals obtained from multi-coset sampling to ensure the time-varying feature of the original signals, which can well highlight the characteristics of signals.

Among authentication solutions for vehicular networks, group signature not only offers authentication services, but also provides conditional privacy preservation. However, the current group signature approach for authentication in vehicular networks exhibits time-consuming signature verification and poor scalability. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a flexible and efficient delay-aware authentication scheme (FEDAS) by utilizing edge computing paradigm. In the proposed architecture, we design the authentication group maintaining mechanism and develop the collaborative CRL management method. Moreover, we propose transition zone to solve the reliable authentication problem in border area of the group. To implement the proposed architecture, we propose a model for calculating the length of local CRL, which establishes the relationship between the size of a sub-area and the length of local CRL. And we also design a method for area division based on the length of local CRL, which provides division principle for our authentication scheme.

In this context, researchers have proposed the optimization of the transmit power of the devices to mitigate interference. This power allocation problem is generally modeled as a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with linear constraints; therefore, traditional optimization methods are ineffective in addressing the problem. In this paper, we apply a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize the transmit power for both DUEs and CUEs in the context of D2D communication underlaid uplink cellular networks, which can solve the optimization problem via optimal decision-making together with efficient deep network training. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm affords a near-global-optimum solution with lower computation complexity than exhaustive search, and outperforms the fixed-power, weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), gradient descent method, and Newton-Raphson approaches.},

This paper studies the impacts of asynchronous reception effects on cell-free distributed massive MIMO systems. We first derive the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation under the asynchronous reception effects. Given the estimated channel state information, we derive the closed-form expressions of the user achievable rates with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoders, which are further used to analyze the impacts of asynchronous reception effects. The accuracy of the closed-form expressions are verified. Simulation results demonstrate that asynchronous reception effects cause a non-negligible drop on the system spectral efficiency. Moreover, the performance degradation is proportional to the subcarrier sequence number and even more serious with the increasing of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or the number of antennas per RAU.},

Then, we propose a randomized rounding-based greedy user selection algorithm (RRGUSA) to get the approximate solution of the max k -cut from the SDP solution. For hybrid MRT, the minimum inter-user interference problem is more complicated. We first force the interference minimization problem of hybrid MRT to be a quasi-max k -cut problem according to the law of large numbers.

  abstract     = {We propose a deep learning-based channel estimation, quantization, feedback, and precoding method for downlink multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output systems. In the proposed system, channel estimation and quantization for limited feedback are handled by a receiver deep neural network (DNN). Precoder selection is handled by a transmitter DNN. To emulate the traditional channel quantization, a binarization layer is adopted at each receiver DNN, and the binarization layer is also used to enable end-to-end learning. However, this can lead to inaccurate gradients, which can trap the receiver DNNs at a poor local minimum during training. To address this, we consider knowledge distillation, in which the existing DNNs are jointly trained with an auxiliary transmitter DNN. The use of an auxiliary DNN as a teacher network allows the receiver DNNs to additionally exploit lossless gradients, which is useful in avoiding a poor local minimum. For the same number of feedback bits, our DNN-based precoding scheme can achieve a higher downlink rate compared to conventional linear precoding with codebook-based limited feedback.},

In the far-away target regime, we derive a closed-form expression of the DOP that reveals a linear asymptotic scaling law. We characterize the asymptotic DOP bounds, and equi-DOP surfaces/contours in 3D/2D localization scenarios, which quantifies the reliability of location estimates on the target&#39;s trajectory. Motivated by vehicular applications, we propose a range-aided dimension adaptation scheme. Here the localization dimension is adapted in real-time using a single range measurement such that the maximum/root-mean-square (rms) DOP does not exceed a threshold. Since high-accuracy localization of far-away targets is infeasible due to linear DOP scaling with distance, this scheme prioritizes high-dimensional tracking of nearby targets while monitoring far-away targets with range-only measurements.},

However, accurate channel estimation is a fundamental technical challenge for achieving large performance gains brought by RIS. To address this challenge, we first integrate a RIS with a small number of uniformly distributed active sensing devices, which are equipped with active radio frequency chains for acquiring partial channel state information (CSI). Then, by leveraging the rank-deficient structure of RIS channels, two practical residual neural networks, named single-scale enhanced deep residual (EDSR) and multi-scale enhanced deep residual (MDSR), are proposed to obtain accurate CSI, which can strike a balance between the system complexity and estimation performance. Simulation results reveal the cost-performance trade-off of the two proposed methods and unveil their superior performance compared with existing baseline schemes.},

Hybrid beamforming architecture provides excellent trade-off between the system performance and the complexity for the massive MIMO system. Hybrid beamforming architecture can be classified as fully-connected (FC) and sub-connected (SC) architecture. Existing studies on the system performance comparison of the two architectures are limited. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the FC and SC architecture in the multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system. We derive the closed-form sum rate of two architectures under the same total transmission power constraint. From the results, we conclude that the system performance of FC architecture is always better than that of SC architecture. When the number of users is small or the signal noise ratio (SNR) is low, the performance difference between the FC and SC architecture is small. Our analysis can serve as a guideline of choosing hybrid beamforming architectures.},

Classical approaches fail in this scenario due to lack of synchronization and lack of data association between multi-static measurements and users. To resolve this, we consider each user to be equipped with an RIS, and show that we can avoid the data association problem and estimate users’ 3D position with submeter accuracy in a large area around the transmitter, using time-of-arrival measurements at the RXs.

In this paper, we analyze error performance of the NOMA-CRS and the closed-form bit error probability (BEP) expression is derived over Nakagami-m fading channels. Then, thanks to the high performance of machine learning (ML) in challenging optimization problems, a joint power sharing-power allocation (PS-PA) scheme is proposed to minimize the bit error rate (BER) of the NOMA-CRS. The proposed ML-assisted optimization has a very low online implementation complexity. Based on provided extensive simulations, theoretical BEP analysis is validated. Besides, the proposed ML-aided PS-PA provides minimum BER (MBER) and outperforms previous PA strategies for the NOMA-CRS notably.},

The difficulty and complexity of the problem increase with MIMO radar systems and multiply even further with a growing number of vehicles present on the scene. A system of connected vehicles can efficiently address this problem by sharing information amongst themselves. In this paper, we propose an efficient waveform design algorithm that seeks to minimize a collective cross-ambiguity function. Vehicles that can talk to each other, can perform the design online in a collaborative manner, or offline, in which case the radar codes can be designed and stored in a codebook for future use. The proposed coding scheme is computationally efficient for practical use and the incorporation of such schemes requires only a slight modification of the existing systems. Our numerical examples indicate that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the interference power level in a desired area of the radar cross-ambiguity functions.},

Inspired by the ideas of quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) and quadrature space-frequency index modulation (QSF-IM), parts of the space-frequency resource units in each resource block (RB) of the MIMO-OFDM system are activated twice independently to send the in-phase and quadrature components of a space-frequency code, respectively, to achieve the second order transmit diversity. Thus the proposed scheme is called space-frequency coded QIM (SFC-QIM). The SFC-QIM scheme allows for a linear-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) receiver, which benefits from the orthogonality between the real and imaginary parts of the symbols in the SFC codewords. Owing to obtaining higher diversity order, simulation results of bit error rate (BER) performance demonstrate that the new SFC-QIM scheme outperforms some existing IM schemes in both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and correlated Rayleigh fading channels.},

To circumvent this issue, in this correspondence, we propose an improved Doppler shift estimation algorithm for down-link signals of space-based AIS, utilizing the calculation of the autocorrelation and ratio on the Rice factor. Specifically, the addressed method is robust to the non-Gaussian noise. Further, the suggested approach has low complexity compared with the existing algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations, such as the standard deviation of the estimated Doppler shift versus signal-to-noise ratio, Rice factor and non-Gaussian noise, and the complexity comparisons, are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed estimation approach.},

A time-switching scheme is implemented such that in each time frame the source either harvests energy or sends information to the destination node. Since switching takes place within a communication time frame, energy harvesting may not necessarily be beneficial in terms of improving the maximum achievable spectral efficiency or the energy efficiency of system. Here, we investigate and provide conditions under which harvesting can improve the system performance. We consider a scenario where the transmission power from the fixed battery is constant. Closed-form expressions for the conditions under which energy harvesting is proven beneficial are provided. The effects of important parameters, namely, time switching parameter, circuit powers, and harvested energy, on the system performance and on the condition for harvesting beneficialness, are investigated and discussed.},

Due to its low complexity and ease of implementation, we consider the use of a switch-and-examine combining with post-examining selection (SECps) scheme to combine the signal received by the DAS. During our experiments, a pedestrian wearing a wireless device on their chest either stood stationary or walked by the side of a road. It was found that the overall signal reliability depends on not only the number, but also different groupings of the antennas which are selected. The goodness-of-fit results have shown that the temporal behavior of the diversity gain was adequately described by the Gaussian distribution. Building upon this, we also provide some useful insights into the antenna selection through the comparison of three different antenna selection mechanisms, namely per-sample random antenna selection, one-shot antenna selection and per-sample optimal antenna selection.},

In this paper, we optimize jointly the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple UAVs to minimize data losses, adapting to the battery levels, queue lengths and channel conditions of the ground sensors, and the trajectories of the UAVs. In the absence of the up-to-date knowledge of the ground sensors’ states, a Multi-UAV Deep Reinforcement Learning based Scheduling Algorithm (MADRL-SA) is proposed to allow the UAVs to asymptotically minimize the data loss of the system under the outdated knowledge of the network states at individual UAVs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MADRL-SA reduces the packet loss by up to 54% and 46% in the considered simulation setting, as compared to an existing DRL solution with single-UAV and non-learning greedy heuristic, respectively.},

In this article, we consider an MEC system consisting of a number of MEC servers and one MD which generates a series of tasks characterized by their dependency relationships. We study computation scheduling and offloading problem of the tasks. To improve the task processing performance, we first propose a parallel transmission and execution (PTE) scheme, based on which we design a computation scheduling and offloading algorithm. Considering the fairness among tasks in terms of task transmission and execution time, we formulate the computation scheduling and offloading problem as a constrained worst-case latency optimization problem which minimizes the maximum completion time of all the tasks. As the original optimization problem cannot be solved conveniently, we first categorize the tasks into high priority tasks (HPTs), medium priority tasks (MPTs) and low priority tasks (LPTs) based on their task execution status and causal relationship. Then, a dynamic priority-based computation scheduling and offloading algorithm is proposed, which designs computation scheduling and offloading strategy for dynamically-changed HPTs and MPTs, respectively. In particular, for HPTs, a multiple knapsack-based heuristic algorithm is proposed, and a task weight and data size-based computation scheduling and offloading algorithm is further proposed for MPTs. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Accordingly, it is urgent to bring up more accurate tracking methods to get a better view of the Mix-Zone&#39;s privacy.

  abstract     = {In multi-access edge computing systems with energy harvesting (MEC-EH), the mobile devices are empowered with unstable energy harvested from renewable energy sources. To prolong the life of mobile devices, as many computation-intensive tasks as possible should be offloaded to the MEC server. However, when the system states of mobile device and MEC server are unstable, e.g. poor communication channel conditions, a great number of tasks will be executed locally, leading to a long execution time. Even worse, some tasks may be dropped due to low energy levels. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a multi-relay assisted computation offloading framework for MEC-EH systems. In this framework, a computation task can be executed by offloading to the MEC server with the help of multiple relay nodes, such as the neighboring nodes. We introduce execution cost as a performance metric to incorporate both the task execution time and task failure. We then develop a low-complexity online algorithm, namely MRACO algorithm, to minimize the average execution cost. MRACO algorithm can select the optimal execution strategy for each task from (1) executing the task locally, (2) offloading it to the MEC server directly, (3) offloading it to the MEC server with the help of the most suitable neighboring nodes, and (4) simply dropping it. Moreover, we also develop an algorithm for selecting the suitable neighboring devices to act as relays and determining the optimal task splitting ratio between them. Finally, performance evaluation shows that the proposed MRACO algorithm greatly outperforms the benchmarks in terms of both average execution time and task drop rate.},

How to jointly optimize task offloading and resource allocation to minimize the energy consumption subject to the latency requirement remains an open problem, which motivates this paper. When the latency constraint is taken into account, the optimization variables, including offloading ratio, transmission power, and subcarrier and computing resource allocation, are strongly coupled. To address this issue, we first decompose the original problem into three subproblems named as offloading ratio selection, transmission power optimization, and subcarrier and computing resource allocation. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to deal with them in a sequence. To be specific, we derive the closed-form solution of offloading ratios, employ the equivalent parametric convex programming to obtain the optimal power allocation policy, and deal with subcarrier and computing resource allocation by the primal-dual method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can save 20%–40% energy compared with the reference schemes, and can converge to local optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Caching and transcoding at multi-access edge computing (MEC) server and wireless resource allocation in eNodeB interact with each other and together determine the quality of experience (QoE) of dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) clients. However, the relationship among the three factors has not been explored, which has led to limited improvement in clients’ QoE. Therefore, we propose a joint optimization framework of video segment caching and transcoding in MEC servers and resource allocation to improve the QoE of DASH clients. Based on the established framework, we develop an MEC caching management mechanism that consists of the MEC caching partition, video segment deletion, and MEC caching space transfer. Then, a joint optimization algorithm that combines the video segment caching and transcoding in the MEC server and resource allocation is proposed. In the algorithm, the clients’ channel state and the playback status and cooperation among MEC servers are employed to estimate the client&#39;s priority, video segment representation switch and continuous playback time. Considering the above four factors, we develop a utility function model of clients’ QoE. Then, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming mathematical model to maximize the total utility of DASH clients, where the video segment caching and transcoding strategy and resource allocation strategy are jointly optimized. To solve this problem, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm that decomposes the original problem into multiple subproblems. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithms efficiently improve client&#39;s throughput, received video quality and hit ratio of video segments while decreasing the playback rebuffering time, video segment representation switch and system backhaul traffic.},

  abstract     = {The limited communication and computing resources, as well as the rising concerns about the privacy protection, bring significant challenges to the massive data training and analysis in vehicular networks. To address these challenges, in this paper a platoon-based distributed learning framework design for data learning is carried out, where the vacant computation resources of vehicle platooning networks are leveraged. In the proposed framework, a 2-phase Markovian stochastic process is utilized to depict the learning service heterogeneity for each participating vehicle. Meanwhile, we propose a joint scheduling and resource allocation scheme for efficiency-oriented distributed learning to maximize the learning accuracy subject to a given learning time constraint. The optimization problem is solved as follows. First, given the scheduled vehicles, the communication resource allocation is modeled as a minimum-maximum problem to minimize the learning delay of each learning round. Subsequently, an efficiency-oriented unbiased global aggregation policy is proposed to explore the convergence difference between partial scheduling and total scheduling. Considering the learning convergence and remaining time, an on-demand scheduling scheme is introduced to determine the number of scheduled vehicles. Finally, combining the learning efficiency of each vehicle with the scheduled number of vehicles, the scheduled vehicle set is selected. Simulations results show that the proposed scheduling policy can schedule the number of participating vehicles on demand based on the trade-off between learning performance and learning latency.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing connectivity between the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and the outside world, safety and security have become stringent problems. The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is the most commonly used in-vehicle network protocol, which lacks security mechanisms by design, so it is vulnerable to various attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection model called CNN-LSTM with Attention model (CLAM) for the in-vehicle network, especially CAN. The CLAM model uses one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) to extract the abstract features of the signal values at each time step and feeds it into the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract the time dependence. By combining the attention mechanisms, we calculate the weight of each hidden state output by Bi-LSTM and perform a weighted summation, so that the model focuses only on locally important time steps, which can improve the convergence speed of the model and prediction accuracy. The proposed model uses the bit flip rate to extract continuous signal boundaries in the 64-bit CAN data, so it does not need to parse the CAN communication matrix and is suitable for different vehicles. The extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed CLAM model can effectively detect CAN attacks, with an average F1-score of 0.951 and an error rate of 2.16%. Compared with the work in related research fields, the accuracy of attack detection is improved by 2.5%.},

  abstract     = {The current in-vehicle network lacks a robust security communication mechanism between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). Although different proposed frameworks aim to secure the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus communication, few of them consider relevant aspects such as key refreshing and management, ECU maintenance, and vehicle manufacturing process. Despite the fact that a centralized key distribution provides an efficient mechanism, security and safety fully depend on this centralized key generator, which may lead to a single point of failure problem. In this work, we present a semi-centralized dynamic key management framework that provides a decentralized and dynamic key generation during the vehicle&#39;s operation. Our framework not only increases security and safety even if the centralized key generator is offline but also reduces the number of keys, the communication payload inside the network, and the complexity of cryptographic material sharing during the vehicle&#39;s lifetime. Moreover, we propose a dynamic generation of session keys for different groups of ECU and external devices, which is a requirement for intelligent vehicles and future Internet of Vehicles. In order to evaluate the performance, we implement our framework on three hardware platforms with different computational power and validate its advantage, efficiency, and flexibility by comparing it with other frameworks.},

As a result, the load on the base stations (BSs) and the consumption of radio resources reduces significantly. Clearly, the success of multi-source content delivery relies on the willingness of the content owners (COs), i.e., sources, to deliver their content to requesting user. Consequently, in this article, we investigate the economic interaction between single BS and multiple COs for content delivery. In view of the fact that participating COs are heterogeneous with respect to the amount of content in their cache and the sensitivity towards energy consumption, there is a need to design a fair incentive mechanism which motivates COs for content delivery. To this end, we model the interaction among the BS and multiple COs as one-to-many bargaining game and design an incentive mechanism based on the Nash bargaining framework. Specifically, we obtain the optimal amount of content delivered by participating COs and their corresponding incentives under two variants of one-to-many bargaining, namely sequential bargaining and concurrent bargaining. For both variants of bargaining, the obtained optimal solutions are capable of minimizing the amount of content delivered by the BS while ensuring fair incentive transfer among the participating COs.},

If detection of human emotion can be made with possibly high detection accuracy by virtual emotion barrier, it can be utilized to an extensive scope of emotion-based applications and communication software services. But, some IoT devices failures in the barrier may cause emotion-based system performance degradation critically. Also, thanks to recent advent of technology, intelligent smart UAVs with rapid speed are considered as promising devices when existing infrastructures are recovered. In this study, fault-tolerant mutual assisted virtual emotion barrier system is introduced with intelligent autonomous UAVs in convergent smart cities. Moreover, we present a formal definition of the problem whose goal is maximizing entire total accuracy of emotion detection where the failed locations are recovered by UAVs’ movement from initial locations without any potential conflicts among UAVs. A greedy UAV movement scheme that constructs resilient virtual emotion barriers is proposed by handling those failed parts in the barriers continuously. Moreover, the proposed schemes are executed by comprehensive simulations with useful scenarios and we evaluate the earned outcome.},

While separate evaluation using proprietary platform has shown the advantage of AI-driven algorithms over their non-AI counterparts, a systematic study is missing for directly comparing these AI-driven design under a uniform and practical platform. To bridge the gap, in this work, we first design and implement a full-fledged evaluation platform named Arsenal, which incorporates multiple state-of-the-art congestion control algorithms, most of which are AI-driven. Using Arsenal, we carry out a thorough comparative study of the algorithms, over massive traces collected from heterogeneous networks including WiFi, 4G, 3G and even the rare commercial 5G wireless networks. In particular, to enable convincing measurements for the dominated real-time video applications, we collect millions of practical video sessions in cooperation with a prevailing video service provider. The evaluation provides a handful of important observations, which are undiscovered before and have important impacts on future protocol design. Moreover, we will make the platform and algorithms open-source to enrich the research tools in the intelligent transportation community.},

However, the energy transfer efficiency and task offloading rate cannot be guaranteed when wireless links between the hybrid access point (HAP) and IoT devices are hostile. To address this problem, this paper aims at utilizing the intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) technique to improve the efficiency of WET and task offloading. In particular, we investigate the total computation bits maximization problem for IRS-enhanced wireless powered MEC networks, by jointly optimizing the downlink/uplink phase beamforming of IRS, transmission power and time slot assignment used for WET and task offloading, and local computing frequencies of IoT devices. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is presented to solve the non-convex non-linear optimization problem, while the optimal transmission power and time allocation, uplink phase beamforming matrixes and local computing frequencies are derived in closed-form expressions. Finally, extensive simulation results validate that our proposed IRS-enhanced wireless powered MEC strategy can achieve higher total computation rate as compared to existing baseline schemes.},

In particular, the average delay defined as the mean value of delay for executing the computing tasks and the task completion probability (TCP) defined as the probability of the delay for executing the computing task being smaller than a target delay, are derived in analytical forms and validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Based on these results, the optimal rate threshold, which affects the task offloading probability and the transmission delay, and the optimal cloud offloading probability to minimize the average delay and maximize the TCP are jointly analysed numerically. Moreover, an approximated result of the average delay is provided to reduce its computational complexity. The results show that the repulsion in the F-RAN significantly decreases the average delay and increases the TCP, but equipped with the optimal rate threshold and the cloud offloading probability, the effects of repulsion on the average delay and the TCP become trivial. Furthermore, with the optimal cloud offloading probability and rate threshold, the average delay and the TCP can be significantly reduced and improved in the hybrid processing mode compared with those in the local processing mode, respectively. The optimal rate thresholds lie in the range of 3 to 13 Mbps under our simulation environment, which can reduce a maximum of 60% of the average delay and increase a minimum of 0.17 of the TCP.},

Considering a dense cellular network scenario that contains several NS over multiple base stations (BSs), it remains challenging to design a proper real-time inter-slice resource management strategy, so as to cope with frequent BS handover and satisfy the fluctuations of distinct service requirements. In this paper, we propose to formulate this challenge as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem in which each BS represents an agent. Then, we leverage graph attention network (GAT) to strengthen the temporal and spatial cooperation between agents. Furthermore, we incorporate GAT into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and correspondingly design an intelligent real-time inter-slice resource management strategy. More specially, we testify the universal effectiveness of GAT for advancing DRL in the multi-agent system, by applying GAT on the top of both the value-based method deep Q-network (DQN) and a combination of policy-based and value-based method advantage actor-critic (A2C). Finally, we verify the superiority of the GAT-based MARL algorithms through extensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {Air traffic management (ATM) of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (AVs) relies critically on ubiquitous location tracking. While technologies exist for AVs to broadcast their location periodically and for airports to track and detect AVs, methods to verify the broadcast locations and complement the ATM coverage are urgently needed, addressing anti-spoofing and safe coexistence concerns. In this work, we propose an ATM solution by exploiting noncoherent crowdsourced wireless networks (CWNs) and correcting the inherent clock-synchronization problems present in such non-coordinated sensor networks. While CWNs can provide a great number of measurements for ubiquitous ATM, these are normally obtained from unsynchronized sensors. This article first presents an analysis of the effects of lack of clock synchronization in ATM with CWN and provides solutions based on the presence of few trustworthy sensors in a large non-coordinated network. Secondly, autoregressive-based and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based approaches are investigated to achieve the time synchronization needed for localization of the AVs. Finally, a combination of a multilateration (MLAT) method and a Kalman filter is employed to provide an anti-spoofing tracking solution for AVs. We demonstrate the performance advantages of our framework through a dataset collected by a real-world CWN. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to that acquired using only GPS-synchronized sensors and outperforms the localization accuracy obtained based on state-of-the-art CWN synchronization methods.},

However, there is a paucity of realistic aircraft mobility models capable of generating large-scale flight data. To fill this knowledge-gap, we develop a semi-stochastic aircraft mobility model based on large-scale real historical Australian flights acquired both on June 29th, 2018 and December 25th, 2018, which represent the busiest day and the quietest day of 2018, respectively. The semi-stochastic aircraft mobility model is capable of generating an arbitrary number of flights, which can emulate the specific features of aircraft mobility.

In particular, a novel channel state information (CSI)-independent decentralized algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is proposed to maximize the sum throughput of V2I links while meeting the latency and reliability requirements of V2V links. Specifically, we implement the individual double dueling deep recurrent Q-networks (D3RQN) and the carefully designed common reward to train the implicitly collaborative agents, through which, each agent optimizes the policy individually based solely on local CSI-independent observations. To handle the non-stationarity induced by multi-agent concurrent learning, we incorporate hysteretic Q-learning and concurrent experience replay trajectory (CERT) to stabilize the training process. Besides, we incorporate the approximate regretted reward (ARR) to alleviate the unstable reward estimation problem caused by shifting environment dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baselines and can achieve close performance compared with the centralized Brute-force method. Furthermore, the proposed CSI-independent design exhibits comparable performance as the CSI-involved version, which sheds some light on the potential to further reduce the signalling overhead of machine learning-based vehicular communication systems.},

First of all, the geometry of the scene and the new system concept is described with emphasis on the required operative modes and the role played by the RIS. Then, the specific radar equation (including the RIS effect) is developed to manage the coverage requirements in the challenging region where the LOS is not present. Both noise and clutter interference cases (pulse length-limited and beamwidth-limited surface clutter as well as volume clutter) are considered. Hence, a digression on the use of the radar timeline for the new operative mode is presented together with the data acquisition procedure and the resolution issues for the range, azimuth, and Doppler domains. Finally, the interplay among the system parameters and, in particular, those involving the RIS is discussed and analyzed via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Virtual Reality (VR) users are able to enjoy immersive experience from anywhere at anytime. However, providing full spherical VR video with high quality under limited VR interaction latency is challenging. If the viewpoint of the VR user can be predicted in advance, only the required viewpoint is needed to be rendered and delivered, which can reduce the VR interaction latency. Therefore, in this paper, we use offline and online learning algorithms to predict viewpoint of the VR user using real VR dataset. For the offline learning algorithm, the trained learning model is directly used to predict the viewpoint of VR users in continuous time slots. While for the online learning algorithm, based on the VR user&#39;s actual viewpoint delivered through uplink transmission, we compare it with the predicted viewpoint and update the parameters and input viewpoints of the online learning algorithm to further improve the prediction accuracy. To guarantee the reliability of the uplink transmission, we integrate the Proactive retransmission scheme into our proposed online learning algorithm.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the detection problem for a massive machine-type communication (mMTC) system that has correlated user activities. Two deep learning assisted algorithms are proposed to exploit the user activity correlation to facilitate channel estimation and user identification. Due to the dependency among user activities, conventional element-wise minimum mean square error (MMSE) denoiser used in the orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm cannot achieve satisfying performance during the two-step iterative process. Therefore, we propose a deep learning modified OAMP (DL-mOAMP) algorithm, which iteratively modifies the user activity ratio via exploiting the user activity correlation in the MMSE denoiser based on the estimated sequence during each OAMP iteration. Moreover, given a specific false alarm probability, a constant threshold employed in the conventional user identification is not optimal in the presence of user activity correlation. Thus, we propose a neural network framework that is dedicated to the user identification (DL-mOAMP-UI algorithm), which minimizes the missed detection probability under a pre-determined false alarm probability. Numerical results show that the proposed DL-mOAMP algorithm provides a substantial mean squared error performance gain compared to the conventional OAMP algorithm and the DL-mOAMP-UI algorithm can further improve the user identification accuracy of an mMTC system.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive radio techniques have been extensively studied over the past two decades. In this paper, we investigate an adaptive algorithm to attain additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) performance in non-white channels, using multicarrier communications such as OFDM and filter-bank multicarrier (FBMC). The non-white channel can be from non-white noise, or more commonly, interference. Our proposed algorithm: spectral shaping (SS), follows a simple optimization problem to find what we term reliable subcarriers, and then per subcarrier power allocations are made in order to attain the AWGN channel bit error ratio (BER). Subcarriers that experience high interference are deactivated or chosen as guard subcarriers. After describing our analysis, we show some simulation results in two non-white interference signal examples: the Gaussian pulse shaped high-power distance measuring equipment (DME) and a classical rectangular-pulse signal. The DME example is pertinent for currently proposed aeronautical communication systems, where new multicarrier techniques, e.g., the L-band digital Aeronautical communication systems (LDACS) have been designed as an inlay approach between the high-power DME channels in L-band. Our results show that in high DME power interferences, using this adaptive technique can improve the overall reliability and attain AWGN BER performance in AWGN channel. We provide power spectral density (PSD) results to compare OFDM and FBMC based spectra when our SS algorithm is applied. Also, we provide BER vs. bit energy to noise density ratio ( Eb / N0 ) results in the AWGN, as well as more realistic aeronautical channels to compare SS system performance. Our results show that in the presence of high power DME interference, using this adaptive technique can improve the overall reliability and enable us to attain non-interference BER performance in realistic aeronautical channels.},

This joint optimization problem is nonconvex and challenging due to the intricate coupling of transmit and reflecting beamforming variables and the highly nonconvex constant modulus constraints. All the known solutions apply the alternating optimization framework to decouple the joint optimization problem into two problems. Then, these problems are optimized individually with different optimization methods in an alternating manner. However, such an alternative procedure may cause performance degradation. On the basis of the cross-entropy (CE) framework, which was developed initially for machine learning applications, we propose a machine learning-inspired algorithmic framework for simultaneously optimizing transmit and reflecting beamforming in an IRS-assisted wireless system. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed CE-based algorithms significantly perform better than the state-of-the-art test algorithms for various system configurations.},

In this paper, we investigate an energy consumption scheduling for unlicensed heterogeneous networks, namely NR-U and WiFi, by leveraging the network slicing technology. First, we introduce a network slice broker, which enables virtual heterogeneous network operators to request and lease resources cooperatively via signaling means. Then, we investigate a joint network selection and resource allocation scheduling to minimize the network energy consumption in real time environment, taking into account various user data rate and delay requirements. An online Lyapunov optimization algorithm has been introduced to solve the proposed problem with low computational complexity and rapid convergence. We show that there exists a tradeoff between energy consumption and traffic delay, which can be adjusted through control parameters.

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered as a potential multiple access technique for supporting massive number of devices with high spectral efficiency for the 5 G and beyond networks. Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is considered as an efficient solution for fully autonomous and sustainable communication networks. In this paper, application of SWIPT in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) employing cooperative NOMA (CNOMA) is investigated. The HetNets consists of macro-base stations (MBS) under-laid by small-base stations (SBS). The distribution of MBSs follow Poisson point process model, while the SBS tier supports NOMA and carrier sensing for its transmission. Carrier sensing helps in reducing interference by blocking the base stations within a specific range from transmitting. In this work, the analysis at SBS tier is carried out in two phases. In the direct phase transmission, the SBS transmits the superimposed signal to a user pair, comprising of a cell-centre user (CCU) and a cell-edge user (CEU), using NOMA principle. The CCU acts as a cooperative relay to forward information to the CEU in the cooperative phase. Unlike existing literature, instead of using only the superimposed signal for energy harvesting (EH), in this work, the cooperating user (i.e. CCU) employs EH using interference from the adjacent base stations along with the EH from the superimposed signal. Expressions for outage probability and throughput are derived at the user pair served using NOMA. Comparison of the proposed EH system with existing solutions are highlighted and useful insights are drawn. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to validate the analytical results.},

In addition to an outdoor location-based service, there are many needs for indoor positioning. However, GNSS is hard to position indoors due to signal blockage, and outdoor–indoor transition areas where multipath effects are unavoidable and signal interference is severe. This article proposes a GNSS/INS/UWB tightly-coupled integration positioning methodology to address the problem of accurate positioning in GNSS-difficult areas and aims to provide seamless positioning in different scenarios. In indoor environments, the system uses the UWB/INS tightly-coupled integration positioning mode and periodically corrects the INS errors with range measurements obtained from the UWB transmitting unit to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. In outdoor GNSS-difficult areas like outdoor–indoor transition areas, a GNSS/INS/UWB tightly-coupled integration positioning system is proposed to ensure positioning accuracy continuity and further improve the reliability of the system. To evaluate the positioning performance of the proposed UWB enhanced multi-sensor tightly-coupled integration system, an experiment was conducted in a high-rise building. The experiment results show that the proposed integrated positioning system can provide seamless and accurate positioning results in both indoor and outdoor–indoor transition areas, with DRMS of 5.25 cm and RMSE of 10.18 cm.},

The NP-hard nature of POB makes it difficult to be solved for large-scale antenna arrays. This paper studies two fast and simple GP algorithms for the problem of POB. First we give a new interpretation of the GP method under the framework of sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Then we prove that the GP operation gives a strict global minimizer of the subproblem of SQP. Moreover, the larger the step size in GP operation, the smaller the minimum value of the subproblem. Based on this observation we design two variable step size GP (VSGP) algorithms that improve the convergence speed of the GP method significantly. Furthermore, the VSGP algorithms have a simple structure, making them easy to be implemented in chips. Finally, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the POB problem. We also prove that, for any initialization, all limit points of the iterates generated by the VSGP algorithms converge to the KKT points. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence speed and computational cost.},

We focus on two EE forms; global EE and weighted sum EE. Therefore, we propose a novel explicit expression of the optimal power allocation related to each subcarrier. We also present the power control with limited power budget or/and minimal transmission rate constraint in both base station and subcarrier perspectives. As a result, we notice the occurrence of some transmission outage events depending on the constraints’ parameters. From another side, we extend our study to analyze the effect of the channel state information (CSI) unavailability on our proposed power scheme. In the numerical results, we show that our proposed power control improves the EE, especially at high power budget regime and low minimal rate regime. We also show that having more subcarriers enhances the OFDMA EE. Finally, we show that EE degradation due to CSI unavailability is very small showing the robustness of the proposed scheme against CSI imperfectness. 1},

With Low Altitude Platform Station (LAPS) like UAV for strengthening communication in certain areas, and High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) for ensuring wide coverage, we put forward the XAPS-enabled (including one HAPS and multiple UAVs) C-NOMA system in 6G heterogeneous Internet of things and investigate the joint 3D-location planning and resource allocation problem by optimizing four factors systematically, which are the spectrum allocation, power control, horizontal coordinate and hovering altitude optimization of UAVs to maximize the overall system uplink achievable sum rate. Due to the strong coupling among these factors, it is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is extremely difficult to solve. Therefore, we decompose it and propose a two-stage solution. Specifically, in the first stage we transfer resource allocation problem into a many-to-one spectrum matching game coupled with power control, where UAVs and subchannels are two groups of participants. Then we complete the second stage by optimizing UAVs’ 3D-locations, including horizontal coordinates and hovering altitudes. Finally, we repeat these two stages iteratively until the near-optimal result is obtained. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show that our proposed approach outperforms previous solutions in terms of system uplink sum rate with relatively low complexity.},

  abstract     = {Mobile storage systems (MSSs) which store popular content in mobile devices can reduce the heavy traffic burden on the base station (BS). To deal with data loss caused by the mobility of devices, erasure codes are widely used in practice to improve system reliability. The duration to repair all lost data is defined the repair delay . However, the repair delay via device-to-device communications is usually large due to intermittent contacts among devices within a given communication range, which causes files to be irreparable and permanently lost. This paper focuses on analyzing the repair delay of the MSSs through D2D communications. We adopt a coded repair process running periodically and derive analytical expressions of the average repair delay by taking into account factors, i.e., limited communication range, device mobility, and coded repair scheme. Moreover, considering that devices need multipath contacts to repair lost data for large files, we propose a relay cooperation repair scheme, in which some mobile devices can act as relay nodes to transmit data cooperatively. Furthermore, we design a heuristic algorithm to optimize the number of relay devices and the amount of data allocated to each path, with the objective of minimizing the average repair delay. We find that maximum distance separable codes can yield smaller average repair delays for small files, and the average repair delay can be reduced by selecting faster moving devices to participate. With the file size increasing, the relay cooperation repair scheme can significantly improve repair efficiency in MSSs using the proposed heuristic algorithm.},

We first derive a closed-form expression for the user rate with the presence of pilot contamination caused by inter-cell interference during the channel estimation phase. From the definition of system EE, we propose a maximization problem with two constraints: limited power for pilot and data signals and a minimum value for every user rate. The proposed maximization problem is a fractional programming problem and is very hard to solve directly. Therefore, we propose the first iterative algorithm to transform the original problem into subtractive form. Moreover, we propose the second iterative algorithm to solve the subtractive form maximization problem by approximating it as a convex problem. The convergence and feasibility of the two proposed algorithms are also discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of our scheme is shown by simulation results.},

In the scheme, users are divided into groups in accordance with their locations for detection at the base station. The inter- and intra-group interferences are mitigated by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and transceivers, respectively. Based on a derived approximate signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for using zero-forcing detection, an iterative power and beamforming update procedure is developed for obtaining the user precoders. The precoder design effectively mitigates the intra-group-inter-user correlation making the adopted approximate SINR represent the original SINR accurately. The proposed multi-group MIMO-NOMA scheme can work under more practical transmit-receive antenna configurations and is shown to outperform upon existing cluster-based MIMO-NOMA schemes in terms of total transmit power for various system configurations. The impact of SIC residuals on the multi-group MIMO-NOMA scheme is investigated. Feasibility conditions for the design under imperfect SIC based on the fractional cancellation error model are developed.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new approach to accurately and efficiently identifying a large number of wireless devices blindly installed to known three-dimensional installation/fitting points, based on received signal strengths (RSSs) between the devices. The approach is non-trivial because of the factorial, mapping nature of the considered problem, the multiplicative ranging errors of the RSS measurements (with standard deviation of 5–7 dB), and the requirement of high mapping accuracy in many internet-of-things (IoT) applications, e.g., industrial IoT and aircraft. The consideration of a structured environment where the set of candidate node positions is known beforehand shifts the problem of interest from a pure position estimation problem to a position assignment problem. The key idea of the proposed approach is that we interpret the position mapping problem with a probabilistic graphical model, where the factorial nature of mapping (more specifically, the mutual exclusiveness of devices at every installation point) is fully captured. A max-product belief propagation is designed against the probabilistic graph, to estimate the max-marginal position distribution of each device. The Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is applied to preserve the mutual exclusiveness of devices throughout the belief propagation and to decide device locations based on the estimated position distributions. Large-scale simulations and field tests are carried out, showing that the new approach achieves close-to-100% accuracy in simulations with hundreds of blindfolded devices under RSS measurement errors with standard deviation of 5–7 dB. Our approach also achieves 100% accuracy in all field trials with 76 devices inside the cabin of a Fokker 100 airplane, dramatically outperforming baseline techniques.},

  abstract     = {Rail transportation, especially, high-speed rails (HSR), is an important infrastructure for the development of national economy and the promotion of passenger experience. Due to the large bandwidth, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is regarded as a promising technology to meet the demand of high data rates. However, since mmWave communication has the characteristic of high attenuation, mobile relay (MR) is considered in this paper. Also, full-duplex (FD) communications have been proposed to improve the spectral efficiency. However, because of the high speed, as well as the problem of penetration loss, passengers on the train have a poor quality of service. Consequently, an effective user association scheme for HSR in mmWave band is necessary. In this paper, we investigate the user association optimization problem in mmWave mobile relay systems where the MRs operate in the FD mode. To maximize the system capacity, we propose a cooperative user association approach based on coalition formation game, and develop a coalition formation algorithm to solve the challenging NP-hard problem. We also prove the convergence and Nash-stable property of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulations are done to show the system performance of the proposed scheme under various network settings. It is demonstrated that the proposed distributed low complexity scheme achieves a near-optimal performance and outperforms two baseline schemes in terms of average system throughput.},

In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model employing spectral correlation function (SCF) which is an effective characterization of cyclostationarity property, is proposed for wireless spectrum sensing and signal identification. The proposed method classifies wireless signals without a priori information and it is implemented in two different settings entitled CASE1 and CASE2 . In CASE1 , signals are jointly sensed and classified. In CASE2 , sensing and classification are conducted in a sequential manner. In contrary to the classical spectrum sensing techniques, the proposed CNN method does not require a statistical decision process and does not need to know the distinct features of signals beforehand. Implementation of the method on the measured over-the-air real-world signals in cellular bands indicates important performance gains when compared to the signal classifying deep learning networks available in the literature and against classical sensing methods. Even though the implementation herein is over cellular signals, the proposed approach can be extended to the detection and classification of any signal that exhibits cyclostationary features. Finally, the measurement-based dataset which is utilized to validate the method is shared for the purposes of reproduction of the results and further research and development.},

  abstract     = {Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UW-ASNs) have received increasing attention in the civil and military fields. However, due to the unique features of the underwater environment, designing a suitable media access control (MAC) protocol for UW-ASNs is an immense challenge. While orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is a multiple access technology based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), allocating different subchannels to different users for parallel transmission. In this paper, we propose a traffic load-aware OFDMA-based MAC protocol for UW-ASNs, called TLAO-MAC, that can suit the operational requirements of distributed underwater sensor networks. It uses the exchange of control packets to collect data transmission requests and update the channel resource list. Neighboring nodes rely on receiving nodes to conduct channel negotiation and resource allocation in a distributed manner. In addition, we define the channel busyness index to sense the dynamic traffic load in distributed networks. The proposed TLAO-MAC includes two key schemes: an adaptive channel grouping algorithm based on channel busyness, and a distributed subcarrier and power allocation algorithm. By adaptively adjusting the channel grouping in consideration of the dynamics of the traffic load, TLAO-MAC allows simultaneous transmission between neighboring nodes and avoids conflict in the data channel. Under the premise of meeting the transmission rate requirement of the sender, the transmission power is saved to the greatest extent. The simulation results show that TLAO-MAC can improve network goodput and reduce end-to-end delay, showing better adaptability in distributed networks.},

  abstract     = {Effective suppression of inadvertent or deliberate jamming signals is crucial to ensure reliable wireless communication. However, as demonstrated in this paper, when the transmitted jamming signals are highly correlated, and especially when the correlation coefficient varies, nullifying the jamming signals can be challenging. Unlike existing techniques that often assume uncorrelated jamming signals or non-zero but constant correlation, we analyze the impact of the non-zero and varying correlations between transmitted jamming signals on the suppression of the jamming signals. Specifically, we observe that by varying the correlation coefficients between transmitted jamming signals, jammers can “virtually change” the jamming channels hence their nullspace, even when these channels do not physically change. This makes most jamming suppression techniques that rely on steering receiving beams towards the nullspace of jamming channels no longer applicable. To tackle the problem, we develop techniques to effectively track the jamming nullspace and correspondingly update receiving beams. Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed techniques can suppress/nullify jamming signals for all considered scenarios with non-zero and varying correlation coefficients amongst transmitted jamming signals.},

Generally, to recommend POIs for users, raw check-in data are collected from in-vehicle devices, which raises users’ privacy concerns. To address this problem, we propose a successive POI recommendation framework with local differential privacy. The proposed framework exploits three types of influence factors for recommendation, including geographical influence, temporal influence, and transition pattern between two POIs. To protect users’ check-in data, we propose a distance-weighted location perturbation mechanism that realizes local differential privacy. Considering that different users may have different privacy requirements, we enhance this perturbation mechanism to provide personalized privacy protection. We use the EM reconstruction method to correct the error caused by perturbation on the server side. To improve the accuracy, we design an individual-weighted EM reconstruction method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can provide strong privacy protection for users without hurting the recommendation accuracy too much.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging technology, cloud-based Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) can significantly improve the efficiency of transportation systems by alleviating traffic congestion and optimizing resource management. However, since the information transmitted in VANET is distributed in an open-access environment, security and privacy are now becoming vital concerns, especially when attackers own more and more resources. Recently, many tamper-proof devices (TPD)-based authentication schemes have been proposed to tackle the above-mentioned challenges, while most of them are dependent on ideal TPDs with very strong security assumptions. Moreover, when the aggregate signature verification fails, these schemes can do nothing but discard the aggregate signature completely, which makes them impractical in VANET. To address the above concerns, we propose a more realistic TPD-based authentication scheme with privacy-preserving features for cloud-based VANET. Specifically, the off-line self-updating method is utilized to update the data in TPD periodically to resist side-channel attacks. Furthermore, an efficient fine-grained error location algorithm is designed to quickly detect all invalid signatures within a problematic aggregate signature scenario. Our performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing ones in terms of security, computation delay and communication overhead, thus more suitable in practical cloud-based VANET environment.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a coexisting network of cellular transmission and device-to-device (D2D) communication, in which two users need to receive downlink signals from base station (BS), meanwhile, they want to exchange information with each other. For such a network, a hybrid cellular and bidirectional D2D cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (HCBD-CNOMA) scheme is proposed. To characterize the performance of our proposed scheme, we derive the closed-form ergodic rate and outage probability by considering both perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). To acquire more insights, their corresponding asymptotic expressions are obtained as well. Moreover, considering the fact that the nodes in Internet of Things (IoT) network are usually powered by battery and thus their power is limited, we further consider the scenario that two users are energy-constraint. In this scenario, users first need to harvest energy from the transmission of BS based on time splitting (TS) or power splitting (PS) energy harvesting (EH) protocol and then use these energy to accomplish subsequent communications. Similarly, the exact ergodic rate and outage probability as well as their asymptotic expressions for this scenario are analyzed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of analytical results, and reveal the performance gain of our schemes over the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Full duplex (FD) is one of the most attractive technologies in enhancing spectral efficiency for potentially doubling the system throughput. In this work, we employ FD jamming to improve the secrecy performance of an uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system at the presence of one eavesdropper. We first evaluate the individual secrecy performance in terms of effective secrecy throughput (EST), by deriving its closed-form expression. Valuable insights are provided into the impacts of transmit power, jamming power as well as the number of antennas. Asymptotic analyses concerning these three arguments show the secrecy performance is location-dependent only in the high regime of transmit power and approaches to the main capacity in the high regime of the other two arguments. A special case, beamforming FD jamming, is next studied such that &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -fold power gain on jamming is available, in turn, improving the secrecy performance. Limited gains from high transmit and jamming power prompt us to further investigate two optimal power allocation problems: (1) optimal power allocation to minimize total power, subject to an overall secrecy performance requirement; (2) optimal power allocation to maximize overall secrecy performance, with constraint of total power. The solutions to these two optimization problems are given and demonstrated numerically with appropriate cases.},

  abstract     = {The paper studies a wireless-powered full-duplex non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with one base station and two groups of near and far users, where the near users can be regarded as the self-energy recycling relays to assist the far users. In particular, the locations of the near and far users are modeled as the uniformly distributed and homogeneous Poisson Point Process respectively. From the beneficial perspective of the near users, we propose a novel power allocation scheme, which can utilize the partial channel state information to switch the transmission mode dynamically between cooperative NOMA and non-cooperative NOMA. Further, since the users’ locations have a significant influence on our proposed power allocation scheme, three different user selection strategies namely random near user and random far user (RNRF), optimal near user and nearest far user (ONNF), and optimal near user and farthest far user (ONFF) are investigated to carry out NOMA pairing. Firstly, the RNRF allows all of users to communicate with the base station by a fair opportunity compared to the others strategies, and then a two-stage user selection method is proposed by considering the actual states of near users to determine an optimal near user who can maximize the outage performance of far user for ONNF and ONFF strategies. In addition, outage probabilities, diversity orders, and system throughputs are derived to characterize the performance of three strategies. Finally, numerical results are shown to verify that not only our proposed power allocation scheme can improve the quality of service of near users but also user selection strategies can fully exploit multi-user diversity in comparison to the existing work.},

  abstract     = {Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) is a promising device-free localization (DFL) method by reconstructing an attenuation image from the variations of received signal strength (RSS) measurements. Targets are considered to be at positions of some pixels with local maximums in the attenuation image. However, the number of local maximums generally exceeds the number of real targets, which will lead to large localization errors. The local maximum which does not have its corresponding real target is defined as an “artifact”. Through our analysis, two causes for artifacts are concluded: 1) multi-path interference: RSS measurements for links that are far from the targets may have variations due to multi-path interference, even though these links are not blocked by the targets. 2) intersecting affected links: the affected links blocked by different targets may intersect within the monitoring area, fabricating artifacts. At a position of artifact, there seems to be a target whose interference effect on links is similar to that of a real target. The quality of the attenuation image will deteriorate because of the above two inevitable influencing factors. To alleviate the effect of artifacts, a training-free artifact detection method is proposed. We formulate the artifact detection problem in the attenuation image as a multi-component optimization problem combing the information of feature links and the density of intersection points. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to derive a closed-form solution. Experiments are conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed artifact detection method.},

  abstract     = {The effective combination of physical layer security communication and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology has recently attracted extensive attention to improve the system security. Unlike existing works that mostly focus on single-carrier systems, we consider an IRS-assisted multi-carrier MIMO wireless physical layer security communication system, which consists of a legitimate transmitter, a legitimate receiver, an IRS node and an eavesdropper. With the aim of maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the multi-carrier transmit beamforming and IRS reflecting coefficient matrix are jointly optimized under the constraints on the transmit power budget and unit modulus of IRS reflecting coefficients. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, an alternate optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to deal with it. Specifically, for the given IRS reflecting coefficient matrix, the minorization-maximization (MM) scheme is adopted to approximate the objective function of the subproblem and following that, the closed-form solution of the multi-carrier transmit beamforming is obtained through the Lagrange multiplier method. Then, for the given multi-carrier beamforming, the IRS reflecting coefficient matrix is also optimized through the MM scheme and a suboptimal closed-form solution that satisfies the KKT conditions is derived. Moreover, the discussion is extended to the discrete IRS phase shift case and a heuristic projection method (HPM) is then proposed. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed AO based algorithm.},

  abstract     = {When polar codes are decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm, erroneously decoded non-frozen bits are caused by either channel noise or error propagation. SC-Flip algorithms aim to improve error performance by first identifying erroneous hard decisions due to channel noise and then flipping them during the decoding process to reduce error propagation. In existing SC-Flip algorithms, cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is used to check the decoded codeword to detect incorrect hard decisions. Differing from this detection approach based on CRC, we propose new SC-Flip decoders that take advantage of both the CRC and distributed parity checks (PCs) to detect, identify and flip erroneously decoded non-frozen bits. The proposed decoders terminate SC decoding early when a distributed PC is not satisfied. In addition, we propose a new metric to help locate the incorrect hard decisions. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our SC-Flip decoders achieve better performance complexity tradeoffs than prior flipping algorithms, and approach the performance and complexity of the SC-Oracle algorithms.},

Existing research mainly focuses on single point positioning (SPP) or double difference positioning (DDP) modes. SPP is non-cooperative, and DDP is considered to be a dual-user cooperation requiring the deterministic model of a static reference station. In this paper, we develop a cooperative CPP (CoCPP) mode for asynchronous systems. CoCPP enables multi-user cooperation and allows both static and mobile users to participate in the cooperation. Specifically, we present the principle and algorithm of CoCPP and discuss practical considerations associated with the test of ambiguity fixing. CoCPP makes the carrier phase ambiguities become integers by double differencing and then enables cooperation gains based on ambiguity fixing. We prove that CoCPP has lower Cramer-Rao Lower Bound than SPP if the ambiguities are correctly fixed. We demonstrate that the single difference matrices and cooperating sequences are non-trivial in the case of partial ambiguity fixing for CoCPP. Simulations show that CoCPP outperforms SPP in positioning accuracy.},

Note that the even-component of frequency domain (FD) received signal suffers from neither inter-sub-band interference nor inter-sub-carrier interference while the odd-component suffers from both. The message passing algorithm (MPA) is first employed to perform multiuser detection by utilizing only the even-component. Next, to improve the performance, the odd-component is further utilized. In this improvement, reliable estimates obtained by MPA over even-component are reconstructed and cancelled from odd-component, and then only a very small number of most-unreliable user data are refined by maximum likelihood method. Moreover, the union bound of the average symbol error probability (ASEP) of maximum likelihood detection using only even-component is derived, from which it is shown that ASEP is sub-band-independent.

The performance loss due to the presence of phase errors arising from limited quantization levels as well as hardware impairments at the RIS elements is also discussed. First, the composite channel containing the direct path plus the product of reflected channels through the RIS is characterized. Then, the distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is matched to a Gamma random variable whose parameters depend on the total number of RIS elements, phase errors and the channels’ path loss. Next, by considering the FBL regime, the achievable rate expression and error probability are identified and the corresponding average rate and average error probability are elaborated based on the proposed SNR distribution. Furthermore, the impact of the presence of phase error due to either limited quantization levels or hardware impairments on the average rate and error probability is discussed. The numerical results show that Monte Carlo simulations conform to matched Gamma distribution to received SNR for sufficiently large number of RIS elements. In addition, the system reliability indicated by the tightness of the SNR distribution increases when RIS is leveraged particularly when only the reflected channel exists. This highlights the advantages of RIS-aided communications for ultra-reliable and low-latency systems. The difference between Shannon capacity and achievable rate in FBL regime is also discussed. Additionally, the required number of RIS elements to achieve a desired error probability in the FBL regime will be significantly reduced when the phase shifts are performed without error.},

  abstract     = {Support for an asymmetric transmission topology involving two user stations, one for downlink and one for uplink, is essential in full-duplex wireless LANs to handle asymmetric and heterogeneous traffic demands as well as heterogeneous station capabilities. The main challenge presented by this asymmetric topology is interstation interference from the uplink-transmitting station to the downlink-receiving station. In this paper, we develop a novel medium access control (MAC) protocol and an associated station selection algorithm that exploit successive interference cancellation (SIC) to resolve the interstation interference. To understand the problem and find design rationales, we establish concepts of distinct transmission types and conduct a formal analysis of decodability with SIC, based on which we show that a transmission-type-specific design is necessary due to the type-dependent information requirements and asymmetric availability of information. We define, identify, and illustrate the SIC-eligible, interference and noninterference regions, each of which has different decodability characteristics. The developed MAC protocol is designed to guarantee coexistence with legacy wireless LANs. The developed station selection algorithm is designed to handle all possible transmission cases of full-duplex communication in both the centralized and distributed operation modes, which differ in terms of the signaling overhead and achieved performance; moreover, this algorithm can be combined with a wide range of access point schedulers. Through comprehensive simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme considerably enhances the system and per-station throughputs compared with conventional schemes, approaching the ideal case with no interstation interference.},

  abstract     = {In coherent radar system, maneuvering target with complex motions usually confronts the issues of range cell migration (RCM) and Doppler frequency spread (DFS) within the long-time coherent integration process. To address these issues and achieve reliable detection and estimation performance, this paper proposes a novel fast approach without motion parameters searching. Particularly, the proposed approach performs the third-order keystone transform (TKT) to eliminate the third-order RCM (TRCM). Then, the bilinear parametric symmetric self-correlation function (BPSSF), scaled Fourier transform (SCFT) and inverse Fourier transform (IFT) are successively operated to estimate target&#39;s velocity and acceleration. Afterwards, the improved second-order phase differentiation (ISPD) is performed to estimate target&#39;s jerk. Utilizing the estimated parameters, the compensation functions could be constructed to eliminate the remaining RCMs and DFSs as well as to obtain the energy coherent integration. By contrast, analyses of several classical approaches and the proposed one are provided concerning computational complexity, coherent integration performance, detection performance and estimation performance, which confirm that the proposed approach can balance the computational burden and the detection/estimation capabilities. Additionally, the proposed approach can avoid the effect of blind speed side-lobe (BSSL). Eventually, simulated data verification and raw data processing are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the presented approach.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has become an appealing solution for a wide range of commercial and civilian applications thanks to its high mobility and flexible deployment. Due to the continuous UAV navigation, the channels between UAV based arial base station (BS) and the ground users are subject to the Doppler effect. Meanwhile, when UAV is equipped with massive number of antennas in high frequency band such as mmWave and Tera Hertz (THz), the non-negligible propagation delay across the array aperture would cause beam squint effect. In this paper, we first investigate the channel under both Doppler effect and beam squint effect for UAV communications with large antenna array and high frequency band. Then, we design a gridless compressed sensing (GCS) based channel tracking method, where the high dimension uplink channel can be derived by estimating a few physical parameters such as the direction of arrival (DOA), Doppler shift, and the complex gain information. Besides, with the Doppler shift reciprocity and angular reciprocity, the downlink channel can be derived by only one pilot symbol, which greatly decreases the downlink channel training overhead. Various simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Practical data detectors must achieve low error-rate at low-complexity for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems. Since near-optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection exhibits high computational complexity for such wireless systems, various iterative methods as well as their enhanced variants have been proposed. The efficiency of iterative approaches, however, is not satisfying due to slow convergence rate and reduced accuracy. This paper proposes a novel semi-iterative data detection algorithm for massive MIMO systems that simultaneously achieves a large improvement in convergence and accuracy with respect to the corresponding iterative method. We provide a general three-term recurrence expression for semi-iterative detection and incorporate it with Richardson method as a show case. To further improve the convergence rate of the proposed technique, a new trace-diagonal based low-complexity initial method is developed. A sufficient condition for convergence of the proposed method is also provided. We analyze the associated complexity of semi-iterative detector, and provide numerical results which demonstrate that the proposed detector is superior to recently introduced iterative detectors in terms of both the error-rate performance and computational complexity.},

The transmission structure of the proposed system is on a block basis, where each block contains two sub-blocks. More specifically, the first sub-block only conveys amplitude and phase modulation (APM) symbol bits, since its transmit antennas (TAs) obey a pre-designed activation pattern, which do not carry any information bit. For the second sub-block, the input bits are modulated to STBC-SM matrices, which are then differentially coded between two adjacent sub-blocks. Moreover, a novel block-by-block based non-coherent detector is presented. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) by using the moment generating function (MGF). Our simulation results show that the proposed differential STBC-SM transmission structure is able to acquire considerable bit error rate (BER) performance improvements compared to both the conventional differential spatial modulation (DSM) and differential Alamouti schemes.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has emerged as a promising novel paradigm to achieve better coverage and higher capacity for future wireless network by exploiting the more favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. To reap the potential gains of UAV swarm, the remote control signal sent by ground control unit (GCU) is essential, whereas the control signal quality are susceptible in practice due to the effect of the adjacent channel interference (ACI) and the external interference (EI) from radiation sources distributed across the region. To tackle these challenges, this paper considers priority-aware resource coordination in a multi-UAV communication system, where multiple UAVs are controlled by a GCU to perform certain tasks with a pre-defined trajectory. Specifically, we maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the UAVs by jointly optimizing channel assignment and power allocation strategy under stringent resource availability constraints. According to the intensity of ACI, we consider the corresponding problem in two scenarios, i.e., Null-ACI and ACI systems. By virtue of the particular problem structure in Null-ACI case, we first recast the formulation into an equivalent yet more tractable form and obtain the global optimal solution via Hungarian algorithm. For general ACI systems, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm for its solution based on the alternating optimization methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly enhance the minimum SINR among all the UAVs and adapt the allocation of communication resources to diverse mission priority.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a hybrid architecture called fully connected sub-array (FCSA) is considered for uplink data decoding with mutual coupling and space constraints at the base station (BS). The above architecture achieves the same system performance with a lower hardware complexity than a fully connected array. The packing of many antenna elements on a small surface area leads to the mutual coupling effect. Moreover, having antenna elements at the BS with finite directivity is more practical than having isotropic antenna elements at the BS. In the present work, we have considered uplink data decoding with dipole antennas arranged in a uniform planar array (UPA) grid at the BS with the error in separation between the antenna elements and mutual coupling as additional impairments. An approximate expression for the mutual coupling matrix (MCM) is derived and verified. A geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for the channel is considered between the user equipment (UE) and the BS. The performance of the hybrid architecture in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and bit error rate (BER) of the system, with the mutual coupling effect and antenna separation error, is analyzed. Numerical simulations show that when the BS has no information on the MCM, SE and the system&#39;s BER performances with the FCSA architecture degrade. In the absence of any information on the coupling effect, the system performs better when a more extensive array size is used at the BS. Both the SE and BER degraded when longer dipoles were used in the array.},

  abstract     = {The sensitivity to blockages is a key challenge for millimeter wave and terahertz networks in 5G and beyond. Since these networks mainly rely on line-of-sight (LOS) links, sudden link blockages highly threaten the reliability of the networks. Further, when the LOS link is blocked, the network typically needs to hand off the user to another LOS basestation, which may incur critical time latency, especially if a search over a large codebook of narrow beams is needed. A promising way to tackle the reliability and latency challenges lies in enabling proaction in wireless networks. Proaction allows the network to anticipate future blockages, especially dynamic blockages, and initiate user hand-off beforehand. This article presents a complete machine learning framework for enabling proaction in wireless networks relying on visual data captured, for example, by red-green-blue (RGB) cameras deployed at the base stations. In particular, the article proposes a vision-aided wireless communication solution that utilizes bimodal machine learning to perform proactive blockage prediction and user hand-off. This is mainly achieved via a deep learning algorithm that learns from visual and wireless data how to predict incoming blockages. The predictions of this algorithm are used by the wireless network to proactively initiate hand-off decisions and avoid any unnecessary latency. The algorithm is developed on a vision-wireless dataset generated using the ViWi data-generation framework. Experimental results on two basestations with different cameras indicate that the algorithm is capable of accurately detecting incoming blockages more than &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${\sim} 90\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; of the time. Such blockage prediction ability is directly reflected in the accuracy of proactive hand-off, which also approaches 87%. This highlights a promising direction for enabling high reliability and low latency in future wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, continuing beamforming along with the movement of the UAV to mitigate the severe path loss is indispensable, which is called beam tracking. The conventional beam tracking studies focus on tracking the angle resulting from the movement of a target and obtaining the maximum beamforming gain with a narrow beam through phased array-based beamforming. However, the high mobility and perturbation of UAV impose a challenge on aligning narrow beams between the base node and the UAV node in the aerial network. In particular, the spatial angular velocity is significantly high in the field of view (FoV) of antenna array. In this article, we propose a scheme that predicts the spatial angle of the moving object in the next time unit 1 and design a wide beam pattern based on the predicted value to reduce the beam misalignment issue. The proposed scheme can establish a robust communication link with the reduced packet loss, by mitigating the variations resulting from angle transition during a time unit, prediction errors, and the angle process noise. Especially, Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based spatial angle prediction method can predict spatial angle for the next time unit, with lower overhead than conventional methods. Considering the fact that UAVs typically travel at speeds from &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{40}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{160}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; [km/hr], we verify the simulation results in high-speed scenario such as from &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{170}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{200}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; [km/hr].

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the application of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in millimeter-Wave (mmWave) communications to address resource allocation issues for multiuser downlink transmission. Inspired by the K-means clustering algorithm, a NOMA user grouping policy is first employed in accordance with the channel correlation between users. The first-stage decoding order for each NOMA group is then determined by merely utilizing the users’ channel gain to formulate a joint power allocation and hybrid beamforming optimization problem. Specifically, we use signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) as the performance index of the optimization problem to reduce the computational complexity, because it can decouple the design of the beamforming and power allocation issues so they can be executed iteratively. Under given beamforming matrix, the power allocation issue is expressed as a quadratic programming (QP) problem, and then transformed into a convex problem by introducing an auxiliary-positive real variable to solve through the Lagrange multiplier method. On the contrary, the beamforming optimization problem is non-convex and very difficult to solve due to the constant modulus constraints in the hybrid architecture. However, the optimum solution of the ideal full-digital beamforming can be acquired primarily by generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GED). In this condition, two hybrid beamforming algorithms are proposed, in which normalized phase matching and equal gain transmission are performed respectively in the analog domain. On this basis, a second-stage decoding order can be employed according to the effective channel gain of users to perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) successfully. Numerical results show that the proposed joint power allocation and hybrid beamforming algorithms are superior to the classical mmWave-NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes not only in lower implementation complexity, but also in better spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency performance.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and reliable underwater sonar image transmission is increasingly desired for underwater investigation by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). However, it is extremely challenging due to the severe interference nature of underwater acoustic channels and the large data size of sonar images. In this paper, we first combine multicarrier modulation techniques with characteristics of compressed sonar image data to improve the transmission performance, where in previous research, image compression and multicarrier modulation were investigated separately. The compressed bitstream of sonar images is regarded as a new type of image with unique frequency characteristic. A non-uniform non-orthogonal multicarrier modulation scheme based on frequency characteristics of compressed sonar image data (F-NNMC) is proposed to meet the requirements of efficient and reliable sonar image transmission. The non-orthogonality between subcarriers improves the spectrum efficiency, and the non-uniform subcarrier structure can carry more effective information of the transmitted compressed data to improve the reliability. The simulation and experiment show that the proposed F-NNMC needs less frequency resource and has better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), as well as lower bit error rate (BER) compared to orthogonal and non-orthogonal modulations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider wireless-powered secure communication with an energy harvesting receiver, which is allowed to harvest energy from the transmitted signals but not to decode information, and there is thus a requirement to keep the information secret from this potential eavesdropper. Considering co-channel interference among signal links, we find the optimal transmit power to maximize the sum rate of the signal links, while ensuring the requirements of information secrecy and energy harvesting. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem formulated here, we first derive suboptimal solutions using an iterative algorithm based on a dual method. In order to address the limitations caused by the use of the iterative algorithm, i.e., long computation time and suboptimality, we design an efficient deep neural network (DNN) framework and a novel training strategy as a means of combining supervised and unsupervised training. Specifically, the DNN is first pre-trained using labeled training data with the suboptimal solutions obtained from the iterative algorithm in a supervised manner; further training is then applied to the DNN using a well designed loss function in an unsupervised manner to enhance the training performance. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal performance with a lower computation time than existing schemes. We also verify that the pre-training and the new loss function are effective in improving the speed of training of the DNN.},

  abstract     = {This article analyzes the robustness and timeliness for cooperative lossy communications in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. The analytical framework consists of two steps: 1) calculating the outage probability, and 2) characterizing the Age-of-Information (AoI) for a given outage probability. Initially, we determine the outage probability based on the Shannon&#39;s lossy source-channel separation theorem. Numerical results indicate that joint decoding reduces the outage probability, and the system can achieve higher diversity order for less stringent distortion requirement. Then, we derive a closed-form expression of the lower bound on the average AoI for the communication system where outage events are constrained to an acceptable level. Moreover, we conduct a series of simulations for verifying the lower bound on the average AoI and evaluating the impact of UAV locations on the average AoI. It is demonstrated that the lower bound is tight when the server utilization ratio is either relatively busy or idle. For the case with a relatively large outage probability, we propose an intermittent transmission scheme to refine the AoI performance without extra energy consumption. The effectiveness of the intermittent transmission scheme for reducing the average AoI is verified by both the simulations and the lower bound analysis.},

  abstract     = {The acquisitionof ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) services via grant-free access has been specified in 5G to support real-time applications in future vehicular communications scenarios. However, this configuration introduces the denial of access attack, aiming to paralyze uplink access by tampering wireless pilots or reference symbols of vehicular users. We in this paper propose a novel hash coding method to probabilistically encode/decode random pilots using resource features of wireless data, such that the influence of attack on pilots can be dispersed across resources and minimized under arbitrary distribution of attack modes. Particularly, multiple access vehicular users adopt random pilots as their own temporal identities which are then hashed on independent subcarriers. Since those subcarriers would carry complex signals, receiver needs to decode pilots despite jamming attack on those subcarriers. The concept of Bayesian attack mode graph (BAMG) is developed to characterize the distribution of attack modes. We show how access control can change the structure of BAMG. Therefore, paging and feature based access control methods are respectively proposed to help identify both uplink users and attack modes while a novel hash decoding method is developed to decode random pilots. The upper and lower bounds of decoding errors are derived under arbitrary attack distribution. With above efforts, the uplink access can be secured within tolerance of errors. Furthermore, novel expressions of failure probability under secure access are derived to characterize the reliability of this new system. Simulations demonstrate the availability of proposed scheme against attack.},

Due to the coarse nonliner property, conventional precoding methods, developed under infinite-resolution DACs, could not yield an attractive performance having a severe error-floor. Finding an optimal transmit signal, moreover, is computationally implausible due to its combinatorial nature. This challenging problem has been partially solved in our earlier work focusing on phase-shift-keying constellations. Our major contribution is to extend it into more practical quadrature-amplitude-modulation constellations in a non-trivial way. We first derive the so-called feasibility condition to guarantee that every user&#39;s noiseless received signal belongs to a desired decision region, and then transform it as linear constraints. Taking the robustness to an additive noise into account, the proposed construction method is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. We construct an efficient algorithm to solve it (equivalently, to generate an 1-bit transmit signal). Via simulation results, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method with respect to a computational complexity and detection performance.},

This paper investigates the impact of phase noise on the performance of cell-free MIMO systems which employ a large number of multi-antenna access points (APs). For both downlink and uplink transmissions, we derive the tractable closed-form achievable rate expressions when signal detection with channel state information (CSI) and channel distribution information (CDI), respectively, by utilizing the extended deterministic equivalence method in random matrix theory. The closed-form achievable rate expressions provide efficient evaluation for the impact of phase noise on system performance. The analytical results indicate that the phase noise influences the power of the desired signal, the beamforming uncertainty gain, and the inter-user interference increment caused by the pilot contamination. In addition, the special cases that only APs have phase noise and only users have phase noise are discussed. It is found that the impact of phase noise at users is more severe than that at APs. Besides, we discuss the system performance at low and high SNR regimes. It demonstrates that the phase noise is the major limitation of the system performance in high SNR regime while it can be neglected in low SNR regime. Furthermore, we formulate the max-min power control problem for both downlink and uplink transmissions to guarantee the users’ fairness and prove that the downlink max-min problem is a quasi-concave problem while the uplink max-min problem is a geometric programming (GP) problem. Then, the phase noise-aware max-min power control schemes for both downlink and uplink transmissions are proposed to ensure the users’ fairness. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the analytical results and the proposed phase noise-aware power control scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the performance of a hybrid receiver-based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) two-way relay network over Nakagami- m faded channels. A hybrid receiver is adopted at the relay node that utilizes both the time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) protocols for energy harvesting and information transmission. Amplify-and-forward relaying protocol is utilized at the relay node to process the information in half-duplex mode. In the considered network, impact of a practical non-linear power amplifier (NLPA) at the relay node is considered. Selection combining is performed at the destination node to utilize the direct-link and relay assisted signals. For the considered system, the analytical expressions of outage probability (OP) and asymptotic OP are derived over Nakagami- m faded channels for both the integer and non-integer value of m . The analytical expression of the system throughput and energy efficiency of the considered network are also derived. Further, the analytical expression of ergodic capacity is derived in terms of the Meijer-G function. By utilizing a cumulative distribution function based approach, analytical expressions of average symbol error rate (ASER) for general order hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), general order rectangular QAM, and 32-cross QAM schemes are derived. For different QAM constellations, a comparative ASER analysis is also illustrated. Furthermore, the impact of TS factor, PS ratio, energy conversion efficiency, NLPA, and threshold data-rates on the considered network is also highlighted. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are performed for validation of the derived analytical expressions.},

  abstract     = {With the burgeoning video applications in 5G/B5G, the requirements for video frame quality and playback smoothness are equally strict but challenging to satisfy simultaneously, especially in fast moving scenarios. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a predictive two-timescale resource allocation scheme for video-on-demand (VoD) services by leveraging the long-term channel prediction. The scheme addresses two critical concerns. One is how to schedule packets over a large timescale to avoid transmission in poor channel states. The other is how to guarantee the delay-quality of service (QoS) over a small timescale to satisfy the high-quality requirements of video services. In the framework of network slicing, we split the VoD slice into two logical sub-slices to support the video contents that play immediately after downloading and the video contents to be pre-cached, respectively. To perform an efficient resource reservation, we propose a martingales-based resource estimation method for the video streams with statistical delay-QoS requirements. Based on this, our scheme is divided into two stages. First, on the time scale of prediction time slots, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm to find a spectrum-efficient video delivery pattern. Then, in each transmission time interval, we develop a utility theory based resource allocation algorithm to balance the metrics of spectrum efficiency, fairness, and delay-QoS. The simulation results demonstrate the capability of the QoS guarantee and the promising gain of spectrum efficiency brought by our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Since optical links are easily blocked by obstacles in the environment, they have been considered difficult to directly perform wireless communications. However, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), as a new type of digital coding meta-materials, can significantly improve the coverage of optical communication by establishing new links. We propose a controllable multi-branch wireless optical communication system based on optical RISs. By setting up multiple optical RISs in the environment, multiple artificial channels are built to improve the system performance and to reduce the outage probability. In this paper, we investigate three factors affecting channel coefficients, including beam jitter, RIS jitter, and obstruction probability. We derive closed-form probability density function of channel coefficients, asymptotic average bit-error rate (BER), and the outage probability for systems with multiple branches. Our analysis reveals that the probability density function contains an impulse function, which causes irreducible error rate and outage probability floors. Based on our numerical results, the BER and outage probability floor of the multi-branch system are significantly reduced compared with the single direct path system. Therefore, the optical RIS assisted multi-branch wireless communication is a promising solution against obstacles of optical channel.},

  abstract     = {Levitation control is a core technique of magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains, whose performance has a significant impact on the driving safety and ride comfort during the operation of Maglev trains. With the rapid development of high temperature superconducting (HTS) materials, a novel hybrid levitation system for Maglev trains, composed of HTS and normal conducting electromagnets, is becoming a more promising alternative to the conventional levitation system, due to a lager levitation air gap and lower energy consumption. The controller of the hybrid levitation system is hard to design due to strong nonlinearity, open-loop instability and fast-response requirements. In this study, we propose a robust model predictive control (MPC) strategy for the novel hybrid levitation system in which state constraints are taken into account, including the air gap, and the velocity and acceleration of the hybrid magnet. In the MPC strategy, the prediction model employs a stabilized model through nonlinear and linear state feedback. With regard to the online computational load, the primal-dual interior-point (PDI) algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization problem with high efficiency to deal with constraints in a real-time manner. Finally, simulation results are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MPC-PDI control strategy for the hybrid levitation system, and the significances considering state constraints are revealed. This study provides an engineering realization solution to the novel hybrid levitation system of a Maglev train.},

  abstract     = {The ‘train-rail’ integrated grounding system for high-speed trains plays the critical role in providing the unique path for power feedback, which mainly consists of two parts - the on-board dynamic grounding sub-system and the fixed terrestrial grounding sub-system. The on-board dynamic grounding sub-system can be classified into two types of grounding modes – working grounding provides the discharging path for transferring the traction power; while the protective grounding maintains reference ground potential for the train body – both of which share the rail as the common path for discharging current. Thus, the traction current discharged from the working grounding wheel sets flows through the neighboring protective grounding wheel sets back to the train body, forming as the ‘train-rail’ current reflux. The ‘train-rail’ current reflux may result in the appearance of a ‘train body’ (TB) current, which may rise the potential of the train body. The TB current and voltage may cause electromagnetic interference to the on-board equipment, electrochemical corrosion on grounding wheel bearing or even on-board partial temperature surging. In this paper, a ‘train-rail’ coupling integrated grounding model is launched to evaluate both the TB current and voltage. Based on this model, different grounding distribution schemes have been tried and compared, considering the impact brought from TB current and voltage. The external grounding resistors are installed in series at the protective grounding wheel sets implemented, with the aim of restricting the TB current and voltage. Ultimately, the best-performed grounding scheme of installing external resistors is found out.},

According to the influence of charge and discharge threshold on the energy flow in TPSS, the laws of energy flow are formulated. Subsequently, an EMS based on fuzzy logic control (FLC) is designed. The proposed EMS is adaptive to the variation of headway and no-load voltage. By monitoring the charge-discharge effect of ESS and the variation of substation output energy within two adjacent periods, the charge-discharge threshold is adjusted adaptively to guarantee the recovery effect of regenerative braking energy. Finally, the simulation and field experiment of proposed EMS are carried out with ground energy storage device and actual line conditions of Beijing Batong line.

A unified dispatch scheme is developed to allocate reactive power compensation capacity for each reversible substation. During night hours the entire capacity is used to accomplish the optimal power flow objective. During day hours the excess capacity after active power production is used to improve the system reactive power factor dynamically. The different objectives throughout the day are implemented in a unified formula which avoids manually change. In addition the outage of reversible substations and the low dc voltage conditions are considered and an over-modulation suppression strategy is included in the unified dispatch scheme to adjust the reactive power allocation among reversible substations. This novel utilization method of reversible substations is able to provide significant improvements in the power factor of dc traction power systems which would otherwise require expensive additional equipment such as static synchronous compensator.

Then, two distributed DRL algorithms, namely asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO), were adopted to propose EMSs, respectively. Finally, emission optimization was taken into account and then distributed DRL-based E&amp;EMSs were proposed. Regarding dynamic programming (DP) as the optimal benchmark, simulation results show that three DRL-based control strategies can achieve near-optimal fuel economy and outstanding computational efficiency, and compared with DQN, two distributed DRL algorithms have improved the learning efficiency by four times.},

Although electric vehicles have been widely promoted by governments around the world, their development is seriously hampered due to charger unavailability and range anxiety. Based on this, this paper designs an energy interaction converter between two electric vehicles, which is controlled through disturbance observer based sliding mode control algorithm. For this converter, three main demands should be satisfied, i.e., high power density, weak source and constant power load. Therein, weak source whose minimum short circuit ratio (SCR) belongs to Jia et al. , 2020 and Wang et al. , 2020, is always called weak grid. Firstly, the equivalent impedance switching process is introduced to eliminate the impact of weak source. Meanwhile, the equivalent six channel interleaved floating dual boost converter is chosen to satisfy the high power density demand, whose generalized state-space function is further built to provide an indispensable preprocessing for following controller design. Moreover, in order to solve the problem regarding low frequency/sub-synchronous oscillation caused through constant power load feature regarding the energy consumption vehicle and weak source feature regarding the energy supply vehicle, a disturbance observer based sliding mode control algorithm is proposed through using generalized state-space function to provide standard DC power with both constant voltage and power. Furthermore, the proportional-resonant controller is proposed to solve the current sharing problem among six parallel channels, which reduces the heat loss and improves the service life of the device. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the high performance of the proposed control algorithm.},

First, trains, the reflux system, and traction substations with EFSs are modeled, and the multimode transitions are analyzed, including the maximum power state of the EFS. Then, a modified AC/DC unified power flow algorithm for the DC power supply system, which simplified the DC reflux system is proposed, and a field case study based on a multiple train scenario is presented to validate the algorithm. Furthermore, system-level energy-saving evaluation indexes are applied according to system power flow analysis. When the headway time decreases, the proposed indexes decrease in general mainly as there is more regenerative braking energy absorbed by adjacent trains. The higher the load rates of the step-down substations are, the more daily feedback energy is utilized. When the start voltage of the EFS ranges from 1650 V to 1770 V, the maximum energy-saving rate reaches 11.9%, which occurs when the start voltage is 1670 V. When the no-load voltage is relatively high, the start voltage should not be higher than 1750 V to keep the system running in high efficiency. These results can provide advice for the design and operation of traction power supply systems with EFSs.},

This paper presents four novel phase-modulation-based approaches that utilize pseudo-random binary sequences to estimate target distances up to 180 m and the absolute value of target velocities up to 80 m/s. The corresponding system setup is lean, as it is based on only one phase modulator and one non-quadrature demodulator. The proposed methods are assessed analytically and by simulations and are compared in terms of computational complexity, detection performance, measurement rate and accuracy. The results demonstrate that while each approach has individual advantages and limitations, the proposed methods offer essential advancements in terms of measurement rate, multiplexing potential and multi-target capability, compared to already known methods.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of advanced vehicular mechatronic systems help to bring vehicle performances to a higher level. To fully unleash the power of such systems, an integrated vehicular control framework has been widely adopted. All actuators, along with their impact on vehicle dynamics are considered in a holistic model, and control performances based on such models are highly optimized thanks to a centralized distribution process. However, the strong reliance on a complex model with details for all subsystems limits the scalability and re-usability of resultant controllers. Any changes from vehicle topology to actuator details will lead to a controller redesign. In some cases, execution logic of actuators might even be proprietary and cannot be incorporated into a centralized coordination scheme. A flat architecture is proposed in our previous research to address such limitations, and a distributed multi-agent control scheme is suggested for a specialized modular vehicle platform. This paper generalizes such approach, and focuses on addressing model scalability and re-usability in complex vehicular active safety applications. When properly formulated, the proposed agent-based cooperative controllers are shown to give no compromise to control performances as their integrated-designed counterparts. The proposed framework also features greater flexibility in handling vehicle configuration changes as well as actuator modelling granularities. Incorporation of proprietary subsystems as “black-box” agent modules expands the coverage of the proposed architecture for advanced vehicular mechatronic systems.},

  abstract     = {While bringing convenience to people, the growing number of vehicles already on roads causes inevitable traffic congestion. Traffic congestion can happen for both observable reasons, such as accidents, or occur naturally due to human driving style in high vehicles density scenarios. In the latter case, traffic congestion are referred to as phantom jams. To alleviate the traffic instability caused by phantom jams, bilateral control models have been proposed with the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) in ideal situations. However, in road scenarios, some factors that severely affect the performance of existing models cannot be ignored, such as uncertainties of vehicle state measurements caused by on-board sensors, time delay caused by intervehicle communications and control systems of vehicles. In this paper, a novel predictable bilateral control model (PBCM) with local wireless communication, which consists of best estimation and state prediction, is proposed to accurately control the host vehicle in traffic flow to alleviate traffic instability. Compared with other models, theoretical analysis and simulation results show that more accurate control decisions could be obtained with the PBCM, which could distribute all vehicles more evenly, and our model could maintain higher velocities when disturbances occurred. The experimental results also reveal that our proposed model could more effectively suppress traffic instability (i.e., the improvement in control decision &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$a$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is more than 10%) and could restore traffic balance 20% faster than other models on average.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the stochastic on time arrival (SOTA) problem in Gaussian process (GP) regulated environments. We presume that the travel times of the underlying transportation network follow a multi-variate Gaussian distribution, i . e . Gaussian process, and propose a Gaussian process proactive path planner (GP4), which outputs a dynamic routing policy for maximizing the traveller&#39;s on-time-arrival probability. When given an instantiated travel time of a certain link, GP is able to analytically represent/predict the posterior travel time distribution over the entire transportation network. With that, we let the ego vehicle ‘proactively’ select the next traversal link, which maximizes the expected stochastic on time arrival probability based on the predicted posterior travel time distribution. Various extensions of GP4 to other forms of travel time distribution assumptions, such as Log-GP and Bi-GP, are proposed and extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of GP4 to various transportation networks, including a real use case with real traffic data in Chengdu, China.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the value of communicated motion predictions in the longitudinal control of connected automated vehicles (CAVs). We focus on a safe cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design and analyze the value of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in the presence of uncertain front vehicle acceleration. The interest in CACC is motivated by the potential improvement in energy consumption and road throughput. In order to quantify this potential, we characterize experimentally the relationship between inter-vehicular gap, vehicle speed, and (reduction of) energy consumption for a compact plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The resulting model is leveraged to show efficacy of our control design, which pursues small inter-vehicle gaps between consecutive CAVs and, therefore, improved energy efficiency. Our proposed control design is based on a robust model predictive control framework to systematically account for the system uncertainties. We present a set of thorough simulations aimed at quantifying energy efficiency improvement when vehicle states and predictions exchanged via V2V communication are used in the control law.},

A two-stage traffic participant trajectory predictor comprising short-term and long-term prediction is used in the planning layer to generate safe but not over-conservative trajectories for the ego-vehicle. The prediction module cooperates well with existing planning approaches. Our work showcases its effectiveness in a Frenet frame planner. A robust controller using tube MPC guarantees safe execution of the trajectory in the presence of state noise and dynamic model uncertainty.

  abstract     = {To improve the accuracy and robustness of the inertial navigation systems (INS) for wheeled robots without adding additional component cost, we propose Wheel-INS, a complete dead reckoning (DR) solution based on a wheel-mounted microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU) in this article. There are two major advantages of mounting IMU to the center of a non-steering wheel. Firstly, the gyroscope outputs can be used to calculate the wheel speed, so as to replace the traditional odometer to mitigate the error drift of INS. Secondly, with the rotation of the wheel, the constant bias error of the inertial sensor can be canceled to some extent. The installation scheme of the wheel-mounted MEMS IMU (Wheel-IMU), the system characteristics, and the DR error analysis are all discussed in this paper. Experimental results show that the maximum position drift of Wheel-INS in the horizontal plane is less than 1.8% of the total traveled distance, reduced by 23% compared to the conventional odometer-aided INS (ODO/INS). In addition, Wheel-INS outperforms ODO/INS because of its inherent immunity to constant bias error of gyroscopes. The source code and experimental datasets have been made available to the community ( https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/Wheel-INS ).},

In this paper we introduce an active learning framework, based on the query-by-bagging algorithm, that substantially reduces the number of simulations needed to train a classifier.

  abstract     = {In the era of internet of vehicles, both the traffic signal control and the rerouting of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are essential techniques to alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency. However, these two schemes have been treated separately without a unified framework allowing for joint optimization in the previous studies. In the case of traffic congestion at the bottleneck intersections, either of the two schemes alone is not enough. To this end, we propose to jointly control the traffic lights and the CAVs under the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To lower the dimensionality of this learning problem, we propose to control the route choices of the CAVs through a few common scalar parameters instead of controlling the CAVs individually. In particular, the rerouting ratios are dynamically adjusted. A model-based method is further proposed to estimate the expected travel time with reduced estimation error. We then exploit the tools from deep RL and put forth an efficient algorithm that is able to control the green time allocation of traffic signals and the rerouting of CAVs jointly. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed models and show the traffic efficiency can be significantly improved with our proposed algorithm.},

Some literatures endeavor to improve parking service qualities through multi-consideration parking decision optimization on edge sides or cloud computing based on outsourced data storage. And some other literatures propose a number of privacy-preserving methods, such as cryptography and authentication, but these privacy strategies are at the expense of other qualities of parking services, especially the real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy skyline parking recommendation scheme for real-time parking recommendation based on roadside traffic facilities. Linguistic parking information instead of raw parking-related data is used in fuzzy skyline fusion. We evaluated our solution with real-world data sets collected from parking facilities in Wulin downtown, Hangzhou city, China.

One of the new concepts that can utilize multiple energy sources is a hybrid fuel station (HFS). For instance, an HFS can benefit from energy hubs, renewable energies, and natural gas sources to supply electric vehicles along with natural gas vehicles. However, the optimal operation of an HFS deals with uncertainties from different sources that do not have similar natures. Some may lack in term of historical data, and some may have very random and unpredictable behavior. In this study, we present a stochastic mathematical framework to address both types of these uncertainties according to the innate nature of each uncertain variable, namely: epistemic uncertainty variables (EUVs) and aleatory uncertainty variables (AUVs). Also, the imprecise probability approach is introduced for EUVs utilizing the copula theory in the process, and a scenario-based approach combining Monte Carlo simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling is applied for AUVs. The proposed framework is employed to address the daily operation of a novel HFS, leading to a two-stage mixed-integer linear programming problem. The proposed approach and its applicability are verified using various numerical simulations.},

However, simultaneous operation of multiple drones is challenging, considering the real-time interactions and the environment; the drone must avoid collision with the other drones or obstacles. The proposed Advanced TD3 model performs energy-efficient path planning at the edge-level drone. We modify the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), which is the state-of-the-art policy gradient reinforcement learning. The frame stacking technique considers the continuous action space of the drone to the TD3 model. During the training, we gradually increase the observation range of agents for fast and stable convergence. We train the modified TD3 model through Offline RL to reduce the overhead for the RL model training. Drones mount the converged RL model on their onboard computer. The Advanced TD3 model in the drones selects an energy-efficient path without the overhead of the training process of the RL model in real-time, considering external factors such as wind or another drone. The total energy consumption of drones in flight along with online path planning is approximately 106% of the total energy consumption of drones that follow offline path planning, even though the trained TD3 model does not require complex computations for real-time execution.},

  abstract     = {Standard cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems is a promising technology to cover the demands for higher data rates in fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond. These systems assume a large number of distributed access points (APs) using joint coherent transmission to communicate with the users. However, CF mMIMO systems present an increasing computational complexity as the number of users increases. Scalable cell-free CF (SCF) systems have been proposed to face this challenge. Given that the cost-efficient deployment of such large networks requires low-cost transceivers, which are prone to unavoidable hardware imperfections, realistic evaluations of SCF mMIMO systems should take them into account before implementation. Hence, in this work, we focus on the impact of hardware impairments (HWIs) on the SCF mMIMO systems through a general model accounting for both additive and multiplicative impairments. Notably, there is no other work in the literature studying the impact of phase noise (PN) in the local oscillators (LOs) of CF mMIMO systems or in general the impact of any HWIs in SCF mMIMO systems. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the uplink capacity accounting for HWIs. Moreover, we obtain the optimal hardware-aware (HA) partial minimum mean-squared error (PMMSE) combiner. Especially, the lower bound is derived in closed-form using the theory of deterministic equivalents (DEs). Among the interesting findings, we observe that separate LOs (SLOs) outperform a common LO (CLO), and the additive transmit distortion degrades more the performance than the additive receive distortion.},

  abstract     = {Controller area networks (CANs) are a broadcast protocol for real-time communication of critical vehicle subsystems. Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal&#39;s boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers—both of which are superior to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios—and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$&amp;gt;$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 97% F-score. Overall, CAN-D is the only solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal that is also the state of the art. In evaluation on 10 vehicles of different makes, CAN-D&#39;s average &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell ^1$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; error is five times better (81% less) than all previous methods and exhibits lower average error, even when considering only signals that meet prior methods’ assumptions. Finally, CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware, allowing for an on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, adaptive filters in complex domain have received increasing attention since they can be applied to a wider scenario than real valued cases. As two typical information theoretic criteria, the minimum complex kernel risk-sensitive loss (MCKRSL) and maximum complex correntropy criterion (MCCC) have shown robustness to non-Gaussian noises in complex domain adaptive filtering. However, since both criteria cannot consider the probability distribution of error, they are not optimal in the presence of some non-Gaussian noises. This paper firstly defines a complex Shannon entropy in terms of the probability distribution of error. Then, a novel adaptive filter is proposed using the minimum complex Shannon entropy (MCSE) criterion. More significantly, the convergence behavior of the MCSE algorithm is discussed, and thus the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) is calculated for theoretical analysis. Finally, simulated results on system identification and channel estimation validate the obtained theoretical results and the merits of the proposed MCSE algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Visible Light Communication (VVLC) is preferred as a vehicle to everything (V2X) communications scheme due to its highly secure, low complexity and radio frequency (RF) interference free characteristics, exploiting the line of sight (LoS) propagation of visible light and usage of already existing vehicle light emitting diodes (LEDs). Current VVLC channel models based on deterministic and stochastic methods provide limited accuracy for path loss prediction since deterministic methods heavily depend on site-specific geometry and stochastic models average out the model parameters without considering environmental effects. Moreover, there exists no wireless channel model that can be adopted for channel frequency response (CFR) prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the machine learning (ML) based channel modeling of the VVLC with the goal of improving the model accuracy for path loss and building the CFR model through the consideration of multiple input variables related to vehicle mobility and environmental effects. The proposed framework incorporates multiple measurable input variables, e.g., distance, ambient light, receiver inclination angle, and optical turbulence, with the exploitation of feed forward neural network based multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and decision tree based Random Forest learning methods. The framework also includes data pre-processing step, with synthetic minority over sampling technique (SMOTE) data balancing, and hyper-parameter tuning based on iterative grid search, to further improve the accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed ML based channel modeling is demonstrated on the real world VVLC vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication channel data. The proposed MLP-NN, RBF-NN and Random Forest based channel models generate highly accurate path loss predictions with 3.53 dB, 3.81 dB, 3.95 dB root mean square error (RMSE), whereas the best performing stochastic model based on two-term exponential fitting provides prediction accuracy of 7 dB RMSE. Moreover, MLP-NN and RBF-NN models are demonstrated to predict VVLC CFR with 3.78 dB and 3.60 dB RMSE, respectively.},

Besides, from the perspective of alternating maximization (AM) these sufficient statistics can also be updated by maximizing the complete-data log-likelihood function with respect to only the complete data, based on which both deterministic and stochastic signal models are considered. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed AM algorithm is equivalent to the EM algorithm for the deterministic signal model while outperforming the EM algorithm for the stochastic signal model. On this foundation, a sequential AM (SAM) algorithm and two iterative weighting schemes are proposed to improve the convergence of the AM algorithm. Numerical results show that the SAM algorithm yields faster convergence and the two iterative weighting schemes can be used to avoid the convergence of the EM and AM algorithms to an unwanted limit point efficiently.},

Specifically, a binary angle-of-departure (AoD) vector and the associated angular-domain channel coefficients are first extracted from the massive MIMO channel. Then, by exploiting the dynamic burst-sparsity of the massive MIMO channel in the joint time-angular domain, a two-stage differential feedback scheme is proposed to compress and feed back the AoD vector, where the feedback overhead is adaptively adjusted according to the AoD changing rate. In addition, an adaptive-codebook-based feedback scheme is proposed for the angular-domain channel coefficients. Compared with the 5G New Radio (NR) Type-2 feedback scheme in 3GPP R15, the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the feedback overhead and achieve better block error rate (BLER) performance.},

Usually, the spectral magnitude of the subspace-based coarray MUSIC algorithm is used for this task of underdetermined source localization. However, the phase spectrum of coarray MUSIC, which has not yet been utilized, exhibits sharp transitions at the direction of arrival (DOA) of the respective sources. As a result, the negative differential of this phase called the coarray group delay shows peaks at the DOAs. In this correspondence, a new source localization technique called the coarray MUSIC-Group delay (coarray MGD) described as the product of the coarray-MUSIC magnitude and the coarray group delay function is introduced. It is shown that as long as the difference coarray of the NULA is a uniform linear array (ULA), the group delay function displays an additive property in the coarray spatial domain. Owing to this property, the proposed coarray MGD technique is able to localize and resolve more closely-spaced sources than the coarray MUSIC magnitude method. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the high resolution property of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Small-cell networks (SCNs), especially those operating in millimeter-wave bands, are sensitive to blockages. In this letter, we develop a three-dimensional (3D) SCN model considering blockages to investigate the impact of base-station (BS) height, BS density and blockage density on the downlink coverage probability. More specifically, we model the blockages as cylinders whose locations follow a Poisson point process and model the locations of BSs as a Poisson hole process. We assume that all the BSs are of the same height and the blockage height follows an exponential distribution. Based on the 3D SCN model, we derive the exact integral expression of coverage probability for general SCNs and the closed-form expression of coverage probability for ultra-dense SCNs. Our analytical results are verified to be reliable through simulations. The numerical results quantify the impact of the blockage density and the BS height on the coverage probability. For a small blockage density, elevated BSs always degrade the coverage probability, while the coverage probability first increases and then decreases with the BS height when the blockage density becomes sufficiently large.},

  abstract     = {Power control is becoming increasingly essential for the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond systems. An example use-case, among others, is the unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) communications where the nearly line-of-sight (LoS) radio channels may result in very low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). The authors in (Chiang et al. , 2007) proposed to efficiently and reliably solve this kind of non-convex problem via a series of geometrical programmings (GPs) using condensation approximation. However, it is only applicable for a small-scale network with several communication pairs and practically infeasible with more (e.g., tens of) nodes to be jointly optimized. We therefore in this paper aim to provide new insights into this problem. By properly introducing auxiliary variables, the problem is transformed to an equivalent form which is simpler and more intuitive for condensation. A novel condensation method with linear complexity is also proposed based on the form. The enhancements make the GP-based power control feasible for both small- and especially large-scale networks that are common in 5G and beyond. The algorithm is verified via simulations. A preliminary case study of uplink UAV communications also shows the potential of the algorithm.},

The goal is to jointly optimize the phase components at the transmitters and the orientation angles of the groups that maximize the radiated energy over an angular sector containing an adversary while placing a null towards the client in order not to obfuscate the client. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, it is intractable to obtain the optimal solution in closed-form. To this end, we propose a non-iterative closed-form solution by adopting a group-wise nullforming approach where each group independently creates a null to the client.

  abstract     = {Delta-orthogonal multiple access (D-OMA) has been recently investigated as a potential technique to enhance the spectral efficiency in the sixth-generation (6G) networks. D-OMA enables partial overlapping of the adjacent sub-channels that are assigned to different clusters of users served by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), at the expense of additional interference. In this paper, we analyze the performance of D-OMA in the uplink and develop a multi-objective optimization framework to maximize the uplink energy efficiency (EE) in a multi-access point (AP) network enabled by D-OMA. Specifically, we optimize the sub-channel and transmit power allocations of the users as well as the overlapping percentage of the spectrum between the adjacent sub-channels. The formulated problem is a mixed binary non-linear programming problem. Therefore, to address the challenge we first transform the problem into a single-objective problem using Tchebycheff method. Then, we apply the monotonic optimization (MO) to explore the hidden monotonicity of the objective function and constraints, and reformulate the problem into a standard MO in canonical form. The reformulated problem can be solved by applying the outer polyblock approximation method. Our numerical results show that D-OMA outperforms the conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) when the adjacent sub-channel overlap and scheduling are optimized jointly.},

Hence, in this paper, we analyze the effect of a FD transceiver&#39;s in-phase and quadrature imbalance (IQI) on simultaneously jamming the receiver of an eavesdropper and detecting a signal of interest by deriving an expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) metric. Through further analysis for some special and limiting cases, performance insights are drawn by showing that the SOP is dependent on the image rejection capability of the FD transceiver and is approximately equal to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\frac{3}{\text{IRR}}(\ln {(\text{IRR})} - 1.83)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where the IRR is the image-rejection ratio.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising candidate solution for data collection of large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we investigate a UAV-aided WSN, where cluster heads (CHs) receive data from their member nodes, and a UAV is dispatched to collect data from CHs. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV-WSN system in a complete round of data collection. Toward this end, we formulate the energy consumption minimization problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem by jointly selecting CHs from clusters and planning the UAV&#39;s visiting order to the selected CHs. The formulated energy consumption minimization problem is NP-hard, and hence, hard to solve optimally. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, pointer network-A* (Ptr-A*), which can efficiently learn the UAV trajectory policy for minimizing the energy consumption. The UAV&#39;s start point and the WSN with a set of pre-determined clusters are fed into the Ptr-A*, and the Ptr-A* outputs a group of CHs and the visiting order of CHs, i.e., the UAV&#39;s trajectory. The parameters of the Ptr-A* are trained on small-scale clusters problem instances for faster training by using the actor-critic algorithm in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results show that the trained models based on 20-clusters and 40-clusters have a good generalization ability to solve the UAV&#39;s trajectory planning problem in WSNs with different numbers of clusters, without retraining the models. Furthermore, the results show that our proposed DRL algorithm outperforms two baseline techniques.},

  abstract     = {With the development of high-speed railways (HSRs), people&#39;s lives have become more convenient. At the same time, people are demanding more data services on trains in terms of wireless communications and mobile computation. Recently, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), a new computing paradigm, has the great potential to improve the user experience of computing services by placing the cloud infrastructures closer to end-users so that users can offload their computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks to the edge servers. In this paper, we concentrate on finding proper data routing paths for each offloaded task and each process result, with the objective of maximizing the network throughput by serving as many tasks as possible while meeting the MEC network resource constraints and the user demand constraints within a finite time horizon of equal time slots. It is challenging because of the unspecific data volume of an offloaded task and handovers of task offloading procedures that may frequently occur. Thus, we first investigate the impact of handovers in uplinks and downlinks. Then we propose a graph-based model to portray the resource availability in the network. Furthermore, a heuristic algorithm is devised, which finds a set of single-source-single-destination delay-constrained shortest paths in a series of auxiliary graphs. Finally, we perform an empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithm by simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could achieve a higher network throughput than the other two benchmark heuristics.},

This paper describes the AddP-CACC - a consensus-based solution to vehicle platoons. The proposed solution turns the communication topology into a design parameter that dynamically reconfigures the controller. In addition, the controller automatically compensates for outdated information caused by network losses and delays. AddP-CACC was implemented in the PLEXE tool and was compared with other related works. Simulation results have shown the robustness and performance of the proposed solution in various scenarios that would include realistic propagation conditions with interference caused by other vehicles. The results have also evidenced the ability of the proposed solution to maintain a stable vehicular platoon by using different communication topologies, different vehicle flows, even in the presence of strong interferences, delays, and fading conditions.},

Unlike the traditional schemes, which consists of complex energy-transportation meshes, the proposed scheme achieves a balance between demand and response by providing incentives to EVs out of their self-interests. However, the online transactions security and privacy protection of EVs poses challenges with respect to confidentiality and integrity preservation. To cope up with the issues, we design a consortium blockchain-based scheme to ensure secure energy transactions between EVs and the SPs without trusted third-party intervention. Moreover, the energy pricing and the amount of traded energy problems for demand response are solved by a double auction mechanism to maximize the social welfare. Numerical results based on a real-time implementation on a private Ethereum network having smart contract demonstrated that the auction-based mechanism achieves social welfare maximization with privacy protection of online transactions between EVs and the SPs. The results obtained show that the rate of convergence, scalability metric average latency, and standard deviation of the energy transactions have been improved by approximately 18.18%, 15%, and 28.1%, respectively in comparison to the existing schemes. Moreover, security and privacy analysis of the proposed scheme shows that it improves the transaction security substantially in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art proposals.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have been widely investigated for ocean environmental monitoring, offshore exploration, and marine military. The core function of UASNs is to collect data for related operations. A number of factors make the monitoring challenging; ocean thermoclines may affect the communication of the underwater nodes and gliders, reducing their communication range at varying depth; moreover, the node movement caused by Ekman drifting effect can significantly interfere with the data transmissions. Thus, these factors are regarded essential towards characterizing the ocean environment. To address these challenges, a sleep-scheduling-based hierarchical data collection algorithm (SSHDCA) for underwater gliders is designed. The UASN is split into multiple virtual cubes, where the nodes in different virtual cubes sleep and work alternately to save energy. Then, the SSHDCA divides the network into a dynamic layer and a static layer. In the dynamic layer, a virtual-cube-based multi-hop method is leveraged to transmit data packets to the central area. In the static layer, an improved density-based clustering technique is applied to assign each node to an appropriate cluster, while the underwater gliders collect data from the cluster heads. Further, to reduce energy consumption, the SSHDCA compresses key and non-key data, reducing the size of the packets. Simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm is effective in reducing the path length of the gliders and the average energy consumption of the nodes, while increasing the remaining operational life of the whole network.},

  abstract     = {5G is envisioned to simultaneously provide diverse service types with heterogeneous needs under very different application scenarios and business models. Therefore, network slicing is included as a key feature of the 5G architecture to allow sharing a common infrastructure among different tenants, such as mobile communication providers, vertical market players, etc. In order to provide the Radio Access Network (RAN) with network slicing capabilities, mechanisms that efficiently distribute the available capacity among the different tenants while satisfying their needs are required. For this purpose, this paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for RAN capacity sharing. It makes use of the Deep Q-Network algorithm in a way that each agent is associated to a different tenant and learns the capacity to be provided to this tenant in each cell while ensuring that the service level agreements are satisfied and that the available radio resources are efficiently used. The consideration of multiple agents contributes to a better scalability and higher learning speed in comparison to single-agent approaches. In this respect, results show that the policy learnt by the agent of one tenant can be generalised and directly applied by other agents, thus reducing the complexity of the training and making the proposed solution easily scalable, e.g., to add new tenants in the system. The proposed approach is well aligned with the on-going 3GPP standardization work and guidelines for the parametrization of the solution are provided, thus enforcing its practical applicability.},

  abstract     = {With the explosion of data traffic, the use of caching technology to offload data traffic is a very effective way to alleviate network pressure, especially in high-speed train (HST) scenarios. And when users participate in the caching game, the costs of data offloading are greatly reduced. However, current research on users’ participation in data traffic offloading is not much; and there are user security and data reliability issues in the cache of device-to-device (D2D) network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel scheme that user terminals (UTs) cooperatively cache wireless services to the intelligent routing relay (IRR) side in HST scenarios; and we establish a reverse auction model to motivate UTs to collaborate and cache. In this model, IRR acts as the purchaser of the wireless services and UTs are suppliers and consumers. We propose a synchronous reverse auction strategy (S-RAS) to maximize the social incomes at first. However, UTs often have to wait for a long time before the auction begins. Then, we adopt an asynchronous reverse auction strategy (A-RAS) to minimize UTs’ waiting time. Ultimately, in order to minimize UTs’ waiting time while maximizing social incomes, we propose the popularity based hybrid reverse auction strategy (PB-H-RAS) considering both the advantages of S-RAS and A-RAS. Simulation and experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed PB-H-RAS strategy; and they also show that the performances of PB-H-RAS strategy are better than the other two strategies in terms of final incomes and completion rate.},

  abstract     = {While the vehicular network enables geographically distributed cooperative computation, its mature implementation has long been constrained due to the lack of an effective management platform. In this paper, employing the security and privacy attributes of blockchain, we propose a novel Blockchain-enabled Large-scale Parked Vehicular Computing (BLPVC) architecture to utilize the potential solar energy and vehicular computational resources in the outdoor parking lot. However, the uneven green power supply and random arrival time of electric vehicles compose the highly complex environment. Accordingly, in this paper, to handle the efficient utilization of the distributed resources by blockchain technology, we propose an integrated optimization framework which leverages the green energy utilization and service latency limit among the processes of block generation, task computing, and communication, whereas such a design leads to the mixed-timescale stochastic optimization problem. To this end, corresponding to the dynamic solar energy arrival, we propose a shaped deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to accelerate the learning rate of computational frequency control in the short-term stage; while in the long-term stage, for the mixed-integer programming (MIP) of task offloading and blockchain parameters adjustment, a series of transformation is employed to preserve convexity. Finally, experiments are carried out on Python demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves a balanced performance between service latency and distributed resources, while the battery depreciation cost is heavily reduced.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) can use wireless access network (RAN) to provide the services required by user&#39;s information technology (IT) and cloud computing functions nearby, which can create a high-performance and low latency service environment. Performing task offloading and data caching at access points (APs) in a cooperative manner can reduce the heavy backhaul load and the retransmission of content downloading. However, in edge networks (ENs), how to maximize storage utilization while reducing service latency and energy consumption is still a key issue, because the heterogeneity of ENs and the uneven distribution of users make it difficult to determine which MEC server and what data should be cached. In this paper, we study a two-tier MEC system, which enables data caching and computing offloading policy to minimize the network cost at the user equipment (UE) side, while satisfying the constraints of task offloading deadline, the cache capacity at APs and the computing capability of MEC servers. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) problem. In order to solve the problem, we transform it into an equivalent task offloading convex optimization problem by fixing an optimization variable. Furthermore, we solve a cache placement problem by dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. Then we propose a distributed collaborative data caching and computing offloading (CDCCO) iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CDCCO algorithm can significantly reduce the network cost and achieve better performance than other existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Cache-enabled small base stations (SBS) are capable of relieving the heavy burden of the backhaul link and reducing the transmission latency. The hit probability depends on the coverage probability and caching placement probabilities. However, the interference in the small-cell networks may significantly degrade the coverage probability. In this paper, for MIMO small-cell networks consisting of SBS and users, where both of them are equipped with multiple antennas, a joint interference alignment (IA) and probabilistic caching (JIA-ProbC) scheme is proposed. Using tools from stochastic geometry, the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -th order Voronoi cells are constructed to form clusters, where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; SBSs cooperatively serve users within each of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -th order Voronoi cells. Then, the IA scheme for MIMO interference channel (IC) is employed to cancel the intra-cluster interference within each &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -th order Voronoi cell. By exploiting the advantage of multiples antennas at users, the IA scheme can simultaneously support more users interference-free than both the zero forcing (ZF) based interference cancellation scheme for MISO systems and SISO systems without interference management, as more interference can be canceled. Furthermore, the coverage probability is analytically approximated by the a closed-form expression. Moreover, the optimal caching placement probability is analytically derived. Numerical Simulation results show that the proposed JIA-ProbC can significantly outperform the existing joint ZF and probabilistic caching (JZF-ProbC) scheme for MISO systems and SISO probabilistic caching (SISO-ProbC) scheme as well as the joint IA and most popular caching (JIA-MPC) caching scheme.},

However, while essential for practical deployments, the problem of securely exchanging cryptographic keys between electronic control units on the CAN bus received little attention so far. In this work, we evaluate group extensions of a regular key exchange protocol, i.e., the elliptic curve version of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, by using both a standardized NIST elliptic curve as well as the faster, more recently proposed Four &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathbb {Q}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; curve. We deploy protocol implementations and determine crisp performance bounds on real-world automotive-grade platforms with Infineon and ARM cores. For an up-to-date analysis, we use both CAN and its more recent extension CAN-FD as communication layers. Roughly, the computational runtime of the key exchange protocol scales logarithmically or linearly with the number of nodes, depending on the protocol version. The computational time proves to be more critical than bandwidth due to the more demanding elliptic curve operations.},

In this paper, leveraging blockchain technology, we first propose a privacy-preserving charging-station-to-vehicle (CS2V) energy trading scheme. The CS2V scheme is useful in crowded cities where there is a need for a charging infrastructure that can charge many EVs daily. We also propose a privacy-preserving vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy trading scheme. The V2V scheme is useful when charging stations are not available or far and cheaper prices can be offered from EVs, e.g., if they charge from renewable energy sources. In the V2V scheme, the privacy of both charging and discharging EVs including location, time, and amount of power are preserved. To preserve privacy in both schemes, EVs are anonymous, however, a malicious EV may abuse the anonymity to launch Sybil attacks by pretending as multiple non-exiting EVs to launch powerful attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting multiple reservations/offers without committing to them, to prevent other EVs from charging and make the trading system unreliable. To thwart the Sybil attacks, we use a common prefix linkable anonymous authentication scheme, so that if an EV submits multiple reservations/offers at the same timeslot, the blockchain can identify such submissions. To further protect the privacy of EV drivers, we introduce an anonymous and efficient blockchain-based payment system that cannot link individual drivers to specific charging locations. Our experimental results indicate that our schemes are secure and privacy-preserving with low communication and computation overheads.},

To tackle this challenge, a distributed learning framework called federated learning has been proposed. Due to the parallel training structure, the performance of federated learning suffers from the straggler effect. In this paper, to mitigate the straggler effect, we propose a novel learning scheme, edge-assisted federated learning (EAFL), which utilizes edge computing to reduce the computational burdens for stragglers in federated learning. It enables stragglers to offload partial computation to the edge server, and leverages the server&#39;s idle computing power to assist clients in model training. The offloading data size is optimized to minimize the learning delay of the system. Based on the optimized data size, a threshold-based offloading strategy for EAFL is proposed. Moreover, we extend EAFL to a dynamic scenario where clients may be offline after several update rounds. By grouping clients into different sets, we formulate the new EAFL delay optimization problem and derive the corresponding offloading strategy for the dynamic scenario. Simulation results are presented to show that EAFL has lower system delay than the original federated learning scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a dynamic load balancing scheme, EdgeSafe, for provisioning Safety-as-a-Service (Safe-aaS) (Roy et al., 2018). Typically, in a Safe-aaS infrastructure, the sensor nodes are either static or mobile in nature. With the variation in the geographical location of the vehicles, the sensor nodes attached to them attain mobility. Consequently, the distance between the mobile sensor node and the edge nodes present within their vicinity changes. As the data is time-critical, it is necessary to be primarily processed at the edge nodes. Considering road transportation as the application scenario of Safe-aaS, we perform load balancing in two stages. In the first stage, we calculate the preferred capacity ratio of the edge nodes present within the communication range of the sensor nodes. We apply Markowitz Portfolio Selection Theory in the second stage to select the appropriate edge node.

We formulate an optimization function to obtain the minimum value of the utility of the edge nodes.

  abstract     = {In the near future, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) transmission will enable wireless broadcast communication among nearby vehicles. Benefits for users include improved driver safety and potentially optimized traffic. However, this communication is vulnerable to cyber attacks involving message manipulation. Research aimed at tackling this problem has resulted in the proposal of multiple authentication protocols. The security, privacy, and other desirable features of authentication in vehicular networks have been widely studied. However, the efficiency of such authentication schemes has not been suitably addressed. There is no model to evaluate the efficiency of the proposals in a practical context, where the delay introduced by V2V authentication may impact on driver safety. In this paper, we provide such a model for evaluation. We explicitly present the key factors involved to evaluate the computational delay in the V2V authentication protocols. Our model has clearly defined metrics for computing the delay and evaluating the impact. Developing this model enables future research in the design of secure and efficient V2V authentication protocols suitable for practical application. Applying the model to assess proposed authentication protocols permits categorization based on safety service they can support. We demonstrate the applicability of our model through case studies. Our model can effectively analyze the delay introduced by an authentication protocol, and determine whether this would result in a crash, in the real world vehicular environments.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent data collection is a key component in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and it plays an important role in seabed environment monitoring, marine resource detection and marine disaster early warning. Owing to the particularities of the underwater environment, such as reduced infrastructure and noisy communication channels, the data collected by underwater nodes are more efficiently transmitted to a control center on the surface by way of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, with the increasing complexity of the underwater tasks, using a single AUV for data collection cannot meet the requirements of low latency and low power consumption. To solve this problem, a multi-AUV collaborative data collection algorithm that reduces the load of data collection task on a single AUV is proposed. The algorithm is divided into two stages: multi-AUV task allocation and Q-learning-based AUV path planning. The data transmission of the clusters is regarded as a set of different tasks, which are assigned to the AUVs for completion. Subsequently, path planning is performed to guide the AUVs, so that the tasks are completed promptly and at a reduced cost. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can leverage the energy consumption of a network and extend its lifetime. The performance of the proposed algorithm in energy consumption is increased by about 10%, and the delay of data collection is also significantly reduced.},

However, the interactions among small cells due to inter-cell interference, the diverse application-specific requirements, as well as the highly dynamic wireless environment make it challenging to design an optimal computation offloading scheme. In this paper, we focus on the joint design of computation offloading and interference coordination for edge intelligence empowered small cell networks. To this end, we propose a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme with the objective of minimizing the overall energy consumption while ensuring the latency requirements. Specifically, we exploit the collaboration among small cell base station (SBS) agents to adaptively adjust their strategies, considering computation offloading, channel allocation, power control, and computation resource allocation. Further, to decrease the computation complexity and signaling overhead of the training process, we design a federated DRL scheme which only requires SBS agents to share their model parameters instead of local training data. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes can significantly reduce the energy consumption and effectively guarantee the latency requirements compared with the benchmark schemes.},

This work sets out to achieve optimal resource provisioning and power allocation within the context of priority slicing where slices are assigned priority levels by the base station. A mixed-integer non-linear programming problem is formulated to maximize the throughput of a best effort slice while satisfying the constraints of the high priority 5G slices. The problem is simplified and relaxed into a convex optimization problem. Three scenarios under various conditions are presented to serve as benchmarks. The impact of the chosen schedulers on the allocations, intra-slice, and inter-slice contentions is also examined. The results highlight that the wireless network can satisfy the quality-of-service requirements of opposing levels of priorities of traffic while simultaneously mitigating both inter-slice and intra-slice contentions under conditions mirroring that of practical wireless network deployments. Furthermore, it is proven that the convex approximation problem serves as a reasonable approximation of the original MINLP problem.},

To achieve blockchain consensus in wireless network, one of the important steps is to broadcast new block using wireless channel. Under wireless network protocols, the block transmitting will be affected significantly. In this work, we focus on the consensus process in blockchain-based wireless local area network (B-WLAN) by investigating the impact of the media access control (MAC) protocol, CSMA/CA. With the randomness of the backoff counter in CSMA/CA, it is possible for latter blocks to catch up or outpace the earlier one, which complicates blockchain forking problem. In view of this, we propose mining strategies to pause mining for reducing the forking probability, and a discard strategy to remove the forking blocks that already exist in CSMA/CA backoff procedure. Based on the proposed strategies, we design Block Access Control (BAC) approaches to effectively schedule block mining and transmitting for improving the performance of B-WLAN. Then, Markov chain models are presented to conduct performance analysis in B-WLAN. The results show that BAC approaches can help the network to achieve a high transaction throughput while improving block utilization and saving computational power. Meanwhile, the trade-off between transaction throughput and block utilization is demonstrated, which can act as a guidance for practical deployment of blockchain.},

  abstract     = {Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) is a novel technology to ensure safe and secure transportation by enabling smart vehicles to communicate and share sensitive information with each other. However, the realization of IoV in real-life depends on several factors, including the assurance of security from attackers and propagation of authentic, accurate and trusted information within the network. Further, the dissemination of compromised information must be detected and vehicle disseminating such malicious messages must be revoked from the network. To this end, trust can be integrated within the network to detect the trustworthiness of the received information. However, most of the trust models in the literature relies on evaluating node or data at the application layer. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid trust management scheme, namely, NOTRINO, which evaluates trustworthiness on the received information in two steps. First step evaluates trust on the node itself at transport layer, while second step computes trustworthiness of the data at application layer. This mechanism enables the vehicles to efficiently model and evaluate the trustworthiness on the received information. The performance and accuracy of NOTRINO is rigorously evaluated under various realistic trust evaluation criteria (including precision, recall, F-measure and trust). Furthermore, the efficiency of NOTRINO is evaluated in presence of malicious nodes and its performance is benchmarked against three hybrid trust models. Extensive simulations indicate that NOTRINO achieve over 75% trust level as compared to benchmarked trust models where trust level falls below 60% for a network with 35% malicious nodes. Similarly, 92% precision and 87% recall are achieved simultaneously with NOTRINO for the same network, comparing to benchmark trust models where precision and recall falls below 87% and 85% respectively.},

  abstract     = {Featuring unprecedentedly high data rates and high connection densities, 3GPP New Radio (NR) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications have been regarded as the most promising remedy to support the next generation driving use cases. For this purpose, although dedicated bands on 5.9 GHz spectrum have been allocated for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the limited bandwidth may not afford the desired service requirements. This engineering concern thus drives the utilization of unlicensed bands on 5 GHz spectrum adjacent to the ITS bands. However, subject to the fairness constraint in sharing unlicensed spectrum, various communication regulations have been imposed, and four different types of multi-band channel access procedures are consequently developed both in 3GPP LTE-A Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) and NR on unlicensed spectrum (NR-U), to lead to a phenomenon that occupying more unlicensed bands may not suggest a proportional growth in the throughput. To empower high-throughout and high-density V2X communications, in this paper, we consequently propose the optimum channel access strategies for each V2X transmitter to decide the optimum number of unlicensed bands to access. To this end, analytic models for four types of multi-band channel access procedures in 3GPP NR-U are provided, which capture both inter-system and intra-system interference from coexisting WiFi transmitters and V2X transmitters. Subsequently, game-theoretically optimum strategies for each type of multi-band channel access procedures are derived. Performance evaluation results fully demonstrate the optimality of the proposed strategies, to serve the urgent demands in supporting the next generation driving use cases on unlicensed spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently emerged as a promising technology for 6 G wireless systems, due to its capability to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate a Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) for IRS-assisted downlink system, where the base station (BS) communicates with single-antenna users with the help of an IRS. RSMA relies on rate-splitting (RS) at the BS and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the users and provides a generalized multiple access framework. We derive a new architecture called IRS-RS that leverages the interplay between RS and IRS. For performance analysis, we utilize an on-off control technique to control the passive beamforming vector of the IRS-RS and derive the closed-form expressions for outage probability of cell-edge users and near users. Moreover, we also analyze the outage behavior of cell-edge users for a sufficiently large number of reflecting elements. Additionally, we also analyze the outage performance of cooperative RS based decode-and-forward (DF)-assisted framework called DF-RS. Through simulation results, it is shown that the proposed framework outperforms the corresponding DF-RS, RS without IRS and IRS-assisted conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. Furthermore, the impact of various system&#39;s parameters such as the number of IRS reflecting elements and the number of users on the system performance is revealed.},

The first type of concatenated LDPC coding scheme globally couples a finite geometry (FG) LDPC code as the local code and a finite field (FF) LDPC code as the global coupling code. This type of global coupling, called GC-FG/FF-LDPC coupling , combines the distinct features of both FG- and FF-LDPC codes to achieve low error rates at a rapid decoding convergence and an error performance close to the Shannon limit. Decoding of a GC-FG/FF-LDPC code is carried out in two iterative phases , global/local or local/global. In the second type of concatenated LDPC coding scheme, both local and global coupling codes are FF-LDPC codes. If both local and global coupling codes are constructed from the same finite field and have the same graphical structures, a GC-FF/FF-LDPC code can be decoded in one phase or two phases iteratively, otherwise, it can be decoded in two phases. Construction of GC-FF/FF-LDPC codes is very flexible in lengths and rates. The proposed two-phase iterative decoding is practically implementable.},

Based on the modified fixed-power allocation (MFPA) strategy, the closed-form expressions of BER are derived for the two-user case with on-off keying, and further extended to the multi-user scenario. The residual probability of EP is introduced and derived to theoretically assess the effectiveness of the proposed ABRSC and SSSIC schemes. Monte Carlo simulation is also conducted to validate the analytical BER results. The BER performance of the NOMA-based VLC system with multiple users is further analyzed and discussed in detail. It is found that under the total average optical transmission power constraint, the allocated average optical transmission power to current user should be higher than that to all rest of users, i.e., the power allocation factor (PAF) is supposed to be greater than 1/2, in order to avoid the error floor issue of current user, hence facilitating the successful implementation of SSSIC. Besides, increasing the bit-rate factor (BRF) could mitigate the effect of EP, and larger BRF leads to more efficient outcomes in alleviating the effect of EP.},

In this paper, the performance of uplink MMSE detection has been analyzed in the context of a multi-cell multiuser MIMO system. An approximate expression for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is proposed, which is in simple form and becomes exact in the low SNR regime. This approximate SINR applies to systems where the base station (BS) has the statistical information of the out-of-cell interfering signals, and systems where the BS ignores the presence of such interfering signals. This approximate SINR is tight for arbitrary user powers, arbitrary number of antennas at the base station, and arbitrary channel correlation matrix associated with any particular user. Approximate expressions for capacity and bit-error rate/symbol-error rate have also been derived. Particularly, it can be proven that, when the MMSE receiver ignores the presence of out-of-cell interfering signals, the performance gap between ZF and MMSE vanishes in the high SNR regime.},

  abstract     = {To accommodate the ever-increasing demands for non-safety critical services in vehicular networks, heterogeneous vehicular networks (HVNs) have been proposed and drawn considerable attention. It is known that the performance of HVNs suffers from a shortage of spectrum resource, and the relatively low utilization of licensed spectrum makes the spectrum shortage even worse. To cope with this, by introducing unlicensed spectrum into HVNs, we investigate the spectrum efficiency (SE)-oriented collaborative transmission. The SE for HVNs depends highly on the channel state information (CSI) of the effective communication links which are normally determined by the vehicle pairing. So, we first propose a joint social-physical domain vehicle pairing algorithm (JSPD-VPA), and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the SE of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications while guaranteeing the quality of services (QoS) requirements of cellular users in licensed spectrum and users in unlicensed spectrum. Considering that the formulated problem is NP-Hard problem, to solve it, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., spectrum assignment subproblem and power control subproblem. An optimal hypergraph coloring algorithm is proposed to solve the spectrum assignment subproblem, and a low-complexity three-dimensional geometry approach is developed to solve the power control subproblem. Simulation results reveal that the proposed vehicle pairing, spectrum assignment and power control algorithm (VP-SA-PCA) can greatly enhance the SE and outperforms the baselines around 7%-37% within a certain range. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed JSPD-VPA has been validated.},

For the D2D link under consideration, we first formulate the mode selection problem—whereby D2D pair could either communicate directly, or, through the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$BS_{_{mC}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , or, through the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$BS_{_{MC}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; —as a ternary hypothesis testing problem. Next, to compute the effective capacity (EC) for the given D2D link, we assume that the channel state information (CSI) is not available at the transmit D2D node, and hence, it transmits at a fixed rate &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$r$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; with a fixed power. This allows us to model the D2D link as a Markov system with six-states. We consider both overlay and underlay modes for the D2D link. Moreover, to improve the throughput of the D2D link, we assume that the D2D pair utilizes two special automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes, i.e., Hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) and truncated HARQ. Furthermore, we consider two distinct queue models at the transmit D2D node, based upon how it responds to the decoding failure at the receive D2D node. Eventually, we provide closed-form expressions for the EC for both HARQ-enabled D2D link and truncated HARQ-enabled D2D link, under both queue models. Noting that the EC looks like a quasi-concave function of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$r$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , we further maximize the EC by searching for an optimal rate via the gradient-descent method. Simulation results provide us the following insights: i) EC decreases with an increase in the QoS exponent, ii) EC of the D2D link improves when HARQ is employed, iii) EC increases with an increase in the quality of self-interference cancellation techniques used at &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$BS_{_{mC}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$BS_{_{MC}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in FD mode.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the channel access problem of vehicles in a cognitive radio vehicular network, where each vehicle opportunistically accesses the channel resources of the primary network in order to successfully receive the necessary data packets within a time deadline. Given the access priority constraint and the limited bandwidth of the primary network, a smart channel connection scheme is indispensable to ensure a decent quality of service (QoS) at the vehicles’ side. Due to the competitive nature of vehicles, the vehicle access control is formulated as a multi-agent access problem that comes with an intrinsic challenge, i.e. the partial observation of the information about the environment dynamics. On top of that, considering the temporal usage profile of the primary network, the environment dynamics are also time-dependant, and hence making the aforementioned access control a non-Markovian problem. Consequently, the estimation of the system states, which are used for the decision making process of a vehicle, is very challenging. To deal with the issues arising from such non-Markovian problem, we propose a vehicle connection algorithm based on a deep recurrent Q-learning network. With the aid of a recurrent Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer integrated into a deep Q-network, the time-correlated system states can be properly estimated, thereby improving the vehicle channel access policy. Besides, we introduce novel reward quantities that help improving the network performance and the capability to flexibly adapt to unexplored scenarios. A new structure of the cumulative reward function is also presented to balance the performance trade off between the cooperative and competitive objectives. Simulation results are provided to verify the advantage and the stability of our proposed algorithm over the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Satellite communication is considered as an efficient way to achieve the reliable communication for worldwide users. To further enhance the achievable rate of the satellite system, we propose joint beamforming schemes of an integrated satellite-terrestrial self-backhauled (ISTS) system, in which the satellite backhaul and terrestrial access links are operating at the same millimeter wave band. Specifically, the earth station and the base station (BS) constitute a self-backhauled relay to forward the satellite signals to the terrestrial users. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated under the constraints of the maximum power requirements of the satellite and the BS, the minimum quality-of-service requirements of the terrestrial users, and the maximum satellite backhaul capacity. To obtain some insights, we first assume that the perfect channel state information (CSI) on the satellite and terrestrial links is known and transform the formulated optimization problem to a standard difference of convex problem. Then we solve it iteratively by adopting the convex-concave procedure approach. Furthermore, when only imperfect CSI on the satellite and terrestrial links is available, we employ a iterative penalty function algorithm associated with the sequential convex approximation method and the S-procedure approach to obtain suboptimal beamforming vectors. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint beamforming schemes have better performance compared with other benchmark schemes and the ISTS architecture is suitable for the satellite systems in various orbits.},

The proposed scheme aims at maximizing the long-term utility function, which is determined by the achieved average data rate and fairness among sources. The formulated long-term time-average optimization problem is converted into instantaneous ones by exploiting the Lyapunov optimization framework. The derived analytical solutions reveal the impact of data buffers’ length on the decoding order of sources’ messages.

Considering a fly-hover-communicate transmission scheme, the most energy-efficient 3-D hovering points (HPs) of the AAP are determined by decoupling the problem in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. First, we derive analytically the optimal hovering altitude that jointly maximizes the downlink and uplink global energy efficiency (GEE) of the system. Next, we propose the multilevel circle packing (MCP) algorithm to determine the minimal number of HPs and their associated horizontal coordinates, such that the AAP covers all the UEs in the given geographical area. A cost analysis is carried out to observe the variation of both fixed and variable costs; these are then minimized by suitably selecting the AAP&#39;s battery parameters, like the depth of discharge (DOD), defined as the portion of battery capacity that is consumed during a discharge cycle, and the velocity of the UAV. Simulation results show that: the UAV energy consumption has a significant impact on the 3-D HPs of the AAP; the time spent during the substitution swap of an out of power AAP has a major influence on the operational cost; the cost of the system can be optimized by suitably selecting the onboard battery and the UAV flight parameters.},

  abstract     = {In underwater acoustic (UWA) adaptive communication system, due to time-varying channel, the transmitter often has outdated channel state information (CSI), which results in low efficiency. UWA channels are much more difficult to estimate and predict than terrestrial wireless channels, given the more severe multipath environments with varying propagation speeds in different locations, non-linear propagation paths, several-order higher propagation latency, mobile transceiver and obstacles in the sea, etc. To handle the complexity, this paper proposes an efficient online CSI prediction model for UWA CSI prediction considering the complicated correlationship of UWA channels in both the time and frequency domains. This paper designs a learning model called CsiPreNet, which is an integration of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short term memory (LSTM) network. The performance is compared with the widely used recursive least squares (RLS) predictor, the approximate linear dependency recursive kernel least-squares (ALD-KRLS), and two common conventional deep neural networks (DNN) predictors, i.e., back propagation neural network (BPNN) and LSTM network using the measured data recorded in the South China Sea. To validate the efficacy of prediction, we investigate the prediction of CSI in simulated downlink UWA orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. Specifically, the measured UWA channel is used in the OFDMA system. A joint subcarrier-bit-power adaptive allocation scheme is used for resource allocation. To further improve the performance, we develop an offline-online prediction scheme, enabling the prediction results to be more stable. Simulation and experimental results show that the CsiPreNet has superior performance than the existing solutions, thanks to its capability in capturing both the temporal and frequency correlation of the UWA CSIs.},

However, the computational complexity of the conventional message passing algorithm (MPA) for the multiuser SCMA detection increases exponentially with the degree of resource nodes (RNs). To address this issue, two low complexity MPA schemes are proposed by utilizing the sparse feature of codewords. First, a sorted MPA (SMPA) detector is introduced to reduce the message exchanging from RNs to variable nodes (VNs) by dropping the redundant superposed constellation points outside a belief interval. Next, in order to further speed up the sorting process of the Euclidean distances between the received signal and codeword combinations, a deep neural network aided MPA (DNNMPA) is proposed, in which, the DNN behaves as a function approximator to generate the belief interval and operates in parallel with the initialization procedure before iterative message passing. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed SMPA and DNNMPA detectors significantly reduce the computational complexity of the conventional MPA one, but with comparable decoding capabilities, for the uplink SCMA system.},

  abstract     = {Complex building structures constrain indoor wireless communications. The significant dependence between the indoor wireless network performance and the building structures can be considered as an intrinsic property of a building, which means that the building has to be designed to achieve desirable indoor wireless network performance. The power gain (PG) and the interference gain (IG) have been defined as the figures of merit (FoMs) to evaluate the wireless performance of a building. Employing open space as the benchmark, the PG and the IG respectively quantify the effective change of the intended signal power and the undesired power, i.e., the interference and thermal noise power, received in a targeted user equipment (UE) location due to the presence of the building. In this paper, a tractable approach is proposed to obtain the PG and the IG with a partition-based path gain model. It enables the PG and the IG to capture the impact of both building materials and the building layout on indoor wireless network performance. Numerical results show that the analytical models in closed-form expressions facilitate the wireless performance assessment to a given building computational-efficiently. This work is a critical complement to the initial framework of the building wireless performance (BWP) evaluation. The proposed method can be employed in future wireless-friendly building design.},

The proposed algorithm exploits pairs of quantized received signals and detected symbols as training examples to train the likelihood function (LF) of the system. A major challenge in optimizing the RLD algorithm is to determine the optimal policy that decides whether to exploit the training examples based on their reliabilities. Determining the optimal policy inherently involves huge complexities in reflecting all possible transitions among candidate symbols. Thus, we simplify the optimal policy by considering only the most probable candidates among all possible decisions to reduce this complexity. Another major challenge in applying the RLD algorithm is that it requires high computational complexity to produce soft information for detection. Thus, we define new branch and path metrics derived from the LF and then remove the candidate symbols whose path metrics are smaller than a pre-defined value to alleviate the complexity. Moreover, we analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithm by deriving the expected number of surviving candidates. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides a better performance-complexity tradeoff than the conventional RLD algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) is promising to fundamentally transform a broad spectrum of industry sectors and the way humans interact with virtual content. However, despite unprecedented progress, current networking and computing infrastructures are incompetent to unlock VR&#39;s full potential. In this paper, we consider delivering the wireless multi-tile VR video service over a mobile edge computing (MEC) network. The primary goal is to minimize the system latency/energy consumption and to arrive at a tradeoff thereof. To this end, we first cast the time-varying view popularity as a model-free Markov chain to effectively capture its dynamic characteristics. After jointly assessing the caching and computing capacities on both the MEC server and the VR playback device, a hybrid policy is then implemented to coordinate the dynamic caching replacement and the deterministic offloading, so as to fully utilize the system resources. The underlying multi-objective problem is reformulated as a partially observable Markov decision process, and a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to iteratively learn its solution, where a long short-term memory neural network is embedded to continuously predict the dynamics of the unobservable popularity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in achieving a trade-off between the energy efficiency and the latency reduction over the baseline methods.},

This paper addresses the user-centric clustering, beamforming, and artificial noise design to combat with the EJA, and an accelerated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach has been proposed for the downlink of UUDNs from a security, reliability and energy efficiency (SREE) perspective. In contrast to the existing approaches, the proposed approach divides the UE&#39;s communication behavior into association phase and transmission phase to perform a fast and adaptive response to the EJA. For the association phase, the proposed approach aims at achieving a fast response to EJA by optimization algorithms from a short-term perspective. For the transmission phase, we propose a DRL based algorithm to achieve optimal adaptive response by dealing with the dynamic and persistent effects of EJA from a long-term perspective. To accelerate the training process, fast response achieved in the association phase will be regarded as the initial experience to update the parameters of the deep neural networks adopted by the DRL based algorithm for transmission phase. Comparing with the existing methods, simulation results show that our proposed accelerated DRL approach achieves better performance in terms of SREE and convergence speed.},

In this paper, we develop two algorithms to deal with these difficulties. First, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation algorithm to improve the performance of both V2I and V2V links. Specifically, the algorithm uses deep Q-network (DQN) to solve the sub-band assignment and deep deterministic policy-gradient (DDPG) to solve the continuous power allocation problem. Second, we propose a meta-based DRL algorithm to enhance the fast adaptability of the resource allocation policy in the dynamic environment. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based algorithm can significantly improve the performance compared to the DQN-based algorithm that quantizes continuous power. In addition, the proposed meta-based DRL algorithm can achieve the required fast adaptation in the new environment with limited experiences.},

Traditional methods based on chaos theory perform well on single non-variable-frequency signal detection (SNVFSD), which is a common situation in texture flaw detection while it is a rare scenario in the communication field. In this paper, we give a comprehensive analysis of the chaos-based approach for weak signal frequency detection. To better understand the advantages and limitations of the chaos theory, we present the research results for several typical communication scenarios. Specifically, we proposed several chaos-based approaches to get a satisfying performance in the following situations: single variable-frequency signal detection (SVFSD), multiple non-variable-frequency signals detection (MNVFSD), multiple variable-frequency signals detection (MVFSD). To enhance the generalization performance to real application, the critical state&#39;s characteristics, Lyapunov Exponents (LE) and Melnikov method are analyzed to employed in these proposed chaos-based approaches. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we study the performance of chaos-based detection systems in terms of SVFSD, MNVFSD, MVFSD.

The Gaussian RF impairment model (GRFIM) and additive quantization noise model (AQNM) are used to evaluate the impacts of the RF impairments and low resolution ADCs/DACs, respectively. The analytical results of the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation show that there is nonzero floor on the estimation error with respect to the RF impairments, ADC/DAC precision and the pilot power of the eavesdropper which is different from the conventional case with perfect transceiver. Then, a tractable closed-form expression for the ergodic secrecy rate is obtained with respect to key system parameters, such as the antenna number per AP, the AP number, user number, quality factors of the ADC/DAC and the RF chain, pilot signal power of the eavesdropper, etc. Moreover, a compensation algorithm between the imperfect RF components and the inexpensive coarse ADCs/DACs is also presented. Finally, numerical results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the achieved expressions and the devised algorithm, and show the effects of RF impairments and low resolution ADC/DAC on the secrecy performance.},

The results show that the optimal UAV&#39;s position that achieves a minimum outage probability highly depends on the optical beamwidth at the destination. Moreover, to achieve a minimum outage probability, the relay-to-destination link length must be shorter than source-to-destination (SR) link and by deceasing beamwidth at the destination, the optimal value for SR link length increases.},

However, inter-vehicle line-of-sight (LOS) blockages may significantly deteriorate the link quality and lead to data packet loss. Addationally, it is difficult to coordinate directional transmissions to broadcast massive sensor data to nearby vehicles timely for enhanced environmental awareness. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a blockage avoidance based multi-hop sensor data dissemination (BAMD) scheme in a centralized manner. First, we propose a mmWave LOS link availability identification method based on the geometric relation among vehicles. Second, the problem of sensor data dissemination among all vehicles is formulated aiming at minimizing the overall transmission delay. To find an approximate solution, a novel transmission utility function based multi-hop data dissemination algorithm is designed jointly considering the distance between vehicles, packet queue, the number of LOS neighbors and concurrent transmissions. By theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is indicated that the proposed scheme can achieve a reliable and fast sensor data dissemination.

In particular, the nonlinearity of power amplifiers may severely degrade the performance of MIMO systems by distorting the precoded signals. In this work, we study the performance and precoding strategy of downlink multiuser MIMO systems with nonlinear power amplifiers. First, we analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of nonlinear systems to establish the relationship between the transmit power and SINR. We find that the condition for maximizing the SINR depends on the average channel gain. Specifically, the maximum SINR is determined by the uncorrelated distortion when the average channel gain is large and by the distortion of precoding vector when the average channel gain is small. Motivated by the analysis, we propose an iterative algorithm, which alternately updates the precoding and power allocation by resolving the complicated coupling factors in the SINR expressions of nonlinear system. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm implicitly controls the total transmit power so that the desired signal, interference, and distortion are properly balanced. By the simulation results, we verify the analysis results and show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional schemes and achieves a near-optimal sum rate.},

Considering the limitation of on-board beamforming, a hybrid analog-digital beamforming scheme is designed under the scenario of millimeter wave (mmWave) coexisting in the ITSN framework. Besides, in order to further mitigate intra-beam and inter-beam interference, we propose an adaptive user scheduling scheme, which first determines the cluster center based on adaptive threshold, and then selects users with less channel correlation into a scheduling cluster. Moreover, we model system sum rate maximization problem that incorporates maximum power constrains and minimum data rate requirements. Combined with the aforementioned hybrid beamforming and user scheduling strategy, we formulate the sum rate maximizing problem to a pure power allocation issue. In view of the non-convexity and high complexity, we propose a feasible optimization method based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion and logarithmic linearization to optimize the power allocation for each user terminal (UT).

  abstract     = {As one of the three main application scenarios of 5 G cellular system, massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) has been regarded as the key solution to facilitate the IoT paradigm. One major bottleneck for accommodating mMTC is the severe congestion at the cellular random access channel when plenty of Machine-Type Devices (MTDs) send access requests concurrently while the preamble resources are limited. To remedy this issue, limiting the number of retransmissions and dropping access requests after the limit is reached can be an effective approach. Yet, the effect of the preamble retransmission limit &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; on the optimal access performance of mMTC in cellular networks remains largely unexploited, which motivates the study in this paper. Specifically, in this paper, we start by characterizing the network steady-state points based on the limiting probability of successful transmission of access requests. We then obtain explicit expressions of the access throughput and the mean access delay of successfully-transmitted access requests as functions of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and the number of preambles &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . The maximum access throughput and the corresponding optimal backoff window size are further derived. It is shown that the maximum access throughput is independent of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , while the mean access delay can be significantly reduced with a small &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , yet, at the expense of increased request dropping ratio. In addition, to improve both the throughput and delay performance, the analysis shows that more preambles should be allocated but the performance gain becomes marginal when &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is large. Therewith, an algorithm is proposed for determining the least number of preambles &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M^\ast$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; that maximizes the access throughput and the preamble resource utilization ratio. Numerical results show that a smaller preamble retransmission limit &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; can further reduce &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M^\ast$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

  abstract     = {A synthetic aperture navigation (SAN) system that exploits downlink cellular long-term evolution (LTE) signals and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is developed. The system is suitable for multipath-rich environments, such as indoors and deep urban canyons. The proposed SAN system mitigates multipath via a spatial discriminator, which utilizes the motion of a single antenna element to synthesize a geometrically separated antenna array from time-separated snapshots, alleviating the need for a physical antenna array. Signals from the synthesized antenna array are used to beamform towards the line-of-sight (LOS) LTE direction, while suppressing multipath components. Different stages of the beamforming process are discussed, and the computational complexity of the proposed system is analyzed. To deal with the unknown clock biases of the LTE eNodeBs, two navigation frameworks are developed: (1) base/rover and (2) standalone rover. The proposed SAN system is validated experimentally, and the navigation solutions achieved from the following systems are compared: (i) IMU only, (ii) LTE only, (iii) feedforward LTE-SAN, (iv) feedback LTE-SAN, (v) LTE-IMU, and (vi) feedback LTE-SAN-IMU. In the performed experiment, a pedestrian-mounted receiver navigated indoors for 109 m in 50 seconds, while receiving LTE signals from 5 LTE eNodeBs. The proposed LTE-SAN-IMU system exhibited a two-dimensional position root mean-squared error (RMSE) of 1.44 m with a standard deviation of 1.85 m.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate power control algorithm can increase total network rate and reduce energy consumption through optimizing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) received by users. Thus it is vital for heterogeneous cellular networks, which are composed of macro base stations (BSs) and micro BSs. However, most existing power control schemes neglect the dynamic traffic variation and backhaul bandwidth constraint due to the variability of wireless traffic and difficulty of problem solving. This results in the performance reduction and resource waste under the highly dynamic traffic. In view of this, we propose an intelligent power control algorithm based on accurate traffic prediction. First, hybrid prediction scheme, composed of long short term memory (LSTM) and historical average value (HAV), is used to predict the traffic demand of each BS. Based on the predicted results, we propose a power control scheme. It achieves a weighted tradeoff between the total network rate and energy consumption under the consideration of backhaul constraint. By using the properties of concave function and the function structure of backhaul constraint, the Marks-Wright algorithm and difference of two convex functions (DC) programming are respectively employed to solve the non-convex optimization model approximately and accurately. Simulation results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of proposed scheme is 3.73% and 6.03% higher than that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, respectively. Compared with full power transmission, energy consumption of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 58.29%, while total network rate is increased by 3.26%.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has opened a novel perspective on spectrum awareness and localization because of their ability to overcome spatial limits and the burden of dedicated infrastructure. In such scenarios, an underinvestigated problem is the simultaneous localization of multiple non-collaborative primary users (PUs) of the spectrum, whose number, transmit power, activity pattern, and signal structure are unknown. This work proposes a framework for multiple PU localization based on the received power measured by an antenna array mounted on a UAV. A score map is firstly constructed based on the measured power. Then two algorithms, k-means clustering and weighted centroid (KCWC), and Gaussian mixture model fitting (GMMF) are applied to the score map to estimate the number and the positions of the PUs. The performance is evaluated in terms of optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) distance, compared with a genie-aided (GA) localization algorithm capable of separating the signals emitted by the PUs. Despite the blind nature of the method proposed, numerical results exhibit very good localization accuracy, with an OSPA distance below &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$6\,$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; m in large, line-of-sight (LOS)-dominated, outdoor scenarios with five PUs, even in the presence of channel impairments and UAV position and heading uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, multidimensional constellation designs of spatial modulated sparse code multiple access (SM-SCMA) systems with arbitrary number of transmit antennas are investigated to improve the system performance. Firstly, the symbol error rate (SER) performance of single-user and multi-user systems under flat independent Rayleigh fading channels is analyzed. It is shown that except for the product distance of the sub-constellation of each antenna, the product of the norm of symbols on each-dimension can affect single-user performance. Then, based on the performance analysis, a symmetric multidimensional constellation (SMC) and a golden-angle-modulation-based constellation (GAMC) are proposed for the general case where the number of transmit antennas is an arbitrary integer, and a low-complexity SMC (LSMC) is proposed for the special case where the number of transmit antennas is a power of two. Finally, the three proposed design schemes are extended to transmit correlated scenarios. Simulation results show that for uplink systems, compared with existing schemes, SMC provides the best SER performance and has no limitation on the number of transmit antennas. When the transmitter has no spatial correlation and the number of transmit antennas is a power of two, LSMC can achieve comparable performance to SMC with reduced computational complexity. For downlink systems, GAMC can obtain a considerable performance gain (up to 3 dB) over other solutions under transmit correlated channels.},

In this paper, we propose a jamming-aided secure transmission scheme for cooperative NOMA networks with a full-duplex (FD) relay. In this scheme, two pairs of users perform secure transmission with the help of a decode-forward (DF) relay, which forwards information and generates artificial jamming to counteract eavesdropping. The precoding vectors are designed to zero-force the artificial jamming at legal receivers. Then, the channel statistics are calculated, based on which the secrecy rates of legitimate signals are analyzed and the expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived. Furthermore, three benchmark schemes are also presented with their performance analyzed to verify the advantage of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show the accuracy of our analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the SOP and improve the effective secrecy throughput via artificial jamming and FD relaying.},

First, considering driver aggressiveness, a linear moving horizon estimator for the vehicle longitudinal speed is designed based on the car following model. Then, the estimated vehicle longitudinal speed is delivered to the lateral estimator module in real-time. For the arbitrary driving routes, the Serret-Frenet equations and nonlinear lateral dynamics are combined to describe the lateral motion of preceding vehicle. Furthermore, a nonlinear moving horizon estimator is constructed to estimate vehicle lateral states accurately. To reduce the computational burden, the multiple shooting (MS) method is introduced, then the objective function is divided into several segments to improve the strong nonlinearity produced by multiple iterations. The proposed estimation algorithm can effectively handle the initial biases, the additive biases and model error, which are common in the acquired signals, and provide an accurate estimate of preceding vehicle states.},

The relationship between the blur pattern and vehicle velocity is determined using camera dynamics. The 2D velocity of the vehicle body is estimated by analyzing the motion blur pattern. The vehicle roll and pitch angle with respect to the ground are calculated by comparing the estimated average depths (heights) of the sections of a scene. We propose a signal processing and control system to precisely modulate the OIM, which is an electro-mechanical system consisting of a coil, magnet, spring and damper. In addition, we validate the influence of the control reference waveform through various experiments and confirm the robustness of the proposed system.

  abstract     = {Reliable trajectory prediction of preceding target vehicles (PTVs) is crucial for the planning and decision making of automated vehicles. However, the future trajectory is affected by the driver&#39;s intention and diverse driving styles, which can hardly be predicted precisely, especially when the vehicle performs a lane change maneuver. In this study, we propose a lane crossing and final points generation (CFPG) model-based trajectory prediction approach for PTVs, in which the key influence factors such as the driver&#39;s intention and the mixed driving style are included. Firstly, we build a maneuver and stage recognition model upon the long short term memory (LSTM) to infer the current maneuver of the preceding target vehicle. Furthermore, the approach predicts the lane crossing point using a physics-based model combining with a deep conditional generative model trained by a deep neural network. Moreover, a maneuver-based model is adopted to predict the final point according to the prediction interval. In order to avoid the possible cumulative error caused by iteratively generating trajectories in traditional methods, we use a curve fitting method to obtain the predicted trajectory. Lane changing data collected from naturalistic driving scenarios are used to verify the proposed approach, and the results suggest more accurate and reliable prediction trajectories compared with conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a latent space reinforcement learning method for interpretable decision-making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. This method is based on the latent model and the combination model of the hidden Markov model and Gaussian mixture regression (HMM-GMR). It is difficult for the traditional decision-making method to understand the environment because its input is high-dimensional and lacks an understanding of the task. By utilizing the HMM-GMR model, we can obtain the interpretable state providing semantic information and environment understanding. A framework is proposed to unify representation learning with the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, in which the latent model is used to reduce the dimension of interpretable state by extracting underlying task-relevant information. Experimental results are presented and the results show the right balance between driving safety and efficiency in the challenging scenarios of highway on-ramps merging.},

In order to propose an effective shift control strategies, a dynamic model of shifting process is established based on the analysis of PCVT&#39;s working principle and speed regulation characteristics. According to the shifting mechanism of PCVT, the shifting process is divided into four stages, and the dynamic equation is established in stages. Based on the PCVT shift control requirements, the clutch and engine controller are designed in stages. For the torque phase, a finite time linear quadratic regulator is used to determine the optimal clutch engagement and disengagement speed, with the jerk and friction work as optimization indices. For the inertia phase, the fuzzy compensation controllers of the clutch and the engine are designed respectively under the comprehensive consideration of the factors such as the speed ratio of torque converter and the system efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed shift control strategy can achieve smooth shift and meet the control requirements well.},

  abstract     = {Many autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems are equipped with front-facing cameras that detect and track objects using deep-learning-based algorithms. However, the localization capability of monocular cameras is often overlooked. In this paper, a novel method for estimating the pixel-wise error in a detected object&#39;s location versus its ground truth is proposed. As the object moves away from the camera, the pixel errors are shown to be normally distributed with unique spreads along the image&#39;s vertical axis (y-pixel). The pixel error appears to be smaller as objects get farther away, while at the same distance range, objects have similar error distribution across the camera&#39;s horizontal view. The horizontal axis (x-pixel) error appears to be smaller while the distance moves further away. However, the x-pixel location along a constant y-pixel row has no impact on the error distribution. The estimated x and y-pixel error distributions can in turn be used to form a spatial error distribution for finding the location of a detected object within a certain confidence interval. The spatial errors are then projected onto the world coordinate system using a camera transformation matrix to give a more realistic sense of what this error means. The results show that location estimation using monocular cameras generates an elliptical error distribution around the object with a larger error in the y-pixel direction compared to the x-pixel direction. This error distribution can be important to fuse information from multiple range-detecting sensors as well as multi-vehicle and multi-object tracking. The uncertainty characterization for position measurement, as demonstrated in this paper is an essential element of tracking and, is sensor and algorithm dependent.},

Unlike brake-based vehicle stability control systems, electronic limited slip differentials have the potential to control a vehicle&#39;s yaw stability without slowing down its speed. In this study, first, an ELSD model is designed to properly predict ELSD torque distribution. The model&#39;s accuracy is evaluated using experimental test data. Then, an intelligent ELSD control design is proposed using the developed ELSD model, capable of working in both off-throttle and on-throttle scenarios. The proposed design, which is based on a model predictive control approach, offers control of the ELSD differential by directly controlling the ELSD clutch pressure. This control design enables the controller to prevent unwanted oversteering yaw moments and avoid chattering in the ELSD clutch. The controller is implemented in a Cadillac CTS vehicle to evaluate its performance experimentally in various driving maneuvers.},

Control of the clamping force has significant impact on the brake performance. In this paper, an EMB clamping force control system is developed that addresses several major challenges in the practical implementation. Firstly, a nonlinear EMB model including the DC motor, planetary gear set, ball screw, and clamping force model is built. In particular, a novel clamping force model is introduced based on a linear transform of two polynomial functions. For the control system design, a clamping force estimation algorithm is proposed that requires only the existing measurements of motor torque, angular speed, and position. The contact point of the brake pad and the disk is also estimated using an internal model controller and a Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother. The tracking controller is based on the disturbance observer structure, with a PI feedback controller and a zero-phase error tracking feedforward controller. Furthermore, a unified architecture is proposed such that a smooth transition between gap closing and clamping force tracking is realized. Finally, the performance of the entire control system under various conditions is evaluated based on simulation.},

Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve privacy leakage problems, but it is exposed to security threats such as model inversion, membership inference. Therefore, the vulnerability of the FL should be brought to the forefront when applying to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$AV$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; s.

These signals have different noise variance, bandwidth and sampling rate (being the latter, possibly, irregular). In this paper we present a non-linear sensor fusion algorithm allowing asynchronous sampling and non-causal smoothing. It is applied to achieve accuracy improvements when incorporating odometry measurements from CAN bus to standard GPS+IMU kinematic estimation, as well as the robustness against missing data. Our results show that this asynchronous multi-sensor (GPS+IMU+CAN-based odometry) fusion is advantageous in low-speed manoeuvres, improving accuracy and robustness to missing data, thanks to non-causal filtering. The proposed algorithm is based on Extended Kalman Filter and Smoother, with exponential discretization of continuous-time stochastic differential equations, in order to process measurements at arbitrary time instants; it can provide data to subsequent processing steps at arbitrary time instants, not necessarily coincident with the original measurement ones. Given the extra information available in the smoothing case, its estimation performance is less sensitive to the noise-variance parameter setting, compared to causal filtering. Working Matlab code is provided at the end of this work.},

  abstract     = {Safety-critical systems in various industries such as transportation or nuclear energy have been paid more attention with the development of societies due to increased attachment of importance to the life of human, their property, and nature. While developing such systems, detailed availability and safety characteristics are to be taken into account in parallel with architectural design decisions such as synchronization between different computing units or real-time task management. For fulfilling top-level requirements in international standards, ambitious quantitative targets like 0.012 FIT for HW units are to be reached where the industry has difficulties to achieve it. In this paper, this problem is handled by proposing an augmented Markov model for diverse architectures that is superior to the formulas provided in the main safety standard IEC 61508 and previous studies. With the proposed method it is possible to cover all safety-relevant states, which leads to more accuracy and lower hazard rates helping to reach these ambitious quantitative targets. Besides, the reliability parameters are investigated and optimized to increase safety performance. Consequently, the proposed novel model including enhanced reliability parameters is used for an industry application, namely safety-critical computer used for unmanned metro and high-speed rail transportation. The result obtained by the proposed model is compared with the results obtained using state of art models in literature and using the formulas in IEC 61508. As domain independent references IEC 61508 and Markovian approach are used in the paper, this study is applicable to other safety critical areas such as automotive or avionic industry.},

In this paper, the capacity configuration of SCESSs, the no-load voltage of substation, the control of onboard braking resistors and train operation diagrams are considered comprehensively. Based on the equivalent circuit model, the effects of traction power system parameters on the energy transmission between powering trains, braking trains and SCESSs are analyzed, and the relationships between the train operating parameters and system energy consumptions are revealed. A multi-variable synthetic optimization method is proposed to optimize the SCESS capacity, train operation diagrams and traction power system parameters collaboratively. In order to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of the optimization algorithm, a hierarchical multi-objective optimization model is established, based on which the design variables and the control variables are optimized iteratively. And as the traffic density has a great impact on the regenerative braking energy distribution of the system, the optimization objective function fully considers the frequency distribution of headways throughout the day. Combined the Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) with the traction power flow simulator, the flowchart of the two-stage optimization algorithm is designed, and the pareto set of the multi-objective problem is obtained. The advantages of reducing system energy consumptions and configuration cost under the proposed algorithm are verified based on case studies of Beijing Batong Line.},

  abstract     = {Road garbage recognition and cleanliness assessment are very important for intelligent cleaning of vehicles. However, widely used garbage detection methods cannot provide accurate information to assess cleanliness. Also, only a few contributions are available in the road cleanliness assessment, and they too mainly depend on the category and quantity of garbage. In this paper, deep supervision UNet++ (DUNet++) is proposed to solve the problem of road garbage classification and segmentation, which can directly impact the output of the category of garbage and the occupied ground area. A new, simple and accurate method is established to assess road cleanliness by combining the results of garbage segmentation. Compared with the cleanliness index (CI), the road cleanliness index based on semantic segmentation (CISS) not only considers the road area occupied by different types or categories of the garbage but also considers the difficulty of cleaning them. A road garbage segmentation dataset, which consists of four categories (stones, leaves, sand, and bottles), is collected to train the designed garbage segmentation model, and it has achieved considerable garbage segmentation improvement with an MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union) of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$76.73\pm 0.11$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . Especially when compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the model we designed has greatly improved the accuracy of garbage segmentation. Experimental results have shown that our road garbage segmentation and cleanliness assessment methods are relatively simple, and can provide accurate road cleanliness information for cleaning vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Despite the advances related to car-following and lane-changing behaviors, the influence of lane-changing on the car-following models, which results in a complex transient merging behavior, has not comprehensively been investigated. This paper presents a novel fuzzy controller based on a human factor to optimize the Follower Vehicle (FV) behavior subject to safety, comfort, and convenient traveled time in the complex behavior where the Lane Changer (LC) vehicle exits the temporary lane. The factor enables the controller to mimic the current driver behavior in terms of maximum pleasantness of drive. Accordingly, the data of real-life experiments were used to design the human-like fuzzy controller, to build a predictive model to suggest the appropriate acceleration, velocity, and travel distance. At best, the correlation coefficient of 0.93 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.71 were achieved for modeling using the adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) utilizing Gaussian function as a membership function. Furthermore, to evaluate the robustness of the controller to uncertainties and unknown disturbances for real-time driving experiments, a test-bed was fabricated to mount the feedback sensors, including vision, accelerometer, and distance measurement sensors. The results of running the controller in various driving scenarios showed 70% and 38% improvements in safety and ride comfort, respectively. The proposed intelligent controller is intended to be used for vehicle route guidance and on urban highways.},

Considering the inertial lag of the servo motor/braking unit in practical scenarios, a third-order nonlinear model is adopted to capture the dynamics of a train, based on which the coordinated control problem is formulated. By virtue of the back-stepping linearization technique, the sampled-data communication based train coordination is transformed to the stabilization of a linear multiple-input system subject to periodic time-varying input delay. An event-triggering communication framework is constructed to lower the dependence on the communication resource. Furthermore, distributed low-gain feedback control protocols are established that, besides achieving coordination of the train operation, ensure the trains track the predefined train speed profile while avoiding unnecessary information transmission. Numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical results.},

Firstly, three operating modes are proposed to describe the procedure of VC departure. Then it is shown that the trains can obtain reference information by the distributed observers under a jointly connected communication topology and reach the coupled state by the proposed fixed-time tracking controllers. The boundary of coupling time, which depends on controller parameters and waiting time, is also given. Finally, the control method&#39;s effectiveness is verified in three typical scenarios.},

Heuristic algorithms have been widely used to plan a path for AUV, but most traditional heuristic algorithms are facing two problems, one is slow convergence speed, the other is premature convergence. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new heuristic algorithms fusion, which improves the genetic algorithm with the ant colony optimization algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm. In addition, to accelerate convergence and expand the search space of the algorithm, some algorithms like trying to cross, path self-smoothing and probability of genetic operation adjust adaptively are proposed. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are reflected through simulated comparative experiments.

However, a malicious vehicle may send false sensor information to the other vehicles intentionally or unintentionally, which may cause traffic inconvenience or loss of human lives. Here, we take the advantage of vehicular cloud and increase the resilience of CAVs to malicious vehicles by assuming each vehicle shares its local sensor information with other vehicles to create information redundancy on the cloud side. We exploit this redundancy and propose a sensor fusion algorithm for the vehicular cloud, capable of providing robust state estimation of all vehicles under the condition that the number of malicious information is sufficiently small. Using the proposed estimator, we provide an algorithm for isolating malicious vehicles. We use numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

In particular, strong nonlinearities of an electrified engine air path and the high interaction between the 48V mild hybrid powertrain and the electrical system pose a major challenge. Current research results show the fundamental potential of optimization-based energy management strategies. However there is a lack of optimization-based solutions that allow online direct control of the electrified air path and the electric motor. In this context, this study presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach for a 48V mild hybrid powertrain with an electric supercharger, which is able to simultaneously improve the response behavior and energy consumption. The control concept is developed on the basis of a detailed system description. The special features of optimization-based control for the degrees of freedom of the powertrain, i.e., the belt starter generator (BSG) and the electrified air path through a throttle, waste gate, and electric supercharger (eC), are addressed. After an analysis and verification of the control properties, the NMPC is evaluated in dynamic driving cycle simulations through a comparison with a state-of-the-art rule-based control strategy. The investigations show that the NMPC is able to control the system well even under transient situations with a high influence of disturbance variables. In addition, the NMPC allows a specific and fuel saving use of the 48V system while improving the driving dynamics at the same time.},

In order to minimize it, it is important to carefully design the powertrain of the race car in terms of sizing and technology, and meticulously administer the energy available on-board. To facilitate efficient design, this paper presents a convex optimization framework to rapidly compute the minimum-lap-time control strategies for a battery electric race car. Specifically, we first identify a convex model of the electric powertrain, including the battery, the electric motor, and two transmission technologies: a fixed-gear transmission (FGT) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Second, assuming an expert driver, we formulate the minimum-lap-time control problem in a convex fashion for a given driving path, and compute its globally optimal solution with second-order conic programming algorithms. Third, we showcase our framework on the Le Mans track by comparing the performance achievable with an FGT and a CVT, and validate it with nonlinear simulations. Our results show that for the given setup a CVT can balance its lower efficiency and higher weight with a higher-efficiency and more aggressive motor operation, significantly outperforming the lap time achievable with an FGT. Finally, we leverage the computational efficiency of our framework to carry out parameter studies on the components, revealing that optimizing the size of the battery and the motor for the specific scenario can considerably improve the achievable lap time, and that the best transmission strongly depends on the sizing decisions.},

However, the former approach lacks accurate estimation and the latter approach can cause privacy issues. In the proposed framework, sensor information from acceleration and gyro sensors installed in mobile devices is utilized instead of the first-person camera. From the images obtained from the third-person camera, a heatmap showing the possibility of objects that the user is looking at is estimated using machine learning techniques. This information is combined with the position of the user&#39;s head, which is obtained from the sensor information, to estimate the location of the user&#39;s gaze point. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a much higher accuracy than existing techniques. Obtaining user gaze information is very helpful in providing advanced location-based services (LBSs). The proposed framework can increase the added value of various types of LBSs.},

To overcome this issue, we propose a formulation for the channel capacity of a compact MIMO system that directly links it to the geometry of a pixelated surface embedded into the MIMO system. This formulation allows us to maximize the channel capacity of the MIMO system and straightforwardly obtain the optimum geometry for the pixelated surface that reduces spatial correlation. The key step in obtaining the formulation is to link the pixelated surface geometry to an impedance matrix that allows us to obtain an expression for the systems channel capacity. The formulation is general and can be applied to a wide variety of MIMO antenna systems and geometries. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we include a design for a compact 4-port planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) array integrated with a pixelated surface. Simulations and experiments are provided to evaluate the performance of the compact MIMO system with and without optimization of the surface. It is shown that optimizing the geometry of the pixelated surface can increase channel capacity by 13% and energy efficiency by 19.9% compared to the system without optimization. The importance of the approach is that it provides a link between communication and electromagnetic formulations of MIMO antenna systems.},

To solve the problem, a novel variational Bayesian-based filter for inaccurate input (VBFII) is proposed to determine the state information under the complex marine condition of inaccurate input. Firstly, the velocities are assumed to follow the Gaussian distribution, which can better describe the model of input information. Secondly, the augmentation method is used to augment the state vector and error covariance matrix to simplify calculation. The augmented state vector, the augmented predicted error covariance and measurement error noise matrices are derived more accurately based on the variational Bayesian (VB) approach.

  abstract     = {Indoor device-free localization (DFL) using radio frequency (RF) signals has many important applications including navigation, security and inventory control. One of the most common approaches to indoor DFL is Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) which is based on line-of-sight (LOS) signal models and often utilizes WiFi signals. In this work, we propose a new extended Rytov phaseless imaging (xRPI) technique for indoor imaging that can image the shape and refractive index of objects in the indoor environment using WiFi RSSI measurements. Estimation of refractive index can be used to distinguish different object types within the environment. In addition, methods to reduce the number of RSSI measurements required for indoor imaging are also developed and these use a strong spatial sparsity constraint which directly arises from imaging change in the environment. Theoretical developments that support these contributions include increasing the validity range of the Rytov approximation by using a high frequency approximation to the total field, incorporating temporal background subtraction, incorporating electric field sensing using directional antennas, and utilization of Fresnel zones. Experimental demonstration of the performance of the proposed method is provided using a 20 node WiFi system. The results show that xRPI provides considerable improvement over RTI in accurately imaging shapes of different objects in an indoor environment. It also provides an estimate of the refractive index which is not possible with RTI or other Wi-Fi based indoor imaging techniques.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) cluster-based model for the fifth generation (5G)/beyond 5G (B5G) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wideband channels. It is the first cluster-based irregular shaped geometry-based stochastic model (IS-GBSM) to distinguish the dynamic clusters and static clusters in vehicular massive MIMO communication scenarios. This model not only considers the high time-variance, the time non-stationarity, and the vehicular traffic density (VTD) of V2V channels, but also models the massive MIMO channel characteristics, such as spherical wavefronts by 3D vector calculation and space non-stationarity. Meanwhile, this model for the first time integrates the VTD into birth-death process to model the channel characteristics of V2V and massive MIMO jointly and deeply, where a novel VTD-combined time-array cluster evolution algorithm for 5G/B5G V2V massive MIMO channel model is developed. Based on the proposed model, we derive some expressions of channel statistical properties, including time-space-frequency correlation function (STF-CF) and Doppler power spectral density (DPSD). The influence of several parameters, e.g., VTDs, vehicle moving directions, and antenna spacings, on the channel characteristics are sufficiently explored, which can provide assistance for the design of vehicular massive MIMO communication systems. Finally, the utility of the proposed model is verified by the close agreement between simulation results and measurement data.},

  abstract     = {Wireless channel characterization and modeling is the foundation of vehicular communication systems. However, most of the existing researches on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel are aimed at the traditional scenarios such as urban and suburban, and the researches on some complicated vehicular scenarios are insufficient. For example, little attention is paid to viaduct, tunnel, and cutting scenarios in vehicular communications, and these complex scenarios often become the high-incidence area of communication interruption, and then affect the overall performance of the vehicular communication system due to the bad and unique channel characteristics. In this paper, to fill this gap, time-varying characteristics of V2V channels in viaduct, tunnel, and cutting scenarios are investigated. Specifically, based on 5.9 GHz channel measurements, channel non-stationarity is quantitatively evaluated and compared. Further, a detailed analysis of time-varying power and delay of multipath components (MPCs) is presented. Based on the obtained results, the mechanism of physical environment affecting channel characteristics is analyzed, and the impacts of vehicular scenarios are quantified. Besides, the impacts of scenarios on the spatial distribution of MPCs are investigated. The angular distributions of MPCs in the three typical V2V scenarios are revealed, and the corresponding statistical characteristics are presented. Moreover, the characteristics of MPC clusters in different scenarios are further quantified and analyzed, such as MPC number in each cluster and cluster lifetime. It is revealed that the non-stationarity of the V2V channel originates from the birth-death process of MPC clusters, and the birth-death process is modeled statistically. The results in the paper show the V2V channel propagation mechanism and can be used for the design of vehicular communication systems in complicated scenarios.},

While collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) exploits the benefits of cooperation, the spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attackers are subsequently introduced, which aim at undermining the performance of CRNs. We thus are motivated to maximize the throughput of the CRNs under SSDF attacks. First, to better discern SSDF attackers, we designate a double reputation based algorithm to differentiate the SSDF attackers and honest secondary users (HSUs). Then the trade off problem is formulated to find the optimal network parameters including, sensing duration, global decision threshold, energy detection threshold, reputation thresholds for maximizing the throughput of the secondary users network (SUN) subject to limited interference with the PUs. To address the non-convexity of the optimization problem, dummy variables are introduced and the alternative optimization method is adopted. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in increasing throughput of the SUN with sufficient protection to the PUs.},

  abstract     = {It has been well-recognized that clustered Interference alignment (IA) can provide remarkable interference suppression performance for the existing small cell networks (SCNs). There is also a tendency that full-duplex (FD) radios would replace the half-duplex radios at future small base stations (SBSs). In this context, the intra-cell and inter-cell interference in SCNs would become much more serious, where the performance of clustered IA has not been evaluated yet. In this paper, we explore the maximum achievable sum-rate of the FD-based SCNs when clustered IA combined with power control strategy is applied. To achieve this, a mixed-integer optimization problem is formulated, which is furtherly decoupled into two subproblems for ease of handling. Then we propose the minimized rate loss (MRL) algorithm to address the clustering subproblem and a convex approximation method to address the power control subproblem. The two subproblems are performed alternatively till the sum-rate gains convergence. Preliminary simulations clearly demonstrate that the achievable sum-rate is limited by the number of antennas at the users.},

To observe the trade-off relationship between spectrum efficiency and energy harvesting via SWIPT, we construct an objective function using the weighted sum method, which scalarizes the dominant with spectrum efficiency and energy harvesting, and attempt to find the optimal transmit power and power-splitting ratio to maximize the objective function. Typical iterative search algorithms such as exhaustive search (ES) or gradient search (GS) with a log barrier function are employed to find the global optimum and sub-optimum, respectively. Furthermore, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) learning algorithm to deal with the non-convexity of the objective function with an effective loss function. The simulation results verify the trade-off relationship between spectrum efficiency and energy harvesting, and show that the DNN-based algorithm can achieve a near-global optimal solution with computational complexity much lower than that of the optimization-based iterative algorithms.},

The sum rate maximization problem in WPCN suffers doubly near-far effect caused by the double signal propagation loss in both the energy harvesting and communication stage. It is generally believed that this effect can be alleviated by integrating UAV into WPCN, thanks to its flexible deployment. However, due to the lack of analytical solution in state-of-art research, it is still unclear how to quantify the advantage that the mobility of UAV brings to migrating the doubly near-far effect. To address this issue, by showing that the optimal UAV trajectory has a multi-location hovering structure, we first derive the closed-form optimal solution of resource allocation, as a function of the UAV hovering location for downlink wireless power transfer (WPT). We then prove that the UAV in our case only needs to hover at a single location for WPT. More importantly, it is explicitly shown that the doubly near far effect can be alleviated into near-far effect. Simulation results validate our analysis.},

Although many techniques have been developed improving the offered services to mobile users, still the demand for high-quality services cannot be reached. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled optimization framework for small-cell network (SCNet) by utilizing the concepts of multi-objective problem. In particular, the transmit power of base station (BS) in each small-cell simultaneously optimizes to maximize the sum-capacity and total energy efficiency (EE) of SCNet. The multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as non-convex subject to several practical constraints, i.e., individual quality of service requirement, maximum power budget of small-cell BS, and efficient decoding of superimposed signal using successive interference cancellation. Based on the nature of the problem, the optimal solutions are provided using sequential quadratic programming, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approaches. The obtained results show significant performance gains over conventional orthogonal multiple access technique in terms of sum-capacity and total EE.},

Since it is infeasible to derive an explicit expression for the average probability of estimation error (APEE) for the proposed MAP criterion, we derive a closed-form upper bound for the APEE, which is used as the cost function to optimize the phase shifts of the IRS units. Considering the unit modulus constraints incurred by the IRS units, a manifold optimization (MO) method is firstly employed to gain a favorable solution to the formulated optimization problem, followed by a low-complexity codebook based solution to circumvent the high computational cost of the MO method. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed IRS phase shift designs over the benchmark method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel beam alignment algorithm based on the sparse graph coding theory is proposed for millimeter wave (mmWave) time-varying channels. Firstly, a pilot design method is introduced to transform the mmWave time-varying beam alignment into a sparse-graph design and detection problem. Inspired by Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and fountain codes, a multi-stage sparse coding method is proposed for the design of the measurement matrix and the theoretical bound of the probability of success is derived to guide the design of the sparse-graph. A beam alignment algorithm is subsequently proposed to detect the beam index and estimate the carrier frequency offset (CFO). Then, the Carmeŕ-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beam alignment algorithm achieves significant performance improvements over the conventional counterparts in both the noiseless and noise cases.},

For such a wireless powered MEC network, the H-AP first transmits wireless information and energy simultaneously in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested energy, the device processes both its local data and the received data from the H-AP. In this system, we minimize the latency by jointly optimizing the power splitting ratio of rectifiers, the data offloading power, the local computing frequency, and the data offloading ratio at the device. By applying a polyblock outer approximation procedure, we propose an algorithm which guarantees the optimal solution.

In the presence of the beam squint effect, the conventional spatially sparse precoding-based hybrid precoding method which approximates the optimal precoder/combiner with a set of array response vectors suffers severe performance degradation. To address this difficulty, we propose a new set of basis vectors to approximate the optimal precoder/combiner. Each new basis vector is devised to form a radiation pattern with a wide beam to cover the squinted beam directions caused by different frequencies.

In order to tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) based approach to efficiently design the symbol-level precoders. Particularly, in this correspondence, we consider a multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink system.

In particular, a practical noisy wireless channel between the edge device and the edge server is considered in this work, unlike the previous works which only considered ideal and simplistic error-free communications between them. To prevent the prediction of DNNs from being inaccurate, the communication errors caused by the noisy wireless channel must be appropriately mitigated. Thus, in the proposed cooperative DNN inference, a hybrid automatic repeat request with chase combining (HARQ-CC) is adopted with a practical error correction code (ECC). Analyzing the end-to-end latency of the proposed cooperative DNN inference, we jointly determine the optimal code rate of the ECC and the optimal location at which the DNN must be split into two parts for the edge device and the edge server to minimize the end-to-end latency.

However, one critical challenge raised is to provide full coverage (especially in dense high-rise urban environments) for ground users due to scarce network resources and limited coverage. To meet this challenge, we propose a high altitude platform (HAP)-reserved ground-air-space (GAS) transmission scheme, which combines with the ground-to-space (G2S) transmission scheme to strengthen the terrestrial communication and save the transmission power. To integrate the two transmission schemes, we propose a transmission control strategy. Wherein, the ground user decides its transmission scheme, i.e., switches between the GAS link transmission and the G2S link transmission with a probability. We then maximize the overall throughput and derive the optimal probability that a ground user adopts the GAS transmission scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed transmission control strategy.},

  abstract     = {A proper channel modeling methodology that characterizes the statistics of extreme events is key in the design of a system at an ultra-reliable regime of operation. The strict constraint of ultra-reliability corresponds to the packet error rate (PER) in the range of $10^{-9}-10^{-5}$ within the acceptable latency on the order of milliseconds. Extreme value theory (EVT) is a robust framework for modeling the statistical behavior of extreme events in the channel data. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on EVT to model the extreme events of a non-stationary wireless channel for the ultra-reliable regime of operation. This methodology includes techniques for splitting the channel data sequence into multiple groups concerning the environmental factors causing non-stationarity, and fitting the lower tail distribution of the received power in each group to the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). The proposed approach also consists of optimally determining the time-varying threshold over which the tail statistics are derived as a function of time, and assessing the validity of the derived Pareto model. Finally, the proposed approach chooses the best model with minimum complexity that represents the time variation behavior of the non-stationary channel data sequence. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea under various engine vibrations and driving scenarios, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed methodology in providing the best fit to the extremes of the non-stationary data. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the channel modeling approach using the stationary channel assumption in characterizing the extreme events.},

To this end, we first outline a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CMTC) to study an AP&#39;s channel bonding process given random traffic arrivals and interference. After that, we outline a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution that controls when an AP uses a single or bonded channel and its transmit power.

  abstract     = {Two-Way Ranging (TWR) is a widely used method for distance estimation in asynchronous wireless networks, but the deviation between the clocks can lead to errors in distance estimation. The ultra-wideband (UWB) technology provides the best accuracy in distance estimation, but total emission time is drastically limited by harmonized standards. Localization accuracy, latency and network scalability are key performance metrics in wireless location characterization. This article advances a new sequencing of the localization process, called Double-Beacon Two-Way Ranging (DB-TWR) algorithm, and presents the related time-of-flight (ToF) estimation formula, which is able to compensate for clock error and to reduce the localization period. The Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol, specified by the Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard, uses the TWR method and as a result the clock deviation leads to systematic errors in ToF estimation. The paper proposes two additional timestamps captures and a new ToF computation formula which compensates for clock deviation. The article provides a theoretical analysis and extensive simulations of errors propagation in the ranging process, both as a mean and as an uncertainty, and proves that the designed algorithms cancel the clock offsets entirely.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of strategic resource management in fog networks is discussed while considering a pay-per-use model, similar to that used in cloud. Fog networks are distributed in nature, because of which resource management in these networks is an NP-hard problem. In the existing literature, the researchers focused on resource management in fog networks, while considering the network delay constraint. However, none of these works considered the effect of pricing policy while deciding on resource allocation. Hence, there is a need for pricing-based resource management in fog networks. In this work, we proposed a dynamic pricing-based resource allocation scheme, named FogPrime, for analyzing the trade-off between the service delay and the associated price. In FogPrime, we use dynamic coalition-formation game to decide the resource allocation strategy locally within a cluster. On the other hand, we use utility game to choose the fog nodes, strategically, while considering the aforementioned trade-off. Through simulation, we observed that FogPrime outperforms the existing schemes in terms of satisfaction of the involved entities – the end-user and the fog nodes. Using FogPrime, the satisfaction of the end-users and the fog nodes increases by 24.49–47.82%, respectively. Additionally, we observe that FogPrime ensures an even distribution of profit among the fog nodes and enables the end-users to pay less at most by 15.88–47.27%.},

  abstract     = {The age of information (AoI) is a key performance metric for data freshness in real-time systems, measuring the time elapsed between status updates received at a remote destination. This paper addresses the analysis of both the AoI and the delay for a system demanding timely status updates, consisting of an internet of things (IoT) community, and a multi-core edge computing node (EN). The IoT devices perform channel contention according to a slotted aloha non-orthogonal multiple access scheme with two transmission power levels to access the EN. The objective of the paper is the dynamic selection of both the EN computation capabilities and the suitable access probability for the two power levels, aiming at maximizing the time-average system utility, while guaranteeing the queues stability. The device end-to-end delay is analyzed by resorting to the martingale theoretical approximation under the condition that the Lyapunov optimization framework is performed on a time slot basis, hence leading to a novel instantaneous mixed integer problem formulation. Furthermore, the generalized benders decomposition method is employed to provide a suboptimal solution for the formulated problem. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed framework is validated by comparing the obtained analytical predictions with simulation results.},

By storing popular content at the nearby mobile user devices, D2D caching is an efficient method to improve network throughput and alleviate backhaul burden. With the attractive features of high mobility and flexible deployment, UAVs have recently attracted significant attention as cache-enabled flying base stations. The use of cache-enabled UAVs opens up the possibility of tracking the mobility pattern of the corresponding users and serving them under limited cache storage capacity. However, it is challenging to determine the optimal UAV trajectory due to the dynamic environment with frequently changing network topology and the coexistence of aerial and terrestrial caching nodes. In response, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning based framework to determine the optimal 3D trajectory of each UAV in a distributed manner without a central coordinator. In the proposed method, multiple UAVs can cooperatively make flight decisions by sharing the gained experiences within a certain proximity to each other. Simulation results reveal that our algorithm outperforms the traditional single- and multi-agent Q-learning algorithms. This work confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of cache-enabled UAVs which serve as an important complement to terrestrial D2D caching nodes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies how to apply game theory to realize a well-function device-to-device enabled vehicular (D2D-V) communication system, where the uplink channel allocated to the cellular user (CU) is reused by multiple D2D-V users. Considering a non-cooperative setting where the CU and D2D-V users are selfish and profit-driven, a novel Stackelberg game framework is proposed to model the single-leader-multiple-follower hierarchical competition, where the CU and D2D-V users act as the leader and the followers, respectively. For the current D2D-V networks, the interference in the dense vehicle scene often leads to extremely poor communication quality. Moreover, a vehicle&#39;s mobility leads to an uncertain channel state and further affects the stability of communication. To achieve effective communication, robust Stackelberg game-based resource allocation is developed, and a price-penalty mechanism is further proposed. Unlike previous Stackelberg games, the robust game is highlighted by handling the channel uncertainty which is embedded in the interference probability constraints. Besides, a game equilibrium (GE) is considered to be the solution and its existence and uniqueness are investigated. Also, a distributed robust power control and nonuniform price bargaining algorithm is proposed to approach the GE. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the algorithm performances, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective in high mobility vehicular networks under uncertain channel environments.},

CAVs will be highly dynamic by intelligently exploiting multipath communication over several radio technologies, such as high-speed WiFi and 5G and beyond networks. Yet, the likelihood of data communication loss can be very high and/, or packets arrive at the destination not in correct working order due to erratic and mixed time-varying wireless links. Furthermore, the vehicular data traffic is susceptible to loss and delay variation, which recommends the need to investigate new multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocols for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) over such heterogeneous networks while reassuring CAVs&#39; needs. We undertake the challenge by jointly considering network coding and balanced linked adaptation for performing coupled congestion control across multiple wireless paths. Consequently, the proposed low delay MPTCP framework for connecting autonomous vehicles is efficient and intelligent by design. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis of the MPTCP design framework. In summation, we provide a detailed mathematical study and demonstrate that the latency penalty for the URLLC-MPTCP developed over these networks becomes negligible when considering the possible benefits that multiple network convergence could offer. Our extensive emulation results demonstrate all these lucrative features of URLLC-MPTCP.},

The existing VNE algorithm ignores the attributes of the network itself. It only allocates resources according to the order in which the requests arrive, resulting in the problem of low utilization of physical resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient topology control scheme for mobile nodes in IoVs. We firstly present a novel hierarchy-based dynamic VNE model for IoV. Then a VNE algorithm based on hierarchical priority is established by considering the attributes of virtual network requests. Finally, a global resource capacity based dynamic VNE algorithm is designed. Compared with precious VNE algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a 19 percent to 23 percent increase in the resource utilization rate of nodes, and elevates the overall request acceptance rate and revenue overhead, and can reduce the average waiting time of virtual network requests.},

  abstract     = {To meet the execution requirements of delay-sensitive services in vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks, vehicular services need to be offloaded to edge computing nodes. For complex, large-scale services, the services need to be migrated if the services are not completed before the vehicles leave the coverage of edge computing nodes. Trust and resource matching between areas thus become major problems. This paper studies the decision model of vehicular service offloading and migration. First, software-defined network (SDN) technology is introduced into the traditional network architecture, and a two-layer distributed SDN-controlled VEC network architecture is designed, which is divided into a domain control layer and an area control layer. In this framework, we use the consortium blockchain as a carrier to share network topology information between SDN controllers to prevent information leakage. We then established a service offloading and migration optimization problem model to minimize service execution delay, reduce energy consumption and maximize the throughput of the blockchain system. We describe the problem model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and design a dynamic service offloading and migration algorithm (DSOMA) based on A3C to solve the problem. Simulation results show that DSOMA can increase the throughput of the blockchain system, and DSOMA is superior to the deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm and greedy offloading algorithm in reducing service execution delay and system energy consumption.},

We formulated the problem of computing an optimal broadcast time interval to maximize the service ratio, reducing the duplicate message overhead. The proposed scheme uses the software-defined network (SDN) architecture having OpenFlow-enabled RSUs and SDN controllers. Based on the global view of traffic-related information, the proposed SDN controller computes the broadcast time interval for data dissemination among the vehicles. We used the NS-3 simulator to evaluate the proposed scheme&#39;s performance by generating a real scenario of VANET traffic using SUMO.

  abstract     = {Multi-agent cooperative target tracking plays a significant role in distributed artificial intelligence for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Most existing tracking solutions using online path planning focus on general target trajectories. Such trajectories have strong regularity and are smooth with minimal fluctuations. However, in real UAV applications a target will change its trajectory frequently to prevent from being tracked, and thus its trajectory will fluctuate greatly and randomly. To this end, in this paper we consider a realistic scenario where the UAV target trajectory is changeable and random. For real-time target tracking, we formulate the tracking task as a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem, the objective of which is to optimize tracking performance under various constraints. To do so, we innovatively combine the adaptive differential evolution (ADE) algorithm with Nash optimization, and then propose a Nash-combined ADE method. Specifically, we use ADE to adaptively adjust the predicted trajectory of each UAV agent and Nash optimization to efficiently solve DMPC formulation for global optimization, which can improve the tracking accuracy and simultaneously reduce the computational complexity. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of tracking accuracy, UAV collision avoidance and tracking stability for realistic target trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising solution to support emerging delay-sensitive mobile applications, such as self-driving, augment/virtual reality, and various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By deploying MEC servers at network edge, e.g., close to cellular base stations (BSs), the computational tasks generated by these applications can be offloaded to edge nodes (ENs) and be quickly executed there. At the same time, with the projected large number of IoT devices, the communication and computational resources allocated to each user can be quite limited, making it challenging to provide low-latency MEC services. In this paper, we investigate the problem of task partitioning and user association in an MEC system, aiming to minimize the average latency of all users. We assume that each task can be partitioned into multiple subtasks that can be executed on local devices (e.g., vehicles), MEC servers, and/or cloud servers; each user can be associated with one of the nearby ENs. The subtasks can be independent of or dependent on each other. For each case, we formulate the joint optimization of task partitioning ratios and user association as a mixed integer programming problem. Each problem is solved by decomposing it into two subproblems. The lower-level subproblem is task partitioning under a given user association, which can be solved optimally. The higher-level subproblem is user association, we propose a dual decomposition-based approach and a matching-based approach to derive near-optimal solutions. Simulation results show that compared to benchmark schemes, the proposed schemes reduce the average latency by about 50% and 40% for the cases of independent and dependent subtasks, respectively.},

In IoV, vehicles, roads, street signs and traffic lights can accordingly adjust to changing conditions in order to assist drivers, and also to improve safety, ease congestion and pollution reduction. Since various entities in an IoV environment make communications over public channels, there are potential security threats. To deal with such serious threats, we design a new blockchain-assisted certificateless key agreement protocol for IoV in smart transportation context, called Block-CLAP. In Block-CLAP, through authentication key management, traffic-centric data reach to a cluster head (CH) and then to its nearby road-side unit (RSU) securely using the established secret keys. A cloud server (CS) then securely collects the information from its attached RSUs and create the transactions. Later, the transactions are formed into blocks by the CS in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers network, and the blocks are verified and added through voting-based consensus algorithm in the blockchain. The detailed security analysis through formal, informal and formal security verification, and comparative study show that Block-CLAP provides superior security and has low communication and computational overheads as compared with other existing competing authentication schemes in the IoV environment. Finally, the blockchain-based implementation of Block-CLAP has been performed to measure computational time needed for a varied number of transactions per block and also for a varied number of blocks mined in the blockchain.},

  abstract     = {Multi-Access edge computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm where users offload computationally intensive jobs to the Access Point (AP). Given that the AP&#39;s resources are shared by selfish users, pricing is a useful tool for incentivising users to internalize the negative externality of delay they cause to other users. Nevertheless, different users have different negative valuations towards delay as some are more delay sensitive. To serve heterogeneous users, we propose a priority pricing scheme where users can get served first for a higher price. Our goal is to find the prices such that in decision making, users will choose the class and the offloading frequency that jointly maximize social welfare. With the assumption that the AP knows users&#39; profit functions, we derive in semi-closed form the optimal prices. However in practice, the reporting of users&#39;s profit information incurs a large signalling overhead. Besides, in reality users might falsely report their private profit information. To overcome this, we further propose a partial-knowledge based pricing mechanism where no knowledge of individual user profit functions is required. At equilibrium, the optimal prices and average edge delays are learnt, and users have chosen the correct priority class and offload at the socially optimal frequency.},

  abstract     = {Efficient traffic allocation for heterogeneous links in satellite data relay networks (SDRNs) has been an attractive topic nowadays. However, different traffic types and link heterogeneity bring plenty of difficulties to the link delay evaluation which directly impacts the traffic allocation efficiency. Owing to the unique determination of the probability distribution of arrival processes, we succeed in characterizing any type of traffic with the help of the moment generating function (MGF). According to the alternation and discontinuity of satellite ground links (SGLs), we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo embedded service matrix construction method to model the SGL service. Being apt at combining service processes, the stochastic network calculus based min-plus convolution is employed to depict the relay service. By deriving the tight upper bounds of the delay in heterogeneous links based on the MGF, min-plus convolution, and Markov chain, respectively, taking advantage of the Chernoff bound and Union bound, we calculate the optimal traffic allocation ratio in terms of minimum system delay. Finally, numerous simulations are conducted to show the relationships among the optimal traffic allocation ratio, traffic type, and link heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) network, where the UAV is responsible for sustaining the network with all devices on the ground. The sustainable charge process operates periodically, i.e., in each working period, the UAV flies from and back to a landing position. The initial remaining energy in the batteries and battery storage limits are considered in this study. We assume only the initial remaining network lifetime (RNL) known and no further lifetime updates available, and provide a sustainable design aiming at minimizing the average UAV consumed power while sustaining the network including all devices. We formulate the problem via determining the UAV trajectory and lengths of working period and charging phase, and introduce an iterative algorithm for an efficient solution. The repeats of designed working period are proved to guarantee the sustentation of the whole network. Moreover, when UAV behaves the same in all working periods, the obtained solution is strongly influenced by the initial RNL. To get rid of this influence, we further propose a second approach, namely a transition-based sustainable design, in which a transition state is introduced for improving the RNL, and the UAV updates its behaviour in each working period. The convergence and limit of this transition approach are addressed. After transitions, the network shifts to a steady state, and operates periodically as in the first design. Finally, through simulations, we validate the sustaining performance of both designs and the performance improvement via the transition approach.},

  abstract     = {Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reinforcement-learning (RL) based user clustering are leveraged to manage interference of a downlink fog radio access network. In particular, clustering of the user devices (UDs) is considered. The UDs of a given cluster can receive data from a certain fog access point (F-AP) over the same radio resource blocks (RRBs) simultaneously. To this end, RSMA enabled data transmission is exploited at each UD cluster. To manage intra-cluster and inter-cluster interference of the network, we focus on the resource allocation to maximize the sum-rate and to minimize total transmission power of the F-APs in each transmission slot. Towards this goal, we optimize jointly the F-APs’ transmit power allocation for RSMA enabled data transmission, clustering of UDs, and assignment of RRBs among the F-APs. The proposed optimization problem is NP-hard, and as a result, a global optimal solution is computationally intractable even with the centralized implementation. To obtain an efficient solution without having the global network information, the proposed optimization problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, namely, UD clustering and resource allocation among the F-APs. Specifically, the UD clusters are obtained by applying a multi-agent RL technique, and the resource allocation among the F-APs is obtained by applying the fractional programming, Lagrangian duality, and alternating optimization techniques. A distributed user clustering-power allocation-RRB assignment (UC-PA-RA) algorithm is proposed, and its convergence to the near-optimal solution is proved. Through extensive simulations, the superiority of the proposed UC-PA-RA algorithm over the contemporary multiple access schemes, UD clustering technique, and RL method is verified.},

  abstract     = {LTE LAA listen-before-talk (LBT) procedures have been considered a promising solution to reasonable coexistence of LTE with other access technologies in unlicensed spectrum. An issue that arises with the LAA LBT procedures is the so-called GAP period, which may largely degrade the performance of a coexistence system. There are two methods to deal with the GAP period. Method 1 is to fill in the channel during a GAP period by using a reservation signal, while Method 2 takes no action but just listens to the channel during a GAP period. Most existing analytical models for the LAA LBT procedures are inaccurate because they do not take into account the GAP period. This paper studies the modeling of the LAA category-4 LBT procedure in an LAA and WiFi coexistence system and investigate the impact of the GAP period on the system performance. A 2-D Markov chain is built to model the category-4 LBT procedure of an LAA eNodeB, considering the effect of the GAP period. Based the Markov model, analytical models are further derived to investigate the throughput and packet delay performance of the coexistence system with Method 1 and Method 2, respectively. Numerical results show that with Method 1, the performance of an LAA eNodeB is similar to that of a WiFi AP in terms of the transmission probability and packet delay. With Method 2, the performance of an LAA eNodeB is worse than that of a WiFi AP.},

To improve the efficiency of anonymous authentication in multiple security domains, VANETs integrated with blockchain attracts extensive attention. However, the existing blockchain-based authentication schemes cannot effectively achieve anonymity because colluded RSUs or vehicles can achieve linkability via the same retrieved record to destroy anonymity. To address the issue, we propose an unlinkable authenticated key agreement with collusion resistant for VANETs. For the unlinkability of V2R, firstly, a trusted authority generates multiple tickets that hide the vehicle&#39;s identity and shares them by the blockchain network. Then, vehicle generates different pseudonyms by homomorphic encryption, and RSU uses different tickets to authenticate them. Meanwhile, in view of the unlinkability of the V2V, anonymous authenticated key agreement based on homomorphic properties is designed to enable vehicles to achieve authentication without retrieving any vehicular information. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme has strict unlinkability and enhanced anonymity as well as improves the efficiency of V2R and V2V by 10% and 50%, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose a joint radio resource and passive beamforming optimization scheme for a downlink RIS-assisted wireless-powered communication network with a harvest-then-transmit protocol to improve system energy efficiency (EE). In the considered model, the single-antenna wireless devices (WDs) harvest wireless energy from a multi-antenna dedicated power station (PS) through the RIS in the downlink and transmit their independent information to a single-antenna receiver in the uplink by a time-division-multiple-access mode. Our goal is to maximize the total EE of all WDs. To make full use of the beamforming gain provided by both the PS and the RIS, we jointly optimize the active beamforming of the PS and the passive beamforming of the RIS. To deal with the challenging non-convex optimization problem with multiple coupled variables, we first consider fixing the passive beamforming, and converting the remaining radio resource allocation problem into an equivalent convex problem which is solved by using Lagrange dual theory. Then, we fix the optimized resource allocation parameters and optimize the passive beamforming of the RIS by using a semidefinite programming method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher EE compared to the conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid antenna array consisting of analog subarrays provides a low-cost solution to achieving high beamforming gain in millimeter-wave/terahertz communication systems. For beam adjustment, beam scanning can be readily applied to find the line-of-sight (LoS) path. Conventionally, the beam scanning process is inefficient because the number of grids, together with the scanning period, has to be large to achieve high resolution. To improve the beam scanning efficiency, in this paper we propose an off-gird direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation method utilizing unequal-sized subarrays. Specifically, we first provide a new solution to overcome the ambiguity problem, i.e., the hybrid antenna array may render the DoA estimate non-unique. That new solution is formed by designing the antenna numbers in the subarrays and can be easily combined with the beam scanning process. We then propose a three-stage beam scanning strategy. At the first stage, coarse scanning is applied to roughly steer the subarrays along the LoS path. At the second stage, a simple DoA estimator is employed to obtain the candidate DoAs. Finally, beam scanning is performed again on the candidate DoAs to obtain the final DoA estimate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve higher DoA estimation accuracy in shorter scanning period than the conventional beam scanning method; and compared with existing methods developed for equal-sized subarrays, the proposed method is more robust against multi-path interference.},

Due to channel estimation error and feedback delays, the channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitters is usually imperfect, which can significantly deteriorate the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered system. To mitigate the impact of imperfect CSI, we formulate a non-convex robust optimization problem for the maximization of the EE (in bits/Joule) of the system while ensuring quality of service (QoS) requirements on the minimum data rata and the minimum amount of harvested energy for cellular and D2D users, respectively. We reveal that the optimal energy-efficient D2D transmission should exhaust all the harvested energy of each D2D transmitter. Exploiting this fact, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm for obtaining the optimal solution. To strike a balance between performance and computational complexity, we further propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm. Simulation results show that compared with several baseline schemes, both the proposed optimal and suboptimal algorithms can significantly improve the EE of wireless-powered D2D communications under imperfect CSI. Moreover, the proposed suboptimal algorithm is close-to-optimal when the number of cellular users are small or the channel estimation error is large.},

Particularly, the road infrastructure is modeled by a Poisson line point process (PLP), whereas base stations (BSs) and users are located according to 1D homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs) on each road. In the considered N-NOMA scheme, there are two types of users, i.e., coordinated multi-point (CoMP) users which are far from their BSs and NOMA users which are close to their BSs, where the CoMP users and the NOMA users are served simultaneously by applying the principle of NOMA. Specifically, the BSs collaborate with each other to provide reliable transmission for the CoMP user by applying Almouti coding, while each BS employs superposition coding to opportunistically serve an additional NOMA user. Compared to a conventional OMA based scheme, where only a CoMP user is served, the proposed N-NOMA scheme significantly improves the performance in terms of outage sum rates and user connectivity, since more users are served in the same resource block. A comprehensive analytical framework is developed to characterize the system level performance of the proposed N-NOMA scheme by applying PLC. Closed form expressions for the outage probabilities achieved by the CoMP and NOMA users are obtained. Computer simulation results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed scheme and also validate the accuracy of the developed analytical results.},

  abstract     = {In-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems require promising resource allocation (RA) strategies to fully exploit the available time-frequency resources. Furthermore, the acquisition of channel state information and signal reception in IBFD systems are significantly impacted by insufficient self-interference cancellation (SIC), impeding the applications of IBFD in practical wireless systems. Multicarrier-division duplex (MDD), which benefits low-budget SI mitigation in digital domain and flexible subcarrier assignment, is expected to be a promising transitional technique from half-duplex (HD) to IBFD. To demonstrate the advantages of MDD over HD, this paper first compares the upper-bound performance of MDD and HD by applying unfair greedy RA. Then, considering the millimeter-wave (mmWave) with hybrid beamforming, we propose the RA optimization with the quality-of-service constraints on both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) mobile-stations (MSs). To solve this non-convex RA problem, we divide it into a suboptimal subcarrier allocation problem solved by the proposed improved fair greedy (IFG) algorithm, and a convex power allocation problem. Furthermore, we design two general hybrid precoder based on matrix factorization and direct approach, and a combiner having high SIC capability. Our results show that the proposed RA algorithm can achieve the performance near the upper-bound achieved by the unfair greedy algorithm, while guaranteeing the proportional fairness among all DL/UL MSs. The performance of the two precoding schemes is depended on the number of radio frequency chains supported. Finally, the proposed SIC algorithm is able to provide sufficient SI mitigation, which can be implemented without impacting the RA operation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the convolution neural networks (CNN) are developed for the classification and localization of mixed near-field and far-field sources by using the geometry of symmetric nested array. We first transform the received data into frequency domain. Then, we preprocess the phase difference matrix to decouple mixed sources. Considering that the counter-diagonal elements in the phase difference matrix only contain the direction of arrival (DOA) parameter of each mixed source, we utilize the upper right elements as the input of CNN to estimate the DOA of each mixed source. In order to avoid the influence of noise, we construct a particular range vector without the estimated DOA and employ the output of autoencoder to classify the mixed sources. Finally, we further exploit the output of autoencoder and apply the CNN without bias vectors to estimate the range of near-field sources. In contrast to the traditional learning-based approaches regarding the parameter estimation as a classification problem, the proposed approach considers the parameter estimation as a regression problem and can significantly reduce the complexity of networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based method can improve the precision for the mixed source localization. Moreover, the proposed method is robust to the off-grid parameters and the different numbers of mixed sources.},

  abstract     = {A compact dual-polarized multiple-input-multiple- output (MIMO) Vivaldi antenna with a wide bandwidth, high gain, and high isolation is proposed for wireless communications in intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV). It consists of four identical orthogonally-crossed Vivaldi radiators, crossed-fishbone-shaped slot, metasurface lens, parasitic stubs, electromagnetic (EM) wave reflector, and three-dimensional (3D) printed radome with dielectric resonator (DR) array. These functional modules jointly contribute to optimized antenna performance. Four identical antenna elements are rotationally symmetrical. To reduce the inter-element mutual coupling, the crossed-fishbone-shaped slot is etched to reduce the surface current flowing in adjacent radiators. To raise the gain, the metasurface lens, parasitic stubs, and DR array are loaded to guide the EM wave in the frontward radiation. An EM wave reflector located underneath the Vivaldi radiators could increase the boresight gain and reduce the influence of the vehicle body on the antenna performance. Diversity performance analysis indicates the proposed antenna could offer better MIMO capability. Besides, the impact of weather conditions on the antenna is analyzed. As a proof of concept, an expanded 8-element antenna array prototype is designed, fabricated, and tested. A good agreement is observed between measured and simulated results. It achieves an -10-dB impedance bandwidth of 7.55-22.85 GHz (100.66% FBW) with port isolation of higher than 18.05 dB. The realized gain is 6.98-11.54 dBi, and the radiation efficiency is 85.05-90.27%. The proposed antenna could be used in wireless communications between vehicles and the satellite/infrastructure.},

Unlike the previous work, the proposed method focuses on each antenna phase distribution in the array and reduces the correlation by adjusting the near-field phase distribution using phase correcting elements (PCEs). The PCEs provide the required transmission phase to modify the near-field phase distribution in a specific plane. Diversity measure and channel capacity are introduced as metrics to evaluate the MIMO system&#39;s array performances. The significance of the phase pattern on the correlation performance is investigated and demonstrated by comparing and analyzing four specially designed arrays&#39; results. A 1 × 4 dual-polarized patch array with four PCEs is simulated, fabricated, and measured to verify the method. The diversity measure and channel capacity are improved by 0.5 (10%), 5 bit/s/Hz (12.2%), respectively, at 2.6 GHz when the channel&#39;s angular spread is 90°.},

AmBC systems enable communications between RF-powered devices (e.g., tags and sensors) and AmBC receivers by utilizing ambient RF source signals from existing communication systems. Thus it offers a low-cost and energy-efficient means of communications for future IoT applications. In the current AmBC research, the impact of using channel coding on existing primary networks in terms of the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the AmBC systems are mostly ignored. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that offer fast encoding and decoding process have been proposed as promising channel codes in the fifth-generation (5 G) networks. In this paper, we investigate the BER performance of an AmBC system that uses LDPC-coded RF source signals. We have analytically derived the BER upper and lower bounds of both the RF source and tag signals for our proposed AmBC system. Simulation results show that the BERs of both signals decrease significantly, compared to conventional AmBC systems with uncoded RF source signals.},

Users are grouped to employ NOMA. In order to cancel the inter-group interference, the ZF decoder is designed as a function of channel estimates acquired based on two low overhead channel estimation schemes, namely, Scheme-I and Scheme-S. Under these estimation schemes, pilots are shared among users in a group while they are orthogonal across groups. User grouping and power allocation are two pivotal ways to regulate the performance of users in a NOMA system. Thus, to ensure uniform quality-of-service to all users, we obtain the max-min power control coefficients which maximize the minimum achievable rate. Furthermore, we investigate two different user grouping strategies, namely, non-scalable near-far grouping and scalable neighbor grouping, and study their impact on the UL max-min achievable rate. We benchmark against the performance obtained with the maximum ratio decoder. Extensive analysis and simulations show that in a substantial portion of the over-loaded regime and the entire under-loaded regime, ZF decoder designed using channel estimates acquired via Scheme-S with near-far grouping gives the highest max-min achievable rate among all the considered decoding and grouping strategies.},

  abstract     = {Carrier Aggregation is one of the vital approaches to achieve several orders of magnitude increase in peak data rates. While carrier aggregation benefits have been extensively studied in cellular networks, its application to satellite systems has not been thoroughly explored yet. Carrier aggregation can offer an enhanced and more consistent quality of service for users throughout the satellite coverage via combining multiple carriers, utilizing the unused capacity at other carriers, and enabling effective interference management. Furthermore, carrier aggregation can be a prominent solution to address the issue of the spatially heterogeneous satellite traffic demand. This paper investigates introducing carrier aggregation to satellite systems from a link layer perspective. Deployment of carrier aggregation in satellite systems with the combination of multiple carriers that have different characteristics requires effective scheduling schemes for reliable communications. To this end, a novel load balancing scheduling algorithm has been proposed to distribute data packets across the aggregated carriers based on channel capacities and to utilize spectrum efficiently. Moreover, in order to ensure that the received data packets are delivered without perturbing the original transmission order, a perceptive scheduling algorithm has been developed that takes into consideration channel properties along with the instantaneous available resources at the aggregated carriers. The proposed modifications have been carefully designed to make carrier aggregation transparent above the medium access control (MAC) layer. Additionally, the complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms has been conducted in terms of the computational loads. Simulation results are provided to validate our analysis, demonstrate the design tradeoffs, and to highlight the potentials of carrier aggregation applied to satellite communication systems.},

Exact and asymptotic expressions for the secrecy outage probability and intercept probability are derived for an interference-limited scenario over a general fading scenario with the assumption that the channel state information (CSI) on the secondary transmitter (ST)- primary receiver (PR) channel is perfect. However, CSI on the ST-PR channel may be outdated due to the time-varying properties or feedback latency from the PU. If the ST allocates transmission power using this outdated CSI, PR&#39;s interference constraint will not be satisfied. Therefore, we investigate the impact of outdated CSI on the secrecy performance of an interference-limited CRN when interference from the primary transmitter to SU exits under peak interference power constraint.},

The proposed method fully considers various possibilities of target motion, which makes the target state estimation more effective. Moreover, the de-noising and exponential weighting of MUSIC pseudo-spectrum improve the likelihood function of particles, thus enhancing the weight of particles in high likelihood region and making these particles more effective in the subsequent resampling process. Simulation results show that the IMM-MeMBer algorithm has better performance than projection approximation subspace tracking of deflation MUSIC (PASTD-MUSIC), MeMBer, particle filter (PF), and random finite set PF (RFS-PF) in the DOA tracking of maneuvering sources.},

Here, we propose a single-intensity-measurement phase retrieval algorithm (SPRA)-based AO technique of compensating for the distortion of the OAM beam. The only parameter required by the SPRA wave-front sensor is the intensity of the probe beam in the Fourier domain, which substantially simplifies the AO system. We first derive an analytical expression to characterize the expansion of probe beam in OAM-OWC links and then determine the diameter constraints as the apriori information of the SPRA required for guaranteeing a certain compensation performance. The simulation results illustrate that the SPRA-AO approach can indeed correct a distorted OAM beam both in a single-channel scenario and in multiplexed OAM-OWC systems. The bit error rate can be improved by orders of magnitude with the aid of SPRA-AO compensation. Furthermore, we establish noise models of AO-based OAM-OWC systems and analyze the robustness of the SPRA-AO technique. In a nutshell, this paper provides new insights for the applications of AO and forms the theoretical basis of employing probe beams in OAM-OWC systems.},

However, to support high speed vehicles and high data rates, a wider coverage area by the RSU antennas projected on the highway is required. This is defined by the radiation patterns of the RSU antennas. On a multi-lane highway, interference from the adjacent lanes is a critical issue which determines the communication reliability in terms of Single-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). Hence, in this paper, an interference-aware antenna synthesis process is proposed and a planar array is optimized based on the objective function of obtaining a wide coverage area in terms of SINR distribution for a given modulation scheme. The proposed antenna array enhances the reliable communication area and provides improved SINR distribution across the lane for misaligned vehicles from the center of the lane. The results indicate that the proposed antenna array performs better than the existing designs in terms of communication reliability.},

Furthermore, a realistic dataset of mmWave channel-DeepMIMO is adopted to evaluate and determine the practicability of this method. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep direct beamforming achieves high performance while its complexity and power consumption are very low. Compared with other methods without perfect channel status information (CSI), the proposed method costs less and requires lower computational resources while achieves higher spectral efficiency. Furthermore, the RSVD can be easily combined with conventional beamforming methods hence the proposed method is easily extendable to other applications.},

  abstract     = {In two-way time-of-arrival (TOA) systems, a user device (UD) obtains its position and timing information by round-trip communications to a number of anchor nodes (ANs) at known locations. Compared with the one-way TOA technique, the two-way TOA scheme is easy to implement and has higher localization and synchronization accuracy. Existing two-way TOA methods assume a stationary UD. This will cause uncompensated position and timing errors. In this article, we propose an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) based two-way TOA localization and synchronization method, namely TWLAS. Different from the existing methods, it takes the UD mobility into account to compensate the error caused by the UD motion. We analyze its estimation error and derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We show that the conventional two-way TOA method is a special case of the TWLAS when the UD is stationary, and the TWLAS has high estimation accuracy than the conventional one-way TOA method. We also derive the estimation error in the case of deviated UD velocity information. Numerical result demonstrates that the estimation accuracy of the new TWLAS for a moving UD reaches CRLB, better than that of the conventional one-way TOA method, and the estimation error caused by the deviated UD velocity information is consistent with the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {The space-ground integrated network (SGIN) has attracted growing attention due to its advantages of high-capacity, low-latency and global coverage. To guarantee the security requirements of SGIN, anonymous authentication is an essential approach to addressing severe threats such as unauthorized access and impersonation attack, while payment is another common method in service-oriented applications in order to encourage companies to participate and also prevent insider attackers from enjoying services without paying. Existing anonymous authentication protocols for SGIN either require users to involve in heavy computation especially in dynamic scenarios, or do not consider cross-domain authentication. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of cross-company satellite services, and then address the cross-domain authentication and billing issues in SGIN, i.e., we propose a decentralized anonymous authentication scheme supporting fast handover and also achieve fairness for the billing procedures. To reduce the authentication delays, the authentication process is delegated from ground to satellites, such that users can arbitrarily switch the satellite networks belonging to different companies. Specifically, users can be anonymously authenticated by showing the knowledge of a secret bound with a randomized verifiable credential and connect to different satellite networks through a fast handover authentication protocol building on a blockchain. Even all companies collude, they cannot forge a valid identity credential and access records for a user. In addition, we provide a fair billing mechanism that can prevent malicious users and greedy satellite companies from manipulating the network accessing fees based on a well-designed smart contract. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient through security analysis and performance evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Due to the pervasive deployment of Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi-based human intrusion detection has attracted intensive attention in recent years. By analyzing temporal changes of signal caused by human movement, the existing solutions can achieve passive human intrusion detection. However, the detection of intrusion direction, from which the person intrudes the area of interests, is still a challenging task. Considering the influence of intrusion direction on the energy and spatial statistical distributions of multiple reflections, in this study, we propose WIDD, a Wi-Fi-based passive human intrusion direction detection system. Concretely, WIDD first extracts the angle of arrival (AoA) and amplitude distributions of the multipath signal and conducts the Jarque-Bera (JB) test to analyze the normality of the obtained distributions. A novel joint hypothesis testing algorithm is proposed to monitor changes in amplitude and AoA distributions of reflections and realize the human intrusion detection based on the analysis result. At last, it finds the reflection affected by the human intrusion most via the divergence evaluation and extracts the corresponding AoA to realize the intrusion direction detection. The comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that WIDD provides human intrusion direction detection accuracy of about 0.943 and 0.931, under the scenario where the transmitter and receiver are separated by the glass and brick wall, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions and shedding bright lights on ubiquitous human detection in practice.},

  abstract     = {The measurement of received signal strength (RSS) and channel state information (CSI) has been widely used in the research of device-free localization (DFL). However, DFL systems based on these systems usually require labour-intensive training to understand the impact of the target on the surrounding wireless signals to build the target location-related model or image. In addition, the fact that the RSS is susceptible to multipath interference and is not directly accessible to CSI directly limits its actual deployment. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of DFL based on time-of-flight measurements of ultra-wideband signals, and propose a fusion method for simultaneous localization of multiple targets based on the evaluation results. Specifically, we mesh the feasible region of the target and utilize the geometric filtering method to re-evaluate the filtered wireless links in combination with the real-time adaptive relaxation target model. Consequently, we introduce the clustering method and combine the category matching strategy to ensure that the algorithm has robust real-time multi-target perception ability. Extensive experiments conducted in the lobby, laboratory and office scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method plays an active role in more than 82% and can control the mean error within 0.6 m.},

  abstract     = {As the cost and technical difficulty of jamming devices continue to decrease, jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning service. Unfortunately, most conventional wireless positioning technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to inherent shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable anchor geometry. Thanks to their high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be a promising solution to the above challenges. Therefore, in this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming positioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations and double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links to perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, we first derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled, and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a promising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are disrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that it is fully compatible with existing user equipment terminals and positioning methods.},

  abstract     = {The combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an efficient solution to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of the wireless communication system. In this paper, a downlink multi-cluster NOMA network is considered, where each cluster is supported by one IRS. This paper aims to minimize the transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming, the power allocation and the phase shift of each IRS. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to be solved due to the coupled variables, i.e., the beamforming vector, the power allocation coefficient and the phase shift matrix. To address this non-convex problem, an alternating optimization based algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the primal problem is divided into two subproblems for beamforming optimization and phase shifting feasiblity, where the two subproblems are solved iteratively. Moreover, to guarantee the feasibility of the beamforming optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed to search the feasible initial points. To reduce the complexity, a simplified algorithm based on partial exhaustive search for this system model is also proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed alternating algorithm can yield a better performance gain than the partial exhaustive search algorithm, NOMA with random IRS phase shift scheme and OMA-IRS scheme.},

  abstract     = {A delay-Doppler robust spectrum sharing method is proposed for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and terrestrial systems by actively introducing the assistive slots (AS) in this work. With the aids of AS, the receiver in the UAV/terrestrial link can extract the delay-Doppler parameter of the signal, and hence further recover the desired signal. Inserting AS in frames introduces different possibilities of signals sampled at AS and non-AS points, and the UAV/terrestrial signal samples are differentiated from the compound signals by focusing on the energy gap among the samples. Since the signal sample differentiation and the delay-Doppler parameter extraction are receiver oriented, the effects of multipath and node mobility are included, and the signal recovery is free from the adverse impacts of delay and Doppler shifts. Analysis shows that although introducing AS is beneficial to recovering the UAV/terrestrial signal, the signal transmission efficiency suffers degradation. Therefore, the optimal AS ratio regarding the tradeoff between delay-Doppler parameter extraction accuracy and transmission efficiency is investigated. For the optimal AS ratio, the signal-to-interference ratio of the spectrum sharing system plays a key role under Rician/Rayleigh distributed terrestrial fading channels. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the traditional methods.},

The possible long term health effects related to the EMF radiation are still an open debate and requires attention. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel EMF-aware resource allocation scheme based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) and machine learning (ML) technologies for reducing the EMF exposure in the uplink of cellular systems. More specifically, we use the K-means approach (an unsupervised ML approach) to create clusters of users to be allocated together and to then strategically group and assign them on the subcarriers, based on their associated channel properties. Finding the best number of clusters in the PD-NOMA environment is a key challenge, and in this paper, we have used the elbow method in conjunction with the F-test method to effectively control the maximum number of users to be allocated at the same time per subcarrier. We have also derived an EMF-aware power allocation by formulating and solving a convex optimization problem. Based on the simulation results, our proposed ML-based strategy effectively reduces the EMF exposure, in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques.},

Based on this chart, an iterative edge selection algorithm combined with a theoretical simplification is proposed to facilitate the selection of independent masked edge sets (MESs) for varying u. To further decrease the complexity of the independent masking scheme, a nested version is presented, where the MESs for varying u are nested and derived from the same mother MES. Meanwhile, nested selection algorithms are provided to select the nested MESs. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the masked 5G-NR LDPC codes can maintain near-capacity performances regardless of the variation of u. Besides, these ULC masked codes achieve comparable performances with the state-of-the-art LDPC codes which are specially re-designed in a static GMAC.},

In this paper, a mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) based mobile crowd computing framework for ICV networks is proposed, where multiple vehicles act as workers to provide computing services for end user (EU). In particular, artificial noise (AN) assisted physical (PHY) layer security approaches are used to enhance the security in offloading links. Ergodic secrecy rates in different offloading phases in time-varying channels are derived. In addition, an incentive-driven mechanism is introduced to encourage workers to share their idle computing resources, and an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the overall price paid for computing tasks, subject to energy consumption and delay constraints.

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the prior works on OTFS have derived it from first principles. In this paper, using the ZAK representation of time-domain (TD) signals, we rigorously derive an orthonormal basis of approximately time and bandwidth limited signals which are also localized in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. We then consider DD domain modulation based on this orthonormal basis, and derive OTFS modulation. We show that irrespective of the amount of Doppler shift, the received DD domain basis signals are localized in a small interval of size roughly equal to the inverse time duration along the Doppler domain and of size roughly equal to the inverse bandwidth along the delay domain (time duration refers to the length of the time-interval where the TD transmit signal has been limited). With sufficiently large time duration and bandwidth, there is little interference between information symbols modulated on different basis signals, which allows for joint DD domain equalization of all information symbols. This explains the inherent robustness of DD domain modulation to channel induced Doppler shift when compared with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).},

Specifically, the DNN models, trained and pre-stored in the cloud, are properly placed at the end and edge to perform DNN inference. To achieve efficient DNN inference, a multi-dimensional resource management problem is formulated to maximize the average inference accuracy while satisfying the strict delay requirements of inference tasks. Due to the mix-integer decision variables, it is difficult to solve the formulated problem directly. Thus, we transform the formulated problem into a Markov decision process which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning based resource management scheme is proposed to make real-time optimal resource allocation decisions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can efficiently allocate the available spectrum, caching, and computing resources, and improve average inference accuracy by 31.4$\%$ compared with the deep deterministic policy gradient benchmark.},

  abstract     = {At present, in the suspension system of maglev train, the self-diagnosis of most of the components can be realized employing direct sensor measurement, however, there are still some components that cannot be directly measured by sensors or model-based methods, such as the power components in the suspension control box, electromagnetics and related connectors. And although the detection method based on Stable Kernel Representation (SKR) can detect the fault, the length of the data used for SKR affects the speed and results of the detection. To obtain better detection results with the shortest possible data, this paper studies a component-level fault detection method based on autocorrelation length and SKR. This method uses the autocorrelation length to determine the length of the data used to identify the SKR, and then applies the SKR to build a residual generator and set the residual threshold. The experimental results show that the studied method can detect faults of the suspension control box in real-time and effectively, and the simulation results show that the studied method can detect faults of the electromagnet in real-time and effectively. In addition, compared with the traditional method, the method in this paper can obtain better results with less data.},

  abstract     = {Fast chirp FMCW MIMO radar with inter-chirp coding provides high emission power by utilizing simultaneous antennas transmissions. However, the coding produces high side-lobes in the Doppler and angle dimensions of the radar&#39;s ambiguity function. The high side-lobes may cause miss-detection due to masking between targets that are at similar range and have large received power difference, as is often the case in automotive scenarios. In this paper, we develop a novel code optimization method that attenuates the side-lobes of the radar&#39;s ambiguity function and hence improves the probability of detection in the case of multiple targets. We formulate an analytical expression for the ambiguity function side-lobes, which takes into account that the targets range difference migrates during the detection interval, and that the migration is proportional to the targets Doppler frequency difference. We then develop an optimization algorithm that finds the code that minimizes the ambiguity function side-lobes average energy. The optimized code attenuates the ambiguity function side-lobes at the Doppler frequencies that are near the main lobe frequency. These frequencies correspond to targets with small speed difference, for which the range difference between the targets does not change significantly during the detection interval, and hence overlapping in range can cause severe interference. We demonstrate by simulation that the optimized code achieves an improvement in the ambiguity function side-lobes attenuation and an improvement in the probability of detection compared to reference codes.},

  abstract     = {All-electric ships (AES) are regarded as a promising solution for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions since they are able to utilize clean technologies like fuel cells instead of fossil fuel. A zero-emission hybrid energy system comprising the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell, battery, cold-ironing, and Recuperative organic Rankine cycle (RORC) is scrutinized in this paper. To use the waste heat produced by PEM fuel cells, a hybrid system which is composed of PEM fuel cells and RORC is suggested. In order to analyze this zero-emission all-electric ship, the real data of a ferry boat, containing the load profiles and routes is used to appraise the possibility of the suggested hybrid system. The structure of the boat and energy sources, along with mathematical models, are represented and examined. Eventually, the hourly energy management of the boat for one specific day is analyzed, and also, to optimize the power dispatch, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is applied in actor-critic architecture. To corroborate the proposed models, the MATLAB software is employed. According to obtained results, the proposed models could ensure effective and efficient ways in marine vessels due to not only their high performances but also permissible energy cost to be a zero-emission ship.},

Analysis based on mass data to detect slipping is of great significance for saving energy, improving the performance and safety of the traction control system of electric locomotives. Therefore, after analyzing and summarizing the advantages of Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Fuzzy Entropy (FE) algorithm in data processing and the classification theory of Support Vector Machine (SVM), this paper proposed a SVM slipping detection method based on EWT and FE algorithm. Firstly, feature extraction is carried out on the locomotive wheelset velocity data collected by the on-board velocity sensor, that is, the feature vector of data is extracted by calculating fuzzy entropy value after EWT, and the velocity data is converted into feature matrix for slipping-detection of SVM. Then considering the defects of traditional optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the parameter optimization of SVM, Genetic Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (GAPSO) is proposed to optimize the parameters of SVM classification model, and the slipping detection model of SVM is established through training samples, which realizes high-precision slipping detection. Finally, combined with a large number of locomotive data, the comparative analysis test is carried out, the results show that the feature extraction method based on EWT and FE algorithm has excellent ability of mode decomposition and feature extraction, GAPSO has efficient optimization ability, and the proposed slipping detection method can accurately detect slipping.},

This paper gives a unique empirical insight into the long-term effects on batteries performing an energy demanding V2G service. To this end, an extensive method for measuring the battery capacity of series produced electric vehicles (EVs) via the DC charge port was developed. The reproducibility of the method is demonstrated with repeated tests on new and aged vehicles and the results are compared with the EVs internal estimates, read via the on-board diagnostics port. The method is also validated with a state-of-the-art battery degradation model. The capacity test method is used to evaluate the battery degradation of a fleet of commercially owned EVs which, as a part of the world&#39;s first commercial operation, have been used for V2G services for five years. The EVs have, together with ±10 kW V2G chargers, been delivering primary frequency regulation for 15 hours per day with a daily energy throughput of 50.6 kWh. The usable battery capacity, initially found to be 23 kWh, after two years is reduced on average to 20.7 kWh and after five years is reduced to 18.9 kWh.},

This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to realize YSC in the nonlinear region. Firstly, a T-S fuzzy model of vehicle is established based on a two-degree-of-freedom model to describe the vehicle dynamic characteristics in the nonlinear region. Then, a robust MPC is designed and its solution is given in the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) form. Next, a sliding mode controller (SMC) is proposed to prevent wheel lock in the YSC process. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified in simulations and experiments. The results show that the proposed strategy has similar performance in vehicle stable region with linear MPC, and shows the ability to suppress the instability of the vehicle in the nonlinear region, and its computation burden is acceptable.},

The system requires no prior knowledge of or modifications to the trailer, is compatible with planar and non-planar trailer shapes, and with multiply-articulated vehicle combinations. The system is validated in full-scale vehicle tests on both a tractor semi-trailer combination and a truck and full-trailer combination, demonstrating robust performance in a number of conditions, including trailers with non-planar geometry and with minimal visual features. Average RMS measurement errors of 1.19, 1.03 and 1.53 degrees were demonstrated for the semi-trailer and full-trailer (drawbar and semi-trailer) respectively. This compares favourably with the state-of-the-art in the published literature. A number of improvements are proposed for future development based on the observations in this research.},

However, the lack of guideline rules makes the selection process of the passive components and operation mode difficult. This paper presents an iterative design methodology based on the equivalent mathematical model of the system to determine the optimal magnetic coupler (MC) dimensions and resonant tanks parameters that operates the system in a quasi constant current mode. It was found that the transconductance function of a series-series (SS) with an intermediate coupler exhibits a quasi-load independent characteristic when the reflected reactance from the receiver side is null. The design methodology then combines the self and mutual coupling profiles of the MC, obtained from a finite element analysis (FEA) tool, with the system specifications and constraints to find all possible solutions. A set of selection metrics are proposed to identify the optimal solution. This work also presents an identification method of the load and mutual inductances based only in the information available from the transmitter side. The proposed method uses the steady-state equations and does not require any form of communication to the receiver side. An experimental prototype was built and assembled in a converted combustion vehicle with efficiency of 89$%.},

In this paper, we propose a pedestrian trajectory prediction approach that utilizes pedestrian appearance as well as historical locations and camera ego-motion to predict future trajectories of pedestrians for vehicles. The proposed model consists of three encoders and a decoder, namely: appearance encoder, location encoder, and ego-motion encoder; and a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) decoder. The appearance encoder employs an embedding Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) to encode pedestrian appearance. A disparity-guided attention mechanism is designed in the appearance encoder to attend to salient dynamic regions in pedestrian appearance. The location encoder and ego-motion encoder employ LSTMs to encode pedestrian historical locations and camera ego-motion. The outputs of all three encoders are concatenated as a representation of input information, which is decoded by the decoder to finally generate the future trajectories of observed pedestrians. We evaluated the proposed model on two public datasets with several baselines and the results showed improvement of about 20% compared with the baselines. We also visualized the predicted trajectories and heat maps generated by disparity-guided attention. Both the visualization and quantitative results validated that our proposed model outperforms the baselines on predicting accuracy and that the model is feasible to capture salient spatiotemporal regions in pedestrian appearance.},

  abstract     = {Drones have a wide range of applications in urban environments as they can both enhance people&#39;s daily activities and commercial activities through various operations and deployments. With the increasing number of drones, flight safety and efficiency become the main concern, and effective drone operations can make a difference. Accordingly, 4D path planning for drone operations is the focus of this paper, and the swarm-based method is proposed to solve this complicated optimization problem. Under the framework of `AirMatrix&#39;, the problem is solved in two levels, i.e., 3D path planning for a single drone and conflict resolution among drones. In the multi-path planning level, multiple alternative flight paths for each drone are generated to increase the acceptance rate of a flight request. The constraints on a single flight path and two different flight paths are considered. The goal is to obtain several different short flight paths as alternatives. A clustering improved ant colony optimization CIACO) algorithm is employed to solve the multi-path planning problem. The crowding mechanism is used in clustering, and some improvements are made to strengthen the global and local search ability in the early and later phases of iterations. In the task scheduling level, the conflicts between two drones are defined in two circumstances. One is for the time interval of passing the same path point, another one is for the right-angle collision between two drones. A three-layer fitness function is proposed to maximize the number of permitted flights according to the safety requirement, in which the airspace utilization and the operators&#39; requests are both considered. A `cross-off&#39; strategy is developed to calculate the fitness value, and a `distributed-centralized&#39; strategy is applied considering the task priorities of drones. A genetic algorithm GA)-based task scheduling algorithm is also developed according to the characteristic of the established model. Simulation results demonstrate that 4D flight path of each drone can be generated by the proposed swarmed-based algorithms, and safe and efficient drone operations in a specific airspace can be ensured.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular social networks (VSNs) are considered as an emerging class of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) with social attributes. In contrast to the traditional randomly distributed human social networks, vehicles normally only move along fıxed paths. As such, information sharing and forwarding become challenging because of the high speed of vehicles, complicated propagation environment, and quickly changing network topologies. The social characteristics and human behavior features are used to improve the effıciency of information delivery among vehicles in VANETs. In this paper, we propose a dynamic periodic location encounter network (DPLEN) model that considering both time-varying and location-varying characteristics of vehicles. We calculate the line similarity for each encountered pair of vehicles based on the periodic time and location information of the encounter event, and analyze social attributes based on the network model, such as the Community structure, Betweenness Centrality and K-shell. We also use the similarity to design two routing protocols for unicast and multicast patterns. After testing the proposed model on empirically collected datasets of mobility traces, the results show that these two routing protocols are able to greatly improve the efficiency of information forwarding in the VSNs.},

  abstract     = {With the recent technological innovation, unmanned aerial vehicles, known as drones, have found numerous applications including package and parcel delivery for shippers. Drone delivery offers benefits over conventional ground-based vehicle delivery in terms of faster speed, lower cost, more environment-friendly, and less manpower needed. However, most of existing studies on drone delivery planning and scheduling focus on a single shipper and ignore uncertainty factors. As such, in this paper, we consider a scenario that multiple shippers can cooperate to minimize their drone delivery cost. We propose the Bayesian Shipper Cooperation in Stochastic Drone Delivery (BCoSDD) framework. The framework is composed of three functions, i.e., package assignment, shipper cooperation formation and cost management. The uncertainties of drone breakdown and misbehavior of cooperative shippers are taken into account by using multistage stochastic programming optimization and dynamic Bayesian coalition formation game. We conduct extensive performance evaluation of the BCoSDD framework by using customer locations from Solomon benchmark suite and a real Singapore logistics industry. As a result, the framework can help the shippers plan and schedule their drone delivery effectively.},

  abstract     = {The adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) problem can be modeled as a multiagent cooperative game among urban intersections, where intersections cooperate to counter the city&#39;s traffic conditions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved marked successes in managing sequential decision making problems, which motivates us to apply RL in the ATSC problem. One of the largest challenges of this problem is that the observation of intersection is typically partially observable, which limits the learning performance of RL algorithms. Considering the large scale of intersections in an urban traffic environment, we use independent RL to solve ATSC problem in this study. We model ATSC problem as a partially observable weak cooperative traffic model (PO-WCTM). Different from a traditional IRL task that averages the returns of all agents in fully cooperative games, the learning goal of each intersection in PO-WCTM is to reduce the cooperative difficulty of learning, which is also consistent with the traffic environment hypothesis. To achieve the optimal cooperative strategy of PO-WCTM, we propose an IRL algorithm called Cooperative Important Lenient Double DQN (CIL-DDQN), which extends Double DQN (DDQN) algorithm using two mechanisms: the forgetful experience mechanism and the lenient weight training mechanism. The former mechanism decreases the importance of experiences stored in the experience reply buffers, while the latter mechanism increases the weight experiences with high estimation and `leniently&#39; trains the DDQN neural network. Experiments in two real traffic scenarios and one simulated traffic scenarios show that, CIL-DDQN outperforms other methods in almost all performance indicators of ATSC.},

  abstract     = {Online Ride-Hailing(ORH) service enables riders to enjoy on-demand transportation service with mobile devices. Despite the convenience of the service, privacy leakage could be caused because riders need to submit their locations during ride matching. To protect users&#39; privacy, much effort has been done to construct a privacy-enhanced ORH system in recent years. However, almost all of current privacy-preserving schemes match the nearest driver to the requesting rider, it is not the optimal matching strategy and unnecessary waste of travel distance may be caused in this way. To solve the problem, we propose a privacy-preserving ORH scheme named pRide, which minimizes the overall travel distance by matching the best driver in global perspective instead of the nearest driver in the local region. To find the best driver, we utilize a deep learning model to predict emergence of ride requests in various regions, and enables the ORH server to perform ride matching leveraging prediction results. Based on the framework, we also propose optimizations to enhance pRide. Moreover, to further defend inference attacks from riders, we propose a private comparing algorithm at the cost of a little communication overhead. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we prove that pRide is able to decrease the overall travel distance securely and efficiently in ORH matching scenarios.},

To address this issue, we propose a hierarchically structured human-&lt;;bold/&gt;centered TVC (HCTVC) for distributed drive electric vehicles (EVs). To do this we design the experiment to characterize the drivers&#39; behavior with different skills. Then a global objective function is formulated considering the driver&#39;s physical and mental workload, as well as the agility and stability of the vehicle, to optimize the overall performance of the driver-vehicle system. Next, an adaptive second-order sliding mode controller (ASOSM) based on the backstepping method is designed as the upper-level controller to improve system robustness. Finally, a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the weight self-tuning strategy is developed as the lower-level controller to solve the torque distribution problem. We further obtain the analytical solution to this optimization problem. Experimental results on the asphalt and icy roads confirm that the proposed HCTVC significantly enhances the vehicle transient response and reduces the driver&#39;s workload.},

  abstract     = {Aiming to shed light on the operation of fully-digital transmitters, we present the first symbol-rate baseband model that makes explicit the inter-symbol interference introduced by the RF pulse-width modulation (RF-PWM). The proposed model expresses the transmitter output as symbols plus interference, paving the way for the derivation of in-band performance metrics of the communication system. Then, we find an approximation for the error vector magnitude that allows us to evaluate the impact of the oversampling ratio, the statistics of the transmitted symbols and the shaping pulse in the transmitter performance. Another advantage of the model is that simulation times are much shorter since it does not require interpolation to appreciate the PWM distortion. To obtain the model, we first assume a generic expression of the continuous-time signal to be transmitted, in terms of the information symbols and the reconstruction filter. This allows us to express the nonlinear differential equation that models the intrinsic distortion also in terms of the sent symbols. Then, we elaborate on the formulation of the continuous-time RF-PWM distortion to procure an expression of the received signal sampled at symbol rate. The article concludes with a numerical validation of the model, and a simulation of the bit error rate of the system.},

  abstract     = {A technique of decoupling dielectric stubs (DDS) is proposed for mutual coupling reduction of wideband, dual-polarized, and large-scale antenna arrays in this paper, where a low dielectric constant DDS is mounting on a dual-polarized and wideband antenna array seamlessly. The decoupling mechanism of the proposed DDS is qualitatively explained. By properly optimizing the dielectric constant and dimensions of the dielectric stubs, the DDS can reduce the mutual couplings between array elements efficiently. The dielectric stubs are considered as perturbations to slightly localize the electromagnetic fields emitted from the antenna element to lower the space wave coupling. The advantages of the proposed decoupling technique are wideband, low cost, high efficiency, and suitable for large-scale antenna arrays. For demonstration, 4 × 4 dual-polarized and wideband antenna arrays with and without the DDS are simulated, measured, and compared. The simulated results show that the antenna array with the DDS can achieve all port-to-port isolations over 25 dB from 4.4 to 5.0 GHz for all the coupling paths, which are 7 dB higher than the counterparts without the DDS. Moreover, the total efficiencies of the antenna elements with the proposed DDS are also improved. The measured results agree well with the simulated, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method of DDS for decoupling of large-scale antenna arrays.},

The proposed techniques are based on two design criterion, the first being, minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimate at the FC subject to total network power or individual sensor power constraints. Second, minimizing the total power consumption in the network while meeting a predefined level of MSE performance. Furthermore, the framework for precoder and combiner optimization is based on results from majorization theory, which leads to non-iterative closed-form solutions for the transceivers.

First, extensive radar measurements of the backscattering power are carried out with the in-house assembled millimeter-wave radar equipment. Next, the measured data is employed to calibrate an accurate analytical model, deduced and described in this paper. Finally, the analytical models are deployed to define the optimal parameters of the radar scheme in the particular geometry of the selected intersection scenario. Specifically, it is found that the optimal angular orientation of the reflector is 43.5 ° , while the 20 m curvature radius shows better performance compared to a flat reflector. Specifically, the curved convex shape increases scattering power by 20 dB in the shadow region and, thus, improves the detection probability of the vehicle, approaching the blind intersection.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes on-driving experience sharing algorithms at junctions in infrastructure-assisted vehicles-to-everything networks. For the purpose, a millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is used because it provides multi-Gbps data rates which is helpful for handling users’ short stay times at junctions and spatial reuse due to high beam directionality which is helpful for interference-avoidance among densely deployed vehicles at junctions. To realize on-driving experience sharing, the proposed algorithms focus on joint resource allocation and scheduling for 3GPP-compliant multiple unicast vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications where the vehicles are group leaders (GLs) in 3GPP Mode 4(d). The resource allocation stands for the roadside unit (RSU) allocation to scheduled V2V GL links where RSU is essentially required for overcoming blockage by establishing two-hop relaying. Because vehicles stay for short times at junctions, this paper designs two algorithms without or with delay considerations. Without delay considerations, the joint optimization of RSU allocation and scheduling was originally formulated as mixed 0-1 non-convex optimization. However our proposed algorithm reformulates the problem into mixed 0-1 convex optimization, which is computationally easier to solve. With delay considerations, our proposed algorithm dynamically controls video contents frame rates for time-average on-driving video sharing quality maximization subject to delay constraints, inspired by Lyapunov optimization. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms can significantly outperform in a variety of scenarios. Furthermore, we conduct the cost analysis for the proposed algorithms in terms of capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX).},

  abstract     = {Recently, a novel machine learning technique, federated learning, attracts ever-increasing interests from academia to industry. The main idea of federated learning is to collaboratively train a global optimal machine learning model among all the participants. During the process of parameter updating, the communication cost of the system or network can be extremely huge with a large number of iterations and participants. Although the edge computing paradigm can decrease the latency to a certain extent, how to obtain further delay reduction is still a challenge. Therefore, to address the problem, we firstly model the corresponding problem into a finite-sum optimization problem. Then, we propose a federated stochastic variance reduced gradient based method to decrease the number of iterations between the participants and server from the system perspective, and guarantee the accuracy at the same time. Meanwhile, the corresponding convergence analysis is provided. Finally, we test our proposed method on the linear regression problem and the logistic regression problem. The simulation results show that our proposed method can reduce the communication cost significantly compared with general stochastic gradient descent based federated learning.},

  abstract     = {Network economics play an important role in managing quality of service (QoS) for wireless networks as well as in managing the unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic. By employing appropriate pricing strategies, wireless service providers (WSPs) can provide incentives to users to allow the best match between user needs and WSP offerings with the objective of maximizing both operator revenue and customer social welfare. We propose a dynamic and fair (D&amp;F) pricing strategy in which users are charged based on both the quantity of data consumed as well as the achieved QoS. The D&amp;F pricing strategy allows users to dynamically increase or decrease the quantity and quality of data consumed over the network. Since users pay based on their achieved quality, as opposed to the quality they requested in their subscription, they are fairly charged even during congestion. We present (a) an economic analysis for illustrating the pricing dynamics between users and WSPs and (b) a game-theoretic analysis between competing WSPs, to illustrate how the D&amp;F pricing strategy can produce increased overall revenue.},

  abstract     = {A substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) H-plane horn antenna with miniaturized longitudinal dimension and increased gain is proposed by loading slow-wave (SW) structures in the form of metallized blind via-holes inside the flare region of the horn for vehicular millimeter wave communications. The slow-wave structure can reduce the phase velocity around the center line of the broad wall and compensate the large phase difference between the center and edge of the aperture caused by reduction of longitudinal length of the horn. Compared with optimum horn with the same aperture width, the gain of miniaturized SIW horn is successfully increased, while the longitudinal dimension is decreased. A SW-SIW horn antenna which covers the 28 GHz band (27.5–28.35 GHz) allocated by Federal Communications Commission for the 5G millimeter wave communications is designed to verify the feasibility of the miniaturized SIW horn antenna facilitated by the proposed slow-wave structure. The SW-SIW horn realizes 53.83% reduction of longitudinal length compared with the optimum horn. The gain of the SW-SIW horn is improved by 1.1 dB on average over 27.5–28.5 GHz compared with optimum horn. A prototype of the proposed SW-SIW H-plane horn antenna is manufactured and measured.

In this paper, a promising technique named intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is proposed to help alleviate blockages and provide alternative line-of-sight links. To maximize the achievable rate of the IRS-assisted OAM communication systems, we optimize its transmit power allocation along with the IRS&#39;s reflecting phase shifts, and propose an alternative optimization-based algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem with coupled variables and non-convex structure.

Motivated by the potential of RIS in vehicular networks, we analyze the secrecy outage performance of RIS-aided vehicular communications in this paper. More specifically, two vehicular communication scenarios are considered, i.e., a vehicular-to-vehicular (V2V) communication where the RIS acts as a relay and a vehicular-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario where the RIS functions as the receiver. In both scenarios, a passive eavesdropper is present attempting to retrieve the transmitted information. Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived and verified.

  abstract     = {Antenna selection (AS) is a signal processing technology that can greatly reduce the hardware complexity of multi-antenna systems. Specifically, AS can decrease the number of required radio frequency chains by activating only a subset of the available antennas in each transmission slot. However, optimal AS suffers from a high computational complexity that increases exponentially with the scale of the antenna array. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity AS algorithm based on multi-label learning (MLL), where a deep neural network is employed to determine the set of selected antennas for a given channel matrix. Specifically, the MLL network combines deep canonical correlation analysis and an autoencoder in a unified network structure, which can extract the low dimensional features of channel matrix as well as the interdependency among selected antennas, so as to achieve an accurate prediction of the set of selected antennas with a relatively small-scale learning model. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the convex relaxation based method, our proposed MLL-based method can achieve comparable capacity with significantly reduced computation time.},

However, for the OAM demultiplexing, it requires a very large aperture size in the receiving end due to the OAM beam divergence and the amplitude null in the beam center, which restricts the full development of OAM based communication. In this paper, we propose a novel partial arc sampling receiving (PASR) scheme based on the augmented dynamic mode decomposition (ADMD) to solve this issue. We explore the use of the phase delay coordinates in the conventional DMD to sort the arbitrary OAM modes with arc sampling receiving. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach in sorting both integral and fractional OAM modes with the PASR scheme.

To this end, we investigate the SAR-aware uplink precoder design for the energy efficiency (EE) maximization in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission exploiting statistical channel state information (CSI). As the objective function of the design problem is computationally demanding in the absence of closed form, we present an asymptotic approximation of the objective to facilitate the precoder design. An iterative algorithm based on Dinkelbach&#39;s method and sequential optimization is proposed to obtain an optimal solution of the asymptotic EE optimization problem. Based on the transformed problem, an iterative SAR-aware water-filing scheme is further conceived for the EE optimization precoding design with statistical CSI. Numerical results illustrate substantial performance improvements provided by our proposed SAR-aware energy-efficient transmission scheme over the traditional baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with lens antenna array, referred to as beamspace MIMO, is attractive for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, since it can realize the adequate beamforming gain with a small number of radio frequency (RF) chains. This paper addresses wideband channel estimation for mmWave beamspace MIMO. Specifically, a two-stage channel estimation scheme is proposed. In the first stage, we utilize multi-task sparse Bayesian learning (MT-SBL) to coarsely estimate the beamspace channel vectors, each corresponding to one OFDM subcarrier. In the second stage, we re-formulate the channel estimation problem by artfully exploiting the characteristics of beamspace channels. Then we develop an expectation maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the parameters involved in the formulation, thereby refining the channel estimates. Compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts, the proposed scheme can achieve much better performance while requiring a lower training overhead.},

  abstract     = {Since the intra-group co-channel interference is introduced intentionally by the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, the reliability of NOMA based networks is limited by far users, while the sum-rate is mainly contributed by near users. In this paper, a NOMA based multiband scheduling policy is proposed to overcome this problem. Unlike conventional NOMA where all users are served in a single frequency band, the proposed scheme divides the entire band into multiple sub-bands, and accommodates the near and far users in different manners by exploring the sub-bands. Particularly, the far users employ repetition-based transmission in all sub-bands, and the maximum ratio combination (MRC) is integrated with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to jointly decode their intended symbols. Closed-form expression of the achievable sum-rate of the proposed scheme is derived, and the outage performance is characterized by the derived upper-bounded outage probability. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme enables NOMA systems to achieve both high reliability and high sum-rate.},

In this article, we propose a novel hybrid signal detection algorithm for OTFS modulation. Based on the system model, we first derive the near-optimal symbol-wise maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection algorithm for OTFS modulation. Then, in order to reduce the detection complexity, we propose a partitioning rule that separates the related received symbols into two subsets for detecting each transmitted symbol, according to the corresponding path gains. According to the partitioning rule, we design the hybrid detection algorithm to exploit the power discrepancy of each subset, where the MAP detection is applied to the subset with larger channel gains, while the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) detection is applied to the subset with smaller channel gains. We also provide the error performance analysis of the proposed hybrid detection algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid detection algorithm can not only approach the performance of the near-optimal symbol-wise MAP algorithms, but also offer a substantial performance gain compared with existing algorithms.},

Concretely, the message passing algorithm is first used to acquire the hard decision of transmit signal, along with the corresponding reliability. Then, an efficient method to determine the reliable observations of clipping noise is presented by utilizing the reliable hard decision signals and the sparsity of the equivalent delay-Doppler channel. Finally, from these reliable observations, the clipping noise can be recovered by CS techniques through utilizing its sparsity in the time-domain.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied for classification tasks in wireless communications such as link scheduling, user association and base station (BS) muting. When training a DNN using datasets with highly-skewed class distribution where most data belong to a few majority classes, learning performance for minority classes will degrade since the imbalanced data forces the training process to be biased towards the majority classes. In many wireless problems, multiple decisions for classification are made jointly, say deciding which BSs in a network should be muted to avoid interference. In this paper, we employ DNN to learn an optimal predictive interference coordination policy, and strive to avoid biased learning in such a multi-label multi-class classification problem. The major contribution is proposing a training method to encourage fairness among classes by minimizing the maximal cost of decisions among classes, which is converted into a problem to optimize the weighting factors on the training cost of each class. We provide a gradient descent algorithm to optimize the weighting factors and the model parameters of the DNN by alternative updates. Simulation results show that the training method can improve the learning performance for the minority class and can achieve higher network utility than existing training methods.},

To protect the privacy of the interests and locations, both requesters and workers prefer to encrypt the information before uploading them to the server. However, such an encryption-before-outsourcing paradigm makes it a challenging issue to conduct the task matching. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Task Matching (PPTM) with threshold similarity search via vehicular crowdsourcing. We first propose an interest-based PPTM by transforming vehicular workers&#39; interests into binary vectors. By using Symmetric-key Threshold Predicate Encryption (STPE) and proxy re-encryption, PPTM achieves privacy-preserving multi-keyword task matching with Jaccard similarity search in multi-worker multi-requester setting. Furthermore, by comparing the Euclidean distances between workers and requesters against a pre-defined threshold, PPTM preserves the location privacy of workers and requesters that only reveals the comparison results to the crowdsourcing server. The security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that PPTM protects the confidentiality of locations and interests of requesters and workers while achieving the efficient task matching.},

Due to these requirements, the privacy of road users is at threat. Thus, preserving it is highly important as it is directly related to their safety. If a specific user is targeted on the road by an attacker who knows his/her identity and real-time location, the consequences can vary from simple stalking to assassination. This paper proposes a new solution called Concerted Silence-based Location Privacy Preserving Scheme for Internet of Vehicles (CSLPPS) that ensures the anonymous and unlinkable participation in the IoV location-based services and vehicular networks safety applications. This scheme relies on the synchronization of the identifier change between the cooperative vehicles to enter a silent period simultaneously before continuing their cyber-activity with new identifiers.

Our objective is to optimize the UAV control for maximizing the UAV.s energy efficiency, in which both aerodynamic energy and communication energy are considered while ensuring the communication requirements for each GT and backhaul link between the UAV and the terrestrial BS. The mobility of the UAV and GTs lead to time-varying channel conditions that make the environment dynamic. We formulate a nonconvex optimization for controlling the UAV considering the practical angle-dependent Rician fading channels between the UAV and GTs, and between the UAV and the terrestrial BS. Traditional optimization approaches are not able to handle the dynamic environment and high complexity of the problem in real-time. We propose to use a deep reinforcement learning-based approach namely Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to solve the formulated nonconvex problem of UAV control with continuous action space that takes into account the real-time of the environment including time-varying UAV-ground channel conditions, available onboard energy of the UAV, and the communication requirement of the GTs. However, the DDPG method may not achieve good performance in an unstable environment and will face a large number of hyperparameters. We extend our approach to use the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) method that can improve the performance of the UAV compared to the DDPG method in such a dynamic environment.},

  abstract     = {Through offloading tasks to surrounding edge nodes, the edge-assistant vehicular network (EAVN) could provide faster and more efficient services. To promote the deployment of EAVN, we need a reasonable resource allocation scheme. Nowadays, there are few auction mechanisms in EAVN scenario. Moreover, the auction mechanism in other edge computing scenario has following limitations. Firstly, current works only focus on the static/offline auction and do not consider that users will join and leave the auction system at any time in EAVN. Secondly, current works that determine the winning buyers/sellers only based on the price do not consider the unique attributes of EAVN, such as poor communication quality and various task demands. We design an online auction scheme for EAVN, which could satisfy the dynamics of users in the auction system. Moreover, the proposed auction mechanism also considers the non-price attributes, such as location, reputation, and computing ability, when constructing the matching between buyers and sellers. To verify our work, we simulate EAVN using a vehicular network simulator. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism could meet the properties of computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness.},

  abstract     = {Billions of mobile sensing devices in Internet of Things (IoT) collect data from surrounding environment in which the Medium Access protocol is employed. Quorum-based protocols are most important medium access control protocol (MAC) for wake-up based devices. However, existing quorum-based protocols cannot achieve both low latency and long lifetime at the same time. In this paper, a novel Element Shift Quorum (ESQ) based MAC is proposed in the sensor based systems. Data transmission is usually launched from the periphery of the network through multi hop routing to the data collector (DC), thus the data operation time of devices are different based on the distance from the DC. In the ESQ protocol, the Quorum time slot (QTS) of sensing devices is scheduled in the time when the devices just have data to process, then the latency and energy consumption can be reduced. In this way, sufficient QTS are allocated for nodes when data operation is needed, and nodes can stay at sleeping state when no data forwarding is required, thus enhancing the energy efficiency and lowering the network delay. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that, the lifetime is increased by 16% using the proposed method. Meanwhile, the latency is reduced by a factor between 9.08%-29.32%.},

Using drone-small-cells (DSCs) as aerial support for terrestrial base stations can enhance the flexibility for resource provisioning in response to traffic distribution variations. In this paper, we study a multi-DSC-assisted radio resource slicing problem for 5G uplink RANs, with the objective of minimizing the total uplink resource consumption under differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for both human-type and machine-type communication services. We begin with an interference-aware graph model to formulate the joint DSC three-dimension (3D) placement and device-DSC association problem for uplink radio resource slicing and prove that the proposed problem is NP-hard. A complexity-adjustable problem approximation is presented via screening candidate DSC deployment positions, which incorporates flight height adaptation to balance the uplink communication coverage and resource utilization. A lightweight approximation using a fixed DSC flight altitude is also provided with reduced complexity. For mathematical traceability, the DSC placement and device-DSC associations in each approximation are transformed as a special weight clique problem. An upgraded clique algorithm is then developed to determine how to deploy DSCs for a given number of DSCs. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme&#39;s effectiveness in terms of resource utilization, network coverage, and drone dispatching cost.},

Multiple mini autonomous UAVs require communication and coordination for ubiquitous coverage and relaying during deployment. Multi-UAV coordination or swarm optimization is required for reliable connectivity among UAVs, due to its high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, a Secured UAV (S-UAV) model is proposed which takes the location of the UAVs as inputs to form a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) among multiple drones with the help of a centralized controller. After WMN formation, efficient communication takes place using A* search, an intelligent algorithm that finds the shortest communication path among UAVs. Further, the S-UAV model utilizes cryptographic techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Blowfish to overcome the security attacks efficiently. Simulation results show that the S-UAV model offers higher throughput, reduced power consumption and guaranteed message transmission with reduced encryption and decryption time.},

  abstract     = {The energy detection technology is recommended in the licensed assisted access (LAA) scheme by 3GPP because of its simplicity and low cost. However, due to its inherent limitation, there may exist imperfect channel detection, which can lead to the decrease of the channel utilization efficiency and the deterioration of fairness. The imperfect detection can generally be represented by the detection probability and false alarm probability, which depend on detection time, signal to noise ration (SNR), sampling rate and energy threshold. However, among the parameters, only the energy threshold can be dominated by LAA small base stations (SBSs) in the LAA scheme. Therefore, the energy threshold should be dynamically adjusted in the changeable channel environment such that the detection accuracy can improved as high as possible. Consider the fact that the optimization theory cannot be used to optimize the energy threshold since the expressions of performance indexes about the energy threshold are extremely complex, a Q-learning based energy threshold optimization algorithm (QLET) is thus proposed in the paper, where LAA SBSs act as the agent, the energy threshold is defined as the agent action, the different combinations of fairness and throughput are defined as the agent states, and the fairness and the reward function are also redefined. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the proposed QLET algorithm, the information exchange mechanism, where the sending-confirmation mechanism and 1- persistent CSMA are used, is also proposed. Based on the proposed QL framework, the agent can learn the optimal energy threshold by repeatedly interacting with the environment, which enables the coexistence system to obtain the best coexistence performance. A large number of simulation results show that the proposed QLET is superior to the traditional fixed energy threshold scheme (FET) in terms of the fairness, WiFi collision probability and transmission delay, and that QLET is almost the same as FET in term of throughput.},

However, current solutions still cannot satisfy multiple performance requirements of such networks. In this article, we propose a priority ladders-based resource scheduling (PLRS) scheme to meet these demands. First, we design a multiple-level priority division approach, which is based on health parameters and data types of patients. Unlike only two priorities of nodes in other schemes, there are four priorities in our solution. This is more practical and more fair for different nodes. Moreover, we devise a ladders-based time-slot allocation method, in which time slots of nodes are increased round by round based on the priority ladders of nodes. This reduces the difference of the number of time slots between disparate nodes with close priorities, and accordingly enhances the fairness of nodes. In addition, we design an interval-based task ordering approach, in which nodes use the allocated time slots in dispersed multiple intervals rather than a continuous time span in conventional solutions. This guarantees high throughput of high-priority nodes and short waiting time of emergency data. Extensive simulations exhibit the advantages of PLRS in terms of energy overhead, delay, and utility.},

Vehicles in a platoon need timely delivery of road-safety information in order to alter their speeds in time and thus maintain the stability of the platoon. The intra-platoon message delivery delay is a critical metric that has a big impact on the maintenance of a platoon&#39;s stability. It depends on several system parameters, such as the number of vehicles in a platoon, the intra-platoon spacing, and the distribution of non-platoon vehicles. This paper studies the analysis of the intra-platoon message delivery delay in a platoon of CAVs moving on a highway road. A theoretical analytical model is derived to investigate the impacts of major system parameters on the intra-platoon message delivery delay. The derived analytical model considers a V2V hop-by-hop communication mode and takes into account the effects of both platoon and non-platoon vehicle nodes on channel access contention. The effect of hidden vehicle nodes is also considered. The derived analytical model is validated through simulation results and the impacts of major system parameters on the intra-platoon message delivery delay are investigated through numerical results. The derived analytical model can be used to provide reasonable reference values for system parameter setting in order to maintain the stability of an autonomous-driving platoon.},

  abstract     = {This study elucidates a reinforcement learning (RL)-based detection with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in time-varying massive multiple-input and multiple-output channels. In one-bit ADCs, conventional channel estimation exhibits poor performance owing to nonlinear quantization. The RL-based detection alleviates this degradation by learning the true likelihood probability during data transmission. However, in time-varying channels, the learned likelihood probability is inconsistent with the true likelihood probability due to temporal channel variations. This inconsistency can cause severe performance degradation. To effectively exploit the learned likelihood probability, we propose a training length adaptation method that determines an appropriate training length based on the channel conditions. To achieve this, we consider an optimization problem that minimizes the training length while guaranteeing the performance of RL-based detection. The solution of the optimization problem is obtained by an explicit form based on simple approximations, and it reveals that the optimal training length depends on the change in the likelihood probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently reduces the training length when a rapid change in likelihood probability is produced in fading channels. Moreover, this reduction contributes to improving the spectral efficiency by an avoiding undesirable learning process. Consequently, the spectral efficiency of the proposed method can be significantly increased compared to that of conventional RL-based detection. For instance, the proposed method achieves 1.76 times higher spectral efficiency than the conventional method at 30 km/h.},

Toward this end, a multiple measurement vector (MMV) sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based SIP (M-SIP) technique is initially derived to exploit the simultaneous-sparsity of the beamspace channel vector across the subcarriers, thereby leading to improved performance in comparison to the existing single measurement vector (SMV)-based SBL and other techniques. This is subsequently extended to the data-aided J-SIP technique that performs joint channel estimation and data detection, and is shown to ultimately yield a better mean squared error (MSE) of the channel estimate and bit error-rate (BER). The SIP-based simultaneous-sparse channel estimation framework is extended to time-selective wideband, i.e. doubly-selective mmWave MIMO channels, via the MMV sparse Kalman filtering-based SIP (MK-SIP) technique for tracking the CSI, and subsequently also to the joint Kalman filtering-based SIP (JK-SIP) for data-aided CSI acquisition. Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds are determined both for quasistatic and doubly-selective mmWave MIMO-OFDM channel estimation. Simulation results, which also incorporate practical channel realizations, are provided to demonstrate performance improvement considering various metrics, such as MSE and BER.},

  abstract     = {The tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) provides a new perspective for the transmit design in satellite communications (SATCOM), i.e., one can jointly optimize the system EE and SE of the SATCOM system. In addition, jointly considering that it is challenging to obtain accurate channel state information at the transmitter, we study the tradeoff between EE and SE for the robust beamforming in multi-beam SATCOM in this paper. Specifically, with the quality of service and total power constraints taken into account, we study the robust beamforming aimed at maximizing the resource efficiency, which is defined as the weighted sum of the system EE and SE, to achieve the tradeoff between EE and SE with more flexibility. For this problem, we first approximate the ergodic user rate and ergodic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, both with closed forms. Then, the semidefinite relaxation is applied to tackle the optimization of beamforming vectors via relaxing the rank constraints. To handle the sum of fractions involved in the optimization objective, a nested iterative algorithm exploiting the quadratic transformation and majorization-minimization method is proposed. Finally, the eigenvalue decomposition is utilized to obtain the beamformers. Simulation results indicate the effectivity of our proposed algorithm in achieving the EE-SE tradeoff and illustrate the superiority of the robust approach compared with the conventional baselines.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid analog-digital (A/D) transceivers designed for millimeter wave (mmWave) systems have received substantial research attention, as a benefit of their lower cost and modest energy consumption compared to their fully-digital counterparts. We further improve their performance by conceiving a Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) based nonlinear joint design for the downlink of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mmWave systems. Our optimization criterion is that of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the system under channel uncertainties subject both to realistic transmit power constraint and to the unit modulus constraint imposed on the elements of the analog beamforming (BF) matrices governing the BF operation in the radio frequency domain. We transform this optimization problem into a more tractable form and develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm for solving it. Then, a novel two-timescale nonlinear joint hybrid transceiver design algorithm is developed, which can be viewed as an extension of the BCD-based joint design algorithm for reducing both the channel state information (CSI) signalling overhead and the effects of outdated CSI. Moreover, we determine the near-optimal cancellation order for the THP structure based on the lower bound of the MSE. The proposed algorithms can be guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the original problem. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed nonlinear joint hybrid transceiver design algorithms significantly outperform the existing linear hybrid transceiver algorithms and approach the performance of the fully-digital transceiver, despite its lower cost and power dissipation.},

  abstract     = {Reactive symbol-level jammer has attracted attention due to its low energy cost and high jamming efficiency. With the development of software-defined radio (SDR), the implementation of reactive symbol-level jamming has become more practical and efficient. To combat the reactive jammer, this paper proposes an index modulation based frequency hopping spread spectrum (IM-FHSS) scheme. Specifically, the current available frequencies are determined by multiple orthogonal frequency hopping (FH) patterns, and bit information is transmitted through the index of the active FH pattern. At the receiving side, we design an energy detector to distinguish the active and idle frequencies. With such implementation, IM-FHSS can obtain the improved resistance of reactive symbol-level jammer. Subsequently, we propose the alternative spectral efficiency (SE) mode of IM-FHSS in order to meet the high SE and low-power jamming scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze the BER of this scheme for the reactive symbol-level jamming under the cases of energy correlation, jamming rate, and phase offset. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that IM-FHSS exhibits enhanced resistance to reactive symbol-level jamming than traditional FH scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the effects of joint transmit and receive antennas’ selection on full-duplex (FD) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) networks’ performance. The antennas’ selection problem is, in general, a combinatorial problem whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of antennas. To fully understand the effects of antennas’ selection, we study the sum rate maximization problem in a single-cell network with an FD-MIMO base-station (BS). First, we consider a system with a normal-scale MIMO full-duplex BS, i.e., a normal-scale FD MIMO system. The sum rate maximization problem is studied for two different scenarios; in the first scenario, we consider jointly optimizing the transmit and receive antennas’ selection with the precoder and the receiver weights. A Generalized Bender&#39;s Decomposition based algorithm is proposed to solve the mixed-integer nonlinear sum rate maximization problem. In the second scenario, we consider self-interference cancellation via zero-forcing (ZF) transmission. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the sum rate maximization problem by optimizing the selection of the transmit antennas, receive antennas, and the receive antennas at which self-interference is nulled. Second, in a very-large scale, i.e., massive MIMO system, we derive lower bounds for the uplink and downlink rates with ZF receiver and precoder, respectively. The sum rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit to receive antennas ratio and the ratio of the receive antennas at which self-interference is nulled. Finally, via numerical analysis, we evaluate the performance of the formulated sum rate maximization problems.},

A mixture gamma distribution is used to approximate the probability density functions of fading channels. Based on this, we obtain closed-form expressions in terms of Meijer-G functions for the OP, the TP and the EC. We also perform asymptotic analysis of these metrics to characterize system behaviors at the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Moreover, upper-bounds for the EC is derived.

  abstract     = {Generalized beam modulation (GBM) is a recently proposed spectrum efficiency (SE)-enhanced index modulation (IM) scheme for narrowband millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems with hybrid transceivers. Unlike most existing fully-digital IM techniques whose application to wideband channels is straightforward after adopting the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique, extending GBM from the narrowband to wideband channels is quite challenging. The reason is that the per-subcarrier process in hybrid OFDM systems is no longer independent across individuals as all subcarriers share a common analog beamformer. Hence, the designed wideband GBM (wGBM) has to be compatible with hybrid OFDM systems while maintaining the SE-enhanced merit of GBM. Towards this objective, a symbol-based instead of the prevalent subcarrier-based paradigm is applied to guide wGBM design. To avoid the high detection complexity in large-scale OFDM systems, we devise a low-complexity detector by transforming the complicated symbol (block) detection into the manageable subcarrier (sub-block) detection. Finally, a simple first-order Doppler compensator is carefully designed to enhance the robustness of wGBM against Doppler. Both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations have been carried out to demonstrate the superiority of wGBM over existing alternatives in terms of error performance and energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In a free-space optical (FSO) communication system, a conventional transmit laser selection (CTLS) scheme selects the best transmit aperture to send the information bits and offers the best possible error performance. However, its performance is highly dependent on the feedback link, and even a slight error in the feedback information can cause a significant loss to the diversity order and bit error rate (BER). To mitigate this problem, in this research, a novel clustering-based TLS scheme, named two TLS (TTLS), is proposed and analyzed. Note that the word two in TTLS corresponds to the transmission corresponding to the two transmit apertures. TTLS scheme divides the arbitrary number of transmit apertures/lasers into two clusters and then selects the best transmit aperture from each cluster. It is observed by analysis that the TTLS scheme offers a lesser loss in the diversity order as compared to CTLS under imperfect feedback link. Therefore, a significant performance gain can be achieved by TTLS as compared to CTLS under a practical (imperfect/erroneous feedback link) scenario. Further, to retain the full diversity order under the imperfect feedback link, a modified error-tolerant weighting scheme (METWS) is also proposed. It is noticed from the asymptotic analysis that METWS offers full diversity order and outperforms CTLS and repetition coding schemes under both perfect and imperfect feedback links.},

The base station (BS) employs a large Uniform Planar Array (UPA) to facilitate massive Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications with high efficiency. UEs are equipped with a single antenna and are distributed uniformly within the cell. The key problem is analyzing and defining groups toward efficient precoding. Because balanced throughput is desired between groups, up to four separate frequency sub-carriers are employed in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system. We show that by employing three or four OFDMA subcarriers, depending on the number of UEs in the cell and the cell range, the UEs can be efficiently separated into high-throughput groups, with each group employing Virtual Channel Model Beams (VCMB) based inner precoding, followed by efficient Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) outer precoders. For each group, we study two different sub-grouping methods offering different advantages. We show that the improvement offered by Zero-Forcing Per-Group Precoding (ZF-PGP) over Matched Filter Precoding (MFP) and Zero-Forcing Precoding (ZFP) is very high when finite-alphabet inputs are used. We also show ZF-PGP with finite-alphabet inputs significantly outperforms MFP with Gaussian inputs in certain realistic setups. Finally, a new technique for power allocation among different UEs is proposed, called Optimized Per-Group Power Allocation (OPGPA), which achieves much higher power efficiency jointly with equal throughput among all UEs in each group.},

In this system, near NOMA users (NUs) that are close to a source can assist the communications between the source and far NOMA users (FUs) using the energy harvested by either PS or TS strategy. The design aims to maximize the sum-rate of the system by optimizing user pairing and power allocation between NUs and FUs as well as performing PS and TS control at NUs, while guaranteeing the target data rates and the minimum harvested energy requirements of users. Since the joint design is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem that is challenging to tackle, we propose a two-step user pairing and resource allocation algorithm. Specifically, we decouple the original problem into an inner resource allocation problem and an outer user pairing problem. For the inner problem, we propose successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithms to perform power allocation as well as PS and TS control iteratively, with the algorithms’ convergence being theoretically proved. By exploiting the characteristics of the outer problem of user pairing, this problem is well tackled by the Hungarian algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed joint design yields better performance gains than the existing schemes.},

Specifically, closed-form expressions are derived for DL-NOMA in terms of the outage probability (OP), bit error rate (BER), and ergodic capacity (EC). The OP analysis considers two main scenarios, the first is when the individual user&#39;s rate is required to satisfy a certain quality of service (QoS), while the second is when the individual user&#39;s NOMA rate is less than that of the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) rate. Moreover, the derived BER performance is generalized for the case of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM). The results demonstrate the interplay between the system performance, the power allocation coefficients, target data rates, and the channel fading parameters. Moreover, the OP results reveal that NOMA users with OMA data rate experience higher outage compared to NOMA with fixed target data rate. The accuracy of the derived expressions is validated using extensive Monte Carlo simulation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel secure channel estimation technique to provide security against leakage of the channel estimates to any malicious user by utilizing artificial noise (AN) along with full-duplex (FD) transmissions. AN overcomes the drawback of FD transmission, where any strategically located eavesdropper can minimize the interference signal received from the FD receiver. The proposed secure channel estimation technique comprises three stages, where the first stage is responsible for the estimation of the residual self-interference (SI) channel. The second stage acquires rough channel estimates to design AN orthogonal to the channel between legitimate transmitter-receiver for the next training stage. In the third stage, both legitimate nodes transmit orthogonal AN signals along with the known training signals using FD transmissions. For power allocation, we have presented a novel local adaptive power allocation algorithm at each legitimate node to allocate the powers to the training signals, and AN signals while ensuring equivocation at the eavesdropper. We provide the mean square error (MSE) to indicate the performance achieved by the respective nodes. We have also provided the bit error rate (BER) simulation analysis to indicate the secure communication achieved by securing the channel estimation process. The presented simulation analysis indicates that the eavesdropper is unable to decode the transmitted information while the legitimate receiver has robustly decoded the transmitted information.},

This number becomes even more extreme in extra-large (XL-MIMO), a variant of M-MIMO where the antenna array is of very large size. Yet, the problem of signal processing complexity in M-MIMO is further exacerbated by the XL size of the array. The basic processing problem boils down to a sparse system of linear equations that can be addressed by the randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm. This algorithm has recently been applied to devise low-complexity M-MIMO receivers; however, it is limited by the fact that certain configurations of the linear equations may significantly deteriorate the performance of the RK algorithm. In this article, we embrace the interest in accelerated RK algorithms and introduce three new RK-based low-complexity receiver designs. In our experiments, our methods are not only able to overcome the previous scheme, but they are more robust against inter-user interference (IUI) and sparse channel matrices arising in the XL-MIMO regime. In addition, we show that the RK-based schemes use a mechanism similar to that used by successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers to approximate the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) scheme.},

In this work, hypersonic vehicle downlink integrated channels that cascade the plasma sheath channel and Rice fading channel are first established, and the probability density functions (PDFs) of the integrated channel amplitude and phase are derived theoretically. Then, a downlink SIMO system over the integrated channel is considered, including a single antenna transmitter and a single ground receiver equipped with a large number of antennas. For this system, a noncoherent telemetry scheme is proposed, a transmitter that modulates information only in the power of the symbols, and an adaptive maximum likelihood (ML) receiver which demodulates symbols using the PDF of the average received power (ARP) across the antennas. Motivated by the efficient power utilization, an asymptotically optimal constellation design in terms of symbol error rate (SER) with an increasing number of antennas is proposed, under an assumption that CSI statistics are available. The PDF of ARP is well estimated by a reduced reversible jump markov chain monte carlo (RRJ-MCMC) algorithm and used for symbol demodulation and achievable rate derivation. The numerical results demonstrate that the optimal constellation scheme outperforms the amplitude shift keying (ASK) constellation scheme and is robust against the plasma sheath attenuation with moderate antennas or a large line-of-sight (LOS) component.},

However, the secrecy of uplink transmission is equally important although relatively less attention has been dedicated to. In this paper, we show that a multi-antenna eavesdropper could potentially reduce the secrecy rate of legitimate communications severely through channel estimation in the training phase and coherent detection in the payload data transmission phase. To safeguard uplink transmission, an artificial noise (AN)-assisted scheme is proposed. Specifically, the optimization problem that aims to optimize the power allocation between AN and data symbols in the sense of maximizing the secrecy rate is formulated. We investigate optimal power allocation strategies for two distinct cases. That is, the base station and the eavesdropper know the channel state information to the users, and the opposite case. In each case, we further consider whether the accurate position of the eavesdropper is known to the users. Due to the complexity of the cost function, a closed-form solution is intractable. As a result, the bisection method is employed to obtain the numerical results. The impacts of the non-idealities, including the channel estimation error and the uncertainty of eavesdropper&#39;s position, on the power allocation strategy are discussed. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out to validate our proposed algorithms.},

While the application of IRS as a passive reflector to enhance the performance of wireless communications has been widely investigated in the literature, using IRS as a passive transmitter recently is emerging as a new concept and attracting steadily growing interest. In this paper, we propose two novel IRS-based passive information transmission systems using advanced symbol-level precoding. One is a standalone passive information transmission system, where the IRS operates as a passive transmitter serving multiple receivers by adjusting its elements to reflect unmodulated carrier signals. The other is a joint passive reflection and information transmission system, where the IRS not only enhances transmissions for multiple primary information receivers (PIRs) by passive reflection, but also simultaneously delivers additional information to a secondary information receiver (SIR) by embedding its information into the primary signals at the symbol level. Two typical optimization problems, i.e., power minimization and quality-of-service (QoS) balancing, are investigated for the proposed IRS-based passive information transmission systems. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of IRS-based passive information transmission and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, as compared to other benchmark schemes.},

Based on the acquired VLC signal waveforms, characteristics related to electronic components, LEDs, and photo diodes (PDs) are studied thoroughly. The non-square shape of received pulses is modeled by new template functions involving rising and setting time intervals. A new PPM demodulator is devised thereupon. Meanwhile, the probability density function of noise is derived using the Edgeworth expansion.

This work proposes efficient resource allocation (RA) procedures to perform joint antenna selection (AS) and power allocation (PA) to maximize the DL spectral efficiency (SE) of an XL-MIMO system operating under different loading settings. Two metaheuristic RA procedures based on the genetic algorithm (GA) are assessed and compared in terms of performance, coordination data size and computational complexity. One algorithm is based on a quasi-distributed methodology while the other is based on the conventional centralized processing. Numerical results demonstrate that the quasi-distributed GA-based procedure results in a suitable trade-off between performance, complexity and exchanged coordination data.

Generally, previous works focus on the performance in NOMA networks, based on some assumptions. For instance, the number of users in a NOMA group, is two-category: 1) only two users; 2) any number of users without restriction. And just a certain factor of channel gain, e.g., the propagation path loss or the small scale fading, is subjectively considered to be dominant. Besides, there is lack of the closed-form expression for the probability density function (PDF) of ordered channel gain. In this paper, we investigate a downlink cellular NOMA network with the directional beamforming and the upper limit for user number (ULFUN) in a NOMA group. Meanwhile, the path loss and the Rayleigh fading are taken into account as a whole for ordering channel gains. Based on the derived closed-form PDF of ordered channel gain, we analyze the performance for an arbitrary user in the network and derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the approximate meta distribution of conditional success probability (CSP) and the ergodic data rate. The provided simulations demonstrate that the proposed analytical results are accurate and reasonable. Moreover, it illustrates that the existence of ULFUN can have a positive impact on the performance gain in low SINR environments, while in terms of the outage probability, ULFUN would become a non-negligible and negative factor in the improvement of performance for high SINR environments.},

However, research on mobility support of NDN-based VANETs still faces many challenges. To solve the issue of data transmission path breaking due to Consumer mobility in NDN-based VANETs, this article proposes a novel vehicle tracking-based Data packet forwarding scheme (VTDF) to improve the successful delivery rate of Data packets in mobile environments. In this approach, the urban road structure is divided into complex multi-junction and straight lane scenarios and Data packets are forwarded according to vehicle movement information. Simulations indicated that this vehicle tracking scheme provides a lower average data transmission delay, shorter handover delay between roadside units, and higher data delivery rate for Consumers compared to the standard methods.},

Since CE is an iterative method, the initial probability of CE plays an important role in converging toward the optimal solution. Thus, we focus on finding a more preferable initial probability for CE in this paper. Firstly, we analyze the perturbation signals of TI scheme. It is found that the number of the subcarriers needed to be perturbed is much smaller than the number of the subcarriers of OFDM systems, which demonstrates the perturbed subcarriers of perturbation signals exhibits the property of sparsity. Secondly, we assign different subcarriers with different perturbation weight defined according to the power of clipping noise. Thirdly, we select a candidate subcarrier set with limited size from the whole subcarrier set according to perturbation weight. Finally, by utilizing sparsity and perturbation weight in the determination of initial probability, we propose an enhanced CE method whose initial probability is problem-dependent and adaptive to OFDM symbols. Simulation results verify that the proposed initial probability adaptation enhanced CE-based TI scheme outperforms the traditional CE-based TI scheme and parametric minimum cross entropy (PMCE) based TI scheme on the PAPR, complexity and BER performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a traction motor for maximum power 76kW electrical vehicle (EV) was designed, and the design results were verified through experiments. One of the important design objectives of the traction motor for EV is to improve energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of a traction motor affects the mileage of electric vehicles (EVs). Among the design factors influencing energy efficiency, shape parameters include torque per rotor volume (TRV), torque density (TD) and shape ratio (SR). These shape parameters have an impact on the motor&#39;s phase back EMF, inductance, winding resistance and core loss resistance, eventually affecting the energy efficiency in the entire operating range of the motor. In this paper, a New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) was applied to calculate the energy efficiency of the traction motor for EV. Changes in motor parameters such as phase back electromotive force (EMF), inductance, winding resistance and core loss resistance were identified according to variations in shape parameters. In addition, the motor characteristics according to the changes of these parameters were confirmed, and shape parameters to improve energy efficiency were selected. Since the traction motor designed in this paper adopted a water cooling method, thermal analysis was performed by reflecting the water cooling method in the thermal equivalent circuit (TEC). In order to confirm the reliability of the analysis method and design, a load test was conducted on the entire operating range to calculate energy efficiency, and a temperature test was performed to compare the test results with the analysis results.},

Our design objective is to reduce the cost of the antenna system for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) radar with a large-aperture array. We formulate this co-design problem as a sparse optimization problem with angular response and binary-like modulus constraints. To solve the resultant NP-hard nonconvex problem, we propose a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm. This method transforms the original problem into a higher-dimensional one by introducing two categories of auxiliary variables. By doing so, the problem can be effectively tackled via alternately solving several subproblems, meanwhile the tricky binary modulus constraints can be well handled by utilizing the geometric property of the subproblem. We further prove that the proposed algorithm converges to the KKT points of the original problem. In addition, we extend our methodology to the discrete phase case to handle the practical finite-bit phase quantization. The devised algorithm is capable of generating phase-only weight vector meanwhile automatically selecting appropriate antenna elements according to the specific beam shape. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the modeling and analysis of a novel priority valve controlled open-loop Cable Reeling Drum (CRD) drive of Load Haul Dump (LHD) vehicle. The LHD vehicle is basically a trackless loading machine having wide applications in underground mining operations. The CRD incorporated in the said machine performs the reeling/unreeling operation of the flexible trailing cables that supply electric power to the machine. In this respect, a novel hydraulic circuit is proposed that incorporates a priority valve for the operation of the hydro motor driving the CRD, unlike the existing LHD machines having a separate hydraulic arrangement for the CRD operation. In the present study, the flow through the bypass port of the priority flow divider (PFD) valve is utilized for driving the CRD. In analyzing the proposed hydraulic system, the detailed model is analytically solved in MATLAB/Simulink software, and the simulation results are validated experimentally. The effects of change of the critical parameters on the system&#39;s dynamic responses are analyzed using the validated simulation model. The investigations show that till the fluid flow metered to the PFD valve is higher than the priority flow demand, the machine&#39;s priority function is not affected by the operation of the CRD. However, with the actuation of the priority operation, the hydro-motor drive speed of the CRD decreases. The model proposed in this study may be considered as a basis for the re-design of the hydraulic arrangement of CRD drive incorporated in an LHD machine for its improved performance.},

  abstract     = {Online remaining charging-discharging cycle (RCDC) prognosis is of great significance for lithium-ion batteries. The conventional method is usually based on whether the state-of-health (SOH) of capacity reaches the end-of-life (EoL) threshold. However, the most available prediction methods have two problems that need to be solved. First, the SOH degradation curve of the lithium-ion battery is nonlinear and non-Gaussian, and the battery capacity regeneration phenomena (CRP) has a direct impact on RCDC estimation efficiency. These factors challenge the precise forecast of RCDC and increase the risk of prediction failure. Second, existing methods have insufficient early-stage prediction ability for capacity degradation because too little data are available to facilitate establishing and optimizing the prediction models. To overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, this study introduces the Mann-Kendall trend analysis to generate an equivalent degradation indicator (EDI), and to replace the capacity-based SOH. The proposed EDI has good linearity and monotonicity, and is conducive to adopt a simple structured prediction model to determine the RCDC. Besides, this study is based on the “SOH-EDI” synchronization mapping relationship and applies an one-degree polynomial regression model to estimate the EoL threshold on the EDI curve. From the perspective of computational complexity, the proposed framework uses two polynomial prediction models with simple structures, which realizes a low computational burden and online RCDC prediction. To verify the efficiency of the proposed method, this paper introduces three methods for comparison. Experimental results show that the proposed framework has satisfied early-stage prediction ability of RCDC and has a superior prognosis efficiency.},

Meanwhile, a distributed control law based on estimated state is developed when the event-triggered condition is violated, which ensures the platoon can reach bounded consensus with an exponential convergence rate. Compared with existing related results, the fully distributed event-triggered mechanism is independent of any global information or leader&#39;s information. Moreover, Zeno behavior can be strictly ruled out for each vehicle. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered control policy is validated by numerical examples.},

In this method, the current prediction trajectory of one voltage vector is extrapolated to multiple control periods, and the control performances of every voltage vector during multiple control periods are evaluated by multi-stage series cost functions. Additionally, the implementation process of the proposed method is described. Finally, the comparison experiments between the conventional MPC and the proposed method show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the switching frequency under the same control frequency.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a vehicle sideslip angle (VSA) estimation method is presented and experimentally verified by fusing vehicle kinematics and dynamics information with fuzzy logic. First, a vehicle-kinematics-based (VK-based) reduced inertial navigation system (R-INS) is developed to calculate the VSA, velocities, and attitude. Then, with the velocities measured by a single-antenna global navigation satellite system (GNSS), a velocity-based Kalman filter (VBKF) is employed to estimate the velocity, attitude, and gyro bias errors in the R-INS and these errors will be adopted to correct accumulated errors of the R-INS. However, the heading error in the R-INS which is highly correlated with the VSA is not well observable when the vehicle is with low excitation. To address this observability issue, the vehicle-dynamics-based (VD-based) VSA estimation approach is leveraged to augment the heading error into the velocity measurements of the VBKF by a novel heading error measurement model, and an augmented Kalman filter (AKF) is designed. Next, according to the vehicle lateral excitation, a fuzzy logic method is proposed to fuse the heading errors from both the VBKF and AKF to take advantage of the VK-based and VD-based methods. Finally, a comprehensive experimental test is conducted, and the results confirm that the heading error observability issue in the VBKF has been tackled by fusing vehicle kinematics and dynamics and the VSA estimation accuracy has been advanced. The VSA estimation accuracy of the proposed method (the absolute mean error is only 0.126°) matches our previous work, which needs a dual-antenna GNSS, but the cost is reduced.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in the capacity and power rating of batteries in today&#39;s HEVs and EVs, the battery thermal management (BTM) system bears growing importance in vehicle safety and efficiency. A practical BTM system is commonly coupled with the passenger cabin heating-ventilation-air-conditioning (HVAC) system, which makes a major energy consumer and a challenging control object. Thanks to the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology, predictions of the vehicle speed profile and power trajectory can be obtained, providing the possibility for predictive control of the BTM and HVAC coupled system in order to maintain battery safety, passenger comfort, and to reduce energy consumption. However, the tradeoff among higher energy saving potential and wider control range from a long and sparse horizon, and higher accuracy from a short and dense horizon is inevitable in the conventional predictive control. In this paper, a two-layer predictive control strategy for warm/hot weather is proposed to address the aforementioned tradeoff. The upper layer controller firstly plans the optimized battery temperature trajectory according to the look-ahead speed preview and battery power profiles provided by the CAV network and the integrated BTM and HVAC system efficiency surface from off-line data. Then the lower layer model predictive controller tracks the planned trajectory and cabin temperature reference while enforcing the energy consumption optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy exhibits accurate battery and passenger cabin temperature reference tracking while achieving up to 10.47% HVAC energy saving comparing to a baseline control strategy with UDDS profile and typical driving conditions. Implementation of the proposed strategy on a real-time vehicle emulator based on rapid control prototyping (RCP) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platforms demonstrates the real-world implementation capability of the proposed two-layer framework.},

This paper investigates the integration of the extended-Kalman-filter with the smooth-variable-structure-filter algorithms for state-of-charge estimation of lithium-ion batteries. The robustness of the presented approach to modeling uncertainty is assessed for batteries operating in highly dynamic environments. The presented approach combines the benefit of the smooth- variable-structure-filter in its robustness to model uncertainty with the benefit of the extended-Kalman-filter in its near-optimality for a given dynamics and measurement noise sequences. The algorithm is rigorously tested using various datasets including standardrized and artificial drive cycles with added dynamics. The drive cycle power profile is calculated for an electric Ford F150 truck and scaled for the 18650PF cell used in the tests. Experimental validation is performed by investigating four different scenarios in which knowledge of the initial conditions as well as accuracy of the battery model were varied. The results demonstrate a substantially enhanced estimation accuracy achieved by the adopted approach through its optimality to measurement and model noise as well as its robustness to model uncertainty. The adopted approach results in a reduction in the complexity of the state-of-charge control algorithm and therefore enhances the battery management system.},

  abstract     = {Rotational speed detection is important for alternator-voltage-regulator (AVR) to starts-up and generates regulated electric power for vehicles. However, the rotational speed detection in standby mode for self-start is challenging with low loss rectifier, such as the Schottky diode. In this paper, a novel rotational speed detection method by sensing phase voltage or field voltage at specific modes is proposed to solve the issue without extra wiring or external components. The analysis of phase voltage in standby mode considering rectifier leakage current explains the challenges of conventional detection. The derivation of field voltage in standby mode with ANSYS Maxwell simulation verifies the proposed method. The experimental platform with a three-phase six-pole pairs alternator verified that the proposed method can detect rotational speed even in self-start and low speed of 200 rpm.},

The objective is to determine the torque split between the internal combustion engine and the electric machine of a hybrid vehicle.

To avoid a complex prediction of the vehicle speed and acceleration over time, the slow dynamic of their distribution is exploited. A rational tuning of the algorithm parameters is proposed as well as some improved implementations. The number of individual operations (additions, multiplications, interpolations, etc) required per seconds is discussed.

First, we formulate an optimization problem by considering driveability and a penalty for using service brakes in the objective function to optimize gear, engine on/off, engine clutch state, and power-split decisions subject to constraints on the battery state of charge (SOC) and charge sustenance. Then, we split it into two control layers, including a supervisory control in a higher layer and a local power-split control in a lower layer. In the supervisory layer, a gear and powertrain mode manager (PM) is designed, and optimal gear, engine on/off and clutch states are obtained by using a combination of dynamic programming (DP) and Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle (PMP). Moreover, a real-time iteration Secant method is proposed to calculate optimal battery costate such that the constraint on charge sustenance is satisfied. In the local controller layer, a linear quadratic tracking method (LQT) is used to optimally split power between the engine and the electric machine and keep battery SOC within its bounds.},

The first method is to design a wide-band EMI filter based on engineering method. It can achieve the insertion loss of 60 dB within 150 kHz--108 MHz. Another proposed method is to design the EMI filter based on the resonance peaks suppression. During the second filter design process, by analyzing the common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) interference paths at two key frequency points 1 MHz and 30 MHz, the dominated parameters responsible for the over-standard points were determined, and the CM and DM filter circuit was designed accordingly. Compared with the filter designed by the first method, the filter designed based on resonance peaks suppression can better meet the design goals, without further rectification according to the tests, and it is smaller in size, only 1/4 of the filter size designed by the first method, lower in cost, and easy to be engineering.},

Different power levels can be conveniently satisfied by flexibly adjusting the number of MPMIs. A modeling method based on the energy-amplitude and phase is developed and linearized to get the slowly changing phase variable and to analyze the system dynamic characteristics at its operating point. To achieve the required dynamic performance of the proposed model, the parameters of a PI controller are obtained by calculating the required settling time and overshoot of the closed-loop dominant poles. A 20.07 kW WPT prototype supplied by three MPMIs with an efficiency of 92.17% was designed and tested. Experimental results show that the proposed modeling method and controller design achieved both good performances of circulating current suppression and MPMIs output voltage phase synchronization.},

  abstract     = {Priority and mutual interaction among vehicles are crucial for the efficiency and safety control of unsignalized intersections. However, most of the approaches for intersection cooperation are based on first-come-first-served (FCFS) rules, neglecting the influence caused by different priorities. Focusing on the priority and mutual interaction between connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a game-based hierarchical control strategy to improve the traveling efficiency at unsignalized intersections. The three-layered hierarchical strategy includes the priority negotiation layer (PNL), strategy bargaining layer (SBL) and strategy optimization layer (SOL), respectively. In the PNL, a game-theoretic strategy is designed for priority negotiation, in which the most efficient crossing order is sought by the Pareto-optimal set. In the SBL, with the assigned negotiated priority, a bargaining game is designed for further interaction between CAVs. In the SOL, model predictive control is applied for strategy optimization considering the comfort of drivers and executability of vehicles. Two cases of cooperative intersection, in which fixed priority with comparison of the Nash game method and greedy method, and negotiated priority with comparison of fixed priority are carried out in a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test. The results demonstrate that the traffic efficiency is improved with safety guaranteed by the proposed hierarchical strategy.},

There are at least three great superiorities of the proposed QPND controller. Firstly, three attitude angles can be coordinated control since the quadratic programming framework incorporates three attitudes. Secondly, the new framework enables the UAV to achieve the additional performance criteria or to perform subtasks. Third, the new controller can track time-varying trajectories due to neural dynamic approach. Specifically, the design process of the controller is divided into position controller design, attitude controller design and quadratic programming formulation.

  abstract     = {Reliable trajectory prediction methods are critical in providing predictive safety intelligence for vital decision making in intelligent transportation systems to further enhance the safety of drivers and passengers. To tackle complicated maneuvering and interactions between objects, learning-based algorithms were used to replace classic model-based trajectory prediction algorithms. However, most algorithms implicitly presume that they are executed at centralized processing units after gathering data from edge sensors and delivering the results back to the on-board units. This causes an increase in computation time and latency; thus, reducing the reaction time of the drivers. To reduce the computation time and latency and consider the robustness of local sensors, we propose a decentralized radar-dedicated framework with a deep-learning (DL) model, called predictive RadarNet, to predict future trajectories over binary range angle (RA) maps with a probabilistic representation according to the original radar RA maps for presenting the uncertainty of the estimated trajectories. In addition, to reduce the model size for low-complexity, we designed a prepossessing technique that can largely reduce the size of the input tensors without losing information. Moreover, we found that the functions of the DL-model consist of two operations: future inference of original radar RA maps and transformation to binary RA maps. Thus, we designed two models with different kernels that are suitable for dealing with the two operations. Simulations show that the proposed decentralized framework using predictive RadarNet can provide reliable prediction results with a low computation time.},

  abstract     = {GNSS/INS integrated navigation and positioning technology is widely used for train operations applications seeking a decrease in dependence on trackside equipment. However, during train operations, environmental factors such as bridges, tunnels, hillsides, and buildings will block the satellite signals. When INS works in a stand-alone mode, the system errors accumulate with time due to the inertial sensor characteristics. To overcome this problem, light detection and ranging (lidar) equipment can be introduced to help control INS divergence. The lidar point cloud data is first processed using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to determine the track plane, then the moving average filtering (MAF) algorithm is used to detect and classify the rails. The frogs can be detected based on the changing rail number and the constraint condition for turnout parameters. With the assistance of a previously surveyed turnout database, the geographical positions of the detected frogs can be obtained and integrated with INS data to converge INS sensor errors when GNSS is not available. In this paper a lidar-aided GNSS/INS integrated navigation system is proposed that can ensure continuous positioning in both GNSS-available and GNSS-blocked scenarios. GNSS/INS is applied when the system operates in the GNSS-available scenario, and switches to the INS/lidar mode when the GNSS signals are blocked. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, an actual train experiment was conducted along the Qinghai-Tibet railway. The results confirm that the proposed lidar-aided navigation system can achieve accurate and continuous positioning. When GNSS is not available, the proposed method can effectively suppress the error of INS with a DRMS of 1.66 m, which is a 70.4% improvement compared with a conventional GNSS/INS integrated system.},

The combination of FEC and DS-SS techniques can provide sufficient link margin and robustness for communication systems.

Generically, an &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -sequence can be regarded as a codeword of cyclic linear codes. Similar to the decoding procedure of LDPC codes, the joint detection and decoding process of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -sequences can be performed by factor graph-based iterative message-passing algorithms (iMPAs). In terms of the iterative signal processing, we first present an improved approach of iterative stopping criterion which can reduce the average number of iteration by 90% for the LDPC decoding approach. Furthermore, a joint detection and decoding method is developed to provide quick synchronization of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -sequence. Meanwhile, stopping criterion-based iMPAs are especially suitable for analog implementation with low complexity. Finally, cascading to the analog LDPC decoder, the implementation of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -sequence detector is designed. The prototyping chip is fully integrated into a 0.35- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mu\text{m}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; CMOS technology, which can achieve higher throughput than 3 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${\textbf {Gcps}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; with a core chip area of 2.79 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${\textbf {mm}}^2$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and power consumption of 6.99 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${\textbf {mW}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; for its core circuit.

The diversity order of the system is found to be independent of the shape parameter of the additive noise. Furthermore, the optimal 4-ary I-PAM constellation minimizing the SEP at lower SNR values is computed numerically. The optimal 4-ary I-PAM constellation is found to be elliptical in shape as opposed to the traditional circular QPSK constellation generally employed in wireless communication systems. The effects of the correlation among the multipath channel gains and the shape parameter of the noise on the optimality of the considered constellation are also presented via numerical studies.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) wireless technology is envisioned to enable terabit-per-second (Tbps) and secure transmissions in sixth-generation (6G) communication networks and has attracted attention from academia and industry in recent years. Because the transmission range of THz radios is restricted compared to that of microwave radios, frequency reuses in the THz band become much more flexible and even possible among transceiver pairs in close proximity. However, without appropriate spatial arrangement and coordination, the frequency reuse in the THz band can also lead to severe co-channel interference and result in a low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) or a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), which finally degrades signal detection and network reliability. To thoroughly study the co-channel interference in the THz band, we model the co-channel interference by the compound channel model and analyze it in detail. The adopted channel model captures the key features of THz communication, such as, spreading loss, molecular absorption loss, and dynamic shadowing, which is much different and complicated than those used in the low-frequency band. The resulted SINR and SIR are investigated by approximating the sum of co-channel interference as a gamma distribution. The generalized analytical results are also reduced to specialized forms for two special cases, i.e., the single-interferer case and the case of multiple independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) interferers. Due to the generalized nature of the THz interference model constructed in this paper, the results play a meaningful role in practical implementation and can be easily extended to advanced performance analyses for THz communication systems.},

By considering transmit antenna selection and maximal ratio combining reception at the legitimate (Bob) and Eve&#39;s receiver sides, we study two relevant scenarios: 1) the transmitter knows Bob&#39;s channel state information (CSI) but not Eve&#39;s CSI, and 2) the transmitter is aware of the CSI of both Bob and Eve channels. For this purpose, we first obtain novel and tractable expressions for the statistics of the maximum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) variates related to the legitimate channel. Based on these results, we derive novel closed-form expressions of the two aforementioned scenarios to assess the secrecy performance of the underlying system. Specifically, for cases: 1) the secrecy outage probability (SOP), the probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC), and 2) the average secrecy capacity (ASC). Moreover, we develop analytical asymptotic expressions of the SOP and ASC in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. In all instances, secrecy performance metrics are characterized in closed-form, without requiring the evaluation of Meijer-G or Fox-H functions. Some useful insights on how the different propagation conditions and the number of antennas impact the secrecy performance are also provided.},

However, performing ray tracing simulations at each discrete time instant is computationally expensive. Instead, a new approach is proposed to extrapolate results obtained from a single ray tracing simulation. It relies on the geometric tracking of interaction points (i.e. reflection or diffraction points), enabling analytical or numerical predictions of the evolution of any ray identified during an initial ray tracing simulation. The performance of this new approach is studied on several canonical vehicle-to-vehicle configurations, as part of a statistical study. Focus is also given to the time horizon during which dynamic ray tracing is possible, related to the lifetime of the main rays. This time horizon can be directly estimated based on the knowledge of the geometry and its evolution. It is found to be the main parameter influencing the accuracy and the computational gain of the presented approach.},

This paper proposes a deep learning method to detect the type/model of the UAV using the transmitted RF signals, even when these signals follow proprietary medium access protocols whose headers cannot be decoded. The main contributions are as follows: (i) We show how the preamble portion of the packet is better suited for learning subtle protocol-specific differences, instead of randomly selecting any subset of the transmitted packet, (ii) we propose a pre-processing scheme that generates cross-correlation feature maps to enhance the classification accuracy, (iii) we develop a deep convolutional neural architecture that can be trained in data collected from static scenarios and then tested in practical hovering conditions with 98.2% accuracy of UAV model classification, demonstrating robustness to channel variations, and (iv) we extend this model towards a federated learning paradigm where sensors send individually trained models back to a central controller that combines them, without any appreciable loss of accuracy. Our evaluations are performed on an 8.9 GB dataset collected from static and flying UAVs, which we also release as part of the technical contributions of the work.},

However, the modulo operation in VP may influence the accuracy of soft decision. For alleviating this problem, the calculation of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) for VP is discussed and we further propose a sub-constellation shifted (SCS) scheme for VP precoding toward more accurate LLR.

  abstract     = {The future sixth generation (6G) wireless communications look forward to constructing a ubiquitous intelligent information network with high data rates. To fulfill such challenging visions, the reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) is developed as a promising solution due to its capability of accurate multi-beam steering with low power consumption and hardware cost. Different from the conventional phase-controlled antennas, the RHS can control the radiation amplitude of the reference wave propagating on the metasurface by leveraging the holographic technique. The desired object waves can then be generated without complex phase-shifting circuits, enabling the convenient implementation of the transceiver. Such amplitude-controlled holographic beamforming triggers new challenges since a new beamforming scheme needs to be developed to handle the complex-domain optimization problem subject to the unconventional real-domain amplitude constraints, which makes the superposition of the radiation waves from different antenna elements difficult to tackle. In this letter, we consider an RHS-aided multi-user communication system with a base station equipped with an RHS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem and design a novel amplitude-controlled algorithm to solve the problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

For the case of known eavesdroppers&#39; locations, a precoding scheme is proposed to maximize the secrecy capacity of the system by suppressing the rate of collusive eavesdroppers. Then we extend the scheme to the case of unknown eavesdroppers&#39; locations. Specifically, the artificial noise is introduced in the precoding scheme to further suppress the average rate of eavesdroppers. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on concave-convex procedure.

  abstract     = {Polar coding has been ratified for employment in the 3GPP New Radio standard and several soft-decision decoders achieved comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art successive cancellation list decoder. Aiming for further improving the performance of the soft-decision polar decoders, we propose a soft-output successive cancellation stack (SSCS) polar decoder, which jointly exploits the benefits of the depth-first search of the stack decoder and the soft information output of the belief propagation decoder. This has the substantial benefit of facilitating soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoding and seamless iterative information exchange in turbo-style receivers. As a further contribution, we intrinsically amalgamate our SSCS decoder into polar-coded large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and conceive an iterative turbo receiver, operating on the basis of logarithmic likelihood ratios (LLRs). Our simulation results show that the proposed SSCS decoder is capable of outperforming the state-of-the-art SISO polar decoders, despite requiring a lower complexity at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Additionally, compared with the non-iterative hard-output SCS decoder, our SSCS scheme attained 1.5 dB SNR gain at a bit error ratio level of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{-5}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , when decoding the [256,512] polar code of a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(64\times 64)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; MIMO system.},

Through analyzing RCEE, it notes that as the number of base-station antennas M becomes unbounded, RCEE approaches a given constant. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis proves that, in high M-regime, the increasing rate of the RCEE scales in the order of √M for Rayleigh fading and pure LoS propagation, while the scaling order with general Ricean fading is capped by √M.

For the latter approach, a simplification is also suggested to lower complexity.

However, the existing algorithms only perform well under a Line-of-Sight (LOS) condition. In this letter, we propose an enhanced AoA-based iterative positioning algorithm with anchor selection in the presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation. The proposed algorithm can identify and mitigate the NLOS anchors by comparing the variances of the intermediate estimated position for all possible combinations of anchors with predefined thresholds. Finally, the estimated position based on the selected anchors is converted back to the angle information and used as prior information for the next iteration.

Reducing the energy consumption and the computation burden of WDs while ensuring the quality-of-service requirements is an urgent issue. To this end, a joint computation offloading and radio resource allocation problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption of WDs for an MEC-based WP-BackComNet by jointly optimizing user association, the transmit power and transmission time of WDs, the computational offloading coefficient of each task, and the reflection coefficients of BDs, where the circuit power consumption of BDs, the computational capabilities of WDs, and the task execution delay budgets are considered.

  abstract     = {In Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation, information symbols are embedded in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain instead of the time-frequency (TF) domain. In order to ensure compatibility with existing OFDM systems, most prior work on OTFS receivers consider a two-step conversion, where the received time-domain (TD) signal is firstly converted to a time-frequency (TF) signal (using an OFDM demodulator) followed by post-processing of this TF signal into a DD domain signal. In this paper, we show that the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of a two-step conversion based receiver degrades in very high mobility scenarios where the Doppler shift is a significant fraction of the communication bandwidth (e.g., control and non-payload communication (CNPC) in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)). We therefore consider an alternate conversion, where the received TD signal is directly converted to the DD domain. The resulting received DD domain signal is shown to be not the same as that obtained in the two-step conversion considered in prior works. The alternate conversion does not require an OFDM demodulator and is shown to have lower complexity than the two-step conversion. Simulations reveal that even in very high mobility scenarios, the SE and symbol error rate performance of the alternate conversion is invariant of Doppler shift and is significantly better than the performance achieved with two-step conversion (which degrades with increasing Doppler shift).},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of 5 G, artificial intelligence and other technologies, the intelligent transportation system (ITS) bursts flourish fireworks. It is acknowledged that driving security problem still runs through the ITS development history.It is the driver who plays the decisive role in a vehicle accident, and the performance of autopilot system is also the kernel in guaranteeing the security of autonomous vehicle. Therefore, many researchers devote to self-driving system optimization and human abnormal driving behavior detection. Note that they either relied on simulators, or confined to several specific driving patterns, which undoubtedly limited their application value. In addition, some works require the vehicles have high computing power and abundant storage memory, which aggravated their burden. Different from previous works, we propose a driving behavior evaluation scheme based on vehicle-edge-cloud architecture. When vehicles running on the road, they transmit the data reflecting the autopilots/driver behaviors to the edge networks via the telematics box. The edge networks use the driving behavior evaluation model trained by cloud server, and send the behavior rankings back to vehicles. The cloud server continuously trains and optimizes the driving behavior evaluation model using vehicle data, and regularly transmits the model to the edge networks for upgrading. The experimental results show robustness and feasibility of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Modern vehicular applications are resource-intensive and have different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this direction, Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) has emerged as a new paradigm to host such applications in the cloud. In this paper, we extend the VCC paradigm to include federation, wherein the data centers from multiple cloud providers are pooled in to support applications that can not be supported in a single provider. We address the problem of dynamic resource allocation in a federated vehicular cloud. We propose a dynamic resource pricing model for sharing resources between the cloud providers, based on which we formulate resource allocation as an optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the cost of the vehicular service provider while meeting the delay bounds of different vehicular applications, for which a cost and delay-aware, polynomial-time algorithm is proposed. We evaluate the proposed algorithm under different scenarios to show that exploiting federation brings great benefits for the service providers and end-users alike. The proposed algorithm is seen to meet the delay requirements with a significant cost reduction to the provider up to 50% compared to baseline methods. We also show that the proposed algorithm can serve more than 90% of requests with lower cost and fewer VM migrations. It reduces the number of VM migrations by 72%.},

MDS utilizes trust score, feedback score and other evaluation schemes to identify abnormal behavior of the vehicles. However, the trust and feedback scores used in MDS may violate the location, trajectory, or identity privacy of the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving misbehavior detection system that can detect or identify misbehavior without violating the privacy of the vehicle. In the proposed method, encrypted weighted feedbacks sent from vehicles are combined using additive homomorphic properties without violating the privacy of the information. The decryption of the aggregate feedback is done securely at the trusted authority which updates the reputation score of the vehicle according to the decrypted aggregate feedback score. We have also performed comprehensive security analysis and have shown the correctness and resilience of the proposed schemes against various attacks. In addition, we have done extensive performance analysis and have shown that the computation cost of the proposed scheme is better compared to the existing schemes.},

The collaborative misbehavior detection system can be used to detect these internal or insider attacks. However, in a collaborative misbehavior detection system, an attacker may lower the detection accuracy by sending false feedback. A trust model can be used to stimulate vehicles to send true feedbacks. However, an attacker can take advantage of weak or strong reputation update methods. A dynamic trust or reputation update policy can be used to stimulate vehicles to send true feedbacks. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based dynamic reputation update policy. In the proposed scheme, feedbacks from vehicles are combined in vehicular edge computing (VEC) servers using Dempster-Shafer theory and the results are used to predict the average number of true messages. VEC then uses deep reinforcement learning to determine the optimum reputation update policy to stimulate vehicles to send true feedbacks. In addition, through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed dynamic reputation-policy is better in terms of the average number of true feedbacks compared to the existing reputation update policy.},

Most of existing P2P task offloading systems aims to solve the resource sharing between one pair exclusively without considering the cost of resource supply and the strategic behaviors of mobile users. In this paper, we propose two user models for the P2P task offloading system: honest user model and strategy user model. For the honest user model, we formulate the resource allocation maximization problem with latency and energy consumption constraints as an Integer Linear Programming. We show that the solution for honest user model can output 189% resource transactions of that for the strategic users. For the strategy user model, we propose a double auction-based P2P task offloading system, and design a truthful multi-resource transaction mechanism to maximize the number of resource transactions. We first group the mobile users based on the connected components to improve the efficiency of double auction. Then we utilize the McAfee Double Auction to price the resource transactions. Finally, we split each winning mobile user of double auction into multiple virtual mobile users, and use the matching approach to calculate the resource allocation. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the designed multi-resource transaction mechanism satisfies the desirable properties of computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget balance, truthfulness for resource request/supply, and general truthfulness for bid/ask price.},

However, the sensing cost heterogeneity among different cells (subareas) has long been ignored by existing works. Moreover, the data provided by participants are not always trustworthy, and some malicious participants may intend to launch data positioning attacks, which raises a new challenge for cell selection. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a trustworthy and cost-effective cell selection (TCECS) framework that takes cell heterogeneity and malicious participants into consideration simultaneously. To this end, we first offer to utilize an iterative statistical spatial interpolation technique to identify trustworthy participants with the help of a small portion of dedicated sensors. Furthermore, we employ the regularized mutual coherence (RMC) in compressive sensing (CS) theory to characterize the contribution to inference accuracy of measurements submitted by different trustworthy participants. Finally, the cell selection strategy, which consumes the least sensing cost while satisfying a given sensing quality, is determined via an RMC-constrained optimization problem. Extensive experiments on a real-world taxi GPS dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can mitigate the adverse effects of malicious participants and outperforms the baselines with less sensing cost for the same required sensing quality.},

However, most of the existing industrial wireless standards are based on IEEE 802.15.4, offering a very limited data rate, which prevents their adoption in critical industrial applications. Based on IEEE 802.11, a recent international standard WIA-FA is proposed to address higher communication requirements in factory automation. In this paper, we study the timeslot allocation for retransmissions in the WIA-FA network. Specifically, we first design a novel superframe to support the Negative ACKnowledgment (NACK)-based retransmission mode in the WIA-FA network, and build a network model which considers the uplink and downlink packet losses simultaneously. Then, we analyze the three major drawbacks of the default NACK-based retransmission scheme in WIA-FA and propose an Automatic On-Demand Retransmission (AODR) scheme. Finally, we give a detailed reliability analysis of the proposed AODR scheme, and prove the relationship between the transmission reliability and critical factors (e.g., the channel condition and the length of the superframe) in the WIA-FA network. Simulation results show that the proposed AODR scheme outperforms existing works in terms of transmission reliability and timeliness for different channel conditions.},

We then formulate the joint computation offloading, spectrum resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV placement (Joint-CAP) problem in the UAV-MEC network to minimize the operation cost of provisioning IoTDs. Since the Joint-CAP problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem and NP-hard, we decompose it into two sub-problems and solve the sub-problems sequentially.

However, existing IDSs require network devices with powerful computing capabilities to continuously train and update complex network models, which reduces the efficiency and defense capability of intrusion detection systems due to limited resources and untimely model updates. This work proposes a cooperative intrusion detection mechanism that offloads the training model to distributed edge devices (e.g., connected vehicles and roadside units (RSUs).

  abstract     = {Beacon broadcasting is of great importance in improving road safety and avoiding dangerous situations in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In order to support emerging vehicular applications such as autonomous driving, the reliability of beacon broadcasting becomes an indispensable issue which is also difficult given the highly dynamic topology and vehicle density. For the territories which are not covered with communication infrastructure, controlling and scheduling in a centralized way may not be applicable. Therefore, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) ad hoc communication is promising to address the ubiquitousness coverage concern. In this paper, a distributed network coding-based medium access control protocol (NC-MAC) is proposed to support V2V beacon broadcasting. We combine the preamble-based feedback mechanism, retransmissions, and network coding together to enhance broadcasting reliability. Extensive simulations are given to show the performance gain of NC-MAC protocol compared to the existing 5 G cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) MAC protocol in a wide range of scenarios including highway and urban vehicle traces generated by simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). The results show that the proposed protocol can improve the communication reliability as well as scalability.},

  abstract     = {Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential to increasing throughput in multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems with digital beamforming. CSI can be acquired by channel estimation and reported via feedback mechanisms. While the training and feedback overhead are typically proportional to the number of antennas, uplink measurements can be utilized to predict downlink CSI assuming perfect channel reciprocity in a time division duplex (TDD) mode. However, many works make the assumption that channels are perfectly reciprocal, which is often not the case in practice due to poor channel estimation and physical channel asymmetry. In this work, we investigate the key challenges in channel feedback performance, including TX-RX imbalance, channel coherence, and interference for mobile systems. We evaluate IEEE 802.11ac-based implicit and explicit feedback schemes with both emulated and in-field MIMO channels, particularly in regards to drone-based transmissions. Our analysis with channel emulation shows that implicit feedback is susceptible to channel reciprocity errors, while explicit feedback is more sensitive to Doppler effects. We propose a hybrid feedback mechanism that increases the throughput by 32% over conventional feedback methods. We additionally evaluate the impact of frequency offset asymmetry on the performance of distributed mobile systems. Our in-field experiments demonstrate that explicit feedback can provide better throughput improvement than implicit feedback in highly-mobile air-to-ground channels. Since our study spans many critical frequency bands, these results serve as a fundamental step towards understanding the impacts of asymmetric factors of channel reciprocity for drone-based beamforming systems.},

  abstract     = {Impulsive noise significantly deteriorates the performance of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based underwater acoustic (UWA) communication systems. The pulse blanking (PB) based approach can mitigate the impulsive noise. However, it causes inter-carrier interference (ICI) and signal attenuation to the receiver. In this work, we first show that the ICI introduces pronounced non-Gaussianity to the receiver chain and leads to significant performance degradation. We then propose a non-Gaussianity-aware iterative ICI cancelation scheme to mitigate the adverse impacts of PB. A companding transformation scheme is incorporated into the soft symbol computation to alleviate the non-Gaussianity of the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) caused by the residual ICI and impulsive noise. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed non-Gaussianity-aware iterative receiver achieves significant performance gains over the conventional non-Gaussianity-agnostic one with even lower computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Integrated satellite-terrestrial communications networks aim to exploit both the satellite and the ground mobile communications, thus providing genuine ubiquitous coverage. For 5G integrated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems, the timing advance (TA) is required to be estimated in the initial random access procedure in order to facilitate the uplink frame alignment among different users. However, due to the inherent characteristics of LEO satellite communication systems, e.g., wide beam coverage and long propagation delays, the existing 5G terrestrial uplink TA scheme is not applicable in the satellite networks. In this paper, we investigate location-based TA estimation for 5G integrated LEO satellite communication systems. We obtain the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements in the downlink timing and frequency synchronization phase, which are made from the satellite at different time instants. We propose to take these measurements for either UE geolocation or ephemeris estimation, thus calculating the TA value. The estimation is then formulated as a quadratic optimization problem whose globally optimal solution can be obtained by a quadratic penalty algorithm. To reduce the computational complexity, we further propose an alternative approximation method based on iteratively performing a linearization procedure on the quadratic equality constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed methods can approach the constrained Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the TA estimation and thus assure uplink frame alignment for different users.},

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA based cognitive radio network (CRN) enhances the spectral-efficiency at the cost of PLS. In this paper, a transmit-zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) technique with signal alignment is proposed to improve the PLS for MIMO-NOMA based CRN when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the base station (BS). In this study, a generalized cellular model with multi-cell is considered where each cluster is formed with a primary user (PU) and a secondary user (SU) to adopt the CRN. The locations of PU and SU are kept arbitrary within the cells. We also propose an eigen beamforming technique to improve the PLS for MIMO-NOMA based CRN when the imperfect CSI is available at the BS. For both beamforming techniques, optimum power allocation algorithms are developed for further enhancement of the PLS. Finally, a closed-form expression of the secrecy outage probability for the Nakagami-m fading channels is derived and compared with simulation results and other existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) enable vehicles to exchange safety information with the surrounding vehicles and infrastructure in order to ensure safety and efficiency in traffic management. Recently however, vehicles come from different manufacturers and therefore use different protocols for the transmission of messages. As a result, communication among vehicles become heterogeneous. Because of this, VANETs face problems related to security and performance. To address this, some heterogeneous vehicular communication-based schemes have been proposed. However, they do not perform well because of an increase in computational overhead. In order to resolve this, we propose a certificateless cryptosystem (CLC) and public key infrastructure (PKI)-based conditional privacy-preserving hybrid signcryption (CP-CPPHSC) scheme. This scheme utilizes bilinear pairings and provides security requirements in a single logical step. Through the CP-CPPHSC scheme, a message is transmitted by a vehicle using the CLC to a vehicle using the PKI. Additionally, the CP-CPPHSC scheme supports the batch unsigncryption method which helps a vehicle to unsigncrypt more than one messages simultaneously. In the random oracle model (ROM), our scheme ensures existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) with respect to a hardness assumption of q-strong Diffie-Hellman (q-SDH) and modified inverse computational Diffie-Hellman (mICDH) problems and indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) with respect to a hardness assumption of q-bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion (q-BDHI) problem. Our scheme effectively reduces computational cost when compared to state-of-the-art schemes without an increase in the communication cost.},

The proposed method maximizes the beam power towards a given set of on-directions while suppressing the power towards all off-directions. Second, by using a set of beams synthesized by the proposed on-off beam synthesis method, we design a non-interactive hierarchical beam management algorithm that can greatly reduce the radio resource usage, feedback overhead, and the latency of the beam discovery, compared to the exhaustive beam search algorithms. Since the proposed beam management algorithm is non-interactive, it can be applied to the initial access as well as the beam tracking, and is especially useful for supporting a massive number of devices.

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) is a wireless self-organized network composed of vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) providing users services. There are problems such as difficulty in maintaining end-to-end links between vehicles and RSUs, and limited bandwidth and channel resources. Incentive mechanisms are necessary to attract a sufficient number of vehicles to participate in data forwarding and share resources efficiently among vehicles in order to solve the above problems. There are two decision-making stages for a node. In the initial stage, a new node that has never participated decides whether to participate; in the following stage, the participating nodes decide whether to participate again. The current incentive mechanisms are based on traditional economics, which have two problems: 1) the role of anchors (that is, reference points) is not considered in both decision-making stages; 2) using the same utility function to evaluate two different decision-making stages which are actually affected by two different anchors. However, anchoring effect in behavioral economics has proved that people make decisions based on the experience of others (called Experimenter-Provided Anchoring, EPA) when they are first time to participate in data forwarding. They rely on their own experience (called Self-Generated Anchoring, SGA) when they already have forwarding experience. Therefore, the users&#39; decision-making in the existing incentive mechanisms deviates from reality. Based on anchoring effect, we propose a Dual-Process Mechanism (DPM), which includes the user Attraction mechanism based on Experimenter-Provided Anchoring (AEPA) and the user Continuous Working mechanism based on Self-Generated Anchoring (CWSGA). AEPA is used to motivate those new nodes to participate in data forwarding. CWSGA is used to motivate those nodes which have participated to forward data again. Simulations show that DPM has a 10% increase in cooperation rate compared with the currently most used incentive mechanism based on traditional economics, and the node utility is also improved.},

Connectivity, which is a key component for the practical implementation of vehicular light communications (VeLC) systems in ITS, must be carefully studied prior to design and implementation. In this paper, we carry out a performance evaluation study on the use of different vehicle taillights (TLs) as the transmitters in a VeLC system. We show that, the transmission coverage field of view and the link span depend on TLs illumination patterns and the transmit power levels, respectively, which fail to meet the typical communication distances in vehicular environments. This paper proposes an infrared-based VeLC system to meet the transmission range in daytimes under Sunlight noise. We show that, at the forward error correction bit error rate limit of 3.8 ×10 -3 , the communication distances of the proposed link are 63, 72, and &gt; 89 m compared with 4.5, 5.4 and 6.3 m for BMW&#39;s vehicle TL at data rates of 10, 6, and 2 Mbps, respectively.},

Each stage is implemented at a low complexity and thus the overall complexity is kept low. A priori knowledge about the channel is exploited progressively to enhance the performance.

  abstract     = {Time Division Duplex (TDD) wireless communication systems are inherently bidirectional, which facilitates exploiting channel reciprocity for pilot based channel estimation of both uplink and downlink. However, there exists a gross asymmetry in channel estimation complexity for the uplink and downlink, particularly for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) TDD systems. Usually, Base Stations (BS) with more antennas need to estimate fewer parameters from each antenna, whereas the estimation requirement is disproportionately higher at the User Equipment (UE). Unlike the UE, the BS has powerful hardware, computational resources and energy to estimate and track channel profiles accurately. To overcome this asymmetry, we propose a solution for MIMO-TDD downlink communication, wherein the post-coder part of the channel matrix is quantized at the BS, and is communicated to the UE via a low-rate channel. Using asymptotically tight lower bounds on the downlink information-theoretic rates achievable, we quantify the performance of the proposed scheme. Simulations reveal that a moderate number of quantization bits are sufficient to achieve rates close to the link capacity. We further show that in the massive MIMO regime, where the BS has many more antennas than the UE, the channel can be effectively compensated by appropriate transmit domain precoding, without any post-coder knowledge at the UE.},

  abstract     = {The nonlinear distortions attributed by the radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) and other RF circuits from the enormous bandwidth of millimeter wave (mmWave) and high frequency design limitations of the integrated circuits involved, degrade the performance of the hybrid mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This nonlinear distortions in the hybrid mmWave systems cause nonlinear coupling of the hybrid precoder with the data signals. Further, it induces intercarrier interference (ICI) in the OFDM systems, which also involves the interference from the precoders of other subcarriers. These difficulties in collusion with frequency selective channel and carrier frequency offset (CFO) may pose great challenges to the estimation accuracy of these parameters (channel gains and CFO) and signal detection. The nonlinearity causes the target posterior distribution for data detection as non-Gaussian and analytically intractable. In this work, we present a novel pilot assisted maximum likelihood (ML) based framework for estimating the CFO with PA impairment in the time domain by formulating a low dimensional equivalent channel matrix. The low dimensional equivalent channel matrix is composed of hybrid precoders-combiners, high dimensional MIMO channel, and the nonlinearly distorted components from PA. We further propose a group-sparse Bayesian learning (G-SBL) based semi-blind channel estimator in the time domain, which incorporates the CFO and nonlinearity of PA in its estimation process. With the estimated channel, a procedure to obtain the hybrid precoder and combiner matrices for data transmission is developed next. An iterative algorithm based on particle filter (PF) that effectively handles the nonlinear coupling of precoder matrix with data, and ICI is also proposed for data detection. The performance of the algorithms are evaluated on two different channel models: (a) synthetic geometric based mmWave channel (b) realistic mmWave channel for an urban microcell (UMi) environment. To validate the efficacy of the CFO and channel estimator, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian CRB (BCRB) are derived respectively.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is increasingly becoming very attractive in cloud radio access networks (CRANs) to further boost the overall spectral efficiency, connectivity and, capacity of such networks. This paper addresses optimizing the energy efficiency (EE) for the downlink of a NOMA-based two tiers CRAN. The stochastic geometry represented by Poisson Point Process (PPP) distribution is used to decide the number and locations of the base stations (BSs) in each tier within the coverage area. A numerical optimal solution is obtained and compared against a proposed subgradient solution, as well as another proposed unoptimized solution based on the false positioning method. For comparison purposes, two other power allocation techniques are presented to allocate different powers to various BS categories; one allocates the power to each BS based on their relative distances to the cloud-based central station and the other is the bisection based scheme. Two simulation scenarios are presented to examine the performance of the two-tier NOMA-CRANs with NOMA is adopted as the multiple access of each tier in both cases. The first scenario considers heterogeneous CRAN (NOMA-HCRAN) case by using two different BS categories in each tier, namely, the macro-BSs and the RRHs. The second scenario considers a homogeneous CRAN (NOMA-CRAN) case by using the RRHs in both tiers but each tier has different frequency layer to prevent cross tier interference. Simulation results show the promising performance gain can be achieved with the proposed techniques relative to the existing approaches. More specifically, it was illustrated that the proposed subgradient based NOMA CRAN offers better performance than the proposed false positioning based NOMA CRAN, which is in turn better than the existing techniques, in particular, the bisection and the distance based NOMA-CRAN.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered as a promising technology, which can effectively control the phase of signals with low-cost reflective elements. In this paper, we investigate the RIS-assisted D2D communication system under Nakagami-m fading. Overlay mode and underlay mode are discussed respectively. To characterize the performance of proposed communication system, we propose novel closed-form analytical expressions for outage probability under two modes, respectively. Based on the analytical results, we derive the diversity order of outage probability. We show that under overlay D2D mode, the diversity order depends on the number of elements and fading parameters. For the underlay D2D case, 0 diversity order is obtained due to the existence of interference. Furthermore, we study the ergodic achievable rate for each mode and the corresponding tight bounds are derived in closed form. High SNR slopes achieved by users under two modes are also discussed. We observe a high SNR slope of order 1 for overlay D2D mode and 0 for underlay D2D mode. In addition, we also investigate the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered system. Numerical results show that the optimal phase shift proposed in our paper enhance system performance effectively comparing to the traditional D2D communication and random phase shift scheme. Significant EE gains can be obtained for low to middle SNR region by passive reflectors with reconfigurable phase. Unlike relay system, the nearer RIS to the D2D transmitter/receiver, the better performance is obtained.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) network, where multiple users decode data and harvest energy from the transmitted signal of a transmitter. The proposed design framework exploits the cost-effective IRS to establish favorable communication environment to improve the fair energy efficient. In particular, we study the max-min energy efficiency (EE) of the system by jointly designing the transmit information and energy beamforming at the base station (BS), phase shifts at the IRS, as well as the power splitting (PS) ratio at all users subject to the minimum rate, minimum harvested energy, and transmit power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and thus challenging to be solved. We propose two algorithms namely penalty-based and inner approximation (IA)-based to handle the non-convexity of the optimization problem. As such, we divide the original problem into two sub-problems and apply the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for both proposed algorithms to handle it iteratively. In particular, in the penalty-based algorithm for the first sub-problem, the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique, difference of convex functions (DC) programming, majorization-minimization (MM) approach, and fractional programming theory are exploited to transform the non-convex optimization problem into a convex form that can be addressed efficiently. For the second sub-problem, a penalty-based approach is proposed to handle the optimization on the phase shifts introduced by the IRS with the proposed algorithms. For the IA-based method, we jointly optimize beamforming vectors and phase shifts while the PS ratio is solved optimally in the first sub-problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the IRS, which can significantly improve the system EE as compared to conventional benchmark schemes and also unveil a trade-off between convergence and performance gain for the two proposed algorithms.},

Specifically, two optimization problems are formulated to maximize the achievable sum rate (ASR) and energy efficiency (EE), respectively, while satisfying the individual quality of service (QoS) constraints. To ensure the stability of successive interference cancellation (SIC-stability), we specially add the power order constraints, which are often neglected in existing works. By dividing each formulated problem into more tractable inter-cluster and intra-cluster sub-problems, and deriving the corresponding solutions, we propose the ASR maximization based power allocation (ASRMax-PA) and EE maximization based power allocation (EEMax-PA) algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed ASRMax-PA (EEMax-PA) algorithm is much better than the state-of-the-art schemes in term of ASR (EE), while yields quite good EE (ASR) performance simultaneously. Moreover, both the two proposed algorithms can ensure SIC-stability, which is shown to have a significant impact on the NOMA system performance.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency transceivers operating in in-band full-duplex or frequency-division duplex mode experience strong transmitter leakage. Combined with receiver nonlinearities, this causes intermodulation products in the baseband, possibly with higher power than the desired receive signal. In order to restore the receiver signal-to-noise ratio in such scenarios, we propose two novel digital self-interference cancellation approaches based on spline interpolation. Both employ a Wiener structure, thereby matching the baseband model of the intermodulation effect. Unlike most state-of-the-art spline-based adaptive learning schemes, the proposed concept allows for complex-valued in- and output signals. The optimization of the model parameters is based on the stochastic gradient descent concept, where the convergence is supported by an appropriate step-size normalization. Additionally, we provide a gain control scheme and enable pipelining in order to facilitate a hardware implementation. An optional input transform improves the performance consistency for correlated sequences. In a realistic interference scenario, the proposed algorithms clearly outperform a state-of-the-art least mean squares variant with comparable complexity, which is specifically tailored to second-order intermodulation distortions. The high flexibility of the spline interpolation allows the spline-based Wiener models to match the performance of the kernel recursive least squares algorithm at less than 0.6 % of the arithmetic operations.},

However, the dense deployment of small cells with fractional frequency reuse in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based H-CRANs increases intra- and inter-cell interference, turning the resource allocation into a more challenging problem. In general, the macro cell users are considered as the legacy users, whereas the cellular IoT devices and small cell users share the macro cell users&#39; resource blocks in an underlaid approach. In this paper, we investigate an underlaid approach of resource allocation for small and macro cell users to improve the energy efficiency (EE) in H-CRANs. The solution approaches are derived with the Dinkelbach, Lagrange multiplier and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) methods by considering the maximum power, resource block allocation, fronthaul capacity and quality of service (QoS) constraints of macro cell users. A two-step energy efficient underlaid cellular IoT (UC-IoT) supported H-CRAN method is proposed and evaluated with the overlaid cellular IoT (OC-IoT) supported H-CRAN and underlaid H-CRAN without cellular IoT devices. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of energy efficiency and the Jain&#39;s fairness index, considering the effect of number of cellular IoT density in each small cell of the H-CRAN.

  abstract     = {The study of the fundamental limits of covert communications, where a transmitter Alice wants to send information to a desired recipient Bob without detection of that transmission by an attentive and capable warden Willie, has emerged recently as a topic of great research interest. Previous work has assumed that the distribution of the multipath fading on the channel, which we term the channel distribution information (CDI), is known to Alice, hence facilitating her characterization of Willie&#39;s capabilities to detect the signal. However, in practice, Willie tends to be passive and the environment heterogeneous, implying a lack of signaling interchange between the transmitter and Willie makes it difficult if not impossible for Alice to estimate the CDI exactly and provide covertness guarantees. In this paper, we address this issue by developing covert communication schemes for various assumptions on Alice&#39;s imperfect CDI: 1) when the transmitter knows the channel distribution is within some distance of a nominal distribution; 2) when only the mean and variance of the channel distribution are available; 3) when Alice knows the channel distribution is complex Gaussian but the variance is unknown. In each case, we formulate new optimization problems to find the power allocations that maximize covert rate subject to a covertness requirement under uncertain CDI. Moreover, Willie may be able to estimate CDI exactly or be faced with an error in estimation, and we investigate two these issues. Numerical results are presented to compare the proposed schemes from various aspects, for attaining desirable covert system performance.},

This paper proposes a novel two-stage joint hybrid precoder and combiner design for maximizing the average achievable sum-rate of frequency-selective millimeter-wave massive MIMO-OFDM systems. In the proposed approach, the analog precoder and combiner design is formulated as a constrained Tucker2 tensor decomposition problem, which allows maximizing the sum of the effective baseband gains over every subcarrier while suppressing inter-user and intra-user interferences. The solution is obtained by a projected alternate least-square-based algorithm, which is suitable for both single-user (SU) and multiuser (MU) systems. The digital precoder and combiner for SU systems is obtained from the effective baseband channel&#39; SVD. In contrast, for MU systems, it is obtained from the regularized channel diagonalization method, which balances multiuser interference and noise suppression. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {For indoor localization system, the integration of various fingerprints could intuitively improve localization accuracy since different fingerprints complement each other. In spite of the potential benefits, however, the limitation of applying various fingerprints in improving localization accuracy still remains unknown. Moreover, how to design efficient indoor localization methods through fully exploiting the features of different fingerprints is to be explored as well. In this work, we investigate the location error of a fingerprint-based indoor system with the application of hybrid fingerprints. It manifests that the location error is dependent on correlation coefficient of different types of fingerprints. For instance, the exploiting correlation between different types of fingerprints is shown to effectively reduce the location error, which gradually decreases with the number of adopted fingerprints. On this basis, we propose a hybrid received signal strength (RSS) and channel state information (CSI) localization algorithm (HRC), which is designed based on deep learning. The HRC fully exploits quick construction of fingerprint database with coarse-grained RSS and rich multipath information of fine-grained CSI. The RSS and CSI with high correlation are selected to construct fingerprint database, aiming to improve localization accuracy. Moreover, a deep auto-encoder is used to reduce the computation complexity and the deep neural network is trained for location estimation. Experimental results, which are obtained by designed indoor localization system, validate that the location error of HRC can be reduced by 77.3% and 20.3%, compared with the existing localization methods and HRC without RSS/CSI selection by correlation coefficient, respectively.},

Building upon our earlier work, we, for the first time, experimentally explore the communication performance in outdoor scenarios, even in broad daylight, and show that rather simple optical modifications help to reduce the ambient noise to enable long distance visible light communication. Our system also supports Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a variety of Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCS) up to 64-QAM and is fully compliant with IEEE 802.11. We performed an extensive series of experiments to explore the performance of our system, even using higher order MCS in daylight. Our results demonstrated a high reliability for distances up to 75m with the presented system, regardless of the time of the day.},

We apply the fundamentals of reinforcement learning (RL) to develop a power control algorithm able to learn a strategy that enhances the total data rate on the uplink channel and mitigates the neighbor cell interference. The base station (BS) uses a set of commands to specify by how much the user equipment (UE) transmit power should change. After implementing such commands, each UE reports a set of information to its serving BS, and this, in turn, predicts the next commands to achieve a suitable UE transmit power level. The BS converts the UE reports into rewards according to a predefined cost function, which impacts the longterm behavior of the UE transmit power. The simulation results indicate a near-optimum performance of the proposed framework in terms of total transmit power, total data rate, and network energy efficiency. It provides a self-exploratory power control strategy that overcomes soft dropping power control (SDPC) with similar signaling levels.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses vehicle positioning, a topic whose importance has risen dramatically in the context of future autonomous driving systems. While classical methods that use GPS and/or beacon signals from network infrastructure for triangulation tend to be sensitive to multi-paths and signal obstruction, our method exhibits robustness with respect to such phenomena. Our approach builds on the recently proposed Channel-SLAM method which first enabled leveraging of multi-path so as to improve (single) vehicle positioning. Here, we propose a cooperative mapping approach which builds upon the Channel-SLAM concept, referred to here as Team Channel-SLAM. Team Channel-SLAM not only exploits the stationary nature of many reflecting objects around the vehicle, but also capitalizes on the multi-vehicle nature of road traffic. The key intuition behind our method is the exploitation for the first time of the correlation between reflectors around multiple neighboring vehicles. An algorithm is derived for reflector selection and estimation, combined with a team particle filter (TPF) so as to achieve high precision simultaneous multiple vehicle positioning. We obtain large improvement over the single-vehicle positioning scenario, with gains being already noticeable for moderate vehicle densities, such as over 40 % improvement for a vehicle density as low as 4 vehicles in 132 meters&#39; length road.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a modulation technique that is dedicated to the high-speed mobility scenario. However, its transmission involves a two-dimensional convolution of the symbols of interest and the multipath fading channel, and it complicates the equalization. In addition to the high-complexity issue, the existing pilot pattern to estimate the unknown channel accurately requires large overhead to avoid the pilot being contaminated, which is spectrally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a receiver design by the marriage of the OTFS and a large-scale antenna array, which allows low-complexity detection and low-overhead pilot pattern design. The receiver is briefly summarized as follows. First, the received signal from each path of the multipath fading channel is identified by a high-resolution spatial matched filter beamformer facilitated by a large-scale antenna array. Then, the derivation shows that the received signal from an angle of arrival can be regarded as a flat-faded signal with rotations in both the delay and the Doppler coordinates. In addition, the identified signal from each beamforming branch in the delay-Doppler domain can be simply equalized using the channel information estimated by our pilot pattern. We further provide the estimator of the channel fading and the rotations of delay and Doppler in each identified branch. With these estimates, the delay and the Doppler shift in each identified branch can be compensated, and then, the signals from all angles of arrival are combined as different diversity versions. Furthermore, the equalization complexity is reduced to 5.0% of the message passing detection and our pilot pattern with only around 25% overhead of the existing pilot pattern ensures the same protection of the pilot. Moreover, the carrier frequency offset is considered and be compensated. The significance of the proposed receiver is its practicality, and it achieves better error performance with lower receiver complexity and lower overhead compared to the existing approaches, at the cost of a linear beamforming antenna array. The price is quite affordable, since the linear antenna array has moderate computational complexity, and it is deployed widely in current and future wireless communication systems. Eventually, the efficiency, the reliability, and the low complicacy of the proposed receiver approach are further validated by the numerical results.},

  abstract     = {The integration of satellite and the terrestrial cellular network is a promising technology to provide global ubiquitous communication. As orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted in the 3GPP standards, such as 4G LTE and the ongoing 5G new radio (NR), it will become an important feature of the satellite to achieve a high degree of commonality with the terrestrial cellular networks, i.e. LTE or 5G. For OFDM systems, synchronization is crucial for the initial attach processing. Unlike the traditional OFDM-based terrestrial cellular systems, synchronization in OFDM-based satellite is facing new challenges, due to the higher Doppler shift in the satellite system. In this paper, we analyze the impact of large doppler on the synchronization of the OFDM-based satellite system and then propose new methods to estimate the carrier frequency offset for the OFDM-based satellite. The advantages of the proposed methods are as follows: first, the proposed methods are compatible with the procedures of the LTE and NR; second, our methods are designed based on the features of the satellite channel, it is suitable for the OFDM-based satellite system; third, the complexity of our methods, whose primary computational efforts are relatively cheap matrix-vector multiplications, is lower than the previous methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a hierarchical power allocation method (HPAM) for dual-stack fuel cell (FC) hybrid locomotive powertrain. In a high-power FC application such as rail transportation, the use of multi-stack system is able to provide the primary and stable demanded power. The battery is adopted as the energy storage source (ESS) to fulfill the transient power demand fluctuations. Besides, considering that the performance of the stack will change with the operating conditions, this study also searches an online identification method based on forgetting factor recursive least square (FFRLS) algorithm to update the system parameters of the dual-PEMFC system in real time. In addition, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) scheme is employed in this study to search for the optimal solution of nonlinear constraint problems. Furthermore, it is also to ensure that the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems can operate as much as possible in the high efficiency range, and the final battery state of charge (SOC) can be close to the initial SOC. Moreover, this study also adopts the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) as benchmark to foreground the superiority of the presented method. A reduced-scale hybrid locomotive powertrain test bench is developed to demonstrate the practicability of the developed HPAM. It can be seen from the experimental results that, the proposed HPAM can optimize PEMFC systems efficiency and performances, and reduce system fuel consumption.},

However, device-level simulation is rarely implemented in electric vehicles (EVs) due to its extreme computation complexity natively introduced by the device models. To solve this problem, an interpolation strategy is designed based on the parallel-in-time algorithm for the device-level simulation of the modular multilevel converter (MMC) connected with the induction machine in EV applications. The MMC is mathematically separated as multiple submodules with the same attributes, which can be processed in a parallel manner in the graphics processing unit (GPU). By implementing the device-level simulation in the different time-step in GPU, the interpolation strategy provides the precise initial values for the nonlinear solution process iteratively. The accuracy of the proposed simulation scheme is validated by commercial simulation tools at the device level. In addition, the system-level simulation of EVs is carried out at different driving cycles, and the results demonstrate a significant reduction in simulation time.},

A fast FBG interrogator, based on linear transmission filters and direct detection, permits to measure dynamic strain up to 240 MHz frequency with a detection limit of 1.1 με and a dynamic strain resolution of 20.2 nε/√Hz. The FBG sensor was first calibrated for an internal pressure ranging from 50 to 250 bar and an energizing duration of 5ms; the FBG sensor allows to measure the static internal pressure of the injector inlet, which is linearly dependent on the FBG static strain, as well as the dynamic strain during the opening/spray/closing processes induced by pressure fluctuations, mechanical vibrations and the impact forces related to the injector needle bounces. The fast FBG interrogator, has been first validated by comparison with commercial interrogators, and then used to detect fast transients. The measured FBG strain variation provides important information on the dynamic behavior of the injector during the spray, confirmed by the analysis of the spray injection performed through a High Speed Video camera. The static and dynamic measurements demonstrate the effectiveness of the FBG sensors technology for monitoring the behavior of the injector and controlling the engine performance and emissions.},

In this paper, we have proposed a position correction model based on hybrid gated RNN, which does not need to establish a motion model like typical navigation algorithms, to avoid modeling errors in the navigation process. According to the low update rate of GPS and the slip data caused by the coverage of GPS antenna during the process of floating and diving, it does not meet the actual requirements of navigation and control. We proposed to use improved EKF and iSAM as the output of the training dataset to filter out GPS slips, then the position error is corrected at the same time. First, the normalized input sequence is fed to the two-layer hybrid gated RNN with BiLSTM output mode as sequence and LSTM output mode as last, and then the processed data is fed to the two fully connected layers with a dropout layer added in the middle. After that, the output of the position correction model can be obtained through the regression layer. To confirm the validity of the proposed model, we conducted sea trials to compare the proposed model with EKF and iSAM. The experimental results prove that the proposed position correction model performs better than EKF and iSAM in all aspects, and the correction model trained with iSAM is more effective than that trained with EKF.},

Second, four virtual voltage vectors can be found through the required locations, and the two vectors with the lowest cost will be selected by cost function. Then, additional current error correction module can better track the current. Finally, the proposed method is compared with the conventional MPCC method and another method with virtual voltage vectors. The innovation of this paper is that the recombination of vectors can better track and predict the current. A current error compensation module is added to reduce the error between the actual current and the predicted current. And the experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance such as smaller torque ripple and current THD both in steady and dynamic states.

Similarly, the heterodyning process may exhibit time delay and bandwidth restriction. Thus, an improved approach with a single high-pass filter in a stationary reference frame is proposed. The rotor position error is extracted from the high-frequency current using the sign of sine of the injected signal considering the phase shift. Consequently, the estimated reference frame LPF in the heterodyning process and the delay compensator for a stationary reference frame LPF-based approach are discarded. A phase-shift tracking observer (PSTO) independent of position error is included. Meanwhile, an online d-axis high-frequency current amplitude estimation is adopted to normalize the effect of d-axis inductance variation. The comparative study with a stationary reference frame LPF and the heterodyning process has shown that the proposed self-sensing strategy delivers an excellent speed sensorless control performance. Thanks to the online d-axis current amplitude estimation, the impact of d-axis inductance variation on speed-position identification has been improved.

The ECB type EWB 154 from Knorr-Bremse and Wheel Sensor types RSR180 and RSR123 from Frauscher Sensor Technology are represented in a comprehensive model, integrating LTSpice and CST Microwave Studio. The wheel sensor predicted readout error is 4% compared to measurements when DC current is not applied to the ECB (passive case). It is demonstrated that the RSR180 is not compatible with ECBs, whereas the RSR123 is. The impact of active (DC current fed) brakes is analyzed when performing running tests with a high-speed ICE 3 train equipped with ECBs. The model is adjusted to study the saturation of the rail and ECB pole cores. The extra damping of the wheel sensor fingerprint is modeled by an extra 6% drop that may well be applicable to passive tests in a laboratory setting to shift to active tests without actually performing them. In this way, cost and time would be saved. Based on the model outcomes, a test bench is recommended for laboratory tests to emulate active behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a robust predictive control scheme with a graphic-based delay boundary analysis to mitigate the electric vehicle (EV) drivetrain oscillating issues, subject to the multi-channel compounding-construction loop delays. The application of Controller Area Network (CAN) in autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) inevitably induces multi-channel compounding-construction loop delays into the control loop. The in-deep analyzing and understanding of the network-induced loop delays is critical for the electrified powertrain and its motion control. This study aims to guarantee, explicitly, the motion stability of AEV drivetrains as safe-critical and hard real-time applications. Firstly, a graphic-based constructional representation approach is presented for modeling of the compounding-construction loop delays. To resolve the upper bound of the compounding-construction loop delays further, a mathematic expression of delay boundary-envelopment analysis is derived. Secondly, based on the reasonable upper bound, Taylor series expansion is applied to make the system model with nonlinear uncertainties caused by the network-induced loop delays represent in the form of the convex polytope. Then, with the convex polytope of the drivetrain system model, a robust model predictive control (RMPC) approach is developed to enhance the system robustness against the unexpected network-induced delays. To attenuate the online calculation burden, a scheme combining off-line design and on-line synthesis is provided. Finally, the satisfactory motion control performance in both the co-simulations (Matlab&amp;Carsim) and bench experimental tests can strongly verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Reconstitution of control architecture creates a great challenge for distributed drive electric vehicles (DDEV), due to the emergence of a new distributed driving strategy. To this end, a novel distributed control architecture is proposed in this paper for integrated control of active front steering (AFS) system and direct yaw moment (DYC) system. First, a multi-agent system (MAS) is employed to construct a general framework, where AFS and DYC act as agents that work together to improve vehicle lateral stability and simultaneously reduce workloads of drivers during path tracking. The cooperative control strategies of two agents are obtained through Pareto-optimality theory to ensure optimal control performance of AFS and DYC. Then, on the basis of dynamic interaction between agents, terminal constraints, including terminal cost function and terminal input with local static feedback, are designed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the close-loop system. Finally, virtual simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed controller. The results indicate that the proposed control architecture can effectively preserve vehicle stability and reduce workloads of drivers, especially for the inexperienced driver. Furthermore, the hardware-in-loop (HIL) test results also demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper improves the fuel efficiency of a student-made parallel hybrid electric racing car whose internal combustion engine (ICE) either operates with peak efficiency or is turned off. The control to the ICE thus becomes a binary problem. Owing to the very limited computation resource onboard, the energy management strategy (EMS) for this car must have small time and space complexities. A computationally efficient controller that combines the advantages of dynamic programming (DP) and Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle (PMP) is developed to run on a low-cost microprocessor. DP is employed offline to calculate the optimal speed trajectory, which is used as the reference for the online PMP to determine the real-time ICE on/off status and the electric motor (EM) torques. The normal PMP derives the optimal costate trajectory through solving partial differential equations. The proposed quasi-PMP (Q-PMP) method finds the costate from the value function obtained by DP. The fuel efficiency and computational complexity of the proposed controller are compared against several state of the art methods through both model-in-the-loop (MIL) and processor-in-the-loop (PIL) simulations. The new method reaches similar fuel efficiency as the explicit DP, but requires less than 1% onboard flash memory. The performance of the Q-PMP controller is compared between binary-controlled and continuously controlled ICEs. It achieves roughly 12% higher fuel efficiency for the binary ICE with only approximately 1/3 CPU utilization.},

In this paper, we propose a novel driver fatigue detection method by embedding surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors on a steering wheel. Compared with existing methods, our approach is able to collect bio-signals in a non-intrusive way and detect driver fatigue at an earlier stage. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods with the weighted average F1 of about 90%. We also propose promising future directions to deploy this approach in real-life settings, such as applying multimodal learning using several supplementary sensors.},

A large number of replay attack signals are injected into controller area network (CAN) through external network, which greatly reduces the real-time control performance of a connected integrated motor-transmission (IMT) system. In order to ensure the performance of an IMT speed tracking system under large random message delays, a robust reset controller combined with a delay-robust speed synchronization controller satisfying energy-to-peak performance is designed in this paper. The uncertain impact caused by a replay attack is described by large random network delays which are modeled by polytopic inclusion. Then, a dynamic output-feedback controller considering the uncertainty caused by attack-delays is proposed for online speed tracking. Moreover, a robust reset controller is designed to obtain comparatively better transient response in the case of large attack-delays. In this control strategy, once the reset condition is triggered, the after-reset value calculated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) would replace the dynamic state vector. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by comparing it with model predictive control (MPC), existing PD control considering delays and energy-to-peak robust control in terms of performance.},

To extract a personalized trajectory from this cluster, we firstly adopt the fuzzy linguistic preference relation (FLPR) method to identify users&#39; preferences on driving, which can be reflected by their subjective objectives including driving safety, ride comfort and vehicle stability. Then, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal situation (TOPSIS) is utilized to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem formulated by considering the user preferences. The algorithms proposed above are integrated, and both simulation and experimental validation are conducted under lane-change scenarios of autonomous driving.

Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic contexts, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of long-term prediction tasks and lack the ability of capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies. This paper proposes an intention inference model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to tackle time series prediction problems. Considering dynamic interaction among surrounding vehicles, our model takes the sequence motion information of surrounding vehicles as inputs and calculates the congestion of different lanes, integrated with vehicle states of the object vehicle. To illustrate the availability of the proposed RNN intention inference model, a motion planning controller considering intention was developed. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) was established to planning a safe, sub-optimal path for autonomous driving vehicle under collision avoidance constraints. The experiments on the proposed model were conducted, based on two RNN structure Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Generalized Recurrent Unit (GRU), by Tensorflow with NGSIM data. The motion planning controller is modeled and simulated by Carsim with Simulink for some typical scenarios. Subsequently, experimental results demonstrate that RNN achieves best performance, inferring intention with 96% accuracy, compared with other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the energy consumption of vehicles is one of the greatest challenges we are facing in the mobility sector. A major step in this direction has been taken with the introduction of hybrid electric vehicles. Their performance, however, depends strongly on the energy management strategy used, which exploits the additional degree of freedom of the propulsion system and is inevitably limited by the lack of knowledge about the exact future driving conditions. Various attempts are being made to offer predictions, one of which is to exploit recorded travel data. In this paper, we propose an incremental graph construction algorithm that encapsulates this data in a digital representation of the road network and captures the actual travel routes of the vehicle along with the sequences of the specified measurement signals. The algorithm processes each location estimate separately, together with any desired simultaneously recorded measurement signal such as the vehicle speed, and constructs a directed graph in whose vertices the measurement data is stored. The real-time capability of this algorithm allows an up-to-date representation of both the road network and the signals it contains at all times. Whenever the vehicle is driving on an already visited route, we can obtain distance-resolved predictions by traversing the graph in the direction of travel and querying the stored measurement data. We present two techniques to efficiently store and predict this data, i.e., by using frequentist prediction intervals and Gaussian process regression. Our algorithm runs in real time and without any manual initialization, pre-, or post-processing. Verifications both during real operation on a trolley bus in public transportation and by simulation on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that the algorithm is real-time capable, that it consistently captures and predicts the recorded signals, and that it works in practice.},

The designed AIC system includes two crucial modules: the model identifier and the inverse model controller which are both the nonlinear adaptive filters constituted by neural networks. Firstly, they are both trained offline and connected with the vehicle to be the initial states of AIC system. Then, the back-propagation (BP) algorithm is used to adjust the weight parameters of the model identifier to identify the nonlinear characteristics of vehicle in real time. Simultaneously, the inverse model controller is used to be the controller of AIC system and the controller&#39;s weight parameters are tuned by the back-propagation through model (BPTM) algorithm online. A novel adaptive learning rate is introduced into the BP algorithm and the BPTM algorithm to guarantee the stability of neural networks. Finally, the inverse model controller can be regarded as the inverse of vehicle and used to solve required steering wheel angle according to the desired path to realize path tracking. The double lane change (DLC) road is used to be the desired path for emergency avoidance. The simulation results illustrate that the AIC system could realize accurate path tracking although there exist external disturbances and the AIC is an effective method to deal with the handling inverse dynamics problem for emergence avoidance.},

Based on the prediction of the queue, the EEAC strategy is designed with a hierarchical framework: the upper-stage uses dynamic programming to find the general trend of the energy-efficient speed profile, which is followed by the lower-stage model predictive controller to computes the explicit solution for a short horizon with guaranteed safe inter-vehicular distance. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the energy efficiency improvement of the EEAC strategy.

At first, by introducing a strip on the bottom layer of microstrip magnetic dipole antenna, the electric current sources are introduced for the enhancement of beamwidth together with the magnetic current source. The operation principle of an equivalent complementary source model is then revealed to provide a physical insight. As seen, the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) can be controllable and effectively enlarged by the electric length of the planar magnetic dipole antenna. Next, by using a stub crossing on the strip, the impedance bandwidth is significantly improved comparing with the unloaded counterpart. After that, the antenna size is miniaturized by etching a pair of slots to extend the length of current path. Experimental results indicate that, under a very low profile of 0.016λ 0 and 0.032λ 0 , the antenna prototypes can still achieve an impedance bandwidth of 14.5% and 20.8%, and a maximum HPBW of 99° (E-plane)/180° (H-plane) and 112° (E-plane)/159° (H-plane). It is also demonstrated that when the antenna size is reduced to 0.442λ 0 ×0.284λ 0 , the impedance bandwidth up to 14.9% and the maximum HPBW of 93° (E-plane)/231° (H-plane) can be guaranteed with a low profile about 0.032λ 0 . Comparing with other design approaches, the proposed designs feature a very low profile structure, and superior beamwidth and bandwidth properties, as well as simple configuration and compact size.},

Due to the special structure of LDPC codes according to the Release 15 (R15) 5G standard, a straight-forward extension of the existing reconfigurable scheme is in general difficult. Therefore in this paper, a unified decoding architecture is proposed that can be reconfigured to either LDPC codes or polar codes. Due to various differences between the two codes such as parity-check matrices, codeword lengths and iterative methods, a joint decoding algorithm is introduced by reordering basic decoding operations to the unified add-comparison-add pattern for both codes. Then, a pipelined structure of reconfigurable decoding unit (RDU) is presented correspondingly which is fully compatible with all decoding patterns of the R15 standard. And finally, a reconfigurable decoder is proposed with multiple levels of parallelism, and the reconfiguration scheme is introduced to improve the hardware utilization and decoding efficiency. The proposed decoder is implemented in FPGA and ASIC, respectively, and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in throughput and area efficiency compared to LDPC-only and polar-only decoders.},

  abstract     = {The coexistence of microwave (MW) and millimeter wave (MMW) technologies is considered as the development tendency of the future 5G wireless communication system. In this paper, a single-port, single-layer, dual-band antenna with large frequency ratio is proposed to support the MW and MMW applications. This antenna mainly consists of a stub-loaded microstrip line in the center, two slot-loaded rectangular patches on the lateral sides, and two thin microstrip lines in-between which connect the former two. The stub-loaded microstrip line works as a series-fed MMW linear array at 26 GHz, and simultaneously it serves as the feed line for the MW patches operating at 4.85 GHz. The connection lines are elaborately designed to isolate the MW patches from the MMW signal, guaranteeing the radiation performance of the antenna at the two bands without requiring complicated filter. For verification, a prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 3.1% and a peak gain of 8.93 dBi at the 4.85-GHz MW band, while an impedance bandwidth of 19% and a peak gain of 13.57 dBi at the 26-GHz MMW band.},

  abstract     = {Self-driving technology has made great advancements with the help of artificial intelligence and intelligent transportation system. Recent studies have shown that traffic efficiency and safety of autonomous vehicles can be further improved by autonomous platooning based on vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, hybrid traffic where autonomous platoons (APs) and individual human driven-vehicles (HDVs) co-exists is seldom considered. Wireless Access in the Vehicular Environment (WAVE) is the de facto wireless protocol for VANETs. WAVE has provided one control channel (CCH) and six service channels (SCHs). The multi-channel access scheme should be jointly designed along with the CCH communication protocol. To design a reliable and efficient communication protocol for hybrid traffic, we propose a platoon-centric multi-channel access scheme based on the reliable broadcast. The reliable broadcast scheme utilizes an enhanced RTS/CTS mechanism designed for multicast communications. A broadcast frequency control mechanism is proposed to balance CCH access intervals. Our scheme can improve the reliability of CCH communication and increase SCH utilization with minimal overhead. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed mechanism.},

Containers in vehicles may suffer from potential attacks which can lead to resource degradation and further cause the decrease in the dependability and security of CDU service. Failover technique can be deployed in an in-vehicle system and then performs protective operation for mitigating the impact of resources degradation and guaranteeing service resilience. This paper aims to quantitatively analyze the availability, reliability and security of CDU service in the vehicle platooning system deploying failover technique. We construct an analytical model to describe the interaction between resources degradation and rejuvenation behaviors of the vehicle platooning system. Then we derive the formulas of availability, Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) for evaluating reliability and Mean Security Capacity to Failure (MSCF) for evaluating security. Simulation and analytical experiments are applied to demonstrate the approximate accuracy of our model and investigate the impact of system parameters on metrics, respectively, which helps service providers make decisions on how to organize vehicles to perform CDU service and how to set system parameter values for maximizing their benefits.},

For charging the UAVs those are extremely power hungry, charging towers are considered for plug-and-play charging during run-time operations. The charging towers should be cost-effective, thus it is equipped with photovoltaic power generation and energy storage systems functionalities. Furthermore, the towers should be cooperative for more cost-effectiveness by intelligent energy sharing. Based on the needs and setting, this paper proposes 1) charging scheduling between UAVs and towers and 2) cooperative energy managements among towers. For charging scheduling, the UAVs and towers should be scheduled for maximizing charging energy amounts and the scheduled pairs should determine charging energy allocation amounts. Here, two decisions are correlated, i.e. , it is a non-convex problem. We re-formulate the non-convex to convex for guaranteeing optimal solutions. Lastly, the cooperative energy sharing among towers is designed and implemented with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and then intelligent energy sharing can be realized. We can observe that the two methods are related and it should be managed, coordinated, and harmonized by a centralized orchestration manager under the consideration of fairness, energy-efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

In these areas, using drones instead of infrastructures to provide edge computing services can be an efficient solution. However, the limited coverage of drones makes it challenging to provide effective edge computing services. In this paper, we propose an edge computing architecture based on the cooperation among the drones with and without edge servers to provide edge computing services for the users, where the computing tasks are transmitted in multi-path and multi-hop in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). To extend the lifetime of a MANET while ensuring service quality, we formulate a joint optimization problem, which assigns a suitable computing drone, a transmission path and a task division scheme for each task. The problem is investigated using a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller, which can get a partial solution of the problem through a greedy algorithm. By adding a task arrival order constraint, we approximate the original problem as a multi-path multi-hop task transmission problem, which can be solved according to the movement state of a MANET. Specifically, when a MANET is stationary, we propose a traversal method to obtain the optimal solution of the approximate problem; when a MANET is dynamic, we propose a heuristic scheme to get a suboptimal solution of the problem based on average rate. Experimental results show that our scheme has a better performance compared to typical existing ones.},

However, the tremendous amount of transmitted vehicular sensor data represents a massive challenge for the cellular network. A promising method for achieving relief which allows to utilize the existing network resources in a more efficient way is the utilization of intelligence on the end-edge-cloud devices. Through machine learning-based identification and exploitation of highly resource efficient data transmission opportunities, the client devices are able to participate in overall network resource optimization process. In this work, we present a novel client-based opportunistic data transmission method for delay-tolerant applications which is based on a hybrid machine learning approach: Supervised learning is applied to forecast the currently achievable data rate which serves as the metric for the reinforcement learning-based data transfer scheduling process. In addition, unsupervised learning is applied to uncover geospatially-dependent uncertainties within the prediction model. In a comprehensive real world evaluation in the public cellular networks of three German Mobile Network Operator (MNO), we show that the average data rate can be improved by up to 223% while simultaneously reducing the amount of occupied network resources by up to 89%. As a side-effect of preferring more robust network conditions for the data transfer, the transmission-related power consumption is reduced by up to 73%. The price to pay is an increased Age of Information (AoI) of the sensor data.},

In our considered scenario, autonomous vehicles periodically sense the environment, offload sensor data to an edge server for processing, and receive computing results from the server. Due to mobility and computing latency, a vehicle travels some distance in the duration between the instant of offloading its sensor data and the instant of receiving the computing result. Our objective is finding a scheduling scheme for the edge sever to minimize the above traveled distance of vehicles. The approach is to determine the processing order according to individual vehicle mobility and computing capability of the edge server. We formulate a restless multi-arm bandit (RMAB) problem, design a Whittle index based stochastic scheduling scheme, and determine the index using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. The proposed scheduling scheme avoids the time-consuming policy exploration common in DRL scheduling approaches and makes effectual decisions with low complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed indexed-based scheme can deliver computing results to the vehicles promptly while adapting to time-variant vehicle mobility.},

This context-aware distributed learning mechanism is then developed and applied to address intelligent object detection, which is one of the most critical challenges in modern intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method, which demonstrates a higher learning accuracy with better precision, recall and F1 score, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under 6G network configuration by achieving faster convergence, and scales better with larger numbers of RSUs involved in the learning process.},

The tension raised due to the conflicting attention requirements of driving and information retrieval can be resolved by designing information retrieval solutions that demand minimal user interaction. In this paper, we construct a Personalized Search Query Generator (PSQG) to reduce driver-mobile interaction during information retrieval in the 6 G era. This system has a query generator and a query recommendation component that update two sets of relationships dynamically: one is the query and the title, another is search and recommendation. The proposed system learns a user&#39;s intent based on historical query records and recommends personalized queries, thus reducing the driver-mobile interaction time. We deploy the system into a real search engine and conduct several online experiments. These experiments are conducted using a custom constructed dataset comprising ten million samples. We use the BLEU-score metric and perform A/B testing. The results demonstrate that our system can assist users in making precise queries efficiently.

  abstract     = {The Internet of vehicles (IoV) is a large information interaction network that collects information on vehicles, roads and pedestrians. One of the important uses of vehicle networks is to meet the entertainment needs of driving users through communication between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). Due to the limited storage space of RSUs, determining the content cached in each RSU is a key challenge. With the development of 5G and video editing technology, short video systems have become increasingly popular. Current widely used cache update methods, such as partial file precaching and content popularity- and user interest-based determination, are inefficient for such systems. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a QoE-driven edge caching method for the IoV based on deep reinforcement learning. First, a class-based user interest model is established. Compared with the traditional file popularity- and user interest distribution-based cache update methods, the proposed method is more suitable for systems with a large number of small files. Second, a quality of experience (QoE)-driven RSU cache model is established based on the proposed class-based user interest model. Third, a deep reinforcement learning method is designed to address the QoE-driven RSU cache update issue effectively. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The new paradigm, Internet of Vehicles, has turned on-road vehicles into intelligent service providers, making full use of on-board processing and storage capabilities. With the advent of 6 G technology, e.g., millimeter wave and terahertz, fast and massive data transfers become possible between moving objects. In this paper, we consider a scenario where vehicles act as mobile edge caching nodes and form a local cloud, to provide popular contents for nearby users via 6 G communication. To maximize the efficiency of content allocation under the limitation of short communication range, we first predict the driving trajectories of vehicles with a Markov chain model and estimate the popularity level of contents in each urban area. Next, we design a scoring system based on the above predictions to compare users&#39; satisfaction and computational efficiency of different algorithms. Finally, we find a subset of vehicles with appropriate content to serve the demand in the area. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional methods by providing a cost-efficient content allocation solution with lower delay.},

  abstract     = {With the development of artificial intelligence(AI), unmanned vehicles can relieve traffic jamming and decrease the risk of traffic accidents, where deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role and have become one of the most critical technologies. Nevertheless, DNNs are still susceptible to adversarial examples. Even worse, they also show severe performance degradation when the system needs DNNs to learn new knowledge without forgetting the old one. As unmanned vehicles travel on the road, they need to frequently learn new categories and different representations. Learning all data after the new sample arrives will expend a lot of time and space. As a result, it will affect the deployment of artificial intelligence in unmanned scenes. In recent years, it has been observed that incremental learning technology can solve the above challenges. However, previously reported works mainly focused on batch learning. It is not clear how much impact the adversarial attack will have on the deep learning model when performing incremental learning tasks. This issue exposes the hidden safety risks of unmanned driving and increases discuss opportunities. Therefore, we propose an adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques for unmanned scenes in this paper. Specifically, it can retain information previously learned by the model. At the same time, it can renew the old model to learn new model, thereby continually adding small perturbation to legitimate examples. A couple of experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has been conducted, and the experiment results show that the adversarial attack based on incremental learning techniques has a higher attack success rate. Further, it can improve the successful attack rate by 8.43%.},

Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-rate (CAN-FD) is a feasible choice to meet the high bandwidth and low latency requirements of in-vehicle communication of mobile vehicles. However, CAN-FD is vulnerable to masquerade attacks because it lacks necessary security authentication mechanisms and protection measures. This study presents a security enhancement technique called forward-backward exploration for independent in-vehicle CAN-FD messages while still guaranteeing each message is real-time. In the forward-backward exploration solution, a novel dual-pointer (including the forward pointer and the backward pointer) solution is proposed; the Message Authentication Code (MAC) size of each message is then dynamically adjusted by presenting the dual-pointer movement rules until the total payload no longer increases. Experimental results with real-life CAN-FD message set provided by an automaker demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.},

  abstract     = {The ubiquity of private vehicles with positioning services leaves a great deal of mobility data in the physical world, which supports abundant mobile applications in the Internet of Vehicles. Despite numerous desirable features that the data provide, the social relationship privacy inherent in private vehicle mobility data has gone with little notice. The relevant work that concentrates on social relation privacy either only considers the temporal and spatial features, attempts to obtain the explicit venue cooccurrence frequency statistics of mobility data, or characterizes the semantics of locations by directly matching the POI information to the location. In this paper, we propose a SEmantic-aware and Memory-Efficient scheme (SEME) for inferring social relationships from private vehicle mobility data. We determine the probability distribution of the visit purpose for each stopover location in vehicle trajectories by a probabilistic generative model with a latent variable of semantic feature vectors that embeds the semantic information, time context, and correlations. Labeling the trajectories with visit purposes, we derive a mobility feature vector for each driver with a feature learning model. Based on the mobility feature vectors, the similarity score that indicates the social connection strength can be pairwise-computed with an effective measurement, i.e., the cosine similarity. Additionally, for both scalability and computational efficiency, we convert the large-scale similarity calculation to an extended version of a maximum inner-product search problem and derive the closed-form solution of binary codes which is used to approximately solve the problem. To evaluate the performance of SEME, we conduct experiments with respect to effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness based on real-world private vehicle trajectories. The evaluation results demonstrate that our scheme improves the inference accuracy and reduces the time cost of similarity calculation.},

Hence how to preserve the data privacy of users during the learning process has become a public concern. To address this concern, under the celebrated framework of differential privacy (DP), we present in this paper a decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent (D-PSGD) algorithm, called DP 2 -SGD, which can offer protection for privacy of users in vehicular networks. With thorough analysis we show that DP 2 -SGD satisfies (ε,δ)- DP while the learning efficiency is the same as D-PSGD without privacy preservation. We also propose a refined algorithm called EC-SGD by introducing an error-compensate strategy. Extensive experiments show that EC-SGD can further improve the convergence efficiency over DP 2 -SGD in reality.},

Therefore, blockchain will be the most promising technology to ensure the security and privacy of 6 G and vehicle networks. In this article, we propose a novel IoV block-streaming service awareness and trusted verification in 6 G. The edge node uploads the microservices and calling diagram of microservices to the blockchain network. The blockchain network serves as an intermediate verification platform for the edge node and the IoV equipment to record the evidence of interaction between the two ends. Moreover, combined with identity-based blind signature technology, we have designed a security scheme in which IoV devices anonymously request services from edge nodes, which can realize the mutual authentication of IoV devices and edge servers while keeping the user&#39;s real identity information confidential. In addition, an edge caching mechanism based on user requests and service awareness is designed to pre-compile services at edge nodes, improve the cache hit rate of service requests from vehicle users on the edge server, and achieve efficient processing of resource requests from users.},

By leveraging a single root Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence with an elaborate set of cyclic shift offsets to generate all the available preamble sequences, the proposed scheme can achieve rapid collision detection and load estimation in one-shot correlation operation, while having the robustness to the non-orthogonal interference. The preamble detection probability, collision detection probability, and load monitoring accuracy, are mathematically analyzed, and an optimal set of preamble selection probabilities is given to maximize the overall load monitoring accuracy.

The design objective is to minimize the time average of a weighted sum of energy consumption and execution delay, meanwhile stabilizing the battery energy queue. To this end, we formulate the problem as a statistic program and propose a dynamic computation offloading (DCO) algorithm in which the transmitter covariance matrix, CPU-cycle frequencies for local computing, and partial offloading ratio are jointly optimized. Based on Lyapunov optimization, the program is first transformed into a nonconvex per-time slot problem. Then, we solve it by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, where a sequence of convex problems are created and solved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal and outperforms several benchmark schemes in terms of both the average system cost and task drop ratio.},

Specifically, a deep Q-network (DQN) is conceived for capturing the relationship between the optimal routing decision and the local geographic information observed by the forwarding node. The DQN is trained in an offline manner based on historical flight data and then stored by each airplane for assisting their routing decisions during flight. To boost the learning efficiency and the online adaptability of the proposed DQN-routing, we further exploit the knowledge concerning the system&#39;s dynamics by using a deep value network (DVN) conceived with a feedback mechanism. Our simulation results show that both DQN-routing and DVN-routing achieve lower E2E delay than the benchmark protocol, and DVN-routing performs similarly to the optimal routing that relies on perfect global information.},

Utilizing the diversity gain of CIOD transmission, the proposed scheme, named CIOD-IM, provides an improved spectral efficiency by means of IM. In order to provide a satisfactory secrecy rate, we design a particular artificial noise matrix, which does not affect the performance of the legitimate receiver, while deteriorating the performance of the eavesdropper. We derive expressions of the ergodic secrecy rate and the theoretical bit error rate upper bound. In addition, we analyze the case of imperfect channel estimation by taking practical concerns into consideration. It is shown via computer simulations that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing IM-based schemes and might be a candidate for future secure communication systems.},

We then develop an optimization problem which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to maximize the rank of the effective channel matrix subject to the introduced constraints. We further provide a channel estimation and precoding scheme for the base station and each V2V transmitter over the equivalent reduced-dimensional channels based on the solution of MILP.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a channel estimation scheme for spatial modulation (SM) systems. In general, SM systems require each transmit antenna to separately send pilot symbols for channel estimation. This is a lengthy process, which may incur significant channel estimation errors in a time varying channel. Thus, we propose correlation-based channel estimation (CBCE) scheme, which exploits the correlation between transmit antennas to estimate channels of inactive antennas using the pilot-based estimate of the active antenna. The change in the active channel from the last pilot-based estimate is calculated, and a time-proportionate amount of that change is scaled according to the channel correlation coefficients to estimate the channel state of the inactive channels. With pilot slots designed to spread out in a data frame, the estimation process for every channel is carried out N t times in a data frame with N t denoting the number of transmit antennas. We observe that in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, our proposed scheme provides about 2 dB and 5 dB gains compared to conventional channel estimation (CCE) method for moderately correlated and highly correlated antennas, respectively. Through Monte Carlo simulations with different correlation ρ and user speeds, we validate our analysis and show that the proposed scheme outperforms CCE when ρ ≥ 0.3, while it provides comparable performance for small ρ.},

When synthesizing the desired transmit beampattern, the degrees of freedom of waveform design is limited, which introduces high multi-user interference (MUI), thus degrading the communication performance. Inspired by the applications of the Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) in mitigating MUI, in this paper, we investigate joint waveform design and passive beamforming in RIS-assisted DFRC system. We first study the minimization of MUI under the strict beampattern constraint by jointly optimizing DFRC waveform and RIS phase shift matrix. To deal with the coupled variables, we propose an alternating algorithm based on manifold optimization. Subsequently, the trade-off between radar and communication performances is investigated. Simulation results show that for both cases of strict beampattern and trade-off design, with the help of RIS, the system throughput can be significantly improved. Moreover, compared with the scenario where no RIS is employed, the obtained beampattern matches with the target transmit beampattern better.},

The radio resource limit and outage in dimensioning make classical inhomogeneous Poisson assumption of uplink served user point process questionable. In this paper, we first prove that this process admits a homogeneous Poisson distribution in the limiting regime. As a consequence, uplink coverage probabilities over log-normal shadowing for both schemes are derived. Then, tractable stochastic geometry models for two schemes are proposed to obtain numbers of total required radio blocks. Their upper bounds under an outage constraint are also given to reduce computing overhead. Finally, the simulations confirm accuracy of derivations and demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.},

This paper figures out the gain of spatially multiplexed index code by jointly designing the multicast beamformer and index code.

At the first step, for an arbitrary index code, conjugate gradient-based multi-group multicast beamforming is designed.

In response to such demands, the reconfigurable holographic metasurface (RHS) is evolving into a promising solution owing to its flexible beam steering capability with low power and hardware costs. Unlike traditional phased antenna arrays with independent phase shifters, the RHS can generate desired beams by radiation amplitude control of the reference wave propagating along the metasurface. This so-called holographic interference technique enables an ultra-thin, small-sized planar antenna structure, which is suitable for integrated implementation without any complex phase-shifting or power-division circuits. In this paper, we consider an RHS-aided wideband communication system with an RHS-equipped base station. We aim to maximize the achievable data rate via joint digital beamforming (DBF) and holographic beamforming (HBF). To defeat the beam squint loss brought by the frequency-selective nature, we leverage the additivity of holographic interference patterns to design a novel amplitude control algorithm for solving the HBF subproblem, which contributes to our proposed joint DBF and HBF scheme.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the spectrum allocation problem between spectrum service providers (SSPs) and terminals equipped with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated radar and communication (IRC) systems. In particular, IRC-equipped terminals such as autonomous vehicles need to buy spectrum for their radar functions, e.g., sensing and detecting distant vehicles, and communication functions, e.g., transmitting sensing data to road-side units. The terminals determine their spectrum demands from the SSPs subject to their IRC performance requirements, while the SSPs compete with each other on the service prices to attract terminals. Taking into account the complicated interactions, a hierarchical Stackelberg game is proposed to reconcile the spectrum demand and service price, where the SSPs are the leaders and the terminals are the followers. Due to the spectrum constraints of the SSPs, we model the lower-layer subgame among the terminals as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem. An iterative searching algorithm is then developed that guarantees the convergence to the Stackelberg equilibrium. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in terms of social welfare compared to baseline schemes.},

It consists of a microwave magneto-electric (ME) dipole antenna and a millimeter-wave parallel-plate resonator antenna (PPRA). It has two vertical conducting walls that form an upper-band parallel-plate resonator and meanwhile provide a magnetic source to the lower-band ME dipole. The design is a shared-aperture structure and is therefore very compact. For demonstration, a dual-frequency antenna simultaneously covering the 5.9-GHz vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) band (5.855–5.925 GHz) and the 28-GHz 5G band (27.5–28.35 GHz) was designed, fabricated, and measured. Good agreement between the measured and simulated results was found. The lower and upper bands have the measured 10-dB impedance bandwidths of 41.6% (5.30–8.08 GHz) and 6.66% (27.15–29.02 GHz), and measured peak antenna gains of 5.80 dBi and 8.46 dBi, respectively. The antenna can be used on vehicular platforms for providing V2V communications and 5G millimeter-wave connections simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {With the broad deployment of Wi-Fi networks, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) based Wi-Fi indoor localization has attained much interest of both academia and industry. At present, most of the currently available Wi-Fi indoor localization techniques focus on increasing the localization accuracy. However, few of them take into account the diversity of Wi-Fi signal distributions and the measurement error associated with RSS values owing to the complicated indoor environment, which consequently results in the low robustness of indoor localization systems. Thus, with the motivation to tackle this gripping problem, we design a new hybrid hypothesis test based on the idea of Asymptotic Relative Efficiency (ARE), which exploits signal distributions by considering different Access Point (AP) contributions to the Wi-Fi indoor localization accuracy. In concrete terms, first of all, the Jarque-Bera (JB) test is used to perform the normality test on the Wi-Fi signal distribution at each Reference Point (RP), and then the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) approach is applied to obtain each AP contribution degree. Secondly, based on the evaluation of the JB test on the Wi-Fi signal distribution, the hybrid Mann-Whitney U and T test is applied to find the set of matching RPs corresponding to each newly-collected RSS data. Finally, the target location estimate is acquired by using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), where the contribution degree of each AP is assigned as the weight during the calculation to find matching RPs. From the extensive experimental results, it is evident that the proposed approach can successfully improve the system performance by achieving a higher localization accuracy and enhanced robustness when compared with the state-of-the-art Wi-Fi indoor localization techniques.},

Alternating optimization is applied to minimize the total energy consumption of WPT, EC, and cooling, while satisfying the computation deadlines of the devices. A key aspect is that semi-closed-form solutions are derived for the WPT power, offloading duration, and CPU frequency by applying the Lagrange duality method. With the solutions, the alternating optimization converges quickly and indistinguishably closely to the lower bound of the energy consumption. The semi-closed-form solutions also reveal the structure underlying the optimal solution to the problem, and can validate the result of the alternating optimization. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm can save up to 90.4% the energy of existing benchmarks in our considered cases.},

In this paper, we investigate energy minimization for UAV-aided communication networks by jointly optimizing data-transmission scheduling and UAV hovering time. The formulated problem is combinatorial and non-convex with bilinear constraints. To tackle the problem, firstly, we provide an optimal algorithm (OPT) and a golden section search heuristic algorithm (GSS-HEU). Both solutions are served as offline performance benchmarks which might not be suitable for online operations. Towards this end, from a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) perspective, we propose an actor-critic-based deep stochastic online scheduling (AC-DSOS) algorithm and develop a set of approaches to confine the action space. Compared to conventional RL/DRL, the novelty of AC-DSOS lies in handling two major issues, i.e., exponentially-increased action space and infeasible actions. Numerical results show that AC-DSOS is able to provide feasible solutions, and save around 25-30% energy compared to two conventional deep AC-DRL algorithms. Compared to the developed GSS-HEU, AC-DSOS consumes around 10% higher energy but reduces the computational time from second-level to millisecond-level.},

  abstract     = {Due to the harsh deployment environment of the Industrial Internet of Things, the reliability of data transmission has always been an important challenge and a hot topic in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Based on a multiple sink node network model, we propose a reliable routing algorithm called SFPAG-R, which is based on sealed first-price auction games. The algorithm offers a route discovery process and data transmission mechanism using the multi-sink network structure. The classic sealed first-price auction game is improved, and we propose a sealed first-price auction game model based on standard normal distribution, in order to ensure that the auction nodes can obtain higher returns. Based on an analysis of the factors affecting reliable data transmission in a large-scale, industrial IoT system, a data forwarding auction game model is established. Finally, to address the issue of selfish nodes, a dynamic revenue control method is proposed to promote cooperation between nodes. The simulation results indicate that the SFPAG-R algorithm proposed in this paper can reliably reduce the average amount of hops that occur during data transmission, ensure a high rate of successful data transmission, balance network energy consumption, and prolong the network&#39;s life cycle.},

In this context, typical solutions must deal with events that may change the state of the network, providing a service that continuously maintains a high level of performance. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a distributed architecture that leverages a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) technique to dynamically offload tasks from UAVs to the edge cloud. Nodes of the system co-operate to jointly minimize the overall latency perceived by the user and the energy usage on UAVs by continuously learning from the environment the best action, which entails the decision of offloading and, in this case, the best transmission technology, i.e., Wi-Fi or cellular. Results validate our distributed architecture and show the effectiveness of the approach in reaching the above targets.},

As a result, the communication delay of participating users is minimized in C-D2D networks. Clearly, the success of C-D2D networks relies on the willingness of the participating users to share their cached content. In this paper, we analyze the interaction among participating cache-enabled D2D users and determine their caching, sharing, and reward decisions to minimize the users&#39; total cost. In view of the fact that the participating users have heterogeneous content interest profile (CIP) and storage capacity, and are self-centric, there is a need to design a fair incentive mechanism to encourage cooperation among users. To this end, we model the interaction among the D2D users as a multi-person bargaining game and design a novel incentive mechanism using the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) approach. The proposed incentive mechanism is capable of minimizing users&#39; total costs while ensuring fair reward transfer among participating users. Further, we proposed a distributed algorithm which allows the execution of the proposed mechanism without any involvement of base station (BS), which is much needed for autonomous D2D networks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism improves fairness by at least 74% and reduces the users&#39; total cost by at least 13.83% compared to the benchmark schemes.},

In this paper, a Particle Filter-based Indoor Navigation (PFIN) framework is proposed for the drone navigation process. In PFIN, Quadcopter Mapping Algorithm (QMA) is proposed using particle filter analysis to aid in mapping for indoor navigation. In addition, particle filter-based Optimized Localization Algorithm (OLA) and Adaptive Velocity Procedure (AVP) are proposed for the purpose of enhancing the precision in localization and to improve the velocity estimation for collision avoidance, respectively. Thus, the proposed PFIN framework is experimented using Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) tools such as Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo for visualizing its behavior, and Crazyflie 2.0 drone assisted Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation in verifying the correctness of the algorithms in a laboratory setup. The PFIN framework reduces position error on an average by 14% than the conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) model. The SITL and HITL simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms through improved precision in UAV exploration.},

The main idea of the proposed approach is to use a hybrid of proactive retransmission and reactive retransmission mechanisms during file transfer. Analytical models are built in various transmission cases to study the effect of link disruption on reliable transmission of BP, with focus on the number of failed transmission attempts, file delivery time and goodput performance normalized with respect to the total amount of data sent.

The concept of space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN), which is one of the enabling technologies and architectures for future 6 G wireless networks, can provide a solution to the network control and resource allocation problems for massive IoTs. In this paper, a novel STIN based network control and resource allocation problem is proposed for massive IoTs and solved through state of the art hierarchical deep actor-critic networks (H-DAC). The massive IoT networks spread over urban vicinity where cooperation can be possible. This is leveraged to negotiate a joint policy for per unit spectrum which the IoT networks are willing to pay. Deep actor-critic based reinforcement learning (RL) is used in this paper to solve the joint network control and resource allocation problem which is modeled as a utility maximization problem. The RL based algorithms solve the problem of cost per unit spectrum for the federated cloud of IoT networks and the data rate assigned to each IoT network and IoT devices. The algorithm also decides whether to transmit either through the space network or the terrestrial network. We validate performance of our proposed H-DAC scheme by comparing it with results of variants of the actor-critic based RL.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel framework based on Lagrange coded computing (LCC) for fast and secure offloading of computing tasks in the mobile edge computing (MEC) network. The network is formed by multiple base stations (BSs) acting as “masters” which offload their computations to edge devices acting as “workers”. The framework aims to ensure efficient allocation of computing loads and bandwidths to workers, and providing them with proper incentives to finish their tasks by the specified deadlines. Thus, each master must decide on the amounts of allocated load and bandwidth, and a service fee paid to each worker given that: i) other masters, i.e., BSs, can be privately-owned or controlled by different operators, i.e., they do not communicate/coordinate their decisions with the master; ii) workers are heterogeneous non-dedicated edge devices with constrained and nondeterministic computing resources. As such, masters compete for the best workers in a stochastic and partially-observable environment. To describe interactions between masters and workers, we formulate a new stochastic auction model with contingent values of bidders, i.e., masters and contingent payments to auctioneers, i.e., workers. To solve the auction, we represent it as a stochastic Bayesian game and develop machine learning algorithms to improve the auction solution.},

  abstract     = {We consider a set of cellular users associated with a base station (BS) in a cellular network that employs Device-to-device (D2D) communication. A subset of the users request for some files from a server associated with the BS. Now, some of the users can potentially act as relays and forward the requested files, or partitions of files, from the BS to some of the requesting users (destination nodes) over D2D links. However, this requires cooperation among the cellular users. Also, when cellular users cooperate with each other, the total amount of energy consumed in transferring the requested files from the BS to the destination nodes can usually be considerably reduced compared to the case when each user separately downloads the file it needs from the BS. In this paper, we seek conditions under which users have an incentive to cooperate with each other. To this end, we model the above scenario using the frameworks of cooperative game theory and stable partitions in coalitional games. We consider two different models for file transfer within a coalition: (i) Model A, in which the BS can split a file into multiple partitions and send these partitions to different relays, which multicast the partitions to the destination nodes of the coalition, and (ii) Model B, in which for each file, the BS sends the entire file to a single relay, which multicasts it to the destination nodes of the coalition. First, we explore the question of whether it is beneficial for all the cellular users to cooperate, i.e., whether the grand coalition is stable. For this we use the solution concept of core from cooperative game theory. We show that, in general, the above coalitional game under Model A may have an empty core, i.e., it may not be possible to stabilize the grand coalition. Next, we provide conditions under which 1) the core is always non-empty and 2) a &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathbb {D}_c$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;-stable partition always exists. Also, we show that under Model B, the problem of assigning relays to destination nodes so as to maximize the sum of utilities of all the users is NP-Complete. Finally, using numerical computations, we evaluate the energy consumption of the cellular users under the cooperation and no cooperation cases for Model A and the performance of different heuristics for solving the above problem of assigning relays to destination nodes under Model B.},

  abstract     = {In narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), a link adaptation technique can be performed, considering multiple resource unit types, repetition numbers, and modulation-coding schemes, to enhance transmission reliability. Then, a base station should allocate downlink and uplink resources for each device using the link adaptation decision to transmit data in NB-IoT frame structures. However, because narrowband physical random access channels (NPRACHs) will occupy the partial uplink radio resource, the uplink transmission of a device using the assigned uplink radio resource without considering NPRACHs will cause severe interference. To solve the above issue, this article investigates the joint link adaptation and uplink resource allocation problem with the consideration of NPRACHs. The objective is to minimize the consumption of radio resources while the uplink data requirement of each device can be satisfied. We prove our target problem is NP -hard and cannot be approximated with a ratio better than 3/2. Then, we propose a dynamic-programming algorithm without considering NPRACHs for the link adaptation problem and finally propose an uplink resource allocation algorithm considering NPRACHs based on the dynamic-programming algorithm. We prove that the proposed dynamic-programming algorithm with pseudo-polynomial time can find an optimal solution for the link adaptation problem. Compared with two previous algorithms, the simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

Blockchain which has transparency, decentralization and immutability nature is treated as a promising approach to support intelligent vehicle systems. However, due to the high data update overhead, vulnerable raw data storage policy and inflexible consensus algorithm, traditional blockchain technologies are not suitable in modern vehicular systems. Hence, we propose, a blockchain data storage system that supports incremental data updating. Specifically, the system reduces the re-uploaded data size through smart contract and data partition to decrease the overhead. Besides, data replica and multi-data source addressing of index on the chain enhance the data reliability. In addition, an adaptive proof-of-work algorithm is developed, whose execution cost is dynamically adjusted based on nodes&#39; behavior. It greatly improves the data record and updating efficiency. Comprehensive experimental results show that BUS can effectively improve the data updating efficiency with low overhead and fewer resources in intelligent vehicle scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the nature of battery-operated sensors, the residual energy of their battery should be considered when a sink node collects sensory data from them. If a sink attempts to collect data from a sensor that does not have sufficient residual energy to transmit data, the utilization of wireless communication resources may be degraded. However, requiring a periodic residual energy report of the sensors considerably reduces the energy efficiency of them. Consequently, the sink node must be able to estimate the residual energy of the sensors without additional information exchange before attempting to collect data. To tackle this problem, we propose a data collection scheme for mobile sinks in cellular Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. The scheme consists of two phases. In the first phase, the mobile sink estimates the residual energy of the surrounding sensors. To reduce the complexity, we design a state diagram composed of three states based on the Markov chain of the sensor. The sink node calculates the communicable likelihood of each sensor based on the state diagram and collects data from the sensor with the highest likelihood. In the second phase, a cellular base station (BS) selects the appropriate mobile sink to improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the signal from a cellular user. Each sink node delivers the bidding price to the BS based on the likelihoods of the sensors. The BS determines an appropriate sink node to allocate resources based on the received bidding prices. Moreover, we show the performance of the proposed method in terms of SINR and IoT network utilization through simulation.},

  abstract     = {Capable of supporting the on-demand high-rate connection towards the core network, wireless millimeter wave (mmWave) backhaul becomes an appealing solution with the growing deployment of small cell base stations (BSs). However, the application of wireless backhaul would impose great limitations on the admission of BSs and the access rate, resulting in a tight coupling between backhaul and radio access network (RAN). In this light, we comprehensively investigate the performance of small cell networks (SCN) in terms of network spatial throughput (ST), supposing that backhaul is conveyed from gateways to BSs through mmWave links. Our results show that the coupling effect makes network ST in the RAN greatly dependent on gateway density &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\lambda _{\mathrm{G}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and suffer exponential degradation with over-provision of backhaul. It manifests that, if excessive backhaul capacity is provided by deploying more gateways, the exacerbating BS-generated interference deteriorates spatial reuse gain, thereby degrading network ST. Thus, leveraging the coupling between backhaul and RAN, we further conduct a joint optimization of BS and gateway densities to improve network ST. Remarkably, the optimization could mitigate the dependence of network ST on &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\lambda _{\mathrm{G}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and brings a 2-fold increase in network ST, which is inversely proportional to mmWave beamforming beamwidth.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) marks the paradigm shift from a single large drone to multiple small drones linked together in an ad-hoc fashion. To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) in the multi-hop networking schema, FANETs utilize the available resources efficiently. However, due to open wireless boundary and high mobility of the drones, the FANETs are vulnerable to malicious nodes that can penetrate the network and, thus, pose serious security threats, particularly at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Such susceptibility compromises the network security and privacy and harms the information exchange operation within the network. The attacker can either transmit a large number of reservation requests to waste the bandwidth, listen to the control messages, conduct power-efficient jamming or falsify the information to manipulate the network control. Therefore, secure access control and a key agreement mechanism are required. The mechanism must utilize the two phases, i.e., node authentication and key agreement, to counter the aforementioned attacks. Our contribution, in this paper, is a certificate-based access control and key agreement scheme, which is based on the technique of Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and employs a collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function. In order to assess the viability and performance of the proposed scheme, we analyze it using formal security analysis techniques, such as the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The scheme is also evaluated using the informal security analysis technique, or the non-mathematical approach. The results obtained from both analyses affirm the superiority of our proposed scheme.},

Meanwhile, each BS also transmits data to a near-user using the NOMA protocol. The common far-user adopts the maximal ratio combining (MRC) technique to decode its desired data by treating the data of near users as interference. Each near-user decodes the data of far-user using the MRC technique and cancels it to decode its own data by treating the remaining undesired data as interference.

In this study, we propose a cluster-based CAN-FD frame packing framework by presenting two strategies, namely, a strategy that maximizes frame size (MAXFS) and a strategy that minimizes frame bus utilization (MINFBU). We first use MAXFS to pack the signal with the same period into a frame and maximize the frame size; then, MINFBU is used to pack the signal into any frame and minimize bus utilization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can reduce bus utilization and deviation rate more effectively compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is of capital importance for the 5G wireless networks and has received a lot of attention recently. Motivated by the hard delay requirement for URLLC, we aim at devising medium access control (MAC) schemes that can guarantee packet transmissions within a bounded delay. The model we considered is a multi-channel single-hop ad hoc network in which each node has packets to broadcast to other nodes. This broadcast scenario is common, and has been extensively studied in various scenarios such as safety message broadcast in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Most of the existing MAC schemes employ backoff algorithms to handle transmission failures caused by channel collisions, and thus cannot provide a hard guarantee on transmission delay. Moreover, these schemes rely on time synchronization and coordination among the nodes, which would cause heavy overhead for control message exchange. In this paper, we focus on devising MAC schemes to provide a hard guarantee on broadcast delay, without time synchronization and cooperation among the nodes. We employ the sequence scheme in which each node is pre-assigned a periodic sequence to schedule transmissions and receptions at each time slot. These sequences are referred to as schedule sequences. Since each node starts its transmission schedule independently, there exist relative time offsets among the schedule sequences they use. Previous sequence schemes for broadcast are only conducted in the single channel context. Our objective is to design schedule sequences such that in a multi-channel system, each node can transmit at least one packet to each of its neighbors successfully within a common period, no matter what the time offsets are. The sequence period should be designed as short as possible. In this paper, we analyze the lower bound on sequence period, and propose a sequence construction method by which the period can achieve the same order as the lower bound. We also consider the random scheme in which each node transmits or receives on a channel at each time slot with a pre-determined probability. The frame length and broadcast completion time under different schemes are compared by numerical studies.},

In this work we consider the index coding problem (ICP) over noisy channel in V2V communication phase of message dissemination. The ICP in V2V communication is considered as device to device ICP with transmitting nodes as receiving nodes also. An achievable solution for index coding problem in V2V communication is proposed considering vehicles with same download capability. This solution is used in noisy broadcast scenario over AWGN channel and the broadcast vectors are mapped to suitable M-PSK signal constellations to save bandwidth, thus increasing the bandwidth efficiency. An algorithm is proposed to derive suitable mapping of the broadcast vectors to M-PSK signal constellation for improving the error performance. Performance improvement in terms of PSK index coding gain is discussed. While one vehicle transmits, the proposed algorithm provides performance improvement for at least one of the remaining vehicles, in most of the scenarios, while not penalizing the other vehicles.},

In order to acquire the knowledge of all individual channels at the BS directly, we propose two-timescale channel estimation algorithms with one-stage training (OST) scheme based on the above time-varying channel characteristics. Specifically, the two-timescale channel estimation problem is firstly formulated as an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) problem. Then, we design batch algorithm to solve the resultant optimization problem. Moreover, to overcome the drawbacks of batch algorithm, a low-complexity online algorithm is also proposed based on the two-stage stochastic optimization framework.

This paper aims at identifying cases where code-domain NOMA can improve the spectral efficiency of mMIMO in the classical regime where K &lt;; M. Novel spectral efficiency expressions are provided for the uplink and downlink with arbitrary spreading signatures and spatial correlation matrices. Particular attention is devoted to the planar arrays that are currently being deployed in pre-5G and 5G networks (in sub-$6$ GHz bands), which are characterized by limited spatial resolution. Numerical results show that mMIMO with such planar arrays can benefit from NOMA in scenarios where the UEs are spatially close to each other. A two-step UE grouping scheme is proposed for NOMA-aided mMIMO systems that is applicable to the spatial correlation matrices of the UEs that are currently active in each cell. Numerical results are used to investigate the performance of the algorithm under different operating conditions and types of spreading signatures (orthogonal, sparse and random sets). The analysis reveals that orthogonal signatures provide the highest average spectral efficiency.},

The degrees of freedom for system design are the transmit/receive beampatterns at the radar array, and the receive beampattern at the communication array. Firstly, we adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) as design metrics and formulate the design problem as a KLD maximization problem with QoS and transmit power constraints. Secondly, we solve the original non-convex problem through the proposed alternating direction sequential relaxation programming (ADSRP) algorithm, which iteratively optimizes three subproblems: 1) dual-function transmit beamforming with the constraints of QoS and transmit power; 2) radar receive beamforming; and 3) communication receive beamforming. We analytical provide the monotonic improvement and bound of KLD, which guarantees the convergence of the ADSRP algorithm. Finally, simulation results are provided to evaluate the effects of different QoS requirements and peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) constraints in terms of power allocation scheme and radar detection performance, compared to the traditional radar system (TRS).},

As a benefit of its carefully controlled complexity, the resultant system is eminently suitable for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in multiuser scenarios, since it requires a low number of turbo iterations between the detector and the decoder. In particular, a pair of HDD schemes are proposed. HDD-I and HDD-II achieve a complexity reduction of up to 25% and 36%, respectively, at a similar bit error rate (BER) performance as that of JDD. Additionally, we propose an adaptive turbo-coded SCMA system for mitigating the influence of multipath propagation so that the system&#39;s bits per symbol (BPS) throughput may be improved under favorable channel conditions by using the most appropriate near-instantaneous user load, modulation order and coding rate. Our adaptive system design principle can also be readily used for other channel coding schemes.},

The regularized zero-forcing (RZF) beamforming is able to provide good performance with the capability of achieving numerical stability and robustness to the channel uncertainty. However, in massive MIMO systems, the matrix inversion operation in RZF beamforming becomes computationally expensive. To address this computational issue, we shall propose a novel randomized sketching based RZF beamforming approach with low computational complexity. This is achieved by solving a linear system via randomized sketching based on the preconditioned Richard iteration, which guarantees high quality approximations to the optimal solution. We theoretically prove that the sequence of approximations obtained iteratively converges to the exact RZF beamforming matrix linearly fast as the number of iterations increases. Also, it turns out that the system sum-rate for such sequence of approximations converges to the exact one at a linear convergence rate. Our simulation results verify our theoretical findings.},

The detection efficiency of the NN receiver is attributed to a key parameter entitled as an optimal average cost function which is formulated from the soft decision statistics that is reached by the NN receiver in 3000 training epochs owing to the prudent selection of all hyper-parameters. Both the simplicity and detection efficiency of the NN receiver are quantified by i) a comparison as well as a comprehensive performance evaluation conducted with the classic Rake receiver structures in a broad range of chaotic communication scenarios involving mobility and ii) derivation of simple expressions to compute the computational complexities. The performance results demonstrate that the proposed NN receiver cuts-down the computational complexity by 76% while attaining and maintaining a very high performance gain of 30 dB in signal-to-noise ratio on average for all test scenarios.},

Because of good allocation efficiency and fairness, auction based mechanisms have been extensively studied in DSA, in which truthfulness is a critical property to guarantee that each bidder can obtain her maximal utility by bidding with her true valuation of bidding spectrum. However, existing spectrum auction mechanisms on homogenous channels strictly require bidders to bid one channel or multiple channels with continuous demands, and does not consider the noncontinuous demands for channels. In this paper, we propose THIMBLE, the first TrutHful Incentive Mechanism for flexiBle muLtichannEl allocation by considering bidders&#39; continuous/noncontinuous demands for channels and spatial reusability. Specifically, bidders using the same channel without interference are formulated to a group, and a group bid recalculation method is presented for noncontinuous group bids. Next, a winner selection and charging method based on group bids is designed to achieve truthfulness. Extensive simulation results show that THIMBLE achieves not only truthfulness in continuous and noncontinuous channel demand cases, but also as good spectrum allocation efficiency as existing spectrum auction mechanisms.},

We formulate a PNC mapping scheme as a function of clusters of estimated summation and difference (SD) of the transmitted symbols from user pairs. Utilizing existing linear detection schemes, such as Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), a cluster of SD symbols are detected using an SD linearly transformed channel matrix. Furthermore, utilizing Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) soft decoding, the SD symbols are mapped to the PNC symbols, leveraging on the PNC symbol that maximizes the likelihood function. For each variant of M-QAM, we derive and simplify a specialization of the generalized PNC mapping function. The error performance results, through simulation, reveal that the proposed PNC scheme achieves twice the spectral efficiency in Massive MIMO, without changing the latter&#39;s underlying framework and without any degradation in the bit-error-rate (BER). In fact, our investigation has proved that the BER of the proposed Massive MIMO and PNC is slightly better than that of the conventional Massive MIMO.

Here NOMA is used in the secondary network, where K half duplex, decode-and-forward (DF) relays are available for assisting the secondary base station (SBS) to deliver information to the secondary users (SUs). We derive analytical expressions for the outage probabilities experienced by the SUs under imperfect successive interference cancellation (i-SIC) conditions. The interference threshold constraint of the primary receiver and the maximum transmit power constraint of the secondary nodes are considered for the analysis. To provide more insights on the outage performance, we obtain expressions for the asymptotic outage probabilities of the SUs in the high transmit power region. Next, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal power allocation (OPA) factors at the SBS and at the selected relay that independently maximize the delay limited throughput of the secondary network in CR-NOMA system. We also determine the jointly optimal power allocation factors that maximize the throughput. We use numerical and simulation investigations to establish that the outage probabilities of the SUs reduce significantly while the throughput improves under the considered PRS scheme, compared to random relay selection and fixed relaying strategies. Further, it is established that the proposed OPA factors can significantly reduce the outage probabilities experienced by the SUs and improve the system throughput compared to equal/random power allocation schemes.},

  abstract     = {We consider a millimeter-wave communication system where the fading channel follows the Nakagami-m distribution. We derive performance limits of such a system in terms of the diversity and coding gains. First, we argue that although traditional design criteria for space-time codes (STCs) are optimal for Rayleigh and Rician fading channels, they fail to capture the optimal diversity and coding gains for Nakagami-m fading channels. Then, we derive a tight upper bound on the average pair-wise error probability at high signal-to-noise ratios. From such a bound, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the diversity and coding gains of any STC over the Nakagami-m fading channel. We then identify necessary and sufficient conditions for STCs to achieve the upper bounds, leading to a fundamental trade-off between maximizing the diversity and coding gains. We also investigate the effect of blockage using stochastic geometry. We show that the diversity and coding gains are limited by the non-line-of-sight link. Numerical simulations assuming different fading scenarios further illustrate that STCs that satisfy the new design achieve full diversity. Whereas, STCs that are otherwise optimal for Rayleigh and Rician channels do not. Furthermore, in a typical indoor environment, blockage reduces the coding gain by 1.5 dB for BERs less than 10 -3 .},

  abstract     = {Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) is one of the key technologies identified for future wireless networks to mitigate inter-cell interference, especially in a dense deployment scenario. However, CoMP can&#39;t be realized for the whole network due to its computational complexity, synchronization between coordinating base stations (BSs) and high backhaul (BH) capacity requirement. BSs need to be clustered into smaller groups and CoMP can be activated within these smaller clusters. In this paper, we develop a multi-objective, dynamic clustering model for multi-user, joint-transmission CoMP to jointly optimize spectral efficiency (SE), radio access network (RAN) load and BH load. We formulate our load-aware model as two coalitional sub-games for small cell and user equipment clustering, respectively. Merge/split/transfer actions for each sub-game are defined and a complexity and stability analysis is provided. Extensive simulation results show that our model provides as good SE in low load when compared to a greedy model, and significantly better load balancing with a reduced number of unsatisfied users and increased throughput in high load scenario. On average 49% increase in the overall system throughput is observed in our simulations when compared to the greedy model.},

  abstract     = {In downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with multiuser clustering, a single beamforming (BF) vector precodes the superimposed signal of strong and weak users. This precoding results in an imperfect inter-cluster interference (ICI) cancellation at weak users since the BF vectors are designed based on strong users’ channels. Also, the ICI is highly increased with the number of transmit antennas, causing severe degradation in the performance of weak users and total system. In this paper, first , a new cooperative NOMA is introduced, in which weak user beam-matching (WBM) equalizer is proposed to remove the ICI at weak users by matching weak users’ channels with the designed BF vectors. The process of WBM is accomplished with the aid of device-to-device (D2D) channel state information (CSI) sharing between the nearby strong and weak users. Second , based on WBM principle, strong user beam-matching (SBM) equalizer is proposed to eliminate the generated ICI at strong users in the case of limited feedback. Third , a new power allocation strategy is proposed to improve weak users’ performance by considering the gained throughput from interference cancellation. Finally , besides the sum-rate, which is adopted as the performance metric by most of the existing NOMA works, the bit error rate (BER) of NOMA users in cooperative NOMA is calculated and compared with those in other schemes. Simulation results show that our cooperative NOMA with the proposed equalizers achieves significant sum-rate and BER improvements over other non-cooperative schemes with both perfect and limited feedback scenarios.},

With high density deployment of small base stations (SBSs), mobile user equipments (UEs) will suffer frequent and unnecessary handovers (HOs) which severely degrade the quality of service (QoS) and/or quality of experience (QoE). To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-attribute mobility management strategy according to link reliability level and throughput requirement. In particularly, the reference signal received quality (RSRQ) and speed of UE are taken into account for the link reliability index. Besides, the minimum throughput is considered for guaranteeing QoS requirement of users. The UE reconnects the target small cell with the highest priority, which are calculated according to link index, QoS index, and corresponding weights. The goal of proposed mobility management scheme is to improve HO performance and QoS of UEs. Extensive simulation experiences with different traffic types are evaluated and the simulation results indicate the effectiveness of our mobility management strategy in terms of throughput and HO delay.},

The proposed precoder is based on maximum-ratio processing and aims to enhance the channel hardening effect at the users. This is achieved through dividing each channel vector by its norm square. Closed-form expressions for the achievable spectral efficiency of the conventional and proposed precoders are derived. If modeled with Rayleigh fading, due to the physical hardening property of this channel, a moderate gain in performance is produced by the proposed precoding method, where the highest spectral efficiency gain occurs for a small number of users and user antennas. Under Rayleigh fading, the results also demonstrate that similar performance is returned by increasing the number of users or user antennas. By comparison, the proposed precoder is shown to produce significant performance gains in the keyhole channels under the condition that the system is limited to single-antenna users. Corresponding to this, the results showcase how the performance of massive MIMO under keyhole channels is heavily dependent on increasing the number of served users over user antennas.},

In this paper, we present the performance analysis of a multi-antenna-assisted two-user downlink NOMA system in an underlay spectrum sharing system. We derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable sum-rate and outage probability of the secondary network under a peak interference constraint and/or peak power constraint, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) of the interference link between secondary transmitter (ST) and primary receiver (PR). For the case where the ST has a fixed power budget, we show that performance can be divided into two specific regimes, where either the interference constraint or the power constraint primarily dictates the performance. Our results confirm that the NOMA-based underlay spectrum sharing system significantly outperforms its orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based counterpart, by achieving higher average sum-rate and lower outage probability. We also show the effect of information loss at the ST in terms of CSI of the link between the ST and PR on the system performance. Moreover, we also present closed-form expressions for the optimal power allocation coefficient that minimizes the outage probability of the NOMA system for the special case where the secondary users are each equipped with a single antenna. A close agreement between the simulation and analytical results confirms the correctness of the presented analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the possibility of estimating the number of people inside a below-deck ship compartment using the theory of room electromagnetics. Most RF-based occupancy detection solutions focus on residential environments. Confined metallic spaces such in industrial environments are more hostile and exhibit features of a reverberant cavity. The theory of room electromagnetics provides a simple characterization of microwave propagation in such environments. By considering the indoor environment as a lossy cavity, the exponential decay rate of the power-delay profile (PDP), also known as reverberation time (RT), is related to the total absorption inside the room. First, we verify the reverberating nature of the room by measuring the RT at different locations inside the room. The PDPs are calculated from the channel impulse response (CIR) measured using the MIMOSA radio channel sounder. Then, the relation between RT and the number of people inside the room is investigated. We show that it is possible to estimate the number of stationary people with a good accuracy, depending on the number of antennas used. With a success rate of 88%, the estimation error is only one person when 16 spatially averaged PDPs are used. Higher success rates are achievable with more spatial averaging. Moreover, off-the-shelf (OTS) ultra wide band (UWB) devices are used to estimate the number of people inside the same room. Results show that temporal averaging of PDPs can further improve the success rate to 95% when people inside the room are moving. In addition, the detection of a lone person falling to the ground is investigated based on the Doppler analysis of the measured CIRs. It is shown that the Doppler spread in case of a fall has higher peak values compared to normal activities, such as walking and sitting. With the use of a simple Bayes classifier, a fall is detected with 98% accuracy and 100% sensitivity.},

However, the wrong selection of the best relay arising from outdated channel state information (CSI) in fast time-varying channels substantially degrades its performance. With the proliferation of high-mobility applications and the adoption of higher frequency bands in 5G and beyond systems, the problem of outdated CSI will become more serious. Therefore, the design of a novel cooperative method that is applicable to not only slow fading but also fast fading is increasingly of importance. To this end, we develop and analyze a deep-learning-aided cooperative method coined predictive relay selection (PRS) in this article. It can remarkably improve the quality of CSI through fading channel prediction while retaining the simplicity of ORS by selecting a single opportunistic relay so as to avoid the complexity of multi-relay coordination and synchronization. Information-theoretic analysis and numerical results in terms of outage probability and channel capacity reveal that PRS achieves full diversity gain in slow fading wireless environments and substantially outperforms the existing schemes in fast fading channels.},

Millimeter wave (MMW) technology features large antenna arrays with high directional beamforming gain and dense base station (BS) deployment that is also beneficial for WPT. This paper focuses on the hybrid deployment of sub-6 GHz and MMW networks, where the user equipment (UE) can simultaneously receive information and harvest energy from either sub-6 GHz or MMW BSs. By using a stochastic geometry framework, we develop analytical expressions for the energy coverage probability (ECP) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise coverage probability (SCP) of a typical user, where the BS and UE locations are modeled by either a Poisson point process (PPP) or a Poisson cluster process (PCP). We further incorporate the unique characteristics of MMW communications in the analysis and study the impact of the practical energy harvesting model on the system performance. Numerical results are provided to validate the accuracy of the analytical models. The results demonstrate that the ECP depends on the considered UE models, where for the PPP model, as the cluster size of BS increases, the ECP increases. In contrast, for the PCP model, the ECP decreases with the increasing of BS cluster size. The results also show that the energy coverage probabilities for both PPP and PCP users converge to the PPP model as the cluster size tends to infinity.},

In this paper, the physical layer security (PLS) for a RIS-aided NOMA 6G networks is investigated, in which a RIS is deployed to assist the two “dead zone” NOMA users and both internal and external eavesdropping are considered. For the scenario with only internal eavesdropping, we consider the worst case that the near-end user is untrusted and may try to intercept the information of far-end user. A joint beamforming and power allocation sub-optimal scheme is proposed to improve the system PLS. Then we extend our work to a scenario with both internal and external eavesdropping. Two sub-scenarios are considered in this scenario: one is the sub-scenario without channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers, and another is the sub-scenario where the eavesdroppers&#39; CSI are available. For the both sub-scenarios, a noise beamforming scheme is introduced to be against the external eavesdroppers. An optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to further improve the system physical security for the second sub-scenario. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed schemes. Moreover, it has also been shown that increasing the number of reflecting elements can bring more gain in secrecy performance than that of the transmit antennas.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques are able to enhance the channel capacity by multiplexing the space dimension resources. By constructing distributed satellite MIMO scenarios, MIMO techniques can be potentially employed to satellite communication networks. In this paper, we study the capacity performance of a distributed satellite communication network with the MIMO scheme that contains two geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites and a terrestrial antenna array. Specifically, the model of two kinds of terrestrial antenna array, uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA), are proposed and the coordinate representation of the array elements is provided by coordinate system transformation. Then, the analytical expressions of the system capacity with different antenna arrays are derived considering the rotation angle of the antenna array. The Min-Max ratio is investigated for both ULA and UCA to gain further insights of the system capacity performance. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate the analytical expressions, show the impact of the rotation angle and other system parameters on the capacity performance. The research results show that ULA is preferred for terrestrial users with fixed locations and the maximum channel capacity can be obtained through adjusting the rotation angle while UCA is not only suitable for fixed locations, but can also be used in mobile scenarios such as vehicles, ships to ensure the stability of the system capacity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a downlink intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO with lens antenna array, i.e., IRS-aided mmWave beamspace NOMA, where the single-antenna users without direct-link but connected to the base station (BS) with the aid of the IRS are grouped as one NOMA group. Considering the power leakage problem in beamspace channel and the per-antenna power constraint, we propose two multi-beam selection strategies for the BS-IRS link under two channel models, i.e., 2-dimension (2D) channel model and 3-dimension (3D) channel model, respectively, where two corresponding RF chain configuration strategies are designed, respectively. Then, we formulate and solve the optimization problem for maximizing the weighted sum rate by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS and the passive beamforming at the IRS, where we propose the alternating optimization (AO) method to solve the above joint optimization problem. Especially, different from the stochastic method, based on the beam-splitting technique, we propose the method to initialize the feasible solution for the proposed AO method, where the conditional transmit power minimization problem is formulated and solved. Through simulations, the weighted sum rate performance of the proposed IRS-aided mmWave beamspace NOMA is verified.},

  abstract     = {Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are important measures of the quality of service in cellular networks. There are multiple efforts by cellular carriers and 5G standardization on the use of crowdsourcing to minimize drive tests (MDT) and self-organize the network while improving KPIs via a user feedback loop. Since propagation highly depends upon the environment, readily-available geographical data could be coupled with the crowdsourced user data to infer performance. In this paper, we build a framework to infer KPIs by establishing a relationship between geographical data and crowdsourced channel measurements via neural networks. In particular, for a specific user location, we leverage delay spread measurements in the region to design a cone-shaped filter for the geographical and user data extraction. Then, a location-specific received signal power prediction is obtained via the neural network trained using the extracted geographical and user data. We study the impact of the angle chosen for the cone and various features selected on location-specific KPI prediction. We then leverage the location-specific inference by repeating the prediction over a set of locations in a region to infer the path loss in a given environment. In both types of KPI inference, we compare against state-of-the-art solutions and show that significant improvement in KPI prediction accuracy is achieved using the proposed strategy. Furthermore, for network planners, we show that our framework can use only geographical information to predict KPIs with a negligible error in user locations that lack signal quality data. By employing the proposed framework to predict location-specific and regional KPIs, we achieve an accurate estimation of network coverage and a 7-fold reduction in throughput estimation error compared to a state-of-the-art solution.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of degradation in performance of multi-carrier multi-user massive MIMO systems when channel induced Doppler spread is high. Recently, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to channel induced Doppler spread. In OTFS based systems, information symbols are embedded in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain where they are jointly modulated to generate the time-domain transmit signal. Due to the multi-path delay and Doppler shifts, the DD domain information symbols need to be jointly demodulated at the receiver. For multi-carrier based communication (e.g., Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)), massive MIMO systems have been shown to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency with low complexity multi-user precoding in the downlink. Extending the same to OTFS based downlink multi-user massive MIMO systems is challenging due to the requirement for joint demodulation of all information symbols at the user terminal (UT). In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing a novel OTFS based multi-user precoder at the base station (BS) and a corresponding low complexity detector (LCD) at the user terminals (UTs), which allows for separate demodulation of each DD domain information symbol at the UT. The complexity of the proposed precoder increases only linearly with increasing number of BS antennas Q and the number of UTs. We show, through analysis, that as Q increases (with total transmitted power decreased linearly with Q), the proposed low complexity detector achieves a sum spectral efficiency close to that achieved with optimal joint demodulation at each UT. Numerical simulations confirm our analysis and also show that the spectral efficiency and error rate performance of the proposed OTFS based massive MIMO precoder (with the proposed LCD detector at each UT) is significantly more robust to channel induced Doppler spread when compared to OFDM based multi-user massive MIMO systems.},

For longitudinal state estimation, the constant turn rate and acceleration (CTRA) model is adopted and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used for estimator construction. For lateral state estimation, a PTV lateral motion model constructed based on the bicycle model and PTV lateral motion relative to the road reference is used. However, the steering angle of the conventional human-driven PTV is unknown, and PTV parameters such as cornering stiffness are uncertain. To provide more accurate PTV lateral states, the design of a state estimator that handles both unknown control inputs and uncertain model parameters is investigated in this study. First, considering that the model parameters are unobservable with the conventional iteration-based method, a system model-based method that measures uncertain parameters via estimated states is proposed. With this method, the observability of uncertain model parameters is naturally established, as the system model fully characterizes the relationship between system states and model parameters. Then, the sensor measurements and estimated states are combined as measurements, and a state-input-parameter mixed Kalman filter (SIPMKF) is proposed to cope with the coexistence of uncertain model parameters and unknown control inputs for PTV lateral state estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed PTV longitudinal-lateral state estimation architecture is verified via simulations and experiments.},

In this paper, we investigate the application of the regenerative electromagnetic retarder&#39;s energy recovery method to the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) of an EV. When the EV was driven downhill or coasts, L-C resonance via switched capacitor was used to control the voltage generated by the PMSM as a voltage that can recharge the battery. During regeneration, the voltage generated in the PMSM varied along with the degree of resonance through switching the duty of the proposed circuit. Through simulation, DC-Link voltage according to switching duty ratio and motor speed is plotted in a 3D map. Based on this, voltage control algorithm using PI and reverse PI duty control has been proposed. To prove the proposed algorithm, the DC-link stage of the inverter is simply equivalent to the R-C model. And, if the PMSM operates at a constant speed, the generated voltage is controlled so as to charge the battery. In addition, the discharging and charging energies of the battery are simulated when the EV with certain load torque is driving uphill and downhill. Considering the dynamics of the car, the energy recovery rate was simulated when the EV is driving uphill and downhill in a 50:50 ratio at the same slope and distance. The simulations were conducted using MATLAB Simulink, and the experiments were carried out using a motor-generator set and a small electric truck equipped with a 13 kW PMSM, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The battery thermal management system of an electric vehicle consumes considerable energy when cooling the battery, which can reduce the driving range. To minimize the energy consumption of the battery cooling system, controllers need to be designed as an optimal control problem. A model predictive control can be applied to the optimal controller design, which can be implemented in real-time but at the cost of a small loss of optimality. The performance of a model predictive controller is affected by its cost structure, which is typically composed of the transition cost and the terminal cost. The transition cost is defined by the controller objective, and energy consumption is one example. However, the terminal cost is user defined and it is the main design factor for the controller performance. In model predictive control, the terminal cost is usually formulated to penalize the state variations, which can cause loss of optimality. In this study, the terminal cost is formulated to represent the cost from the end of the prediction horizon to infinity, which is called the cost-to-go. This approach is consistent at the point of an optimal control problem, and the controller with cost-to-go can achieve more optimal performance than one that penalizes state variations. In the proposed model predictive controller, the cost-to-go is approximated by the optimal expected cost that can be calculated using stochastic dynamic programming. The proposed controller reduces the energy consumption significantly in comparison to a typical model predictive controller without increasing the computing load.},

  abstract     = {Slip controllers are crucial for railway vehicle operation when a high tractive effort is required. The slip controllers have been developed for decades, and their developments continue. The developed slip controllers are based on many more or less effective principles. One of the perspective slip controllers determines a phase shift between an injected excitation signal to the required torque of the electric drive and the signal representation in a measured wheel angular velocity. The slip controllers that are based on the principle can effectively work with any adhesion conditions. However, the slip controller principle has some drawbacks like high filtration requirements, possible failure due to mechanical shock in the wheel-rail contact and long response time. The paper proposes a novel phase shift detection method for the slip controller based on an unscented Kalman filter that can cope with the known disadvantages of the original slip controller. When the proper output of the UKF is used, the slip controller becomes faster, more reliable and can work when the original slip controller fails. The proposed slip controller was verified on the measured data in an open-loop calculation and the mathematical model in the closed-loop simulation.},

Therefore, a novel theory of controlling the transmitter array is necessary for electromagnetic compatibility and user safety. In this study, we optimize the input currents at the transmitter array and the load impedance at the receiver to maximize PTE under the cancellation condition of the magnetic field leakage. Simulations show that the proposed method reduces magnetic field leakage by more than 10 and 38 dB, with and without ferrite plates, respectively, compared with existing PTE maximization methods, even when there is a lateral misalignment between the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, experiments using coils having ferrite plates show that the proposed method reduces magnetic field leakage by more than 6.75 dB.

  abstract     = {Unified waveform design for automotive joint radar-communications (JRC) leverages the scarce spectrum efficiently and has become a key topic for investigation of late. Designing such a waveform necessitates meeting the requirements of both systems, thereby making it a challenging task. The contribution of this paper is to formulate the JRC design problem into an optimization problem and propose an algorithm to maximize the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise-ratio (SCNR) of radar system and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at communicating vehicle, simultaneously. Central to this are the exploitation of the communication link to acquire environment/ channel information and enhance radar tasks, flexibility to impart trade-off between the two systems during design as well the formulation of the optimization problem to include sidelobe constraints and yield solutions robust to Doppler shifts. The designed waveforms exhibit enhanced radar performance in terms of probability of detection and communication performance in terms of bit error rate (BER), while taking into account the trade-off between two systems. The numerical simulations corroborate the claim of optimized performance with environment/ channel information, ease of effecting trade-off and the use of design flexibility.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of motor characteristics prediction according to driving cycle can be improved by taking temperature change of motor into account. From this point of view, this paper proposes a fast and accurate coupled analysis method. To calculate motor circuit parameters, electromagnetic finite element analysis (FEA) is used. The proposed method consists of two stages to exclude the time consuming FEA from repetitive process. In pre-process stage, the circuit parameters are stored as look-up tables (LUTs) considering motor temperature. Further, a technique that allows reducing the number of analyses is developed to consider a wide operating temperature range with less time consumption. In main process stage, the torque and voltage equations are solved using the circuit parameter LUTs. Among the solved motor characteristics, losses are applied to lumped parameter thermal network (LPTN) as heat sources to figure out thermal characteristics. Here, techniques including loss separation and thermal parameter tuning are introduced to improve both accuracy and speed of the LPTN. Since the computation of the characteristic equations and LPTN are fast, the iterative analysis at entire time steps of the driving cycle is facilitated. An example of the proposed method is presented using worldwide harmonized light vehicle test procedure (WLTP). Thereafter, the effectiveness of the method is discussed by comparison with conventional methods. Finally, the experimental verifications are conducted to validate the electromagnetic FEA and LPTN used in this study.},

In addition, it is utilized as an early warning system to prevent the battery&#39;s failure. Recent advance in Machine Learning (ML) is an enabler for new data-driven estimation approaches. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid method, named the CNN-LSTM-DNN, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), for the estimation of the battery&#39;s remaining useful life (RUL) and improving prediction accuracy with acceptable execution time. A comparison against various ML estimation algorithms is carried out to show the superiority of the proposed hybrid estimation approach. For that, three statistical indicators, i.e., the MAE, R 2 , and RMSE, are selected to assess numerically the prediction results. Experimental validation is performed using two datasets of different lithium-ion batteries from NASA and CALCE. Thus, results reveal that hybrid methods perform better than the single ones, also the effectiveness of the suggested method in reducing the prediction error and in achieving better RUL prediction performance compared to the other methods.},

  abstract     = {An onboard energy storage system (OESS) withfast-energy-exchange capability is needed to enable future grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations. To facilitate the fast energy exchange, the OESS normally interfaces between a high voltage (HV) bus on the grid side and a low voltage (LV) bus on the vehicle side. The HV bus can be up to 1200 V, while the LV bus is as low as 48 V, which means a high conversion ratio is needed. Resonant converters are commonly used for OESS and designed with large characteristic impedance for wide-range output power and zero-voltage-switching operation. However, such a design leads to large volume and complex customization of the magnetic components. In this paper, a high-conversion-ratio OESS is proposed, which is based on interleaved quasi-resonant converters with small characteristic impedance. The resonant converters are of modular design with a small characteristic impedance to achieve small volume, low cost, and simple customization. Interleaved in LV-side-parallel and HV-side-series configuration, a high conversion ratio can be achieved. Moreover, modulated in quasi-resonant operations, all the switches can realize soft switching even at light load conditions for high efficiency. Burst control for output regulation is implemented in each modular quasi-resonant converter, while interleaved control is implemented between them to minimize the current ripple. The proposed design and control are validated by a compact 5 kW prototype with a charging/discharging current of 100 A, high power efficiency of 98.91%, a high power density of 3.86 W/cm 3 , and high-conversion-ratio (up to 20: 1) power flow between a 1000 VDC HV bus and a 48 VDC LV bus.},

The optimal speed trajectory is obtained with the objective of minimizing the fuel consumption of freight vehicles. Meanwhile, freight-priority optimal signal timing is achieved by minimizing the queueing delay of passenger vehicles at the intersections, while ensuring freight vehicles to avoid stopping and idling. The cooperative optimization problem is non-convex due to constraints from the queues and traffic signals in the network; therefore, a sub-optimal strategy restoring convexity is proposed to solve the problem. Comparison studies of the result and some benchmark methods are performed via numerical simulations, showing significant improvement of traffic efficiency and fuel economy with faster calculation.},

Specifically, we aim at reducing the mass of the transmission and the leakage losses that occur in the system. To do so, we first formulate the joint plant and control design problem including the corresponding objectives and constraints. Thereafter, we propose a proportional integral structure for the design of the CVT ratio control. The combined plant and control design problem is formulated as a nonlinear multi-objective optimization problem, and is simultaneously solved using an interior point optimization method. We evaluate the obtained design on the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) as well as on more aggressive driving scenarios, and demonstrate that the optimized CVT design is always capable of realizing the required driving performance. Additionally, we study the impact of the plant design parameters on the control performance by analyzing the coupling strength between the subproblems. Thereby, the pulley radius is found to have the strongest influence in the resulting leakage losses that occur at the variator level. Finally, leveraging the presented design framework, we show that up to 13% and 18% reduction in the CVT variator mass and on leakage losses, respectively, can be achieved without compromising the desired ratio trajectory over a representative dynamic driving cycle.},

During the observer design process, a new concept called the degree of observability (DO) is introduced to quantitatively describe the strengths and weaknesses of the system observability in terms of different outputs. This concept integrated with the decoupling conditions lead to a systematic method for selecting the suitable outputs of the suspension system for the observer design. In this method, among all output combinations that satisfy the decoupling requirements, the combination of sprung mass displacement and unsprung mass velocity is found to have the highest DO containing the most information of the system. The performance of the designed observer with the selected outputs is compared with the Kalman filter (KF) developed in the literature by assuming the initial random walk model for the road profile. To have a nearly real situation for simulation studies, a MacPherson suspension model constructed in the ADAMS multibody software is employed. The results obtained by deterministic and stochastic road excitations indicate much more accurate estimations for the designed observer with minimum outputs compared with the KF. The estimation errors are quantitatively compared with the KF using different set of outputs to confirm the positive effect of simultaneous DO analysis and decoupling approach. Meanwhile, the proposed observer is free of assumptions, and its structure is more simple and easier for implementation.},

  abstract     = {GNSS has become a widely accessible technique for vehicle instantaneous velocimetry. GNSS time difference carrier phase (TDCP) velocimetry can provide high-accuracy displacement increments, through which the between-epoch average velocity can be derived. However, there are always so-called modelling errors in such velocity, i.e., the deviation between the average velocity and the instantaneous one. GNSS Doppler velocimetry offers exactly instantaneous velocity, but its measurement is much noisier. In this work, we propose to integrate TDCP with Doppler for estimating vehicle&#39;s instantaneous velocity. The TDCP-derived displacements and the Doppler-derived instantaneous velocity are treated as two sets of measurements, whereas the vehicle&#39;s kinematics is represented by kernel model. Rather than directly solving for vehicle&#39;s velocity, we indirectly seek for the kernel weights to establish an analytical kernel model of vehicle&#39;s motion state. Tikhonov regularization is introduced to deal with the ill-conditioned problem in kernel weights estimation, and it can significantly smooth/denoise the noisy Doppler measurements. The hyperparameters involved are optimized using generalized cross validation criterion. The constructed kernel model can provide vehicle&#39;s velocity at any instants, not necessarily at the sampling epochs. The static and dynamic vehicle field experiments demonstrate that the proposed TDCP/Doppler integrated velocimetry can provide both high accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles have to share the road with human-driven ones for a prolonged period in the near future. Thus, they should have the ability to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding human-driven vehicles. Unlike human drivers, the state-of-the-art models used in autonomous vehicles recognize a driver&#39;s lane changing intention based on the target vehicle&#39;s lateral movement, which leaves little to no time for the autonomous vehicle to react. In this paper, a Human-like Lane Changing Intention Understanding Model (HLCIUM) for autonomous driving is proposed to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding vehicles. By imitating the selective attention mechanism of human vision systems, the proposed model emulates the way human drivers concentrate on the surrounding vehicles and recognizes their lane changing intentions accordingly. The velocity changes of the surrounding vehicles are treated as the lane changing hints, and the attention is drawn to the corresponding vehicle following a saliency-based scheme. Then, the lane changing intention is identified by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based intention recognizer. The proposed model is tested with Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectory dataset, and the proposed method has reached 90.89% in detecting lane changing intention and 88.58% in lane keeping in urban road scenarios, and reached 87.73% and 87.48% for the lane changing and lane keeping intentions in highway scenarios, respectively. Importantly, the average recognition time before the lane changing maneuver of the proposed model is 6.67 seconds for the urban road datasets and 7.08 seconds for the highway datasets, which is far earlier than state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the proposed method shows efficiency and robustness in complex real urban traffic datasets, which is ideal to use in human-like autonomous driving systems.},

  abstract     = {Multiple vehicles control at an intersection is one of the most challenging scenarios in the vehicle control field due to the high number of constraints. However, regarding the control strategies of an isolated intersection, few studies have considered the longitudinal-lateral dynamics comprehensively. In the approaches that treat the turning curve as a straight line, a longitudinal dynamic model is adopted, while the lateral execution ability is ignored. The ideal decisions that ignore vehicle dynamics are not accurately executed by actual vehicles, as doing so would be futile. In addition, due to the strong coupling and nonlinearity of the longitudinal-lateral dynamics model, the optimization problem is difficult to solve. Therefore, in this paper, a reasonable model, the simplified vehicle dynamics model coupled with longitudinal-lateral dynamics is used to describe longitudinal, lateral, and yaw motions comprehensively. Optimization of the longitudinal and lateral control of each vehicle is realized simultaneously. The multi-objective optimization problem is decomposed and solved by each vehicle utilizing model predictive control (MPC) in a distributed manner. A novel safety constraint interpretive method (SCIM) is proposed to reduce the number of constraints and facilitate the solution by converting the safety constraint. The asymptotic stability of a local closed-loop system is guaranteed by a terminal constraint, and the global feasibility is proven. Finally, a demanding intersection scenario, with comparison between the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) method, is carried out in a Processor-in-the-Loop (PiL) test. The results demonstrate that intersection safety is guaranteed with smoother control inputs obtained by the designed distributed method. The control inputs are more suitable for vehicle execution, especially in turning maneuvers.},

  abstract     = {Sparse recovery (SR) is a promising tool for radar signal processing. However, SR-based target detection is still an open problem in the challenging scenarios of grid mismatch, very high dimensionality and constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) requirement. To address the above challenges, an efficient approach termed as knowledge-aided generalized approximate message passing (KA-GAMP) is proposed. Firstly, traditional signal processing (TSP) is performed to obtain prior knowledge about targets of interest. Based on this prior knowledge, dimensionality reduction is carried out, and a new approximate observation model of the received signal is established. Then, considering the grid-mismatch problem, target parameter estimations are carried out before SR, and an estimate of the measurement matrix is obtained. Finally, by exploiting the sparsity of the received signal, GAMP is adopted to perform target recovery. Based on recovery results, target detection is implemented. Interestingly, it is shown that the noise envelope outputted by GAMP approximately follows an i.i.d Gaussian distribution, and the proposed detector is CFAR. Numerical results via both Monte Carlo simulations and the measured data show that the proposed approach is superior to the TSP-based method in terms of target detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Identifying a true, system-level optimal solution for hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) powertrains requires methods such as combined design and control optimization (co-design) to account for the coupling between powertrain design and optimal energy management strategies. Despite the widespread application of co-design techniques to HEV powertrains in recent years, limited research has been done to account for the inherent uncertainties present in these systems. This is problematic as such uncertainties may not only impact HEV powertrain component sizing and control strategies, but also overall vehicle performance and cost-both of which are critically-important in the fiercely-competitive automotive industry. One way to address this issue is to apply a stochastic dynamic system optimization technique known as robust multidisciplinary dynamic system design optimization (R-MDSDO) to the HEV powertrain co-design problem. This method ensures that the HEV powertrain co-design solution, including its system performance and cost, explicitly accounts for random variations within the system and its problem formulation using concepts from robust design optimization. Therefore, in this study, we formulate and solve a robust co-design problem for a power-split HEV powertrain using R-MDSDO to identify the optimal component designs, state trajectories, and control trajectories such that the vehicle powertrain cost is minimized. The robust solution is then compared to the solution from the associated deterministic problem, with the results indicating that accounting for system uncertainty has a significant impact on HEV powertrain co-design.},

  abstract     = {The fuel consumption, productivity and operability are three important performance criteria for construction machinery. Better fuel economy sometimes means reduced productivity while higher productivity requires more powerful powertrain and thus consumes more fuel. It is challenging to compromise these performances in a single machine. However for working sites with multiple machines running together, it is possible to balance fleet fuel consumption and productivity with proper site operation strategy. In this study a site operation strategy for wheel loader/truck loading and transportation cycle is developed. A comprehensive criterion balancing the trade-off between fleet fuel consumption and fleet productivity - the fleet operating cost, is proposed. The strategy takes both fleet configuration parameter (number of wheel loaders and trucks) and operating parameter (wheel loader cycle time) into considerations. The fleet fuel consumption is calculated based on vehicle powertrain models instead of empirical estimation. The fleet fuel consumption, productivity and fleet operating cost with different numbers of wheel loader/truck and wheel loader cycle times are obtained. The optimal number of wheel loader/truck and wheel loader cycle time to achieve minimum fleet operating cost are identified.},

We propose an optimal control strategy that determines the power split between different vehicle power sources and brakes. Based on model predictive control (MPC) and sequential programming, the optimal trajectories of the vehicle velocity and battery state of charge are found for upcoming horizons with a length of 5-20 km. Then, acceleration and brake pedal positions together with the battery usage are regulated to follow the requested speed and state of charge, which is verified using a high-fidelity vehicle plant model. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a sequential linear program for predictive energy management that is faster and simpler than sequential quadratic programming in tested solvers and provides trajectories that are very close to the best trajectories found by nonlinear programming. The performance of the method is also compared to that of two different sequential quadratic programs.},

However, achieving high-precision positioning using low-cost 16-channel LiDAR in urban canyons remains a challenging problem due to the limited point cloud density from low-cost LiDAR and excessive dynamic surrounding objects. To fill this gap, this paper proposes enriching sparse 3D point clouds to denser clouds via a novel deep learning-based superresolution (SR) algorithm before its utilization in 3D LiDAR odometry. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using the KITTI dataset and a challenging dataset collected in an urban canyon (with complex environmental structures and dynamic objects) of Hong Kong. We conclude that significantly denser point clouds are achieved with considerable accuracy. In addition, significantly improved performance of 3D LiDAR odometry is obtained in the evaluated dataset collected in an urban canyon of Hong Kong.},

Each shared-aperture antenna element consists of two wideband microstrip antenna units with air-cavity for the C-band and one wide beam magnetic-electro dipole antenna unit for the S-band. To achieve the wide-angle scanning, a phased array should have low inter-element mutual coupling and wide array-element beam-width. A simple metallic strip (MS), comprising four metal stubs and one rectangle shaped metal pillar, is utilized to improve the inter-element isolation of the array in and between the C- and S-bands. Furthermore, the metal strip can also broaden the beam-width of the C-band antenna units without distorting the wide-beam property of the S-band units. The shared-aperture array with a simple metallic strip is designed based on the above elements, and WASC is realized in both the C- and S- bands with low mutual coupling. To verify the proposed method, the shared-aperture array is fabricated and characterized, yielding good performance within the overall operating bandwidth. The measured results align very well with the simulated. The proposed array realizes the scanning coverage of ±60° with realized gain reduction of less than 3 dB in both the C- and S-bands, which is a good candidate for the base station in the mobile environment.},

It overcomes the limited coverage of a mmW antenna array, and the low radiation efficiency of a multi-beam mmW antenna array. This technique enables antenna to radiate two isolated beams with different tilted angles, which can effectively increase the UAV coverage without enlarging the antenna size or degrading radiation efficiency. For demonstration, an 8 × 8 antenna array is designed with the tilted beams of 11° and 23° for the coverage from 6° to 28°. Measured results indicate two beams have 40 dB isolation, 15.2% impedance bandwidth, up to 21.7 dB stable gain, and up to 74.2% radiation efficiency. Antenna coverage could be further enhanced by arraying the proposed antennas in a flat structure. Example is given to radiate 18 beams covering ±28° seamless 2D plane over 57-64 GHz. The size of the proposed array is smaller than that of a standard A4 page, which is suitable for UAV-mounted mobile base station (MBS).},

This forms a strong driving force for exploiting the terahertz (THz) band where the available spectrum is massively abundant. In this paper, the smart rail mobility channel is characterized through ultra-wideband (UWB) channel sounding and ray tracing (RT) at 300 GHz band with an 8 GHz bandwidth in the five scenarios - Train-to-infrastructure (T2I), Inside station, Train-to-train (T2T), Infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I), and Intra-wagon. Corresponding channel characteristics such as path loss, shadow fading, Rician K-factor, root-mean-square delay spread, azimuth/elevation angular spread of arrival/departure, and cross-polarization ratio are extracted and analyzed. Based on realistic channel information, the performance of THz communication is investigated in terms of channel capacity for all above five scenarios with various antenna patterns and weather conditions (except Intra-wagon) - sunny, rainy, and snowy. The results provide valuable insights into the system design and evaluation for THz communication enabled Smart Rail Mobility.},

Within the decision-making framework, a motion prediction module is designed and optimized using model predictive control (MPC) to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of the decision-making algorithm. Besides, the payoff function of decision making is defined with the consideration of vehicle safety, ride comfort and travel efficiency. Additionally, the constraints of the decision-making problem are constructed. Based on the established decision-making model, Stackelberg game and grand coalition game approaches are adopted to address the decision making of CAVs at an unsignalized roundabout. Three testing cases considering personalized driving behaviours are carried out to verify the performance of the developed decision-making algorithms. The testing results show that the proposed game theoretic decision-making framework is able to make safe and reasonable decisions for CAVs in the complex urban scenarios, validating its feasibility and effectiveness. Stackelberg game approach shows its advantage in guaranteeing personalized driving objectives of individuals, while the grand coalition game approach is advantageous regarding the efficiency improvement of the transportation system.},

Traditional centralized parking approaches are with an insidious single point of failure and unsuitable for large organization because the manager is overburdened with authority and responsibility. The malicious service provider enables to (i) track the precise mobility patterns of citizens. (ii) collect the data to infer privacy-sensitive information, e.g., where the parking requester (i.e., driver) socialize, work, and live; (iii) analyze trajectories to monitor the location of the driver for entertainment (e.g., discovering one-night stands). To design a decentralized smart and practical parking platform without compromising the privacy of the entities is an urgent issue for the smart city. Blockchain (or distributed public ledger technology) is a near-ideal decentralized and distributed solution for centralized parking-space-recommendation systems. However, most of the existing parking recommendation solutions on top of blockchain ignore to protect the privacy of drivers during parking spot detection and matching phases while cannot maintain the property of anonymity of the drivers.

This will be facilitated by heterogeneous access technologies and edge computing to offload tasks from vehicles via secure resource assignment. Thus, each vehicle in SIoV acts as a social subject that manages its own network. SIoV will lead to an explosive growth in network size, and induce issues like scalability and resource discovery. Blockchain is a potential candidate to address these, however, it is not suitable for SIoV with traditional proof-of-work (PoW) consensus. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses a dynamic PoW (dPoW) consensus with a checkpoint mechanism and a resource assignment policy. The dPoW consensus has different mining difficulty levels that change according to the communication traffic, whereas the checkpoint defines an alternative mechanism to generate the next block hash. The assignment policy manages an access control list to mandate the edge modules to securely distribute resources among vehicles. To study the feasibility of our framework, we present a formal security analysis using the Access Control Logic model. For the performance analysis, we use three metrics, i.e., scalability, latency, and security. With these analyses, we demonstrate that our framework offers enhanced security and can scale with a minimal increase in computation overhead. A case study with a comparative analysis is also discussed that evaluates the network dynamics and attests the superior performance of the framework under a real-life vehicular network scenario.},

  abstract     = {New mobility paradigms have appeared in recent years, and everything suggests that some more are coming. This fact makes apparent the necessity of modernizing the road infrastructure, the signalling elements and the traffic management systems. Many initiatives have emerged around the term Intelligent Transport System (ITS) in order to define new scenarios and requirements for this kind of applications. We even have two main competing technologies for implementing Vehicular communication protocols (V2X), C-V2X and 802.11p, but neither of them is widely deployed yet. One of the main barriers for the massive adoption of those technologies is governance. Current solutions rely on the use of a public key infrastructure that enables secure collaboration between the different entities in the V2X ecosystem, but given its global scope, managing such infrastructure requires reaching agreements between many parties, with conflicts of interest between automakers and telecommunication operators. As a result, there are plenty of use cases available and two mature communication technologies, but the complexity at the business layer is stopping the drivers from taking advantage of ITS applications. Blockchain technologies are defining a new decentralized paradigm for most traditional applications, where smart contracts provide a straightforward mechanism for decentralized governance. In this work, we propose an approach for decentralized V2X (D-V2X) that does not require any trusted authority and can be implemented on top of any communication protocol. We also define a proof-of-concept technical architecture on top of a cheap and highly secure System-on-Chip (SoC) that could allow for massive adoption of D-V2X.},

  abstract     = {The papers in this special section focus on blockchain for vehicles and intelligent communications. The proliferation of vehicles and intelligent communications is generating enormous amount of data for enabling autonomous driving and innovative communications applications. The data may raise efficiency and security concerns to users, e.g., offering real-time services for smart phones/devices/vehicles and exposing sensitive driving information to the untrusted 3rd party. Blockchain, which is featured with decentralization recording and tamper-proofing, has been emerged as a promising approach for mitigating data security risks of vehicles and intelligent communications. In addition, incorporating with smart contracts and other techniques, users connected through blockchain can share the data information in an efficient, private and secure manner, thereby reducing the management cost of service provision, improving the security of intelligent communications, and protecting the privacy of vehicles and mobile users. Further, highly dynamic communication topology caused by driving vehicles may undermine the establishment of consensus protocols. Thus, efficiency will become a critical challenge in leveraging blockchain for delay sensitive services in vehicular and intelligent communications.},

In the proposed scheme, the fully distributed transmit power control strategy of secondary users (SUs) is learned by means of a distributed deep neural network (DNN) structure in an unsupervised manner, such that the average spectral efficiency (SE) of the SUs is maximized whilst allowing the interference on primary users (PUs) to be regulated properly. Unlike previous centralized DNN-based strategies that require complete channel state information (CSI) to optimally determine the transmit power of SU transceiver pairs (TPs), in our proposed scheme, each SU TP determines its own transmit power based solely on its local CSI. Our simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can achieve a near-optimal SE comparable with a centralized DNN-based scheme, with a reduced computation time and no signaling overhead.},

We construct a system model for this cooperative WPT (CoWPT)-based multihop transmission and formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal WPT time of each node for maximizing the lifetime of the multihop network. We first verify that the lifetimes of multihop nodes have the solidarity property, and that the network lifetime is maximized by equalizing their respective lifetimes. Then we convert the considered optimization problem into a tractable linear programming (LP) problem and solve it. Intensive simulations show that the optimal CoWPT solution significantly increases the network lifetime compared with the typical WPT method in both wireless sensor network (WSN) and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) environments. Moreover, it is revealed that the network lifetime is further improved in MANET relative to in WSN because more ambient RF signals are available for energy harvesting in the MANET topology.},

By introducing suitable penalty functions to l 2 -box ADMM decoding, we present an enhanced method, called l 2 -box ADMM penalized decoding, to further improve the performance.

Exact expressions for the secrecy performance metrics such as secrecy outage probability (SOP) and probability of the non zero secrecy capacity (PNZSC) are derived, and asymptotic analysis on the SOP is also conducted. The obtained results reveal useful insights on the effect of channel correlation on FSO communications. Counterintuitively, it is found that the secrecy outage performance demonstrates a non-monotonic behavior with the increase of correlation. More specifically, there is an SNR penalty for achieving a target SOP as the correlation increases within some range. However, when the correlation is further increased beyond some threshold, the SOP performance improves significantly.},

In this correspondence, an estimator of CP is devised under the information theoretic criterion(ITC) framework for long observation regime. In particular, we formulate asymptotic log-likelihood function in discrete frequency domain. From the evidence that direct implementation of ITC leads to a high probability of CP overestimation, we reformulate ITC by Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and derive an accurate penalty function. The proposed BIC variant appears to be consistent as signal-to-noise ratio increases.

However, because combined relay selection involves the generation of the full set of two-relay combinations, the selection complexity of combined relay selection is much higher than that of per-subcarrier relay selection when the number of relays goes large. This drawback restricts the implementation of combined relay selection in dense networks. To overcome this drawback, we propose to enable combined relay selection by supervised machine learning (ML). Because the training procedure is off-line, the proposed implementation scheme can considerably reduce the selection complexity and the processing latency. We carry out extensive experiments on TensorFlow 2.1 over a graphics processing unit (GPU) aided computing cloud server to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The experimental results confirm that supervised ML can provide near-optimal performance with lower computing latency that well matches that provided by brute-force search and the optimal relay selection in a per-subcarrier manner.},

Our objective is to minimize the total transmit power under users&#39; quality-of-service constraints: formulating CI at each user with high probabilities for a given target signal-to-noise ratio (SINR). We first analyze the probability of CI under imperfect CSIT. A series of approximations are then developed, transforming the intractable stochastic CI constraints into determined convex constraints. The non-convex stochastic-robust CI power minimization (CIPM) problem is then converted into second-order cone programming. We show that we could create tightened or relaxed approximations by changing the parameters, enabling us to find upper-bounds and lower-bounds for the original stochastic CIPM problem. The best parameter values corresponding to the tightest upper and lower bounds are also discussed and obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed methods reasonably approximate the stochastic CIPM problem. Using the given parameter values, it can guarantee the required probability of CI for each user under acceptable channel uncertainties and outperform the existing robust CI precoding in terms of both transmit power and feasibility rate. The small gap between the upper and lower bounds also shows that the proposed method does not cause too much performance loss.},

Based on this modified model, we propose a robust localization method for the case of unknown model parameters. Specifically, we introduce a balancing parameter and express the additional path loss term as the sum of the balancing parameter and an error term, and then formulate a robust weighted least squares (RWLS) problem to jointly estimate the source location, the unknown model parameters, and the balancing parameter. The RWLS problem is solved in an iterative manner, where the S-Lemma and the semidefinite relaxation technique are used.

However, the intended signals that impinge upon an RIS are often mixed with interfering signals, which are usually dynamic and unknown. In particular, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) may be degraded by the signals reflected from the RISs that originate from non-intended users. To tackle this issue, we introduce the concept of intelligent spectrum learning (ISL), which uses an appropriately trained convolutional neural network (CNN) at the RIS controller to help the RISs infer the interfering signals directly from the incident signals. By capitalizing on the ISL, a distributed control algorithm is proposed to maximize the received SINR by dynamically configuring the active/inactive binary status of the RIS elements. Simulation results validate the performance improvement offered by deep learning and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ISL-aided approach.},

  abstract     = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technique has received many interests, thanks to its advantages of low cost, easy deployment, and high controllability. It is acknowledged that the RIS can significantly improve the quality of signal transmission, especially in the line-of-sight-blocked scenarios. Therefore, it is critical to analyze the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) coverage probability of RIS-aided communication systems. In this correspondence, we consider many practical issues to analyze the SNR coverage probability. We employ the realistic path loss model and Rayleigh fading model as large-scale and small-scale channel models, respectively. Meanwhile, we take the number and size of the RIS elements, as well as the placement of the RIS plane into considerations. We first derive the exact closed-form SNR coverage probability for a single element. Afterward, with the moment matching method, a highly accurate approximation of SNR coverage probability is formulated as the ratio of the upper incomplete Gamma function and Gamma function, allowing an arbitrary number of elements in the RIS. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the impacts of essential factors on the SNR coverage probability, such as the number and size of the element, the coefficients of fading channel, and the angles of incidence and RIS plane. Overall, this work provides a succinct and general expression of SNR coverage probability, which can be helpful in the performance evaluation and practical implementation of the RIS.},

We proposed a new secure beamforming scheme in which beamforming vector is a linear combination of the energy beamforming (EB) and information beamforming (IB) vectors. In particular, we present a new closed-form solution for the proposed beamforming vector which is shown to achieve a near-optimal secrecy capacity for asymptotic regime of a large number of antennas at the source. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that the proposed beamforming vector achieves significantly higher secrecy rate as compared to the trivial EB and IB vectors. A tight closed-form approximation for the ergodic secrecy rate is also derived for a large number of antennas.

  abstract     = {With the development of sensor-clouds, the traditional WSN is expanded and the computing capacity is greatly improved. However, there are still challenges to be solved in sensor-clouds, such as how to disseminate codes to all nodes in a fast and energy-saving way. In this paper, an early wake-up ahead (EWA) code dissemination scheme is proposed to disseminate codes more efficiently. The main innovations of EWA code dissemination scheme are as follows: (a) An early wake-up message (EWM) routing protocol is proposed to propagate the early wake-up message ahead to awake the nodes in the routing path before data packets arrive. The forecast message can be forwarded for multi-hops during a time slot, while the packet can only be forwarded for one hop. Therefore, the nodes in the routing path can be awakened before the sending node starts to transmit the packets, the sleep latency is thus reduced as the sending node has not to wait for the receiver to be awakened for transmission. (b) The proposed EWA scheme aims at accelerating the code dissemination by increasing the duty cycle of the nodes which are far from the sink based on the EWM routing protocol. Meanwhile, the EWA scheme can improve the energy utilization rate without affecting the network lifetime. Theoretical analysis has verified the proposed protocol and scheme do accelerate code dissemination and improve energy utilization ratio. The experimental results show that the proposed EWA scheme reduces the network delay by 16.53%-37.13% compared to the conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {Using satellite constellations to provide global Internet access services has recently drawn increasing attention. A low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network with multiple satellites provides global coverage, low latency, and operates independently, by which it effectively complements terrestrial IP networks. Satellite gateways are located on the ground and can serve as data exchange points between satellite networks and the Internet. As the placement scheme can affect network performance, finding appropriate sites for gateways constitutes a fundamental problem. This paper proposes a gateway placement optimization (GPO) method for LEO satellite networks in order to solve this problem by modeling it as a combination optimization problem. We aim to identify the best gateway locations that can balance traffic loads while using as few gateways as possible. The constraints to be satisfied concern the physical links between gateways and satellites: specifically, link interference, satellite bandwidth, and number of satellite antennas. We use a gravity model to estimate the traffic matrix from/to gateways and satellites, then we adopt and modify the discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, we apply the GPO method to numerical tests on real satellite constellations. The results indicate that our method performs well and effectively.},

  abstract     = {While 5G is being deployed all around the world, the industry and academia start the investigation of 6G. Network function virtualization (NFV) is seen as the key enabler towards the flexible resource management and sharing of 6G networks. The main idea of NFV is to decouple the physical devices from the specific functions that run on them. In NFV, virtual network service (NS) is modeled as a service function chain (SFC). The challenges in SFC description, composition, embedding, and scheduling are key issues in NFV. In this paper, we focus on the joint SFC embedding and scheduling for NFV in 6G networks. With the assistance of sensing the physical node resource abilities, we propose a novel SFC embedding and scheduling algorithm, which is named as RA-SFC-6G. A new service is first composed as an SFC which is an ordered sequence of virtual network functions (VNFs). Afterwards, our RA-SFC-6G algorithm will select the physical nodes with stronger resource abilities and abundant resources to accommodate the SFC. In addition, the NS is guaranteed to be implemented without violating the NS maximum allowed scheduling time. If violated, our RA-SFC-6G can re-embed and re-schedule the violated VNFs to suitable positions. In order to validate our RA-SFC-6G performance, we do the experiment work. Experiment results show that our RA-SFC-6G achieves at least 10% higher SFC acceptance ratio than the previous counterparts and the typical heuristics.},

  abstract     = {In opportunistic mobile crowdsensing, the objective of service requesters is to have as many of their sensing tasks completed as possible within their budget constraints, whereas that of participants (workers) is to collect the highest monetary reward possible on their trajectories. However, these objectives can conflict and may result in unhappy service requesters or workers if the matching between them is not handled carefully. In this paper, we study the problem of finding task assignments that fulfill both coverage-aware preferences of service requesters and profit-based preferences of workers in a budget-constrained, opportunistic mobile crowdsensing system. Since this is a matching problem with bilateral preferences, we aim to find a matching in which everyone is satisfied with their assignment based on their preference profile. We first propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for general settings, and then show that a slightly modified version of this algorithm has a constant approximation ratio when the rewards offered to workers by service requesters are proportional to the coverage capability of workers for corresponding tasks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms in different settings, and show that they mostly provide substantially better task assignments in terms of user happiness and coverage quality while having a few orders of magnitude lower running times compared to the benchmark algorithms.},

However, existing 3D aerial mobility model (3D AMM) cannot capture unique features of GUAV in SAR, especially smooth 3D trajectory and collision avoidance. In this paper, we develop realistic 3D aerial group mobility model based on spiral line (3D SLGM) for SAR. Firstly, we review some related works. Then, we introduce the mechanism of 3D SLGM, such as Z-Or-SLGM and Z-Non-SLGM. Furthermore, we analyze some mathematical features of 3D SLGM. In addition, we investigate key mobility features of 3D SLGM. Finally, we evaluate the network performance under 3D SLGM. The result shows that 3D SLGM has smooth 3D trajectory and uniform distribution of spatial nodes in 3D space. With the collided rate of 0%, 3D SLGM merely takes about 1.4 minutes to cover 100% of the target area of 200 m*200 m. Besides, the network under 3D SLGM can approach the throughput of 0.45 Mb/s, the end-to-end delay of 3.2 ms and the loss packets rate of 0%. We believe that 3D SLGM, as a significant supplement of 3D AMM, can provide many helpful guidelines in the design and analysis of authentic ABN.},

However, the conventional Long Term Evolution (LTE) random access procedure hinders the support of mIoT due to the limited number of available preambles. In this paper, we propose to aggregate two Zadoff-Chu preamble sequences from two different roots to obtain a larger set of preambles by considering all possible combinations of preamble sequence pairs. Decoding the aggregate preambles is challenging because the receiver needs to decode two preamble sequences where each one is allocated half of the transmit power. We propose two receiver architectures for preamble decoding. The first one is a threshold-based receiver which only requires minor changes to the LTE preamble receiver architecture. The second proposed preamble decoder architecture exploits a deep neural network. Simulations show that the proposed aggregate preamble design results in a lower service time for backlogged IoT devices compared to existing collision avoidance techniques. Moreover, the proposed receiver architectures can decode the aggregate preambles with low probabilities of misdetection and false alarm (less than 11%), especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.},

In this paper, our proposed mechanism first achieves the verifiable aggregation and immutable dissemination of performance records by exploiting a blockchain with the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. Moreover, to acquire a driver&#39;s aggregated performance record from the blockchain, the proposed scheme first realizes quick identification with a Bloom filter and further approaches the target performance record through an oblivious transfer (OT) protocol. A performance evaluation shows that during the acquisition of the records, the computational complexity of our scheme is only related to the scale of the records contained in one transaction. However, the computational complexity of one traditional scheme without a Bloom filter depends on the scale of the records generated during each time slot. Furthermore, the computational complexity of another traditional scheme without aggregation relies on the scale of the records contained in one transaction, as well as the length of a driver&#39;s performance history. We also investigate the trade-off between the privacy level and computational complexity, and we determine the optimal number of data records in each transaction.},

In CVEC, we introduce an offloading service provider that deploys an MEC server and schedules PVs on demand to handle offloading tasks. Efficient workload allocation and user-centric utility maximization are studied to optimize the network-wide task scheduling. In dynamic environment, offloading destination of each task is determined in a probabilistic manner. When necessary, the offloading service provider represents an offloading user to design a contract based incentive mechanism for the PVs. Based on contract theory and prospect theory, we model the offloading user&#39;s subjective evaluations on the utility in computation offloading, and derive an optimal contract to maximize the subjective utility under information asymmetry. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {In wireless network virtualization processes, load imbalance in substrate nodes and substrate links may significantly reduce the number of virtual network requests served by a substrate network. In addition, load imbalance also impairs resource utilization and increases embedding cost of the virtual networks. To tackle these issues, this work proposes a re-embedding scheme for virtual node (RSVN). Based on the load condition of a substrate network, RSVN first determines whether to start re-embedding procedure or not, and then selects proper re-embedded virtual nodes according to their re-embedding factors. Next, RSVN re-embeds the selected virtual nodes to balance the loads of a wireless substrate network. The extensive simulation results showed that RSVN improves the acceptance ratio of virtual network requests, increases the resource utilization of substrate networks, and reduces the average embedding cost of the entire virtual networks.},

In this paper, we first collect extensive traffic flows at the exit router of a university and label them into various source applications. After extracting the message (consisting of multiple consecutive TCP packets) sequence for all collected traffic flows, we find that each application type has distinct sequential message features. By leveraging the message sequential feature, we develop a system, named SMC (Sequential Message Characterization), which can perform online traffic classification with the sequential size information of a few message segments. In SMC, after confirming the long-term dependency among message segments, we create a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to conduct deep learning on message size sequence, and then build a multi-classifier to classify traffic types based on the probability profiles output by deep LSTM models. Extensive experiments are conducted and results demonstrate that the proposed SMC can achieve 97% of classification accuracy on average. Meanwhile, with as few as 6 pieces of message size information as input, SMC enables early online traffic classification especially for heavy-traffic flows with over 35 message segments in median.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing has become an effective tool to utilize human intelligence to perform tasks that are challenging for machines. Many incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing systems have been proposed. However, most of existing mechanisms assume that there are enough participants to perform the crowdsourcing tasks. This assumption may not be true in large-scale crowdsourcing scenarios. To address this issue, we diffuse the crowdsourcing tasks via the social network. We study two task diffusion models, and formulate the problem of minimizing the total cost such that all tasks can be completed in expectation for each model. The topology based influence estimation and history based influence estimation based on the limited knowledge of social network are presented in this paper. Further, we present the global influence estimation method to measure the influence over the whole community with the full knowledge of social network. We design two sealed reverse auction based truthful incentive mechanisms, MTD-L and MTD-IC, for both diffusion models. Through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness, and guaranteed approximation. Moreover, the global influence estimation based mechanisms always output the least social cost and overpayment ratio, and the history influence estimation based mechanisms show significant superiority in terms of task completion rate.},

To efficiently exploit 3C resources of fog devices in proximity, we propose F3C, a fog-enabled 3C resource sharing framework for energy-efficient IoT data stream processing by solving an energy cost minimization problem under 3C constraints. Nevertheless, the minimization problem proves to be NP-hard via reduction from a Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). To cope with such challenge, we propose an efficient F3C algorithm based on an iterative task team formation mechanism which regards each task&#39;s 3C resource sharing as a subproblem solved by the elaborated min cost flow transformation. Via utility improving iterations, the proposed F3C algorithm is shown to converge to a stable system point. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that our F3C algorithm can achieve superior performance in energy saving compared to various benchmarks.},

Furthermore, under a restless martingale (RM) bandit condition, we put forth a generalized RM-FA-UCB algorithm that can achieve a sublinear regret bound even under non-stationary network dynamics.

  abstract     = {A challenging issue for a three-dimensional (3D) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is addressed in this paper - how do we efficiently establish and maintain one or multiple routes among swarm regions (i.e., groups of UAVs), during the dynamic swarming process? Inspired by the human nervous system which can efficiently send brain signals to any tissue, we propose a 3D transformative routing (3D-TR) scheme, which consists of three novel designs: (1) Proactive routing skeleton establishment: 3D-TR first identifies the skeleton of the UAV network, which has a trunk-stem-stemlet (TSS) structure. The trunk is located in the relatively stable area of the network (i.e., the central area), and stems/stemlets reside in the outer areas with more swarming movements. Such a TSS skeleton enables the easy establishment of the path(s) with low end-to-end delay and a high packet delivery rate. (2) Reactive, transformative path selection: The 3D-TR scheme can smoothly adapt to the formation changes through dynamic TSS adjustments. (3) Bottleneck-aware route maintenance: We propose an efficient scheme to recognize the bottleneck nodes in each path and build the diversified routing pipes with different thickness/stability levels. The proposed routing scheme is distributed (only uses local message exchanges among 1-hop neighbors) and does not require the GPS (global positioning system) positions of the UAVs. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed 3D-TR scheme during the dynamic UAV swarming process.},

This paper deals with the CSI prediction in the case of a buffer aided relaying communication scheme with adaptive link selection previously proposed in the literature where a direct source-destination link is not available and with both links affected by an independent fading. In particular, the CSI prediction has been reduced here to a time series prediction problem, performed by involving the usage of the recurrent neural networks.

Specially, the closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the considered NOMA-based ISMTRNs in the presence of the above two eavesdropping cases and partial relay selection scheme are obtained. To obtain further insights in high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) regime, the asymptotic analysis of SOP with two considered cases are also derived, which give efficient means to evaluate the benefit of NOMA scheme and the impacts of HIs on the SOP.

Conventional low-sidelobe antennas were realized using power dividing network to obtain the in-phase and nonuniform-amplitude excitation, which causes complicated antenna&#39;s structure and design. To tackle these challenges, a simplified feeding method without using power dividing network is introduced to design the low-sidelobe slot antenna array. The slots at the top walls serve as the radiation elements, and the slots are directly fed by the electric field of the cavity mode. Nonuniform amplitude is obtained by simply modifying the slots&#39; sizes and positions, while the in-phase excitation of the elements is remained. The nonuse of power dividers brings out a simpler antenna structure than conventional full-metal waveguide-based antennas. Besides, the full-metal structure introduces a high power-handling capacity. Then, two linear arrays with 1 × 4, 1 × 7 elements and a planar array with 5×4 elements are presented to show the design feasibility. Finally, the 5 × 4 antenna array is fabricated and measured, which can achieve 18.2 dBi gain, -20 dB sidelobe level, 94% radiation efficiency, and -42 dB cross-polarization. Good agreement between measurement and simulation verifies the feasibility of the proposed design concept.},

As such, downlink/uplink decoupling (DUDe) has become an attractive approach, as it offloads user equipments (UEs) to small-cells (SCells) and creates a more benign environment for D2D communication. In this paper, we investigate the application of DUDe in D2D-underlay heterogeneous networks, and propose an efficient joint cell-association, subchannel allocation, and power control scheme for network sum-rate maximization. The proposed scheme includes a minimum path-loss based DUDe to decide the uplink (UL) serving base-station, and a greedy coloring scheme with modified Munkres algorithm to cluster the UEs, and allocate subchannels. Furthermore, the difference of convex functions based programming algorithm for power control is utilized to maximize the network sum-rate while satisfying the UE transmit power and data rate constraints.

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet (UV) communication has emerged as a promising solution for providing non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wireless connectivity due to strong molecular and aerosol scattering at UV wavelength. However, performance of UV based communication systems is severely impaired due to nonlinear transfer-characteristics of light emitting diode (LED), which degrades the overall symbol error rate (SER) performance. In addition, UV based communication systems are also impaired by multiplicative distortion due to turbulence, that causes detrimental instantaneous outages. Hence, in this work, first an expression for the outage probability is derived for a nonlinear UV communication system via analytical characterization of the statistics of the additive distortion. Further, utilizing the proposed analytical model for additive distortion, the error rate of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) based detectors is quantified for the nonlinear outdoor NLOS UV channel. Additionally, using the derived expression for error-rate, an RKHS based minimum symbol error rate (MSER) equalizer is formulated to mitigate the distortion due to LED nonlinearity, and to enhance the error-rate performance of the considered nonlinear NLOS UV link. Convergence of the proposed MSER equalizer is analyzed, and improvements in error-rate promised by the proposed equalizer are validated by computer simulations over typical NLOS UV channels.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a key problem in WiFi fingerprint-based localization, namely how to sample a sufficient number of received signal strength (RSS) measurements during an offline site survey. To this end, a probabilistic framework is firstly presented to characterize the ability of distinguishing two fingerprints, and is then applied in both the ideally infinite sampling case and the realistically finite sampling case with correlated samples. On these grounds, it is shown that the Euclidean distance between the vectors of mean RSS measurements at any two positions is the key factor of determining localization performance, and how several other factors affect localization performance. More importantly, based on the central limit theory, a quantitative analysis is conducted to describe the degradation in localization performance introduced by finite and correlated samples. In addition, provided that correlated samples satisfy the first order autoregressive model, an explicit formula is derived to describe the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the sampling sizes, which can be employed to guide the offline site survey. Extensive simulations are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the probabilistic framework as well as the correctness of different analytical results, and an experiment is also carried out for validation. This paper not only helps to understand the basic mechanism of WiFi fingerprint-based localization, but also provides insightful guidelines for efficiently building a fingerprint database.},

  abstract     = {Recently, ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) using short-packets has been proposed to fulfill the stringent requirements regarding reliability and latency of emerging applications in 5G and beyond networks. In addition, multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO NOMA) is a potential candidate to improve the spectral efficiency, reliability, latency, and connectivity of wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate short-packet communications (SPC) in a multiuser downlink MIMO NOMA system over Nakagami- m fading, and propose two antenna-user selection methods considering two clusters of users having different priority levels. In contrast to the widely-used long data-packet assumption, the SPC analysis requires the redesign of the communication protocols and novel performance metrics. Given this context, we analyze the SPC performance of MIMO NOMA systems using the average block error rate (BLER) and minimum blocklength, instead of the conventional metrics such as ergodic capacity and outage capacity. More specifically, to characterize the system performance regarding SPC, asymptotic (in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime) and approximate closed-form expressions of the average BLER at the users are derived. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the average BLER, an analysis of the diversity order, minimum blocklength, and optimal power allocation is carried out. The achieved results show that MIMO NOMA can serve multiple users simultaneously using a smaller blocklength compared with MIMO OMA, thus demonstrating the benefits of MIMO NOMA for SPC in minimizing the transmission latency. Furthermore, our results indicate that the proposed methods not only improve the BLER performance, but also guarantee full diversity gains for the respective users.},

The presence of malicious receivers, however, compromise the security of the UAV-to-ground communications links, thereby degrading secrecy rates. In this work, we consider a NOMA-based transmission strategy in a mmWave UAV-assisted wireless network, and investigate the respective secrecy-rate performance rigorously. In particular, we propose a protected-zone approach to enhance the secrecy-rate performance by preventing the most vulnerable subregion (outside the user region) from the presence of malicious receivers. The respective secrecy rates are then derived analytically as a function of the particular protected zone, which verifies great secrecy rate improvements through optimizing shape of the protected zone in use. Furthermore, we show that the optimal protected zone shape for mmWave links appears as a compromise between protecting the angle versus distance dimension, which would otherwise form to protect solely the distance dimension for sub-6 GHz links. We also numerically evaluate the impact of transmission power, protected-zone size, and UAV altitude on the secrecy-rate performance improvement for the sake of practical deployments.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a methodology to design a sparse multiband ranging signal with a large virtual bandwidth, from which time delay and carrier phase are estimated by a low complexity multivariate maximum likelihood (ML) method. In the estimation model for a multipath channel, not all reflected paths are considered, and time delay and carrier phase are estimated in a step-wise manner to further reduce the computational load. By introducing a measure of dependence and a measure of bias for a multipath reflection, we analyse the bias, precision and accuracy of time delay and carrier phase estimation. Since these two indicators are determined by the signal spectrum pattern, they are used to formulate an optimization for signal design. By solving the optimization problem, only a few bands from the available signal spectrum are selected for ranging. Consequently, the designed signal only occupies a small amount of signal spectrum but has a large virtual bandwidth and can thereby still offer a high ranging precision with only a small bias, based on the low-complexity simplified ML method. Numerical and laboratory experiments are carried out to evaluate the ranging performance of the proposed estimation method based on sparsely selected signal bands. Relative positioning, in which we only measure a change in position, based on either the time delay estimates or the carrier phase estimates, is presented as a proof-of-concept for precise positioning. The results show that positioning based on only 7 out of 16 signal bands, sparsely placed in the available spectrum, achieves a decimeter level accuracy when using time delay estimates, and a millimeter level accuracy when using carrier phase estimates. Compared with the case of using all available bands, and without largely decreasing the positioning performance, the computational complexity when using the sparse multiband signal can be reduced by about 80%.},

  abstract     = {The large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), also known as massive MIMO, is one of the key techniques for the fifth-generation (5 G) mobile communications. Due to large-scale antenna systems equipped at the basestations, the user-basestation distance in massive MIMO systems may be within the so-called Rayleigh distance. This would cause challenges in developing algorithms for user localization, because both near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) sources (users) may coexist. To solve this problem, most of existing algorithms are based on a simplified source-sensor spatial model, where the sensor-magnitude is assumed to be equal and the spatial phase is approximated by the Taylor polynomial. In contrast, a new algorithm based on the exact spatial geometry is developed, where no model simplification is made. The new algorithm is termed as MIxed Localization using the Exact model (MILE) in that it sets up a unified (non-approximation) model framework to the problem under consideration, and solves this problem in a mathematically quite simple manner. In fact, the MILE has the following three important advantages: (1) it is not restricted to exploit equally spaced arrays, (2) it can accommodate any arbitrary propagation loss, and (3) it does not suffer the model mismatch caused performance loss. All these advantages are not offered by current state-of-the-art techniques. The matlab codes for replication of the results in this study are available at: https://github.com/jinhesjtu/MILE.git.},

  abstract     = {The use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands in 5G networks introduces a new set of challenges to network planning. Vulnerability to blockages and high path loss at mmWave frequencies require careful planning of the network to achieve a desired service quality. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D geometry-based framework for deploying mmWave base stations (gNBs) in urban environments by considering first-order reflection effects. We also provide a solution for the optimum deployment of passive metallic reflectors (PMRs) to extend radio coverage to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. In particular, we perform visibility analysis to find the direct and indirect visibility regions, and using these, we derive a geometry-and-blockage-aided path loss model. We then formulate the network planning problem as two independent optimization problems, placement of gNB(s) and PMRs, to maximize the coverage area, minimize the deployment cost, and maintain a desired quality-of-service level. We test the efficacy of our proposed approach using a generic map and compare our simulation results with the ray tracing solution. Our simulation results show that considering the first-order reflections in planning the mmWave network helps reduce the number of PMRs required to cover the NLoS area. Moreover, the gNB placement aided with PMRs require fewer gNBs to cover the same area, which in turn reduces the deployment cost.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has a great potential to offer a higher spectral efficiency of multi-user wireless networks than orthogonal multiples access (OMA). Previous work has established the condition, referred to quasi-degradation (QD) probability, under which NOMA has no performance loss compared to the capacity-achieving dirty paper coding for the two-user case. Existing results assume Rayleigh fading channels without line-of-sight (LOS). In many practical scenarios, the channel LOS component is critical to the link quality where the channel gain follows a Rician distribution instead of a Rayleigh distribution. In this work, we analyze the QD probability over multi-input and single-output (MISO) channels subject to Rician fading. The QD probability heavily depends on the angle between two user channels, which involves a matrix quadratic form in random vectors and a stochastic matrix. With the deterministic LOS component, the distribution of the matrix quadratic form is non-central that dramatically complicates the derivation of the QD probability. To remedy this difficulty, a series of approximations is proposed that yields a closed-form expression for the QD probability over MISO Rician channels. Numerical results are presented to assess the analysis accuracy and get insights into the optimality of NOMA over Rician fading channels.},

To deal with these issues, we propose a beam tracking scheme based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) using a monopulse signal, which can provide (1) higher robustness by offering a reliable link in the estimated spatial direction and (2) lower complexity compared with the existing conventional beam tracking schemes. We point out the limitations of using a beamformed signal as a measurement model for a Kalman filter (KF) based scheme and instead utilize the monopulse signal as a more plausible model. For the performance evaluation, we derive the upper bound of the mean square error for spatial angle estimation of UAV and confirm that the proposed scheme is stable with a certain bounded error. We also show from various simulations that the proposed scheme can efficiently track UAV and detect beam disconnection every time frame using a beamformed signal.},

Different from the conventional spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes, the proposed BMST-LDPC codes can have encoder/decoder implemented using the structure of the corresponding LDPC-BCs. The proposed construction is universal, which is applicable to any existing LDPC-BCs including the 5 G New Radio (5G-NR) LDPC-BCs to obtain extra coding gains. The proposed BMST-LDPC codes are also a special class of BMST codes, which have lower error floors even with an encoding memory of one, inheriting a low decoding latency. Moreover, partial superposition, where a fraction of the coded bits are superimposed onto the following codewords, is introduced to alleviate the decoding error propagation. The construction can be optimized, for random long codes, by a protograph-based extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis, or by a one-dimensional search for structured block codes. Furthermore, the BMST-LDPC scheme is integrated with the hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) over the block fading channel, improving the throughput performance. Numerical results are presented to validate our analysis and demonstrate the performance advantage of the BMST-LDPC codes over the LDPC-BCs. They also show that the proposed HARQ scheme can yield a throughput improvement of up to 10% over the conventional HARQ scheme.},

Reliable and efficient resource allocation is a prerequisite for enjoying excellent quality of vehicular communication experiences, which yet still remains a serious challenge due to the inherent vehicle mobility and network heterogeneity. In this work, taking the rapidly varying channel state information (CSI) into consideration, we investigate the joint time-frequency allocation problem for the heterogeneous cellular V2X network, where resource sharing based on hierarchical reuse among different V2X communication types are granted. To address the high dynamics of V2X environment, a mapped fuzzy space is introduced, in which the uncertain CSI is interpreted as fuzzy numbers. This could effectively avoid the deterioration of such dynamic environment to the stability and convergence of optimization mechanisms. On this basis, we construct a two-side many-to-many fuzzy matching game (MM-FMG) to formulate the optimization problem with the dynamic and uncertain information, and further propose a vehicle-resource dynamic matching algorithm to solve this MM-FMG problem. Our developed scheme can achieve both reliable and efficient resource assignment by excluding the precise CSI, which is hence more suitable to the concerned V2X scenarios. Finally, the superior performances of our designed algorithm are demonstrated via numerical simulations.},

The proposed DUESA architecture dynamically allocates antennas to sub-arrays based on channel state information, which leads to a combinatorial problem to optimize the sum rate. The exact solution to this problem requires an exhaustive search; however, the total number of candidates to search through can be extremely large in massive MIMO systems. To address this challenge, we propose three sub-optimal algorithms. The first is a tabu search-based algorithm, which examines the neighbors of the current solution to antenna-to-sub-array allocation and moves to the best one in each iteration. The second is a sequential antenna-reallocation algorithm with reduced complexity, which updates an antenna-to-sub-array assignment in each iteration. The third algorithm, that is, greedy antenna allocation, is composed of two sub-optimal algorithms. In its first part, only a single antenna is allocated to each sub-array based on a conventional algorithm. Then, in the second part, the antennas are added sequentially to each sub-array to optimize the system sum rate. The numerical results demonstrate that the DUESA architecture achieves substantially higher total achievable rates than conventional PC-HBF schemes. Furthermore, it has approximately 10%-20% higher energy efficiency than the conventional UESA architecture.},

  abstract     = {With the establishment of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) play a significant role for improving traffic safety and efficiency. In order to avoid malicious attack and resource abuse in VANETs, the use of digital signature scheme is widely regarded as the first line of defense to achieve a secure VANETs system. However, it is still a challenging task to design a conditional privacy preserving authentication scheme, to resolve security and privacy-preserving problems in VANETs and to improve the utilization ratio of information resources. In addition, the relevant researches show that the tamper-proof device (TPD) is vulnerable to side channel attacks. If the sensitive parameters stored in TPD are extracted, the system would be totally broken. To address these issues, this paper introduces a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme with double-insurance supporting batch verification (CPPA-D) for VANETs, which is constructed in cyclic groups on elliptic curves. Either the master private key or the vehicle private key is leaked, it is impossible to forge a valid authenticated message to deceive the recipients, which achieves double-insurance for private keys. When multiple messages are received, our CPPA-D scheme allows the receiver to perform batch verification to improve the efficiency. Security analysis shows that our CPPA-D scheme not only can resist traditional attacks but also can solve the security problems caused by private key stolen in the TPD under side channel attack. There is also a certain advantage in computation overhead according to efficiency analysis and comparison.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of underwater multipath signals has become an indispensable part of many military and civil applications in the oceanic field. However, DOAs of different paths of the multipath signals may be the same or too close to be separated in space, which brings a great challenge to the DOA estimation of multipath signals. Besides, the number of multipath is generally unknown and time-varying in passive scenarios which generally lead to an underdetermined case. Therefore, it is essential to study an efficient algorithm to realize the underdetermined DOA estimation of underwater multipath signals in passive scenarios. This paper proposes a passive DOA estimation algorithm of underwater multipath signals via spatial time-frequency distributions (STFDs). Firstly, we establish a multipath signals model and utilize the quadratic time-frequency (TF) analysis method to reduce cross-terms while keeping a good resolution. Then, we estimate the number of multipath and introduce a novel multi-ridge detection technique to extract the TF trajectories of multipath signals, which adopts the idea of smoothing forward and backward, and the edge TF point detection strategy. Lastly, we estimate the DOA of each path of the multipath signals separately and realize source association based on the clustering-based method. Simulation results and analysis demonstrate that this algorithm can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of instantaneous frequency (IF) and DOA estimation of underwater multipath signals in underdetermined cases and passive situations.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted wireless caching networks (WCN) have been recognized as a promising way to reduce the network load and improve the energy efficiency in the sixth generation (6 G) communication systems. Aiming to improve spectrum efficiency and system capacity, we apply non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in UAV-assisted WCN to serve multiple users on the same spectrum simultaneously and propose the cross-layer resource allocation strategy including the scheduling of UAVs, the grouping of users, and the allocation of power. First, the ρ-K-means algorithm is proposed to assign users to multiple clusters and deploy UAVs according to the distance from UAVs to the base station in the UAV deployment layer. Then, the base station broadcasts the popular files to UAVs via NOMA in the content placement layer. Based on the existing fixed power allocation strategy, we propose a statistic quality of service (QoS) based fixed (SQF) power allocation method to take the statistic QoS of the popular files into consideration and improve the energy efficiency through introducing the discount factor. On the basis of SQF, an instantaneous QoS based adaptive (IQA) strategy allocates power according to the instantaneous QoS of the popular files to reduce the file outage probability. Furthermore, we propose an improved method that is a cross-layer based optimal (CLO) power allocation strategy to maximize the system hit probability. Finally, in the content delivery layer, users in each cluster are grouped according to the channel gain from users to UAVs. In addition, each UAV serves two users on the same time-frequency resource block based on the cognitive radio inspired power allocation for the NOMA user pairs. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ρ-K-means algorithm and CLO strategy reduce the file outage probability and improve the hit probability.},

First, for systems with a multi-antenna base station (BS) and a single cluster of two single-antenna users, the average transmit power with SINR constraints is analyzed for channel-alignment-based NOMA and multi-user beamforming with matched filter (MF) beamformers. Properties of the average transmit power are obtained with respect to the alignment threshold and the BS antenna number. It is shown that using either scheme alone without the alignment consideration leads to unbounded average transmit power. With the observation that the two schemes have distinct preferred regions of channel alignment, hybrid transmissions of NOMA and multi-user beamforming are proposed for power saving and outage avoidance. Further, for systems with more than two users, clustering algorithms are developed to group users into multiple two-user clusters with respect to the minimization of the total transmit power for NOMA and hybrid schemes. Simulation results are provided to validate our theoretical results. In addition, the proposed transmission schemes and clustering algorithms are shown to achieve significant saving in the average transmit power.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication-based cooperative vehicular networks are a key technology for future smarter transportation systems as they provide various applications for addressing road safety and traffic congestion. To alleviate the performance limitations of existing dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) protocols, cellular-assisted V2V communications have been proposed recently, wherein cellular base stations (BSs) relay the transmission from one vehicle to another. Such cellular-assisted communications have shown promise for more reliable V2V communications with a wider capacity and longer transmission distances. In this study, we theoretically analyze the performance of cellular-relay (CR) V2V communications, in which a vehicle first transmits a message to its nearest BS via uplink, and then, the BS forwards the message to a destination vehicle via downlink. We model the road segments through a Poisson line process and the positions of vehicles through a Poisson point process on the roads; subsequently, we derive a theoretical expression for the probability of a successful CR transmission and the mean local delay in the CR transmission. Furthermore, we propose a performance metric to evaluate the difference between the performances of CR and direct V2V communications, and it can be applied to automatic transmission mode selection (i.e., CR or direct) for V2V communications. We evaluate the analytical results using numerical examples and demonstrate the impacts of various system parameters on the performances of CR and direct V2V communications.},

Our diversity analysis results show that, with no phase rotation, SIMO-OTFS and MIMO-OTFS systems with RAS are rank deficient, and therefore they do not extract the full receive diversity as well as the diversity present in the DD domain. Also, Alamouti coded STC-OTFS system with RAS and no phase rotation extracts the full transmit diversity, but it fails to extract the DD diversity. On the other hand, SIMO-OTFS and STC-OTFS systems with RAS become full-ranked when phase rotation is used, because of which they extract the full spatial as well as the DD diversity present in the system. Also, when phase rotation is used, MIMO-OTFS systems with RAS extract the full DD diversity, but they do not extract the full receive diversity because of rank deficiency.

  abstract     = {Recently, numerous electronic components are installed in vehicles, providing drivers and passengers with increased safety and convenience. The electronic components construct an in-vehicle network that internally shares relevant status information about the vehicle. As modern vehicles become more computerized, the potential for automotive cyber-security threats also increases a fact that has been illustrated clearly by various car-hacking demonstrations. Using the controller area network (CAN), the de facto standard protocol in the automotive industry that facilitates in-vehicle network communication, car-hacking demonstrations inject critical CAN messages to control vehicular functions. In efforts to address this security issue, car manufacturers, in turn, have made confidential the CAN database (i.e., DBC format file), where signal information assigned in the CAN data payload is specified. However, it has since become known that this policy does not hermetically seal a vehicular network against cyber attacks. On the contrary, in-depth automotive security research has been hindered significantly because of the limited information accessible by researchers. For example, automotive intrusion detection systems (IDS) identify and alert when there is a vehicular break-in, and this technology is a major area of study in automotive cyber security research. For the automotive IDS that analyzes CAN traffic, information in the DBC format file greatly improves detection veracity. However, most IDS technologies to date have been independently developed without the confidential CAN DB information and, as a result, do not mitigate threats to a satisfactory standard. In this paper, we propose an enhanced method that identifies signal boundaries in a CAN data payload, which is specified in the DBC format file. Unlike an existing method that is designed based on total bit-flip rates, our method analyzes bit-flip time series not total bit-flip rates so that signal boundaries can be more clearly identified. In this paper, we use a publicly available DBC format file called OpenDBC as a reference, and show that our method outperforms the existing method.},

Firstly, we propose a novel framework (framework 1) that can guarantee the excellent detection performance of clustering detectors to implement the signal detection even if in the case of short block length by considering the rotational symmetry of digital modulation constellations. Then, we propose a novel rule by defining the concept of pseudo rotational symmetry of cluster centroids, which can check the quality of the cluster centroids of clustering algorithms. Besides, based on the proposed rule, we investigate two scenarios and propose framework 2 and framework 3 for the problems in the scenarios. Specifically, the framework 2 can early terminate the clustering algorithms that are performed multiple times different initializations to avoid poor detection performance, and it significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining excellent performance. The framework 3 can adjust the data length of clustering algorithms according to different environmental conditions that can improve the detection efficiency while improving performance. Moreover, the proposed framework 1 can be combined with proposed framework 2 or framework 3, which further enhances the detection performance. In addition, we conduct the performance analysis for the SM-MIMO systems when the perfect channel state information (CSI) is unavailable. Simulation results demonstrate the clustering detectors combined with proposed frameworks behave better than the clustering detectors without the proposed frameworks in terms of performance or complexity.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can improve the wireless link between the transmitter and receiver by configuring the propagation environments of the system. In order to achieve intelligence of the configuration, the channel state information is required. In this paper, we study the downlink channel estimation problem in an IRS-aided frequency division duplexing (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We propose a two-phase training scheme such that the direct channel (non-IRS channel) and the cascaded channel (IRS-aided channel) can be tracked by two Kalman filters separately. The pilots transmitted by the base station (BS) and the reflective coefficients at the IRS are then jointly optimized to improve the channel estimation accuracy. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, the optimal solution is not straightforward. A lower bound of the objective function is derived to serve as the baseline for evaluating the performance of a certain pilot and reflective coefficients design. In two special cases, namely the direct channel dominant scenario and the cascaded channel dominant scenario, we find that the optimal pilots and the optimal reflective coefficient matrix can be approximated by some columns of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices as the number of antennas at the BS and the number of reflective elements at the IRS get larger. We further propose a codebook-based low-complexity design for a general scenario which can significantly reduce the control overhead of the IRS and cut the computational burden. Numerical results are provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed channel estimation method.},

However, the symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER) have not been studied comprehensively in the NOMA, even they play a key role in communication system control, e.g., power allocation. To address such an issue, this paper studies the SER and BER with consideration of the downlink/uplink transmission, the number of information streams, and the channel coding jointly. For analyzing the impact of channel coding, Gray coding is introduced for the downlink transmission. The derived SER and BER are given by closed-form expressions, by which the transmission performance could be evaluated efficiently. We also show an approximate SER/BER when the transmitter could employ Gray-coding. Additionally, associating with the derived closed-form expressions, we show that there exists no error propagation/error accumulation phenomenon when the successive interference cancellation (SIC) is adopted in signal demodulation, which is treated as a major drawback of SIC demodulation in the NOMA systems. Furthermore, by analyzing the encoding/decoding processes in the current NOMA works, a joint Gray-coding scheme is introduced to reduce the SER and BER in the downlink transmission effectively. Through simulations, we validate the correctness of the derived expressions of SER and BER from different aspects.},

  abstract     = {As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely employed, the spectrum resource for UAV communication becomes scarce. The UAVs may communicate based on spectrum sharing, requiring efficient spectrum prediction to improve the performance of spectrum sensing. However, since the existing prediction methods are generally designed to predict the spectrum states in the next moment at the current location, they can not be directly applied to UAVs which rapidly move to the next location when obtaining the prediction result. In another word, the UAVs require to predict the spectrum in the next moment at the next location. This is a method which can predict spectrum in the joint temporal and spatial dimensions. The main challenge is the historical data of the next location is usually not possible to be obtained in advance by the UAVs. This paper proposes a new prediction approach which firstly estimates the historical data of the next location based on the homotopy theory (HT), and then performs the prediction based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), referring to the HT-HMM based prediction. Experimental results show that the HT-HMM based approach is able to efficiently predict the spectrum states of the next location.},

To overcome this issue, we propose to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a friendly jammer to interfere Eve in decoding the confidential message from the secondary transmitter. Our goal is to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV&#39;s trajectory in the three-dimensional space to maximize the average achievable secrecy rate of the secondary system. The formulated optimization problem is nonconvex due to the non-convexity of the objective and non-convexity of constraints, which is very challenging to solve. To obtain a suboptimal but efficient solution to the design problem, we first transform it into a more tractable form and then develop an iterative algorithm for its solution by leveraging the inner approximation (IA) framework. Combining tools from IA framework and S-procedure, we further extend the proposed algorithm to a more realistic scenario, where the imperfect location information of ground nodes (including Eve, secondary receiver and primary receiver) is considered, resulting in the average worst-case secrecy rate. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission between a source and two end users is examined over slow Generalized-K distributed (GKD) fading channels, where a single relay using decode-and-forward (DF) protocol is selected out of a set of full-duplex/half-duplex (FD/HD) multiple relays with the quality of service requirements. Two stage relay selection (RS), selecting a relay out of a set of relays providing service quality for user 1 to maximize data rate of user 2, is analyzed. Additionally, not only perfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC) but also imperfect SIC (ipSIC) is considered. Self-interference (SI) and ipSIC are assumed to be Nakagami-m distributed, additionally, Gaussian and channel gain dependent modelling of ipSIC are also considered. A new expression for cumulative distribution function (CDF) of GKD is provided, thereafter, robust approximated probability density function (PDF) and CDF for GKD based on generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature are derived. Since outage probability (OP) analysis with exact CDF is found to be unstable, approximated and asymptotic OP expressions are derived and validated via Monte Carlo simulation technique. Approximated CDF, in turn OP, expression is almost excellent. Unlike existing works, our expressions are unique and valid for all cases such as FD and HD together with pSIC and ipSIC, i.e. expressions are not given separately but in a single compact form. Effects of SI, ipSIC, fading and shadowing parameters on OP are demonstrated and it is also shown that RS can significantly reduce OP. Finally, nonzero diversity order is asserted and details are provided.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel quaternion-based attitude estimation method for land-vehicle applications by fusing the low-cost magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensors and global navigation satellite systems measured velocity (GNSS-V). A structure of three-layer cascaded indirect Kalman filter (IKF) is devised to minimize the interactions of heterogeneous error sources on attitude quaternion solutions. It sequentially fuses the Earth&#39;s gravity vector, magnetic vector, and GNSS-V vector pairs with quaternion state constraints from Euler angles in each local filter. To further ensure the robustness of quaternion-based attitude solution, the external acceleration term is adaptively compensated within a sliding window of GNSS-V information. Meanwhile, independent and cross check procedures for observation vectors are also established for excluding individual sensor fault by taking land-vehicle dynamics into account. It is of significant importance that, in this contribution, the GNSS measured velocity is fully utilized in all potential aspects of aiding attitude determination with MARG sensors. Real-world vehicular experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The presented results verify the validity and efficiency thus the developed method may be promising for implemention in land-vehicle applications.},

  abstract     = {A state-of-the-art real-time rain detection and wiper control method is proposed in this article. Currently, commercial models adopt electronic sensors that can only sample the humidity of a small region of the windshield. The existing computer vision methods primarily focus on the detection and counting of raindrops and provide a recall rate of less than 70%. Here we adopted a holistic-view deep learning approach to build a visual classifier that is robust to large varieties of background scenes, illumination, and water forms. Specifically, Deep Residual Network (ResNet) was adopted as the visual classifier that distinguishes between rainy and fair street scenes and controls the wipers accordingly. To verify the practicality of the proposed deep learning framework, we tested the network on various embedded computing systems, including an embedded computing cluster. The results show that the deep learning rain detector outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with higher rain recall and precision. It was also found that with the help of some graphic computation-enhancing components, commonly available embedded systems in the market can provide comparable performance to personal computers. While using the enhanced embedded systems to build a cluster, a performance superior to PC was witnessed. As the embedded system is cost-effective, small, and lighter, normalized performances for various aspects clearly show the competitive edge of the embedded systems and confirm the practicality of the proposed system. We also release the dataset of 160 k images used for training the visual rain detector.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries have found wide usage in electric vehicles (EVs). Efficient utilization of the storage capacity of any battery used in EVs is heavily dependent on the accuracy of state of charge (SOC) estimation. The classical SOC-OCV (open circuit voltage) based approach for estimation of SOC is quite ineffective under rapid variation in operating condition of EVs. The impact of parameter variations and unknown disturbances due to widely varying environmental conditions and drive terrain, demands a robust observer for SOC estimation. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel SOC estimation technique using a nonlinear fractional-order unknown input observer (FOUIO). The scheme based on the combined framework of fractional calculus and state estimation with unknown input is able to meet the challenges of SOC estimation in EVs by decoupling the plant disturbance inputs from the state estimation process. The optimally designed FOUIO using a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based formulation has been analytically proved for convergence. The proposed FOUIO has been validated and compared with reported SOC estimation schemes for different drive profiles in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. The numerical simulations and hardware in loop (HIL) based experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FOUIO in estimating the SOC robustly under different scenarios of battery operation.},

  abstract     = {In vehicles, wheel locking and associated instability issues can be prevented by regulating wheel brake torque during braking. In contrast with conventional vehicles, electrified vehicles have both friction and regenerative braking. Typically, pneumatic friction braking is used for Wheel Slip Regulation (WSR) in Heavy Commercial Road Vehicles (HCRVs). However, the pneumatic brake system has a lower bandwidth compared to a regenerative brake system, thereby affecting the braking performance of the HCRV during WSR application. This article proposes an Integral Sliding Mode Control (ISMC) based WSR to exploit the responsiveness of regenerative brakes during braking. The proposed control strategy was evaluated in a hardware-in-loop experimental setup. For different operating conditions, the experimental results conveyed that the proposed braking strategy incorporating regenerative braking reduced the slip ratio tracking root mean square error and stopping distance in the range of 12.13% to 72% and 2.43% to 4% respectively compared to conventional frictional braking (without regenerative braking).},

The key difference of proposed machine is that Halbach PM arrays are employed in the inner stator slot openings, so that the parallel magnetic circuit between PM field and wound field is performed and the ratio of PM field short-circuited in the inner stator is effectively reduced. Thus a wider speed regulation region and a higher torque/power density can be achieved. Firstly, the configuration of proposed machine is described, based on which its operating principle is discussed. Then the electromagnetic performances are calculated and compared based on 2-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA). The results show that the torque can be improved by 76% with a similar magnetic field regulation ratio compared with an existing PS-HE machine with slot PMs. Finally, a prototype machine is built and tested to verify the analysis and FEA results.},

  abstract     = {As a fundamental task of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), energy management strategies are critical for improving the performance. This paper proposes a new queue-Dyna reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based energy management strategy (EMS), which can substantially reduce the online learning time while guarantees the control performance compared with widely used Q-learning. To solve the existing problems of direct and indirect RL based EMSs, a blended RL algorithm, Dyna, is introduced first. By reusing the actual experience to construct a model online, Dyna integrates direct and indirect RL, and thus has the advantages of both. Furthermore, two novel strategies of backward focusing and prioritized sweeping are incorporated in the Dyna framework, developing the queue-Dyna algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, it&#39;s the first attempt of adopting queue-Dyna in the EMS of a HEV. A comparative simulation of direct RL, indirect RL, Dyna and queue-Dyna is implemented, and the results demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves a great improvement in fast learning and maintains satisfied fuel consumption. At last, a hardware-in-the-loop experiment verified the real-time performance of the proposed EMS.},

The influence of order and width of RBF-NN on the online prediction accuracy was studied in depth, it was found that RBF-NN with a fixed structure was not always suitable for the overall online prediction process. Then, by introducing a neural network structure determination method (SDM) with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), an adaptive RBF-NN which adjust structure in real time was designed to perform online VVP to further improve the prediction accuracy. Simulation results indicate that, the VVP strategy proposed in this paper predicts the future vehicle velocity with acceptable accuracy.

Therefore, this paper uses the real phase and position information of traffic lights to establish a road model and proposes a multi-objective hierarchical optimal (MOHO) strategy. First, a speed planning module is developed as the upper layer. By integrating speed constraints, slope, and traffic light information, a model predictive control (MPC)-based speed planning strategy (SPS) is developed, which improves riding comfort. Second, an energy management module is developed as the lower layer. An adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS)-based energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed, which achieves the optimal power distribution. The results show that the proposed MOHO strategy can improve riding comfort and fuel economy while avoiding vehicle stopping at the signalized intersection under two different road conditions.},

A novel matching-based radar imaging algorithm is proposed to obtain the positions of multiple targets in the L-shaped corner scenario with complex multipath ghost signals. Firstly, a multipath propagation model for the multiple targets scenario is established. Then the positions of the actual multipath ghosts are extracted from the radar image, and the candidate targets corresponding to these multipath ghosts are derived. Secondly, the ellipse-cross-localization method is proposed to obtain the positions of the candidate multipath ghosts, followed by two defined matching factors to measure the similarity between actual and candidate multipath ghosts. According to the similarity, decision rules are designed to determine the actual targets. Compared with the localization algorithm based on one-dimensional range profile, the proposed algorithm can effectively cope with the cases of multiple targets, even in the cases of rough walls and noise. Finally, simulations and experimental data are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Each vehicle is equipped with a camera, placed on the dashboard, that perceives the scene in a drivers view. This scene is analyzed and mapped into specific warning codes that are specific to a safety event, and communicated as short packets using visible light communication. The camera in the following vehicle captures this information and generates a recommendation for safety action to the driver by comparing the warning from the packet and from its own scene perception. Through experimental evaluations of a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that our system is able to achieve up to 90% accuracy in identifying nine occluded safety events, which correspond to traffic light statuses (red, green, yellow), other vehicles’ lane change behaviors (merge/leave lane left/right), and pedestrian detection.},

Reacting to such situations requires accurate classification for uncommon events, which in turn depends on the selection of large, diverse, and high-quality training data. In fact, the data available at a vehicle (e.g., photos of road signs) may be affected by errors or have different levels of resolution and freshness. To tackle this challenge, we propose an active learning framework that, leveraging the information collected through onboard sensors as well as received from other vehicles, effectively deals with scarce and noisy data. Given the information received from neighboring vehicles, our solution: (i) selects which vehicles can reliably generate high-quality training data, and (ii) obtains a reliable subset of data to add to the training set by trading off between two essential features, i.e., quality and diversity. The results, obtained with different real-world datasets, demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, providing high classification accuracy with a limited bandwidth requirement for the data exchange between vehicles.},

The existing TBD methods suffer from performance degradation due to the use of approximate motion models in range-Doppler plane. In this paper, exact time evolving rules of target range and Doppler are presented for constant acceleration (CA) and coordinated turn (CT) motions in Cartesian coordinates, and two novel pseudo-spectrum based TBD approaches are proposed for effective detection of weak CA and CT targets in range-Doppler plane, respectively. In accordance with the common CA and CT motions in Cartesian coordinates, the accurate time evolution equations of range and Doppler are derived for CA and CT targets, respectively, which are nonlinear functions of range-Doppler and several invariable parameters. Then, the pseudo-spectrum based TBD of CA and CT targets in range-Doppler plane is performed by matching these invariants. Each range-Doppler cell is predicted according to the exact evolution equation. A pseudo-spectrum is constructed around the predicted position, and sample values of the pseudo-spectrum are added onto cells for energy integration. This eliminates performance loss caused by model mismatch and target output envelope can be well maintained. To deal with the unknown target parameters, two pseudo-spectrum based matched filter banks are proposed for CA and CT targets, respectively. Analysis and design of the filter banks are provided in detail. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the validity of the proposed methods in handling weak maneuvering targets.},

Typically, heterogeneous type of sensor nodes are present in the device layer of Safe-aaS. Considering the case of safety in road transportation, we compute the fixed and variable costs incurred in procurement, deployment, and maintenance for each of these different types of sensor nodes. We introduce the concept of tariff cost, which varies with the type of road in different regions and presence of similar homogeneous sensor nodes deployed in that region. Finally, we estimate the utility of a sensor node, which is a function of the sensing area, ratio of the fixed cost to total cost incurred, responsiveness factor, and rating given by an end-user for that sensor node. The SSPs provide rent to the sensor/vehicle owners for taking their sensor nodes on lease. In order to formulate the interactions among the SSPs and sensor owners, we apply first-price, sealed-bid auction-based game theoretic approach, where SSPs act as bidders. Exhaustive simulation results depict that the proposed pricing scheme, RegPrice, is capable of reducing the expenses of a SSP by 7.51% and 9.71% compared to the existing pricing schemes [1] and [2] .},

Scheduling algorithms used in the PCS can optimally assign PCS resources to the vehicles in order to maximize their profit. Although the main purpose of the PCS is to provide charging capability, it needs to address other customer requirements such as different deadline constraints, battery swapping, and vehicle to grid (V2G). In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive model for multiservice PCS profit maximization in which battery charging, discharging, and swapping services are included. The model has been used in formulating a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem wherein charging and discharging of vehicles are scheduled to maximize the PCS profit. We utilize queuing theory to analyze the performance of the model at the presence of random variables such as solar power, electricity price, state of charge (SoC), amount of discharge (AoD), battery capacity, and vehicle arrival time to the PCS. Low complexity and near-optimal online scheduling algorithm is proposed to complete the offline scheduling solution. Our simulation results show that more profit for the PCS and less delay for vehicles are better achieved when the number of vehicles requesting battery swapping service is increased. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the impact of different parameters on long-term profit and the performance of the online algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of trajectory tracking control for marine surface vehicles (MSVs), which are subject to dynamic uncertainties, external disturbances and unmeasurable velocities. To recover the unmeasurable velocities, a novel adaptive neural network-based (NN-based) state observer is constructed. To guarantee the transient and steady-state tracking performance of the system, a novel nonlinear transformation method is proposed by employing a tracking error transformation together with a newly constructed performance function, which is characterized by a user-defined settling time and tracking control accuracy. With the aid of the state observer and the nonlinear transformation method in combination with the adaptive NN technique and vector-backstepping design tool, an adaptive neural output-feedback trajectory tracking control scheme with predefined performance is developed. With regard to the developed control scheme, uncertainties can be reconstructed only by utilizing the position and heading of the MSVs. Independent designs of the state observer and the controller can be achieved, and the position tracking error can be guaranteed to fall into a predefined residual set in the user-defined time frame and remain in the above set. A rigorous stability analysis validates that all signals in the closed-loop trajectory tracking control system for MSVs are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed adaptive neural output-feedback trajectory tracking control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) and a linear quadratic tracking (LQT) method for optimal power-split control of a combustion engine and an electric machine in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The objective is to deliver demanded torque and minimize fuel consumption and usage of service brakes, subject to constraints on actuator limits and battery state of charge (SOC). First, we derive a function for calculating maximum deliverable torque that is as close as possible to demanded torque and then reduce the number of control inputs to one while minimizing the usage of service brakes in the case of negative demanded torque. Next, we propose modeling SOC constraints by tangent or logarithm functions that provide an interior point to both the ECMS and the LQT. Then, we show that the resulting objective functions are convex, and we propose sub-optimal analytic solutions for the optimization problem by applying their second order approximation about a given reference. We also consider robustness of the controllers to measurement noise using a simple model of noise. Simulation results of the two controllers are compared, and their effectiveness is discussed.},

Hence development of technology associated with the evaluation of safety and stability of SBPM is essential. In evaluating the safety, SBPM cannot be tested physically for all different conditions due to many reasons. Therefore, we developed a virtual environment simulation platform capable of reproducing the dynamic behavior of SBPM for various driving conditions accurately thereby replacing the actual tests and being used as a platform for the evaluation of safety/stability of SBPM. To construct the co-simulation platform, model of SBPM was built in RecurDyn using the actual measurement data of a commercial SBPM product, and two internal controllers (self-balancing controller, and yaw-rate command controller) that play key roles in realizing the dynamic characteristics of SBPM were experimentally identified and were implemented into the RecurDyn model using MATLAB/Simulink. Validity of the virtual environment co-simulation platform was verified through the comparison with the experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Operating remotely piloted aircraft is not imaginable without a continuous data exchange between the air vehicle and the remote pilot. This data exchange requires reliable data links. One approach for such a data link discussed in the community is a terrestrial system deployed in C-band. A good knowledge of the physical conditions of the communication channel, in this case the air-ground/ground-air channel, is indispensable for the development of wireless data links. Therefore we carried out a 50 MHz bandwidth channel sounding campaign with a terrestrial transmitter and an airborne receiver. In this paper we give a detailed description of our campaign setup and the processing of the collected data. The campaign covered several flight scenarios, such as take-off, taxiing, and multiple en-route maneuvers. We furthermore present results on the received power and the amplitude distribution of the dominant component of the received signal for the different flight scenarios. We observed significant drops in reception power during certain maneuvers that need to be considered in the design process of a data link for unmanned aviation. Additionally, we show that the amplitude distribution follows the distributions commonly used in statistical channel modeling of wireless channels to some extent. We finally present parameter sets for multiple flight scenarios for scaling the amplitude distributions to allow a statistical channel modeling of the reception power of the first resolvable signal path.},

  abstract     = {With the recent developments on opening the terahertz (THz) spectrum for experimental purposes by the Federal Communications Commission, transceivers operating in the range of 0.1THz-10THz, which are known as THz bands, will enable ultra-high throughput wireless communications. However, actual implementation of the high-speed and high reliability THz band communication systems should start with providing extensive knowledge in regards to the propagation channel characteristics. Considering the huge bandwidth and the rapid changes in the characteristics of THz wireless channels, ray tracing and one-shot statistical modeling are not adequate to define an accurate channel model. In this work, we propose Gamma mixture based channel modeling for the THz band via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. First, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied to characterize the Gamma mixture model parameters, and then EM algorithm is used to compute MLEs of the unknown parameters of the measurement data. The accuracy of the proposed model is investigated by using the Weighted relative mean difference (WMRD) error metrics, Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to show the difference between the proposed model and the actual probability density functions (PDFs) that are obtained via the designed test environment. To efficiently evaluate the performance of the proposed method in more realistic scenarios, all the analysis is done by examining measurement data from a measurement campaign in the 240 GHz to 300 GHz frequency range, using a well-isolated anechoic chamber. According to WMRD error metrics, KL-divergence, and KS test results, PDFs generated by the mixture of Gamma distributions fit to the actual histogram of the measurement data. It is shown that instead of taking pseudo-average characteristics of sub-bands in the wide band, using the mixture models allows for determining channel parameters more precisely.},

The objective is to guarantee spatial-geometry constraints of vehicles in a platoon. We deal with the case where a predecessor-leader following (PLF) communication topology is used and heterogeneous vehicle dynamics is subject to disturbances. To estimate the lumped disturbance, the technique of unknown input proportional multiple-integral (PMI) observer is employed such that both the state and the disturbance are simultaneously estimated. Moreover, tube-based model predictive control (TMPC) is used and the corresponding control law is composed of a feed-forward term, a feedback term, and a disturbance compensation term. The gains in the integrated control strategy are optimized by utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with an H ∞ performance index of an augmented error system. It is proved that the deviations between the actual system and the nominal system are bounded in a robustly positively invariant (RPI) set, that is, the main objective is guaranteed. With the proposed control strategy, simulations and comparisons are carried out. We can see that the control performance of the proposed strategy is significantly improved while the computational time is reduced compared with existing methods.},

To deal with this problem, we first formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP), and then introduce the state and action spaces. We further design a novel offloading strategy based on the deep Q network (DQN), where the users can dynamically fine-tune the offloading proportion in order to ensure the system performance measured by the latency and energy consumption.

In particular, to solve this problem, we propose a product Riemmanian manifold (PRM) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the beamformer at transmitter as well as phase shift coefficients at double IRS, in which the PRM optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the phase shift coefficients at both IRSs simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm greatly enhance the SR compared with the existing benchmark schemes.

However, the conventional ZF is of high complexity as a result of ignoring the structure of the FD massive MIMO channels while the 2D ZF has poor performance due to neglecting the elevation angular spread. In this correspondence, by exploiting the spatial correlation of the FD massive MIMO channels, we propose a dominant path zero-forcing precoding (DPZF) scheme based on the low-rank matrix approximation. The proposed DPZF scheme includes two stages. In the first stage, we obtain the elevation and the azimuth components of r dominant paths for each user&#39;s channel by solving the rank-r channel matrix approximation. In the subsequent stage, we reformulate the Gram matrix with the obtained components so as to zero force the most dominant path of each user&#39;s channel with low complexity. For the proposed DPZF, the upper bound of the performance gap to the conventional ZF is derived and the complexity is analyzed. The analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed DPZF can yield a more elegant performance-complexity tradeoff than the existing precoding schemes.},

  abstract     = {Efficient spectrum management has always been an important issue due to the scarcity of satellite spectral resource, especially with the ever-increasing broadband demand. This paper proposes a market-driven technique to improve spectrum efficiency. In practice, spectrum resources are typically allocated in bulk to terrestrial agents which in turn will resell the bandwidth to end users of satellite communications. This paper explores the important role of terrestrial agents which serve as spectrum sales agents in satellite communications systems. The proposed approach aims to provide an incentive scheme for the agents to participate in the spectrum optimization process so as to result in maximizing the benefit of the agents as well as the satellite systems. We propose a dynamically optimal cooperation scheme between terrestrial agents and satellite systems, which is based on a stochastic process and optimal contract principle. By taking into consideration the satellite system&#39;s marginal cost related to transmission capacity in the given bandwidth, terrestrial agent&#39;s effort and the impact of market volatility, we designed an optimal incentive model which allows the satellite systems to determine a threshold value for paying sales commission to terrestrial agents or triggering contract termination if spectrum utilization is inefficient. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the performances of satellite systems&#39; profits in changing spectrum market and agency cost undertaken by satellite systems.},

The optimal design of cell associations and precoders are particularly relevant due to the anticipated ultra-dense networks suffering from heavy interference. As the resulting optimization is a non-convex and combinatorial problem, we propose an iterative low complexity algorithm, employing the recently developed penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework. In contrast to predominantly used sparsity inducing methods, the proposed method incorporates the penalty/re-weighting strategy into the algorithm, which is then solved as a sequence of convex second-order cone programs. The aforementioned feature leads to a high convergence rate and subsequently a low computational cost for the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm meets the requirements to converge to a KKT solution. Numerical simulations verify the superior performance of our proposed method in ultra-dense networks, in comparison to commonly used methods, such as the reweighted l 1 -norm, in terms of system energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent mobility and enhanced communication capability of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it is foreseen that effective UAV-based sensing schemes can achieve faster deployment and flexible observation as compared to the traditional fixed sensing systems. In many sensing applications, multiple geographically distributed tasks need to be executed while satisfying a stringent requirement on the transmission delay of the sensory data, especially for the time-critical sensing tasks, such as disaster rescue and environment monitoring. To minimize the overall mission completion time in such delay constrained multi-task UAV-based sensing applications, it is imperative to properly design the inter-task trajectory, the UAV-BS association, and the sensing order. Nonetheless, finding the optimal sensing scheme is highly non-trivial since these three sub-problems are tightly coupled and involve non-convex constraints. To overcome these challenges, firstly, a novel space pruning based trajectory search (SPTS) algorithm is proposed by exploiting the geometric characteristics of the optimal inter-task UAV trajectory, which can achieve a substantially faster convergence as compared to the Ployblock algorithm. Secondly, a novel optimal UAV-BS association (OUBA) algorithm is presented to quickly identify the best BS for each sensing task. Thirdly, by combining these two proposed algorithms with the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm, a lower bound of the mission completion time can be efficiently computed and a near-optimal solution can be obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate that significant performance improvement can be achieved by the proposed scheme.},

Although a number of works have been proposed to study adversarial samples, only a few of them are designated for the scenario of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the state-of-the-art attack models only focus on a single data source without considering the correlation among multiple data sources. To fill this blank, we propose two multi-source adversarial sample attack models, including the parallel attack model and the fusion attack model to simultaneously attack the image and LiDAR perception systems in the autonomous vehicles. In the parallel attack model, adversarial samples are generated from the original image and LiDAR data separately. In the fusion attack model, the adversarial samples of image and LiDAR can be generated from a low-dimension vector at the same time by fully exploring data correlation for data fusion and adversarial sample generation. Through comprehensive real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed models are more powerful and efficient to break down the perception systems of autonomous vehicles compared with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we simulate possible attack scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to evaluate the attack performance of our proposed methods.},

The proposed algorithm combines Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) to analyze the preferences of multiple services for different network attributes and obtain the Quality of Experience (QoE) of different edge users for each network. Moreover, in order to realize the fair allocation of network resources, we comprehensively consider the importance of the requested services and the obtained QoE by edge users to construct system fairness index. The BGMNS algorithm can optimize the overall QoE of users under the premise of ensuring the system fairness. Simulation results show that compared to the existing network selection algorithms, the proposed BGMNS algorithm can not only provide stable access to users when network status fluctuates randomly, but also effectively reduce user blocking probability as well as total packet loss rate, and significantly improve user average energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing deployment of more short-range small cells using mmWave technologies, backhaul becomes a bottleneck and wireless backhaul is relatively attractive compared to wired backhaul due to lower cost and efficient operation. As such, cooperative relaying for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless backhaul networks is studied, in which the source sends independent messages to K destinations with the help of N relays where the relays operate in full- or half-duplex mode. Herein, we focus on a line-of-sight dominant environment in which each of the channel matrices between nodes becomes rank-deficient due to the lack of multi-paths. In such cases, the multiplexing gain from using multiple antennas is severely limited, and the capacity cannot be improved with the number of antennas. To overcome the rank deficiency, we develop a novel cooperative relaying scheme that utilizes relays as active reflectors. In the proposed scheme, the source distributes the streams over the relays as uniformly as possible, and the relays extract the streams of each destination based on their received signals and forward them to their corresponding destinations, while any inter-user and inter-relay interference is also properly nulled out. We analyze the achievable sum degrees of freedoms (DoFs) and sum rates with full-duplex and half-duplex relays, and derive an upper bound on the sum DoF, which is tight when the relays operate in full-duplex mode. The results demonstrate that our scheme offers significant improvement to system throughput in comparison with direct transmission without cooperative relaying.},

We design a recursive predictor that estimates future interference values by filtering measured interference at a given location. The predictor&#39;s parameterization is done offline by translating the autocorrelation of interference into an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) representation. This ARMA model is inserted into a steady-state Kalman filter enabling nodes to predict with low computational effort. Results show a good accuracy of predicted values versus true values for relevant time horizons. Although the predictor is parameterized for Poisson-distributed nodes, Rayleigh fading, and fixed message lengths, a sensitivity analysis shows that it also tends to work well in more general network scenarios. Numerical examples for underlay device-to-device communications, a common wireless sensor technology, and coexistence scenarios of Wi-Fi and LTE illustrate its broad applicability. The predictor can be applied as part of interference management to improve medium access, scheduling, and radio resource allocation.},

When streaming SVC-encoded live video, the video source should dynamically derive and configure a set of coding parameters for each upcoming chunk, which consists of a number of consecutive frames. The coding parameters quantify the throughput evolution of an upcoming chunk by providing a few bitrate options for the frames within this chunk to encode with. Unlike the majority of existing works that simply treat the coding parameters as given (i.e., taking them for granted), in this paper, we derive the coding parameters from a comprehensive mathematical modeling and optimization perspective. Our approach consists of an optimization problem that captures the fundamental trade-off in determining the coding parameters and a customized search algorithm based on the analysis of the optimization problem&#39;s solution structure. Numerical results produced by the NS-3 network simulator show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

Therefore, a reinforcement learning-based opportunistic routing protocol (RLOR) is proposed in this paper by combining the advantages of opportunistic routing and reinforcement learning algorithm. The RLOR is a kind of distributed routing approach, which comprehensively considers nodes’ peripheral status to select the appropriate relay nodes. Additionally, a recovery mechanism is employed in RLOR to enable the packets to bypass the void area efficiently and continue to forward, which improves the delivery rate of data in some sparse networks. The simulation results show that, compared with other representative underwater routing protocols, the proposed RLOR performs well in end-to-end delay, reliability, energy efficiency and other aspects in underwater dynamic network environments.},

  abstract     = {Mega-constellation networks (MCNs) based on low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have become increasingly important with many projects in the design or implementation phase. For those MCN systems with inter-satellite links (ISLs), the large number of satellites increases the routing complexity and the required hop-count of ISL paths. This paper aims to provide insights into the topology and routing design in MCNs through the analysis of ISL paths. We propose a theoretical model to explicitly estimate the ISL hop-count between ground users in MCNs with inclined orbits. The spatial distribution properties of hop-count are derived based on the proposed method. Based on an exemplary constellation, that is Starlink, the global distribution patterns of hop-count and the path difference caused by different access satellites are illustrated for the first time. In Starlink, the difference of the paths from different starting satellites can be up to 45 hops. The numerical results show that optimizing the constellation phasing factor can effectively reduce the average hop-count, for both the whole network and specific regional users.},

  abstract     = {Delivering high fidelity virtual reality (VR) video over mobile networks is very challenging since VR applications usually require very high bandwidth and ultra low latency. With the evolution of 5G mobile networks, multi-cell multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks enable low latency data communication. However, even in this setting, the requirements of VR applications are tough to meet. To optimize the end-to-end latency for VR video delivery over multi-cell MEC networks, we propose a rendering-aware tile caching scheme. As a first step we propose collaborative tile caching in 5G MEC networks by enabling multiple cell sites to share caches so that the network caching performance is improved. Hence, the amount of redundant data delivered and eventually the latency are both significantly reduced. Second, our scheme offloads viewport rendering of VR video to the MEC server and closely couples this with cache placement, allowing thus the rendering-induced latency to be reduced. Finally, a low-delay request routing algorithm is integrated with the proposed cache placement scheme to further optimize the end-to-end latency of VR video delivery. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed rendering-aware caching scheme can achieve better latency performance than the state-of-the-art decoupled caching/rendering schemes.},

To this end, a monolithic Stochastic Reward Net (SRN) is proposed to evaluate the delivery delay and the average number of transmissions under epidemic routing by considering skewed location visiting preferences. This model is not scalable enough, in terms of the number of nodes and frequently visited locations. In order to achieve higher scalability, the folding technique is applied to the monolithic model, and an approximate folded SRN is proposed to evaluate performance of epidemic routing. Discrete-event simulation is used to validate the proposed models. Both SRN models for predicting the performance of epidemic routing exhibit high accuracy. We also propose an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model for epidemic routing and compare it with the folded model. The obtained results show that the folded model is more accurate than the ODE model. Moreover, it is proved that the number of transmissions by the time of delivery follows a uniform distribution, for a general class of networks, where positions of nodes are always independent and identically distributed.},

  abstract     = {A large-scale clustered massive MIMO network is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency of the next-generation wireless infrastructure by maximizing its sum-rate. Our solution combines the advantages of the centralized processing architecture and massive MIMO. Explicitly, the network is divided into multiple clusters; each cluster is handled by a centralized processing unit, which connects to a certain number of massive MIMO-aided BSs, where only limited information is exchanged among the clusters; each user of a cluster can be served by several nearby BSs in a user-centric way. We analyze the maximum sum-rate of the network with multiple antennas at BSs and UEs, relying on the optimal transmit precoder matrix of each BS configured for each user, and on the optimal frequency-domain power sharing scheme of each cluster. The optimizations are conceived for multiple coordination schemes that were widely studied in literature, namely the coherent-joint-transmission (CJT) scheme, the non-coherent-joint-transmission (NCJT) scheme and the coordinated-beamfoming/scheduling (CBF/CS) scheme. Our simulations show that the optimal CJT achieves 2.2 – 4.5 times higher average sum-rate than its non-cooperative massive MIMO network counterpart, while the optimal NCJT and the optimal CBF/CS achieve at most a factor 1.3 average sum-rate gain. The popular signal-to-leakage-and-noise-ratio (SLNR) scheme is also extended to the multi-antenna UE scenario and achieves a factor 1.1 – 1.2 gain.},

  abstract     = {Caching is a powerful technique that reduces the peak traffic loading by pre-storing popular contents in caching helpers during off-peak hours. In this work, the problem of probabilistic caching is revisited, in which users are allowed to request multiple contents sequentially. A novel algorithm based on the method of Lagrange multipliers is proposed to produce a policy that guarantees to yield a locally maximal content delivery success probability (CDSP) of the most demanding user, who requests the largest number of consecutive contents. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem, this algorithm may be trapped into an insignificant local maximum. We further propose an enhanced version of the algorithm based on the idea of simulated annealing, which enables the algorithm to statistically escape from a local maximum. Simulation results show that the proposed enhanced algorithm can attain a 45% CDSP improvement over the state-of-the-art when hundreds of contents are involved, and is significantly less sensitive to initial values. Moreover, to increase the overall system throughput, we propose an alternative metric of maximizing the weighted CDSP, instead of considering only the CDSP of the most demanding user. For this new metric, an algorithm adapted from the proposed algorithm is introduced, for which similar conclusions can be drawn.},

This paper proposes a new NOMA scheme for the uplink HetNet using oblique projection (OP) under perfect and imperfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR). In this scheme, the OP operation performed at the femtocell base station (FBS) recovers the desired NOMA users&#39; signal from the composite received signal. Unlike the existing successive interference cancellation (SIC) based NOMA schemes, the proposed scheme does not demand any power control or user clustering techniques for decoding NOMA users&#39; data at the receiver side. Further, it does not need information exchange between users for decoding and hence the computational complexity and the signaling overhead of the system gets reduced significantly. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under perfect CSIR analytically, we derive the closed-form expression for the probability of error and outage probability at the FBS receiver. We also derive the diversity order, sum-rate, and perform the computational complexity analysis of the NOMA-HetNet system employing the proposed scheme. Simulation results illustrate that the derived analytical results accurately describe the proposed NOMA scheme. We compare the performance of the proposed technique with a prevailing SIC based NOMA scheme and establish its superiority. Performance of the proposed NOMA scheme under imperfect CSIR is also studied and established that the scheme works well under this scenario also.},

  abstract     = {The intermittent nature of millimeter wave (mmWave) links caused by human-body blockage is an intrinsic property of the 5G New Radio (NR) technology that may cause drops of sessions already accepted for service. To improve the session continuity, multiconnectivity and guard capacity mechanisms have been proposed recently. Multiconnectivity enables dynamic handover between multiple pre-established spatially-diverse links, while guard capacity reserves a fraction of radio resources for the already accepted sessions by ensuring that they will have sufficient provisions in case of link blockage. In this study, we combine the tools of queuing theory and stochastic geometry to develop a mathematical framework for capturing the joint operation of these two schemes as well as the features of mmWave radio propagation. The metrics are related to user- and system-centric performance including the system resource utilization and the new and ongoing session drop probabilities. Our results show that multiconnectivity benefits all of the considered parameters. However, the range of performance boost remains limited by the deployment density and the maximum supported degree of multiconnectivity. In its turn, guard capacity allows to further decrease the ongoing session drop probability at the expense of the new session drop probability and the system resource utilization. When implemented jointly with multiconnectivity, guard capacity does not produce noticeable negative effects on the system resource utilization as compared to its standalone use. Hence, one may prefer a joint implementation of these mechanisms for preserving the session continuity of users without compromising the resource utilization.},

Shape of the dipoles and installation of the patch are designed collaboratively to realize wideband and high efficiency in a compact size. The balun, which also contributes a resonance, simultaneously realizes low-pass filtering response at wide stop-band and low loss in passband, with a simple structure. For demonstration, the proposed antenna is implemented. Size of the radiator is 0.28*0.28*0.29 λ 3 . The measured 15-dB return-loss bandwidth of the prototype is 32.7%, which covers the 4G bands (from 690 MHz to 960 MHz). In the passband, efficiencies beyond 90% and peak gains of 9.05 ± 0.55 dBi are measured. The half-power beamwidth at passband is maintained 65° ± 5°. At frequencies ranging from 1.7 GHz to 4.0 GHz, the prototype can provide beyond 13 dB gain suppression.

Considering the different delay requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) users, we propose a two-slot hybrid cooperative NOMA security (THCNS) scheme that utilizes the cooperative interference between NOMA user pairs to enhance the security of offloading. In the first time slot, the interference to the eavesdropper comes from the task signals (TSs) transmitted by the two users, while in the second time slot comes from jamming signal (JS) transmitted by the user who has completed the offloading tasks. The weighted sum secrecy outage probability (wSOP) and secrecy computation probability (SCP) are utilized to measure the security performance of users in the proposed scheme. To confirm the feasibility and applicability of the proposed scheme, we analyze the impact of some key parameters on users&#39; security, including the users&#39; local computation time and offloading time, transmit power, task allocation coefficients of two time slots. The analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme is more suitable for the case where the wiretap channel outperforms the main channel, and it can enhance the system security when selecting the optimal parameters. Finally, the numerical simulation results reveal how the analysis parameters affect the security performance of users and validate the theoretical analysis, it provides good insights about how to design parameters of IoT users to enhance their security performance in MEC system.},

In this context, by leveraging on the additive quantization noise model (AQNM), this paper investigates the performance of massive MIMO relay systems with a variable-resolution ADC/DAC-based architecture, where each ADC and DAC use arbitrary bits for quantization. To be specific, we first derive the closed-form expression of achievable rate over spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels by using perfect channel state information (CSI), maximal ratio combining (MRC), and maximal ratio transmission (MRT). Afterwards, we extend the work to the case of imperfect CSI. The analytical expressions reveal some insights of key parameters, i.e., spatial channel correlation, large-scale fading coefficients, estimate errors, and the resolution of ADCs/DACs. Finally, simulation results validate our theoretical analyses and confirm that the achievable rate reduces as the spatial correlation rises. Besides, we provide the condition under which coarse DACs (ADCs) and receive spatial correlation (transmit spatial correlation) dominate the loss of achievable rate. Moreover, provided that the total number of quantization bits is constant, we find that the achievable rate is optimal over spatially correlated channels when all ADC and DAC adopt the same quantization bits from the perspective of statistic.},

We consider a mmWave WPT network, where the location of the energy transmitters follows a Poisson point process. Instead of the mostly used flat-top antenna model, we adopt the Gaussian antenna model suggested by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for better accuracy. Two beam alignment error (BAE) models, i.e., truncated Gaussian and uniform models, are introduced to represent different BAE sources. We derive the probability density functions (PDFs) of the cascaded antenna gain with both BAE models and then provide the approximated PDFs for tractability. With the help of Fox&#39;s H function, the analytic expression for the energy coverage probability with nonlinear energy harvesting model is derived. Besides, we deduce a closed-form expression of the average harvested radio frequency (RF) energy. The simulation results verify our theoretical results and demonstrate the performance degradation incurred by BAE. It also shows that in the imperfect beam alignment scenario, the Gaussian antenna model can accurately represent the performance of mmWave WPT networks with actual beam pattern, while the flat-top antenna model cannot always provide accurate performance evaluation.},

  abstract     = {To support ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in vehicular networks, the virtual cells, where multiple access points (APs) cooperatively serve one mobile node, have been proposed to reduce the end-to-end latency in the downlink. The latency can be further reduced by eliminating the need for retransmission and feedback control, i.e., open-loop communications. However, it is difficult to achieve a high reliability of the uplink via virtual cells, because of multiple access interference and collisions from other virtual cells nearby. In this paper, we formulate the proactive radio resource allocation in the open-loop uplink of vehicular networks as a stochastic optimization problem with the objective to maximize the uplink reliability while ensuring the network stability. The optimal resource allocation policies are obtained solving the optimization problem using the Lyapunov optimization technique in a distributed manner. To reduce the computational and to improve the challenges of the Lyapunov optimization, we propose a virtual resource slicing algorithm that maps radio resource units to virtual resource blocks. Simulation results exhibit that both ultra-low latency and ultra high reliability are guaranteed in the open-loop uplink of vehicular networks. Based on the theoretical performance analysis and simulations, the uplink radio access procedure is summarized for the URLLC in vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) for a two-tier heterogeneous cellular network having a macro cell and multiple small cells, where the macro cell consists of a macro base station (MBS), a macro user and an eavesdropper and meanwhile each small cell comprises of a small base station (SBS), a small user and an eavesdropper. We consider the use of artificial noise (AN) signals emitted at MBS and SBSs at the expense of transmit power to defend against eavesdroppers. For the sake of obtaining a better balance between the secrecy rate (SR) and energy efficiency of heterogeneous cellular networks, we propose an SEE maximization (SEEM) scheme in small cells through jointly optimizing the beamformers of confidential signals and AN at MBS and SBSs, called joint beamforming based SEEM (JBF-SEEM) while guaranteeing the SR requirements and the power constraints for MBS and each SBS. However, the proposed JBF-SEEM problem is a complicated optimization problem because of the non-convex fractional form. Thus, we firstly transform the original objective function in fractional form into a subtractive one through applying the Dinkelbach&#39;s method, and then the non-convex subtractive form is approximated into a convex optimization problem by combining the penalty function and the difference of two-convex functions approach. Furthermore, we propose a two-tier iterative JBF-SEEM algorithm to obtain the near-optimal beamforming solution. Numerical results show that the JBF-SEEM algorithm is convergent while achieving a better SEE performance than conventional approaches.},

By minimizing the Lorentzian norm of the a posteriori error vector with a suitable constraint on the weight vector and providing a dynamic Lorentzian-norm-controlling parameter, the proposed APL algorithm achieves robustness against impulsive disturbances and speeds up convergence for colored input signals. The computational complexity of the APL algorithm is analyzed and a fast recursive filtering method is employed to reduce its complexity. The stability analysis, based on energy-conservation arguments, shows that the APL algorithm converges. Furthermore, its tracking behavior is also investigated and a step size optimizing the tracking performance is derived. Simulation results agree well with the theoretical analysis. Simulation results for channel estimation and in-car echo cancellation scenarios demonstrate that the APL algorithm achieves better performance compared to the maximum-correntropy-criterion, affine-projection-generalized-maximum-correntropy, affine-projection-sign, affine-projection-like M-estimate, and Lorentzian adaptive filtering algorithms in various impulsive interference environments.},

  abstract     = {In a broadcast transmission over an erasure network, feedback with network coding is both capacity-achieving and loss-immune. In this article, we carry out performance analyses of the feedback-based online network coding technique, drop when seen (DWS), and its recently proposed randomized variant (rDWS). An absorbing discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model is constructed to find the probability of dropping a packet from the sender queue (even before decoding) in a generation-based DWS broadcast. The dropping probability is computed efficiently in homogeneous as well as in heterogeneous erasure scenario by a tensor-algebraic formulation on top of the DTMC model. Further, the notion of first time drop leads to obtain a dropping distribution. A similar inspection for rDWS is not straight-forward because of receivers&#39; Markov-state dependency. So, the analysis is carried out with respect to Independent Markov-state Model (IMM), and the model is shown to be accurate in most of the cases except the situations where erasure probabilities, number of receivers, field size, target time slot all are very low. Another characterization of the dropping phenomenon helps in establishing the fact, average dropping time strictly decreases with generation size for DWS, and we conjecture, the same holds for rDWS. Using the fundamental matrix concept, we calculate the mean decoding time of a generation for a receiver. Extending the idea of first time dropping to decoding, statistics of different decoding options are analyzed. Finally, some analytical and simulation plots yield, the light-weight rDWS exhibits a very close performance to DWS for a sufficiently large finite field.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, spectrum sharing incentive for legitimate wireless information surveillance at the physical layer is investigated. The concept behind this is that authorized government agencies want to eavesdrop the communication between a suspicious source-destination pair, and stimulate the help of another source-destination pair (referred to as secondary users) looking for transmission opportunities. We thus propose to let the secondary receiver act as a monitor to eavesdrop the suspicious communication and let the secondary transmitter act as a friendly jammer to improve the eavesdropping performance, such that they are granted to share the spectrum of the suspicious users, as a reward. To guarantee the eavesdropping performance, the successful eavesdropping probability is required to be larger than that with passive eavesdropping. The problems of jointly optimizing the transmit power of the secondary transmitter and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order at the secondary receiver to maximize the average secondary transmission rate and minimize the secondary transmission outage probability are investigated. Two scenarios are considered for the availability of the channel state information (CSI). The first scenario assumes perfect CSI, and the optimal strategies for the transmit power control and the SIC decoding ordering are derived. The second scenario assumes partial CSI, where the instantaneous CSI of the secondary transmission link and the statistical CSI of the links related to the suspicious communication are available, and the optimal strategies for maximizing an approximate average secondary transmission rate and minimizing an approximate secondary transmission outage probability are proposed. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

  abstract     = {Automotive Ethernet is considered to be the backbone of future in-vehicle data communication. The IEEE 802.3bu standard specifies the use of one unshielded twisted pair of copper cables to simultaneously carry data and energy via Power over Data Lines (PoDL). One main challenge in combined data and energy transfer is the distortion of the data channel due to wideband interference from power signals present in the Automotive environment. This paper proposes the design of a novel enhanced coupling network for PoDL that features a noise cancelling current source controlled by an adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filter for the active attenuation of interfering power signals. The concept of active attenuation was proven for a resistive network, an average attenuation of 92 dB was measured up to 120 MHz. Further analyses show that the cancellation performance heavily relies on low latency of the active filter. It is derived that the provided attenuation decreases exponentially with the frequency for a given time delay and a novel latency management concept called compressed summation is proposed. The approach maximizes the cancellation performance of the proposed filter architecture by exploiting the knowledge of the ideal filter function and effective latency to define the FIR-filter weights.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a significant role in various 5G or Beyond-5G (B5G)-enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. However, the UAV performance in an air-ground cooperative network is significantly affected by its mobility and air-to-ground (A2G) communication and computation behaviors. In this paper, a UAV-oriented computation offloading system is investigated, where the UAV desires to complete its onboard computation demands with the assistance of a ground edge-computing infrastructure, i.e., a road-side unit (RSU). The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency of the UAV. Specifically, a non-convex constrained optimal control problem is formulated to optimize the overall energy efficiency of UAV by jointly considering the coupled effects of UAV&#39;s longitudinal mobility, A2G communication, and computation dynamics. To address the coupled complexity and non-convexity of the original problem, a primal decomposition approach is developed to transform the problem into a convex subproblem and a primary problem, and then a closed-form optimal transmission power control is derived by solving the subproblem, which is dependent on mobility information. By embedding the closed-form optimal power control into the primary problem, a gradient projection-based iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain a joint optimal solution for both the longitudinal acceleration control and the power control, the feasibility and convergence of which is also theoretically proven. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of constraint satisfaction and convergence speed, and comparative results also demonstrate that it can outperform other benchmark methods in terms of global energy efficiency.},

Besides, multiple radio access technology (multi-RAT) has been proposed to enhance the network throughput and service reliability. However, the two technologies have been evolving independently. In this paper, we will develop an integrated multi-RAT and MEC network framework, which enables smart devices (SDs) to offload computation tasks over multiple RAT links in parallel. Considering the resource-limited nature as well as the time-varying property of the proposed network, we then focus on investigating long-term fairness guarantee mechanisms to facilitate fair resource sharing/allocation between SDs. Specifically, we formulate a max-min stochastic optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the minimum long-term time-average offloading utility. An adaptive task splitting and resource allocation algorithm is proposed based on the Lyapunov optimization technology, which jointly optimizes the SD task splitting and uplink transmit power allocation, the RAT subcarrier allocation, and the MEC computation frequency allocation. The adaptive algorithm can accommodate to the time-varying network dynamics without requiring their distribution information. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to have polynomial computation complexity and be asymptotically optimal by rigorous analysis. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show that the Jain&#39;s fairness index of the proposed algorithm converges to 1 as the number of time-slots grows, which outperforms the benchmark algorithms.},

Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution plays a primary role in quantifying the QoS as well as link capacity of IEEE 802.11p in one-dimensional (1-D) highway and two-dimensional (2-D) intersection road. Most of the analytical models based on stochastic geometry assumed ALOHA access to analyze the SINR distribution, while few of the works developed the stochastic geometry based model considering CSMA access but derived the SINR distribution utilizing statistical estimator. On the other hand, the current interference based probability analytic model for the SINR distribution limit the 1-D extension to 2-D, due to the very high numerical computational complexity at 2-D. In this paper, we propose an analytic model under more general non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) node distribution, more general channel fading model (Nakagami) with path loss, and noise, for the study of QoS and capacity of VANET for BSM based safety applications in both 1-D highway and 2-D intersection road. The proposed model derives QoS and capacity of VANET BSM broadcast through evaluation of SINR distribution using probability theory and ordered statistics, which has much lower computational complexity compared with the unordered statistic model. The proposed model is validated by NS2 simulation and extended to the derivation of other QoS metrics such as packet reception probability, packet reception ratio, and broadcast link capacity, etc. The performance comparisons between 1-D and 2-D are implemented, and the QoS sensitivity analyses regarding the extension to multi-intersection as well as enlarging interference range are discussed.},

On one hand, we exploit the joint benefits of spatial modulation and SCMA for boosting the data rate. On the other hand, a physical-layer secret key is generated by varying the SM-SCMA mapping patterns based on the instantaneous CQI in the desired link. This guarantees the security of AANETs, since this secret key is not exchanged between the source aeroplane and its destination. Due to the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation in the AANET, other aeroplanes or eavesdroppers may detect the signals delivered in the desired link. However, they are unable to translate the detected signals into the original confidential information, even if multiple copies of the signals are recoined over multiple hops of the AANET, because they have no knowledge of the CQI-based SM-SCMA mapping pattern. The performance of the CQI-mapped SM-SCMA is evaluated in terms of both its bit error rate and its ergodic secrecy rate, which substantiates that the proposed scheme secures the confidential information exchange in the multi-hop AANET.},

  abstract     = {Polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes are special concatenated codes in which we employ a one-to-one convolutional transform as a pre-coding step before the polar transform. In this scheme, the polar transform (as a mapper) and the successive cancellation process (as a demapper) present a synthetic vector channel to the convolutional transformation. The numerical results show that this concatenation improves the Hamming distance properties of polar codes. Motivated by the fact that the parallel list Viterbi algorithm (LVA) sorts the candidate paths locally at each trellis node, in this work, we adapt the trellis, path metric, and the local sorter of LVA to PAC codes and show how the error correction performance moves from the poor performance of the Viterbi algorithm (VA) to the superior performance of list decoding by changing the constraint length, list size, and the sorting strategy (local sorting and global sorting) in the LVA. Also, we analyze the complexity of the local sorting of the paths in LVA relative to the global sorting in the list decoding and we show that LVA has a significantly lower sorting complexity compared with list decoding.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) provides extremely high throughput owing to their high bandwidth utilization over higher frequencies. To compensate for the severe loss and attenuation, beamforming training is used to determine the optimal beam direction and thereby improve directional transmission power. However, the training overhead will be significantly increased with narrower beams, particularly under conventional exhaustive schemes. Therefore, we propose a learning-based adjustable beam number training (LABNT) scheme to intelligently and flexibly select beam training candidates considering different user mobility and hybrid line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. In LABNT, several deep learning networks are parallelly constructed and connected to a reinforcement learning network to determine training candidates dynamically based on performance rewards. A novel enhanced feature selection method, that is, uniformly distributed mutual information, is developed based on the correlation of historical results to select the beam inputs for each deep learning network. In simulations, the proposed LABNT outperforms other existing schemes in terms of beam alignment accuracy, training latency, and system throughput. Moreover, following the IEEE 802.11ad/ay protocols, we implement realistic mmWave beamforming training on a programmable hardware platform with integrated 60 GHz wireless-gigabit (WiGig) transceiver devices. The experimental results on the WiGig platform demonstrate that the proposed LABNT scheme can achieve real-time performance with approximately Gbps transmission throughput and millisecond-level training overhead.},

This proposed approach is presented to thwart the non-probabilistic (NP) hardness problem of data availability due to prolonging backlogs. This approach classifies the different instances of data availability and delivery for the edge-connected end-user services/applications. The classification is preceded by using Naïve Bayes&#39; classification to identify the offloading instances to prevent unnecessary backlogs. The probability of data transmission, delivery, and offloading are independently analyzed for their likelihood, and the appropriate available time instances are allocated in a distributed manner.

The departure process of the queuing model is characterized by obtaining the first and second moment statistics of the service time that depends on the resource allocation strategy, the packet size and channel distributions. The proposed model is utilized to obtain the optimum power allocation that minimizes the maximum of the average queuing delay (MAQD) for a two-user network scenario. The Monte Carlo simulation experiments are performed to numerically validate the model by providing MAQD results for both NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes. The results demonstrate that the NOMA achieves lower latency for low SINR outage thresholds while its performance is degraded faster than OMA as the SINR outage threshold increases such that OMA outperforms NOMA beyond a certain threshold. Another important result is that the latency performance of NOMA is significantly degraded when the 5G NR frame types having wider bandwidth are utilized. The results provide powerful insights for queuing delay analysis of 5G services.},

Using the lower bound CDFs, the LB expressions of the secrecy outage probability are derived for various scenarios. Applying the asymptotic CDFs, the diversity order of the secrecy performance is also quantified for each case. From analysis results, we show that the diversity order of the secrecy outage probability in the proposed system is only affected by authorized system&#39;s parameters, not by eavesdropper&#39;s parameters. Further, the relay and user nodes with the MRC receiver provide the SNR gain compared to the SC receiver regardless of eavesdropper&#39;s receiver type. Finally, the secrecy outage probability of the proposed RU system with the SC eavesdropper has the SNR gain compared to the MRC eavesdropper, while the diversity order is identical to each other.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new artificial noise (AN) scheme that combines with the relay selection techniques to improve the physical layer security for a wiretap full-duplex decode-and-forward cooperative network. The communication consists of two phases. In the first phase, the source transmits a message to the selected full-duplex relay, which simultaneously injects AN to mitigate eavesdropping attacks. In the second phase, the selected relay decodes the source message, XORs the source message and AN, and then broadcasts the mixed-signal to the destination. Different form existing schemes, the proposed AN scheme makes the eavesdropper fail in obtaining any information about the source message directly in the second phase. We take into account the correlation of the channel coefficients for the same link during different phases in the performance analysis of AN-aided max-min (MM) and partial (Par) relay selection schemes, and characterize the security-reliability trade-off (SRT) of the proposed schemes by the closed-form expressions of outage probability and intercept probability. Numerical results show that the proposed AN-aided MM/Par relay selection achieves a better SRT performance than the corresponding full-duplex mode assisted AN-aided relay selection scheme in existing literature. Furthermore, the MM scheme outperforms the Par scheme in terms of the SRT, and the SRT of the MM scheme can be substantially improved by increasing the number of relays, while the improvement of the Par scheme is limited.},

We introduce a secure cooperative communication scheme, in which nearby NOMA users operating in FD mode act as jammers and generate AN to enhance the physical layer security (PLS) of the legitimate transmission. Closed-form expressions in terms of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for a user pair are acquired. Following the mathematical results, secrecy diversity order analysis is further carried out for two scenarios, i.e., 1) fixed transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the Eve, and 2) transmit SNR at the Eve being proportional to that of LUs. Closed-form expressions of asymptotic SOP for the two scenarios are also obtained. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to certify the veracity of the theoretic analysis and illustrate that the proposed scheme employing both AN and FD-NOMA is superior in the secrecy outage to the NOMA scheme without AN and the orthogonal multiple access scheme with AN.

To further improve the spectral efficiency and connectivity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered to be integrated with mmWave MIMO. Nonetheless, the existing power-domain mmWave MIMO-NOMA with narrow analog beams suffers from beam misalignments which deteriorate the data rates of the misaligned users as well as the system fairness. Thereby, we propose a beam aggregation-based mmWave MIMO-NOMA scheme to loosen the requirement of beam alignment and improve the system fairness. The proposed scheme generates virtual beams with wider beamwidth by aggregating adjacent analog beams. NOMA transmissions are utilized within each aggregated virtual beam. Then, we propose a non-orthogonal multiuser precoding scheme to ensure the fairness within the aggregated beam by maximizing the minimum achievable rates of the grouped users. To address this issue, a max-min problem is proposed and artificial intelligence (AI) technology is exploited to solve this non-trivial problem. The problem is firstly converted to an equivalent penalized minimization problem and then an unsupervised deep neural network (DNN) is trained to map the instantaneous channel coefficients to the precoders in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we explicitly introduce the transmit power as the DNN input to achieve better generalization in different signal-to-noise ratio regions. Performance evaluations reveal that the proposed scheme can achieve significant gain on the max-min data rate compared with the conventional scheme.},

In this paper, we investigate the downlink millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user massive MIMO system and propose an interference cancellation (IC) framework on hybrid beamforming design. Based on the proposed framework, three successive interference cancellation (SIC) aided hybrid beamforming algorithms are proposed to deal with inter-user and intra-user interference. Specifically, for the first proposed algorithm, we use zero-forcing (ZF) to cancel inter-user interference and use SIC to cancel intra-user interference. For the second one, SIC is used to cancel inter-user interference and ZF is used to cancel intra-user interference. Both inter-user interference and intra-user interference are suppressed by SIC in the third algorithm. Furthermore, the optimal detection order of data streams is derived according to the post-detection signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Numerical results show that the proposed SIC-aided hybrid beamforming algorithms outperforms the existing approaches in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) at the cost of computational complexity for the SIC procedure. Moreover, the results indicate that the proposed algorithms can achieve good SE performance with 2-bit finite resolution phase shifters and channel estimation error.},

  abstract     = {In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), communications between vehicles, i.e. vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are of greatest importance to facilitate autonomous driving. The current state-of-the-art for secure data exchange in V2V communications relies on public-key cryptography (PKC) consuming significant computational and energy resources for the encryption/decryption process and large bandwidth for the key distribution. To overcome these limitations, physical-layer security (PLS) has emerged as a lightweight solution by exploiting the physical characteristics of the V2V communication channel to generate symmetric cryptographic keys. Currently, key-generation algorithms are designed via empirical parameter settings, without resulting in optimum key-generation performance. In this paper, we devise a key-generation algorithm for PLS in V2V communications by introducing a novel channel response quantisation method that results in optimum performance via analytical parameter settings. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art, the channel responses incorporate all V2V channel attributes that contribute to temporal variability, such as three dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers&#39; mobility. An extra functionality, namely, Perturbe-Observe (PO), is further incorporated that enables the algorithm to adapt to the inherent non-reciprocity of the V2V channel responses at the legitimate entities. Optimum performance is evidenced via maximisation of the key bit generation rate (BGR) and key entropy (H) and minimisation of the key bit mismatch rate (BMR). A new metric is further introduced, the so-called secret-bit generation rate (SBGR), as the ratio of the number of bits which are successfully used to compose keys to the total amount of channel samples. SBGR unifies BGR and BMR and is thus maximised by the proposed algorithmic process.},

However, the interference pattern becomes more unpredictable and challenging in these networks. Therefore, a suitable trade-off between spectrum spatial reuse and interference level has to be pursued to achieve good performance in terms of provided throughput. This paper proposes a new method to maximize the achievable throughput of an UDN with a suitable level of spatial spectrum reuse. In particular, the focus is on the small cells tier where the available spectrum is divided into sub-bands and each cell can use some of these to communicate with its associated users. The goal is to find the sub-bands allocation among cells that maximizes the system throughput. However, to limit complexity and signaling overhead that could result unaffordable in an UDN, a new metric to approximate the cell throughput to be optimized is defined. Moreover, the newly defined problem is solved using the Gibbs Sampling approach. The method effectiveness is proven by comparing the achieved results with those of the maximization of the effective system throughput and the optimal solution.},

Our proposed GSM-based scheme, referred to as spatial modulation based communication-radar (SpaCoR) system, allocates antenna elements among the subsystems based on the transmitted message, thus achieving increased communication rates by embedding additional data bits in the antenna selection. We formulate the resulting signal models, and present a dedicated radar processing scheme. To evaluate the radar performance, we characterize the statistical properties of the transmit beam pattern. Then, we present a hardware prototype of the proposed DFRC system, demonstrating the feasibility of the scheme. Our results show that the proposed GSM system achieves improved communication performance compared to techniques utilizing fixed allocations operating at the same data rate. For the radar subsystem, our experiments show that the spatial agility induced by the GSM transmission improves the angular resolution and reduces the sidelobe level in the transmit beam pattern compared to using fixed antenna allocations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the capacity gain of full duplex (FD) self-backhauling over the half duplex (HD) counterpart in downlink cellular systems, and then proposes an opportunistic FD scheme. The first step is to derive the capacity gain of FD self-backhauling over the HD counterpart as a function of the system parameters in a computationally tractable form. Unlike previous studies on the capacity of FD self-backhauling, a practical constraint is imposed so that the end-to-end link achieves a target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for a successful link connection. Also, a condition under which FD is more beneficial than HD is derived. Specifically, the minimum allowable self interference cancellation factor and the maximum allowable cell radius for the benefit of FD are derived as an explicit function of system parameters. Their dependencies on the system parameters are investigated and compared with counterparts derived for single-hop point-to-point links. Lastly, to overcome the weak points of FD and HD, this paper proposes a user-wise opportunistic FD (OFD) self-backhauled scheme. To this end, an instantaneous channel gain-based FD/HD switching rule is derived from a condition under which FD cannot instantaneously satisfy the target SINR. We confirm the substantial capacity gain of the proposed user-wise instantaneous OFD over a cell-wise static duplex switching scheme, as well as the fixed duplex (HD or FD) schemes. When compared to the static duplex switching scheme, the proposed OFD is most beneficial at the boundary of HD-preferred and FD-preferred regions. Based on this, a system-level guideline is proposed for selecting the most practical scheme among OFD, FD, and HD by trading off capacity gain and switching overhead. Extensive simulation results are provided to confirm the correctness of the derivations and the related investigations.},

  abstract     = {A multiple relay-aided downlink (DL) multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system is investigated to support simultaneous connectivity to cell-edge users. The estimated uplink channel state information (CSI) is used for precoder designs, and statistical DL CSI is adopted for successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the users. The achievable rates are derived, and thereby, the deleterious effects of CSI uncertainty, imperfect SIC, inter-relay interference and intra-cluster pilot contamination are quantified. Fundamental trade-offs between the achievable sum rate and system scalability are explored via two pilot assignment schemes. The performance of the proposed system is compared with that of the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) counterpart. We reveal that the latter performs better in low-user regime because the former&#39;s achievable rates are hindered by intra-cluster pilot contamination and imperfect SIC.However, the proposed model provides better system scalability and outperforms OMA in the large-user regime. The performance of zero-forcing (ZF)/null-space (NS) precoding is compared with maximum ratio transmission (MRT). We show that NS-based ZF precoding can boost the sum rate by mitigating inter-cluster interference at the expense of a higher computational complexity than that of MRT.},

  abstract     = {The field of automatic driving has always been a research hotspot. Based on inertial and odometer, dead reckoning is used to navigate for L4 and above level autonomous vehicles with less human intervention when GPS is blocked. The navigation accuracy is mainly determined by the alignment error and the drift accumulated over time. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to achieve initial alignment of inertial navigation for L4 and above level autonomous vehicles. The alignment is accomplished with a MEMS inertial measurement unit (MIMU) and single antenna global positioning system real-time kinematic (GPS-RTK). By matching the trajectory obtained from MIMU dead reckoning with the trajectory obtained from RTK, the initial heading angle is obtained, and the heading angle accuracy is improved through multiple iterations. In the case of RTK precision decreasing, the MIMU can still achieve lane-level navigation after the initial alignment. Because the alignment is accomplished in motion, there is no need for additional static alignment time before the vehicle starts. The field experiment results show that the method could achieve fast initial alignment in a few seconds in moving state with an alignment accuracy of 0.05°.},

In this paper, the detailed impedance model of DFIM-SPS is established, with a salient-pole synchronous generator (SPSG) acting as the power source and a DFIM functioning as the propulsion load. The impedance modelling of DFIM is carried out from the aspect of ac coupling between the stator and rotor circuits, which is easy for physical understanding. In addition, the back-to-back power converter (BTBPC) is regarded as controlled voltage sources with impedances in the equivalent circuit. The phase-locked loop (PLL) is a key element in influencing the system stability, and it is integrated to upgrade the system dq impedance model. Moreover, the impedance shaping effect caused by dc-bus voltage control is investigated. Nyquist stability criterion is employed for system small-signal stability analysis, which is implemented with respect to the DFIM operation mode and PLL controller effect, and the time-domain simulations are carried out to verify the stable operation of a 5 MW DFIM-SPS in Matlab/Simulink. Furthermore, the experimental verification is done on a 1.5 kW DFIM electric drivetrain platform.},

After the range compression, approximate 2-D range-frequency and Doppler-frequency expressions are derived according to the principle of stationary phase (POSP) and series inversion extension. The mathematical range-Doppler frequency relationships are then exploited to search the target&#39;s first-order motion parameters and Doppler ambiguity numbers within a predetermined parameter range, and formulate the corresponding new data from the original 2-D data matrix. Finally, Fourier transform and constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detector are further applied to detect the targets.

Then the game theory-based control strategies are proposed and two information patterns are investigated. In the open-loop case, the Nash equilibrium of each control cycle is determined by solving discrete-time Riccati equations. When it comes to the closed-loop pattern, the game complexity increases because each player can revise his own game strategy according to the other players’ strategy evolution, and thus the dynamic programming method based on the Bellman&#39;s principle is applied to derive the control strategies. Besides, a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) method is adopted to facilitate the process of discretizing the state-space model in every control cycle.

  abstract     = {Collision avoidance and platooning applications require vehicle localization at cm-level accuracy and at least 50 Hz rate for full autonomy. The RADAR/LIDAR and camera based methods currently used for vehicle localization do not satisfy these requirements, necessitating complementary technologies. Visible light positioning (VLP) is a highly suitable complementary technology due to its high accuracy and high rate, exploiting the line-of-sight propagation feature of the visible light communication (VLC) signals from LED head/tail lights. However, existing vehicular VLP algorithms impose restrictive requirements, e.g., use of high-bandwidth circuits, road-side lights and certain VLC modulation strategies, and work for limited relative vehicle orientations, thus, are not feasible for general use. This paper proposes a VLC-based vehicle localization method that eliminates these restrictive requirements by a novel VLC receiver design and associated vehicular VLP algorithm. The VLC receiver, named QRX, is low-cost/size, and enables high-rate VLC and high-accuracy angle-of-arrival (AoA) measurement, simultaneously, via the usage of a quadrant photodiode. The VLP algorithm estimates the positions of two head/tail light VLC transmitters (TX) on a neighbouring vehicle by using AoA measurements from two QRXs for localization. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed by deriving its Cramer-Rao lower bound on positioning accuracy, and simulated localization performance is evaluated under realistic platooning and collision avoidance scenarios. Results demonstrate that the proposed method performs at cm-level accuracy and up to 250 Hz rate within a 10 m range under realistic harsh road and channel conditions, demonstrating its eligibility for collision avoidance and safe platooning.},

  abstract     = {The varying real-world road conditions (eg. slopes, speed limits) have great effects on the vehicle dynamics and fuel characteristics. The lack of consideration for these effects may lead to deteriorative fuel economy and even collisions. This paper presents a hierarchical control framework for a connected and automated vehicular platoon subject to time-vary uncertain dynamics and uniform communication delays. This control method minimizes the fuel consumptions and ensures the tracking performance on the premise of collision-free property. Firstly, a centralized ecological speed planning (CESP) algorithm based on dynamic programing (DP) is designed as the upper layer. This layer produces the fuel-optimal and feasible speed profiles, which can be followed by all vehicles, for the entire platoon based on the preview information of road conditions (eg. slopes, speed limits). Secondly, the distributed collision-free speed tracking control (DCST) method is proposed in the lower real-time control layer. The collision-free property is guaranteed by the uniform boundedness performance of the well-designed potential function of the spacing error. The convergences of all speed tracking errors are proved through barbalat&#39;s lemma. By modifying the desired spacing model, the application range of DCST is extended to the conditions with large initial deviations. Finally, the main theoretical results are verified through numerical simulations.},

Though many works have been investigated on transportation mode recognition in recent years, the accuracy and generality are still not able to meet the application requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion framework for fine-grained transportation mode recognition, which consists of the Network in Network (NIN), Dilate Convolution and the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). In this framework, we first use NIN and Dilate Convolution to capture local and global features, respectively, and then introduce the graph convolutional network to learn the correlation of features. We construct a topological structure of the features based on the maximal information coefficient (MIC) criteria which is used to measure the similarity between two variables, and then obtain the adjacency matrix used for graph convolution. Extensive experimental results on the public Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed NDGCN to other state-of-the-art baselines with more than 22.3% higher accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Analytical optimal solution to the energy management of hybrid electric vehicles is of interest from theoretical and practical perspectives. Particularly, effort has been made to derive analytical solution to the energy management problem for series hybrid electric vehicles using Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle (PMP). However, admissibility of the system input was not fully explored in determining the optimal input candidates. In this paper, the analytical solution for the same problem is found by partitioning the positive power demand set into four subsets, where the solution is derived for each case separately according to the corresponding admissible input set. The analytical solution is verified through comparison with numerical solution for a series hybrid electric wheel loader, and two different drive cycles are considered for this purpose. From the proposed solution, effective equivalence factor bounds are found and used to construct an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy. The proposed strategy and the analytical solution are implemented together for the same vehicle to demonstrate their effectiveness in dealing with real-world applications. Simulations are performed for 12 drive cycles, and the results are compared to the ones achieved by PMP-based optimal control where the optimization is done numerically. Simulation results suggest that the proposed methodology is relatively fast and has satisfactory performance in presence of drive cycle uncertainty. It is observed that the proposed method fulfills charge sustenance, and the achieved fuel consumption figures are very close to the optimal benchmarks found by the non-causal method.},

  abstract     = {When harvesting grain crops on large farms, a combine collects the grain while a grain cart transports the grain by commuting between the combine and a semi-trailer parked by the roadside. There are several issues associated with human-operated grain carts: labor shortage and increasing labor cost, operational imprecision and inefficiency as well as safety hazards, all of which can potentially be addressed if grain carts were autonomous. This paper presents a motion planning algorithm and the associated navigation solution for autonomous grain carts. The algorithm features a novel integration of Artificial Potential Field (APF) with Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). A set of simulation tests were carried out, comparing the proposed APF+FLC planner with a simple APF planner. The test results verified the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed planning algorithm in performing the logistical tasks in harvest operations where unharvested crops were the only obstacles as well as when random static or dynamic obstacles existed. In addition, a set of mobile robot tests implementing the proposed navigation solution were conducted, in which the robot representing the grain cart autonomously accomplished the logistical tasks in the harvest operations, verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the navigation solution.},

Based on this, we propose an online rolling traffic flow prediction method to provide support for the CAVs can be seen into practice. The new matrix factorization techniques proposed can learn the low-dimensional embeddings in the online setting and impute missing ones simultaneously. Moreover, instead of directly predicting the high-dimensional traffic flow data, a standard vector autoregressive (VAR) process is employed on low-dimensional embeddings to predict future values. Further, a multidimensional Cadzow method is proposed to solve the coefficient matrices of VAR efficiently even if there is noise. The simulation results on two real datasets show the applicability of the proposed method to online traffic flow prediction for edge computing-enhanced CAVs.},

  abstract     = {Signalized intersections play a vital role in addressing the issue of transportation efficiency and vehicle fuel economy in urban areas. Meanwhile, with the development of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), the mixed traffic environment composed of traffic participants with differing intelligent levels will become an important stage of the intelligent transportation system. Considering the changes in the mixed traffic environment, this paper proposes a Coupled Vehicle-Signal Control (CVSC) method to optimize the traffic signal timing and driving trajectories of CAVs at the same time, with the goals of traffic efficiency improvement and energy saving respectively. The signal timing is continuously optimized to minimize the total delay at the intersection. CAVs generate eco-driving trajectories using the received signal timing information and the planned arrival time to reduce fuel consumption. Finally, simulation experiments were been carried out to verify the control effect of the proposed CVSC. On the one hand, the influence of the involved parameters on the optimization results was analyzed and discussed. On the other hand, the proposed CVSC method was compared with the traditional CACC control and the classic eco-driving model, GlidePath. The research results show that the proposed CVSC method can effectively improve the performance of signalized intersections. When the penetration rate of CAVs is greater than 40%, this method can save fuel consumption by 6%-14% and increase the average speed by 1%-5%.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a compact millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) phased array incorporating inverted-L antenna (ILA) with high-impedance electromagnetic surfaces (HIS) based on single-layer FR-4 PCB for user equipment (UE). In order to realize mm-Wave UE in low production cost, the design methodology of phased array antenna in single-layer FR-4 PCB is proposed without any additional packaging process. The presented antenna consists of low-coupled antenna element and low loss feeding networks in compressed linear array configuration with 0.39λ 0 inter-element spacing. First, in order to realize broadband characteristics, the ILA is integrated with one-dimensional electromagnetic bandgap (1-D EBG) structures featuring HIS via slow-wave behavior. Due to high-impedance properties of the embedded via wall structures in common ground plane between each antenna element, the mutual coupling path through surface-current can be reduced. Second, in order to minimize leakage power caused by surface-waves, low loss coplanar waveguide ground (CPWG) feeding networks with via wall structures and island-shape pads are realized. The fabricated 4-elements and 8-elements phased array antennas including antenna element and feeding network based on FR-4 PCB achieve wide 3 dB beam coverage while featuring low beam squint in the Ka-band. In order to investigate over-the-air (OTA) system performance at three beam steering scenarios (boresight and ±60° scan angle), the measured maximum error vector magnitude (EVM) in QPSK modulation scheme is 16.6%. The coverage efficiency beyond 50% for the realized gain of −1.5 dBi from 26 to 36 GHz is demonstrated.},

While conventional offline calibration of a phased array antenna requires accurate knowledge of the positions of calibration targets relative to the radar, such information is not available in a dynamic scenario. To compensate for this, we have developed an estimation procedure based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to address the challenge of simultaneous localisation, mapping and calibration. The proposed technique makes it possible to compensate for moderate errors of amplitude and phase in the phased array response with just a few measured frames. A significant reduction in the sidelobe rejection of the array response, plus the ability to correct for angular steering errors, are demonstrated via numerical simulations and real data processing.},

  abstract     = {Wireless connectivity in airplanes is becoming more important, demanded, and common. One of the largest bottlenecks with the in-flight Internet is that the airplane is far away from both the satellites and the ground base stations during most of the flight time. Maintaining a reliable and high-rate wireless connection with the airplane over such a long-range link thus becomes a challenge. Microwave frequencies allow for long link distances but lack the data rate to serve up to several hundreds of potential onboard customers. Higher bands in the millimeter-wave spectrum (30 GHz-300 GHz) have, therefore, been utilized to overcome the bandwidth limitations. Still, the per-user throughput with state-of-the-art millimeter-wave systems is an order of magnitude lower than the one available with terrestrial wireless networks. In this paper, we take a step further and study the channel characteristics for the terahertz band (THz, 0.3 THz-10 THz) in order to map the feasibility of this band for aviation. We first propose a detailed channel model for aerial THz communications taking into account both the non-flat Earth geometry and the main features of the frequency-selective THz channel. We then apply this model to estimate the characteristics of aerial THz links in different conditions. We finally determine the altitudes where the use of airplane-to-satellite THz connection becomes preferable over the airplane-to-ground THz link. Our results reveal that the capacity of the airborne THz link may reach speeds ranging from 50-150 Gbps, thus enabling cellular-equivalent data rates to the passengers and staff during the entire flight.},

In this work, a range ambiguous clutter suppression method based on transmitting beam main lobe correction for the FDA MIMO radar is proposed. Firstly, this method uses the designed transmission pulse weights to compensate for the initial phases formed by the accumulation of frequency increments between pulses, so as to solve the problem that the main lobe high gain illuminated angle is inconsistent between the MIMO equivalent transmitting beampattern pulses synthesized at the receiving in the traditional FDA MIMO system. Secondly, by restoring and compensating received echoes, the influence of the main lobe correction weights of the transmitting signal is eliminated. Finally, through the characteristics of transmitter correction compensation to distinguish different range ambiguous clutters, the echoes from the range ambiguous areas can be discretely distributed in the power spectrum while preserving the signal echoes in the observation area. Thus range ambiguous clutter suppression is realized. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the clutter suppression performance compared with the MIMO and linear frequency increment FDA radar.},

We then examine how far we need to push the eavesdropper away from the transmitter in order to guarantee pn ≥ δ, where δ is a given value determining a certain level of security. The results reveal that the DM-RFDA system ensures a high level of security (e.g., δ = 0.95) for the legitimate user who is significantly further away from the transmitter than the eavesdropper. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that it is easier to guarantee the required level of security when there are more resource (e.g., higher bandwidth and a larger number of transmit antennas) in the DM-RFDA system.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel relax-and-retract algorithm is proposed to tackle the nonconvex unit-modulus constraint in the joint intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) transceiver design. The conventional method to tackle the unit-modulus constraint is semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and its computational complexity is large. By using the symbol detection mean square error (MSE) as the quality of service (QoS), the proposed relax-and-retract approach enables us to get convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) subproblems, which have a much lower computational complexity than the conventional SDR approach. Simulation results show that the proposed relax-and-retract approach has excellent performance in terms of computational complexity, while the transmit power and the unit-modulus hardware implementation are the same as those of the SDR approach.},

However, problems with regard to the phase differential have emerged in prior literature, some of which make the localization system perform extra but useless efforts, some affect the comprehensibility of the algorithm, and some even reduce the reliability of localization results. Therefore, the analysis of phase differential is very helpful for researchers and practitioners to complete and improve their work.

The methods that provide the best performance employ non-linear precoding techniques that require a search for a parameter vector of the same dimension as the number of antennas, which is prohibitively expensive for massive MIMO applications. In this paper, we propose a reduced complexity precoding method based on linear programming and constructive interference that exploits an initial approximate solution to significantly reduce the dimension of the search. In particular, the method uses the output of an initial quantized linear precoder and updates only those elements that do not satisfy a certain reliability condition. Simulations show that the resulting loss in performance due to the use of the simplified approach is insignificant provided that the reduced dimension is chosen to be large enough, but still much smaller than the number of antennas.},

To suppress the malicious jamming on Bob from Mallory, a conventional maximum receive power (Max-RP) at Bob is presented firstly. Subsequently, to exploit the colored property of noise plus interference at Bob, a whitening-filter-based Max-RP (Max-WFRP) is proposed with an obvious performance enhancement over Max-RP. To completely remove the malicious jamming from Mallory, a Max-RP with a constraint of forcing the malicious jamming from Mallory to zero at Bob is proposed. To further improve secrecy rate (SR) by removing the zero-forcing contraint (ZFC), the maximum signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (Max-SJNR) is proposed. Our proposed methods have closed-form expressions.

We design an energy consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing offloading time, task allocation and computation frequency. The optimal solution for the non-convex problem is obtained by some ingenious mathematical methods.

In this work, we develop a fast randomized-MUSIC (R-MUSIC) algorithm, which exploits the random matrix sketching to estimate the signal subspace via approximated computation. Our new approach substantially reduces the time complexity in acquiring a high-quality signal subspace. Moreover, the accuracy of R-MUSIC suffers no degradation unlike others low-complexity counterparts, i.e. the high-resolution angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is attained. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the performance of our R-MUSIC method. As shown, it resolves the long-standing contradiction in complexity and accuracy of MIMO radar signal processing, which hence have great potentials in real-time super-resolution automotive sensing.},

Motivated by this and also by measurements found in the literature, this paper proposes an ACF model that extends the exponential decaying ACF by allowing negative correlations. The model is proved to be PSDe in ℝ 2 and ℝ 3 and its capability to fit channel measurements in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands is also analyzed. Furthermore, it provides an analytical derivation of a sum-of-sinusoids (SoS) method capable of generating a Gaussian process (GP) in ℝ 3 characterized by the proposed ACF. The proposed SoS method is compared to a state-of-the-art (SoA) solution and presents gains up to 13 dB and 1.5 dB in terms of spatial-mean-square error (SMSE) and mean square error (MSE), respectively, while demanding lower computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission has great potential in balancing spectrum utilization and interference mitigation in dense cellular networks. However, NOMA reforms the spectrum sharing policy of CoMP transmission due to introducing additional interference among coordinated base stations (BSs), which deteriorates the CoMP transmission rate. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization of BS clustering and power control for NOMA-enabled CoMP transmission in dense cellular networks to maximize system sum-rate. We first characterize the impact of interference among coordinated BSs on CoMP transmission rate and find that the BS clustering is dependent on NOMA user grouping and restricted by the NOMA decoding condition. We then derive a tight lower bound on the system sum-rate and exploit it to design a joint BS clustering and power control scheme. Specifically, a power control algorithm is designed by a penalty convex-concave procedure to satisfy the NOMA decoding condition and users&#39; rate requirements. A BS clustering algorithm based on successive convex approximation is designed to iteratively update the BS clustering and NOMA user grouping to increase system sum-rate. Finally, two algorithms are alternately performed until all users successfully access and the system sum-rate converges. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently alleviate interference among coordinated BSs to improve system sum-rate and spectrum efficiency of NOMA-enabled CoMP transmission even under high user density.},

  abstract     = {A rapid-growing machine learning technique called federated edge learning has emerged to allow a massive number of edge devices (e.g. smart phones) to collaboratively train globally shared models without revealing their private raw data. This technique not only ensures good machine learning performance but also maintains data privacy of the edge devices. However, the federated edge learning still faces the following critical challenges: (i) difficulty in avoiding unreliable edge devices acting as workers for federated edge learning, and (ii) lack of efficient learning task assignment schemes among task publishers and workers. To tackle these challenges, reputation is utilized as a metric to evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of the edge devices. A many-to-one matching model is proposed to address the task assignment problem between task publishers and reliable workers with high reputation. For stimulating reliable edge devices to join model training and enable secure reputation management, blockchain is employed to store the training records and manage reputation data in a decentralized and secure manner without the risk of a single point of failure. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can achieve significant performance improvement in terms of reliability of federated edge learning.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an optimization problem that maximizes an aggregate utility, formulated as the weighted geometric mean of the “in-context” suitability of a set of radio access technologies (RATs), to support adaptive video streaming subject to the existence of legacy data transfers. Motivated by the unfeasibility of solving the formulated problem centrally when the various RATs are loosely integrated (i.e., at core network (CN) level), a hybrid (i.e., network-assisted user-driven) strategy is devised to approximate its optimum solution. Unlike previous hybrid approaches, the proposed methodology exploits network assistance to ensure a friendly co-existence between adaptive video streaming clients and legacy users. It operates on different timescales, where the fastest timescale operation is performed on the video clients according to a policy that is tuned by the network on slower timescales. The user operation on the fastest timescale (i.e., tens of ms) enables to adapt video streaming depending on the perceived quality-of-experience (QoE) and local components of the context (e.g., remaining credit and battery level). A small-cell tuning on a slower timescale (i.e., hundreds of ms) enables to preempt the resources used by legacy users based on the operating conditions (e.g., load and type of scheduler). Finally, a tuning performed by the network on the slowest timescale (i.e., few seconds) offloads legacy data transfers to unlicensed bands whenever the amount of interference on licensed bands reaches critical levels, which helps to sustain good QoE for all video clients. A cost-benefit analysis reveals that the proposed methodology performs closely to its centralized counterpart with much less control overhead on the radio interface.},

  abstract     = {In cellular Internet of Things, burst transmissions from millions of machine type communications (MTC) devices can result in channel congestion. The main bottleneck in such scenario is the inefficient random access channel (RACH) mechanism that is used to attach MTC devices to a base station (BS). To address this issue of congestion in RACH mechanism, 3GPP has proposed an extended access barring (3GPP-EAB) mechanism. However, several works indicate that the performance of the 3GPP-EAB mechanism can be further improved. In this work, a successive interference cancellation (SIC) based RACH mechanism is considered to significantly increase the RACH success rate and reduce congestion. In the proposed mechanism, the devices are allowed to transmit repeatedly for a finite number of times in a given radio frame, and thereafter, the success rate is improved by applying back-and-forth SIC at the BS. A Markov model of the proposed mechanism is presented with all transition and steady-state probabilities. Further, the probability of successful SIC for a given state of the Markov chain is derived. Through extensive numerical results, it is shown that the proposed mechanism significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art mechanisms in terms of the success rate and average access delay. Moreover, to maximize the success rate, the optimum number of devices to be entered in a radio frame is also calculated. Finally, we investigate the effect of imperfect SIC, increasing number of contending devices on the performance of the proposed mechanism.},

Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel rogue AP localization scheme leveraging sparse recovery technique, which consists of three steps: 1) Coarse localization, which is the result of comparing the online records with clustered fingerprint database. A novel Object Weighting Affinity Propagation (OWAP) clustering method is proposed to group the offline fingerprints. When computing the similarities, unlike traditional affinity propagation clustering method which views each object equally, we utilize the prior physical coordinates information to assign weight to each object. 2) Compressive sensing (CS) kernel optimization, in which the minimum number requirement of monitors in localization system is deduced through analyzing the problem formulation theoretically, and an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) based monitors selection scheme is presented to achieve higher location accuracy. 3) Joint fine rogue AP localization and outlier detection through a formulation of an improved CS based sparse recovery model. It could localize the rogue AP and identify the monitors whose readings are either not available or erroneous simultaneously, which increases the localization robustness. We operate simulations as well as experiments to verify the superiority of the proposed scheme both theoretically and practically.},

The limited energy supply of underwater sensor nodes is a significant challenge that can be mitigated by the cyclic difference set (CDS)-based coordination asynchronous wake-up scheme. However, the CDS-based asynchronous wake-up scheme also introduces long delays in the neighbor discovery that deteriorates packet delay as well as the network lifetime. In this paper, we formulate the problem of policy selection for idle listening as a Markov decision process and exploit the framework of deep reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal policies of underwater sensor nodes. Furthermore, the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are utilized to estimate the network traffic feature, which can improve the performance of the proposed adaptive asynchronous wake-up scheme. To verify the performance of the proposed scheme, simulations in different network scenarios are conducted with the comparison of random, fixed metric policies, and original CDS-based asynchronous wake-up schemes.},

  abstract     = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks are an emerging technology with applications in various fields, including smart grids, healthcare, vehicular telematics and smart cities. Heterogeneous M2M networks contain different types of nodes, e.g., nodes that send emergency, periodic, and normal type data. An important problem is to rapidly estimate the number of active nodes of each node type in every time frame in such a network. In this paper, we design two schemes for estimating the active node cardinalities of each node type in a heterogeneous M2M network with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; types of nodes, where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T \geq 2$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is an arbitrary integer. Our schemes consist of two phases– in phase 1, coarse estimates are computed, and in phase 2, these estimates are used to compute the final estimates to the required accuracy. We analytically derive a condition for one of our schemes that can be used to decide as to which of two possible approaches should be used in phase 2 to minimize its execution time. The expected number of time slots required to execute and the expected energy consumption of each active node under one of our schemes are analysed. Using simulations, we show that our proposed schemes require significantly fewer time slots to execute compared to estimation schemes designed for a heterogeneous M2M network in prior work, and also, compared to separately executing a well-known estimation protocol designed for a homogeneous network in prior work &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; times to estimate the cardinalities of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; node types, even though all these schemes obtain estimates with the same accuracy.},

In this paper, a mobile underwater charging solution is developed that can continuously recharge a swarm of AUVs by using a wireless mobile charger. Magnetic induction-based communication and wireless energy transfer are employed. This paper first shows that by using tri-axis coils, reliable wireless communication and wireless energy transfer without coil orientation losses can be obtained. After that, wireless communication, motion control, and wireless energy transfer are jointly designed for a swarm of mission-driven AUVs. In particular, optimal continuous motion controllers are developed for AUVs to avoid intra-swarm collisions and networking protocols are designed to optimally allocate resources for wireless communication and wireless energy transfer. The proposed approach can guide AUVs to their destinations, while maintaining wireless network integrity and maximizing wireless energy transfer efficiency, upon which the constraints on AUVs’ batteries can be eliminated and cheaper and smaller AUVs can be employed for various underwater applications.},

Considering the non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) property of this problem, we propose a brain storm optimization (BSO) approach which utilizes the penalty-based fitness function in individuals evaluation to meet the storage capacity constraint and the genetic algorithm (GA) in new individuals generation to meet the integer constraint, respectively. Moreover, to improve the initialization performance of the BSO approach, we propose to utilize Opposition-based Learning(OBL) to improve the initial solution space. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose to implement the convergent operation in the objective space via individuals classification. We then analyze the global convergence and computational complexity of the proposed policy theoretically.

It is expected that the next generation cellular networks will enable the low-latency and high-reliability communications with the support of aerial-terrestrial heterogeneous networks (HetNets) composed of flying and ground base stations (BS). In addition, with the emergence of various delay-sensitive applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles), the end-to-end delay becomes a crucial quality of service (QoS) metric. However, how to design an efficient and delay-guaranteed aerial-terrestrial HetNets remains an open research challenge. In this paper, we develop an analytical approach to characterize the end-to-end delay performance of aerial-terrestrial HetNets by using network calculus. A stochastic model that takes into account the successful transmission and resource utilization in the radio access network is proposed to evaluate the delay performance within a target delay-violation probability. In addition, the effect of background traffic in the core network are carefully examined to present a tight upper bound for the end-to-end delay. Simulation results validate the proposed analysis under different network settings such as available bandwidth, the number of UAVs, and the trajectory of UAVs. Also, it is revealed that the trajectory of UAVs plays a more significant role in the delay performance compared to the number of UAVs.},

The limited processing capacity and energy storage of these devices inevitably makes the real-time analysis of complex signals – the key to autonomy – challenging. In urban environments, the UAVs can leverage the communication and computation resources of the surrounding city-wide Internet of Things infrastructure to enhance their capabilities. For instance, the UAVs can interconnect with edge computing resources and offload computation tasks to improve response time to sensor input and reduce energy consumption. However, the complexity of the urban topology and large number of devices and data streams competing for the same network and computation resources create an extremely dynamic environment, where poor channel conditions and edge server congestion may penalize the performance of task offloading. This paper develops a framework enabling optimal offloading decisions as a function of network and computation load parameters and current state. The optimization is formulated as an optimal stopping time problem over a semi-Markov process. We solve the optimization problem using Dynamic Programming and Deep Reinforcement learning at different levels of abstraction and prior knowledge of the system underlying stochastic processes. We validate our results in a realistic scenario, where a UAV performs a building inspection task while connected to an edge server.},

  abstract     = {Passing through a rural area with a limited network infrastructure may disrupt fog computing support for vehicles. As a result, some applications on vehicles may turn off and bother the performance of the vehicular systems. In order to escape from this kind of situation, vehicular fog computing is discussed in recent times as an alternative of fog computing support while passing through a blank spot of network infrastructure. However, it is not feasible to establish a trusted vehicular fog computing service among vehicles without mutual trust. To deal with this situation, this paper proposes a method called Bidding-Price-based Transaction (BPT) for vehicular fog computing service in rural areas. This method is composed of bidding-price-based mutual trust establishment between client vehicle and server vehicle and also payoff assignment based on transaction evaluation. By applying this method, trusted fog computing service transactions between two vehicles can be achieved without the direct assistance of any trusted third party as a validating entity. The simulation results and feasibility analysis then validate the performance of the BPT scheme in rural areas. Based on feasibility analysis, we claim that the BPT scheme can be realized by adjusting vehicle speed and transmission range with respect to the size of offloaded data.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a distributed network involving connected vehicles and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), allows connected vehicles to communicate with other Internet-connected entities in real time. The communications among these entities (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and road-side infrastructure) generally take place via an open channel. In other words, such an open communication can be targeted by the adversary to eavesdrop, modify, insert fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete any data-in-transit; thus, resulting in replay, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, and other related attacks. In addition to security, anonymity and untraceability are two other important features that should be achieved in an authentication protocol. In this paper, we propose a new mutual authentication and key agreement protocol in an IoV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Using both formal and informal security analysis, as well as formal security verification using an automated verification tool, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against several known attacks in an IoV-enabled ITS environment. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and computational overheads, and offers better security and functionality attributes in comparison to seven other competing schemes. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using NS2.},

NOMA also provides a new way to enable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and improve the achievable rates through cooperation. Motivated by these developments, we provided a novel analysis for NOMA-enabled backscatter-based V2X networks. Specifically, we consider that several vehicles are connected to the base station (BS) via different roadside units (RSUs) and the backscatter tags along the road. These backscatter tags can be considered ultra-low-powered safety sensors that communicate with the vehicles using the same spectrum resources. To optimize the performance of such networks, a joint problem of optimal power allocation at BS and RSUs has been formulated. Subsequently, the problem has been transformed into a convex problem and solved using KKT conditions and sub-gradient methods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed in MATLAB. The acquired results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than the conventional suboptimal NOMA scheme and joint optimal TDMA scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new channel estimation and equalization algorithm for underwater acoustic (UWA) communications is presented. The proposed algorithm is developed to meet the requirements of underwater time-varying sparse channels that undergo Rayleigh fading. In addition, the algorithm takes into consideration a path-based channel model which describes each received path with significant power by an attenuation factor, a Doppler scale, and a delay. Transmit diversity enabled by Alamouti space-frequency block coding coupled with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is employed in the form of two transmitters and multiple receivers. The proposed, non-data-aided, expectation-maximization (EM)-based maximum a posteriori probability sparse channel estimation first estimates the channel transfer functions from each transmit antenna to the receiver. Then, the estimation performance is greatly improved by taking into account the sparseness of the UWA channel and refining the estimation based on the sparse solution that best matches the frequency-domain channel estimates obtained during the first phase of the estimation process. Sparse channel path delays and Doppler scaling factors are estimated by a novel technique called delay focusing. After that, slow time-varying, complex-valued channel path gains are estimated using a basis expansion model based on the discrete Legendre polynomial expansion. Computer simulation results show that the resulting channel estimation algorithm can achieve excellent mean-square error and symbol error rate for both generated data and semi-experimental data taken at Sapanca Lake in Turkey and is capable of handling some mismatch due to different fading models.},

Innovative use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM) takes advantage of using tone indices in data transmission. In this study, we propose a novel multiplexing and multiple access scheme, namely SCMA based on OFDM-IM (SCMA-IM). SCMA-IM method can be implemented in uplink NOMA systems in an efficient way with similar computational complexity as SCMA. In this method constellation differences and diversity are obtained via SCMA codebooks (CBs) and the employment of CBs is transferred to index modulation (IM). Performance improvement is achieved via CBs so that the number of data bits carried by indices increases more than one bit with different constellations, and also with the number of CBs assigned. In order to determine the indices used in IM, the receiver structure is simplified by the message passing algorithm and log-likelihood ratio detection process used in SCMA receivers without indexing the receiver. Thus, a new NOMA scheme is obtained by coding with IM. Bit error rate performance of the system is studied for 150% and 200% overloading factors.},

It shows a faster performance in finding the solutions of system such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, quantum error correction and others with a polynomial order over the classical one. Grover&#39;s algorithm is one of the first proposed QSA in identifying the index number of the solution of a system, whose solutions are known to the oracle. A further improved QSA called Boyer-Brassard-Høyer-Tapp (BBHT) is followed by the Durr-Hoyer algorithm (DHA), which proposes to find the solutions, while the exact number of the solutions is not known. In this treatise, we propose two modifications to the existing DHA and BBHT algorithms. In DHA, we propose a semi-quantum framework, where after each iteration in DHA, the non-solution points are removed in classical framework. This makes the data set iteratively shorter. In the case of BBHT algorithm, we propose to choose the Grover search number based on the Gamma distribution instead of the uniform one, which gives more chances to the new larger values to improve probability of success. The performance of the proposed QSAs demonstrates plausible improvement in search success performance as compared to their existing BBHT and DHA counterparts. Numerical simulations are conducted with the proposed QSA algorithms on a MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to demonstrate the performance improvement.},

However, the independence assumption of existing literature ignores the inherent correlation of the PHY-layer attributes, which limits its generality. In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute-based PHY-layer authentication scheme by taking the correlation into account. To cope with the exponential growth of computational complexity in correlated analysis, this paper studies the reconstruction and heuristic algorithm to find a suboptimal authentication solution with low complexity. Specific to the inherent volatility nature of the PHY-layer attributes, we propose an unsupervised machine learning (ML) based non-parametric clustering algorithm to enhance the reliability of PHY-layer authentication. Unlike existing PHY-layer authentication schemes based on ML, the proposed PHY-layer authentication scheme does not require any prior information or the training set, which has a more potent universality. Extensive simulations are performed under both synthetic and real data sets, and the figures verify that the proposed authentication scheme can achieve a reliable and robust performance with low complexity.},

In a mmWave dense network, centralized processing and coordinated multi-points processing require large amounts of signaling exchange overhead, which in turn increase the latency. As such, distributed mechanism is demanded. In this paper, we investigate joint user scheduling and beam selection strategies for eNodes and formulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process. The objective and constraints are long-term average network delay cost minimization and instantaneous quality of service (QoS) guarantee for each user equipment. To update the distributed strategies, we apply the multi-agent reinforcement learning technique and propose a hybrid learning framework by extending the actor-critic model, where centralized training and decentralized execution are implemented. We utilize the Lagrange technique to design the reward functions. Additionally, a novel actor network architecture and an exploration scheme are proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent distributed algorithm with a high degree of scalability, and show superior performance in terms of long-term average network delay cost and QoS satisfaction rates compared with other methods.},

More specifically, the proposed IRS is composed of unit cells, each having multiple variable capacitors. Active tuning of capacitances of the variable capacitors in each unit cell provides the full coverage of 360° in the reflection phase. Furthermore, polarization is switched from an incident wave to the reflected wave through the excitation of two orthogonal modes, enabling arbitrary phase distribution over the IRS for the desired polarization. As a result, the proposed IRS allows the increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver in a communication scenario, by adjusting the reflection phase shift of each IRS element. Moreover, the reflection phase shifts of each IRS element are optimized with the aid of the Newton method, such that the received signal power of a receiver is maximized. In our simulations, it is demonstrated that our proposed IRS successfully maximizes the SNR at the receiver, both in the single-user and the broadcast multi-user scenarios, where multi-user interference is absent.},

Our proposed system consists of a ground station (GS), a UAV, and multiple users located on the ground, in which both the ground station and all the ground users (GUs) want to know the locations of the ground users. To this end, the UAV first harvests energy from the GS, and then broadcasts signals to the GUs for localization. Each GU will estimate its location, and then transmits data, including its location information, to the GS with the help of the UAV.

We first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under spatially correlated shadowing for localization performance evaluation. Next, we analyze the system throughput under delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes. To derive exact closed-form expressions as well as high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations of the performance metrics, we consider a mixture gamma distribution approximation for the probability density functions (PDF) of the composite fading channels. We evaluate the impact of several key system parameters such as the number of waypoints and the altitude of the UAV, correlated shadowing and energy-harvesting time both on the localization performance and on the achievable throughput.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a multi-channel medium access control (MMAC) protocol for the exploitation of retro-directive array antennas in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (named FA-MMAC). This FA-MMAC employs multiple channels and retro-directive array antennas to adjacent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transmit simultaneously over the same channel without causing interference. The channel utilization characteristic of FA-MMAC increases the spatial reuse of channel and thus improve the system performance. The key idea is that UAVs first exchange control packets in control window to select data channels and to align beams before exchanging data packets in the data window. In this way, the hidden-terminal and deafness problems are reduced. UAVs can reserve channels and align beams through a circular directional transmission of control frames so that the protocol can take advantage of the benefits of retro-directive array antennas of spatial reuse and increased coverage without prior knowledge of the locations. We develop both antenna model and channel model for FA-MMAC protocol. Analysis and simulation results show that our proposed FA-MMAC can offer a significant performance gain for both static and mobile scenarios than the existing MMAC and 802.11-based protocols. Our findings reported in this paper provide some insights into the performance of multi-channel Flying Ad Hoc Networks which might help network researchers to contribute in the development of next generation UAVs.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining angle-of-arrival (AOA) information is of great significance to improve the performance of communication systems. Real-time AOA recognition can reduce the complexity of beamforming design for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and can be used to construct an outer precoder to optimize the system and rate. However, for vehicular communications, AOA will change with environment and positions of vehicles, and it is difficult to obtain accurate AOA in real-time. Therefore, a fast AOA recognition method is needed to adapt to the rapid changes of channels. The traditional spectral- or parametric-based AOA estimation methods are difficult to obtain real-time AOA information because of the relatively high computational complexity. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a machine-learning-based fast AOA recognition approach. The proposed method includes off-line training and on-line estimation processes. In the off-line training process, an estimation model is obtained by using the support vector machine (SVM) based on a large number of actual measurement data in vehicular scenarios. Then, in the on-line estimation process, the obtained model is used to realize fast AOA recognition according to the channel snapshots collected by antenna array. Furthermore, the performance is verified under the different conditions of SVM parameters, training features, antenna numbers, and training data sizes. The experimental results show that the proposed method has satisfactory accuracy in real-time AOA recognition, and the optimal configuration and implementation scheme are also discussed.},

In the proposed framework, a more practical scenario the imperfect channel state information, imperfect successive interference cancellation and data outage are investigated. To address the considered problem, the optimization problem is formulated constrained by the total power and the outage probability requirements. However, the EE objective function is with a non-convex structure. Accordingly, we first convert the optimization problem to make the objective function concave and analytically tractable. Furthermore, we split the joint optimization problem to find a suboptimal solutions to the original problem. As a result, we first propose a suboptimal user-scheduling algorithm to improve the system&#39;s EE. Due to the non-convex function of the transmit power, we invoke a sequential successive convex approach to address the non-convex problem by its lower bound concave function. Besides, the fractional objective function is converted to its equivalent subtractive form. Finally, we derive a power control scheme to address the proposed framework. Simulation results endorse the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and their performance gains in terms of EE compared to both NOMA and OFDMA variants.},

Multiple antennas are installed at the sources, relays, and the destination nodes. In the transceiver design, we consider the mismatch between the true and the estimated channel state information (CSI), where the CSI mismatch follows the Gaussian-Kronecker model. A robust transceiver design algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the source, relay, and destination matrices to minimize the maximal weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) of the received message at all destination nodes. In particular, the WMSE is made statistically robust against the CSI mismatch by averaging through the distributions of the true CSI. Moreover, the WMSE decomposition is exploited to reduce the computational complexity of the transceiver optimization. Numerical simulations show a better performance of the proposed robust transceiver design against the channel mismatch.},

In this paper we propose low-complexity hybrid precoding schemes based on Martin&#39;s expansion for logarithmic determinant (log-det) form in analytical SE lower bound.

  abstract     = {It is well known that physical-layer Group Secret-Key (GSK) generation techniques allow multiple nodes of a wireless network to synthesize a common secret-key, which can be subsequently used to keep their group messages confidential. As one of its salient features, the wireless nodes involved in physical-layer GSK generation extract randomness from a subset of their wireless channels, referred as the common source of randomness (CSR). Unlike two-user key generation, in GSK generation, some nodes must act as facilitators by broadcasting quantized versions of the linear combinations of the channel realizations, so as to assist all the nodes to observe a CSR. However, we note that broadcasting linear combination of channel realizations incurs non-zero leakage of the CSR to an eavesdropper, and moreover, quantizing the linear combination also reduces the overall key-rate. Identifying these issues, we propose a practical GSK generation protocol, referred to as Algebraic Symmetrically Quantized GSK (A-SQGSK) protocol, in a network of three nodes, wherein due to quantization of symbols at the facilitator, the other two nodes also quantize their channel realizations, and use them appropriately over algebraic rings to generate the keys. First, we prove that the A-SQGSK protocol incurs zero leakage to an eavesdropper. Subsequently, on the CSR provided by the A-SQGSK protocol, we propose a consensus algorithm among the three nodes, called the Entropy-Maximization Error-Minimization (EM-EM) algorithm, which maximizes the entropy of the secret-key subject to an upper-bound on the mismatch-rate. We use extensive analysis and simulation results to lay out guidelines to jointly choose the parameters of the A-SQGSK protocol and the EM-EM algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an algorithm for optimizing the transmission protocol which considers the weights of transmission nodes in a wireless body area network (WBAN) is studied. The source broadcasts the radio frequency (RF) signal to transmit wireless energy to all other nodes in the system, and then the relay and sensors collect energy. Using the energy harvested, each sensor transmits information data back to the source in turn by time division multiple access (TDMA). Since the importance of sensors in the transfer network is different, in this process, the weighted throughput proposed in this paper can better reflect the system&#39;s information transmission efficiency. Motivated by this, a joint weights optimizing time slot allocation protocol (JWTA) is proposed. The specific weight of each sensor is based on the analytic hierarchy process algorithm (B-AHP). When dynamically selecting several sensors to form a certain communicating network, we can quantitatively calculate the physiological weight value of each node in current network through this algorithm. That weight value can directly reflect the importance of physiological signals collected by the detecting sensor to human health. With this foundation, this paper reallocates transmission time slots combining with the obtained weights, which also optimizes the traditional time switching (TS) protocol. The simulation result shows that the weighted throughput of the JWTA protocol is significantly better than that of the classic algorithm (that is, optimizing time slots individually) and equally assigned transmitting time slot algorithm. The influence of various system parameters is also analyzed.},

A series of simulation experiments are carried out to verify the proposed closed-form IA solution, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and low computational complexity.},

The specification for their follow up generations, i.e., IEEE 802.11bd and NR-V2X are being developed and expected to be completed soon. To evaluate and compare the performance of these technologies, system-level studies are required to be carried out for various channel conditions and reliability requirements. However, these studies are time-intensive and require highly complex computations, if they are performed using link-level simulators. Therefore, the physical layer performance is usually abstracted using a link quality model, also known as Physical layer abstraction (PLA). For this purpose, we present novel PLA techniques to model different fading and interference effects for considered technologies. Further, we compare the performance of PLA techniques in terms of estimation accuracy against physical layer simulations. The results show that the estimated packet error rate (PER) by proposed PLA methods are close to the results obtained through physical layer simulations. Besides, we compare the performance of all considered technologies (i.e., IEEE 802.11p, LTE-V2X, IEEE 802.11bd, and NR-V2X) in terms of data rates, latency, and reliability. The results indicate that NR-V2X is superior in terms of average data rates compared to other technologies. In contrast, IEEE 802.11bd has lower transmission latency and higher reliability compared to other technologies.},

The second one is the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver, which impacts the interference cancellation at the NOMA receiver. The third issue is the imperfection arising due to hardware circuits, which include fixed-pointed digital logic, analog and radio frequency (RF) circuits. To some extent, these issues have been addressed in bits and pieces in the context of single antenna power NOMA design, however they have not been addressed all together in the context of MIMO power NOMA. There are several key contributory aspects in this work. Key part is the exploitation of these parameter estimation error statistics along with the imperfections in transceiver hardware chains and SIC at the receiver. We propose a MIMO NOMA based on the maximum sum-rate criterion. An analytical framework has been presented in this regard.

In the design of most of the traditional networks, this broadcast nature is perceived as a performance-degrading factor. However, Physical Layer Network Coding (PNC) exploits this broadcast nature by enabling simultaneous transmissions from different sources and thereby enhances the performance of the wireless networks with respect to improvement in spectral efficiency, coverage, latency and security of the system. For fifth generation (5G) networks and beyond, massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is considered as a key physical layer technology. Thus, its combination with PNC can significantly enhance the performance of the network, facilitating capacity-coverage improvement, among other benefits. While the bit error rate performance of multiuser massive MIMO-PNC systems through linear detection has been investigated extensively, their coverage probability for a given target signal-to-noise ratio has not been explored yet. In this paper, we derive a closed form expression for coverage probability in PNC based multiuser massive MIMO systems employing zero-forcing equalization.

In this paper, the problem of joint user scheduling, operation mode selection and power allocation in a two-tier cellular network with FD-capable small basestations is considered. The objective is to maximize the network sum rate under quality-of-service requirements and backhaul capacity constraints. In order to solve the problem, a distributed algorithm is developed which divides the original problem into two subproblems, viz., (i) user scheduling and mode selection; and (ii) power allocation. For the first subproblem, a low-complexity search method is proposed for opportunistically finding the best user scheduling and operation modes. In the second subproblem, an iterative successive convex approximation method is proposed to transform the nonconvex power allocation problem into a sequence of convex subproblems. The proposed solution provides a hybrid strategy which opportunistically selects FD or half-duplex (HD) operation modes for access and backhaul links. It is observed that the proposed algorithm converges in few iterations and mitigates the interferences by properly adjusting the transmission powers. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over other possible scenarios. In particular, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 44% gain in overall sum rate compared to a network that solely uses HD.},

Drones have the primary task of parcel delivery and a secondary task of acting as relay nodes (hop) to add extra capacity in a cellular network. Base transceiver stations in the cells can admit ground user equipment to communicate directly with the drone (device-to-device communications) through in-band signalling between them. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, called CARLO, which optimizes trajectory and altitude of the drones in order to deliver physical parcels, maximize network capacity and reduce network interference. Our simulation studies show that our solution improves the network throughput while the energy inefficiency of taking detour path to assist congested cells is kept to a minimum. Moreover, it is guaranteed that parcels are delivered before deadline.},

  abstract     = {In the Shannon lecture at the 2019 International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), Arıkan proposed to employ a one-to-one convolutional transform as a pre-coding step before the polar transform. The resulting codes of this concatenation are called polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes . In this scheme, a pair of polar mapper and demapper as pre- and post- processing devices are deployed around a memoryless channel, which provides polarized information to an outer decoder leading to improved error correction performance of the outer code. In this paper, the list decoding and sequential decoding (including Fano decoding and stack decoding) are first adapted for use to decode PAC codes. Then, to reduce the complexity of sequential decoding of PAC/polar codes, we propose (i) an adaptive heuristic metric, (ii) tree search constraints for backtracking to avoid exploration of unlikely sub-paths, and (iii) tree search strategies consistent with the pattern of error occurrence in polar codes. These contribute to the reduction of the average decoding time complexity from 50% to 80%, trading with 0.05 to 0.3 dB degradation in error correction performance within FER = &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{-3}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; range, respectively, relative to not applying the corresponding search strategies. Additionally, as an important ingredient in Fano decoding of PAC/polar codes, an efficient computation method for the intermediate LLRs and partial sums is provided. This method is effective in backtracking and avoids storing the intermediate information or restarting the decoding process. Eventually, all three decoding algorithms are compared in terms of performance, complexity, and resource requirements.},

  abstract     = {Long-Term Evolution in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) is a promising solution to address the spectrum scarcity in the cellular networks. However, the LTE-U and WiFi systems may interfere with each other and degrade the performance. Thus, many works have focused on coexistence design and proposed various solutions. Nevertheless, the hidden terminal problem has not been well studied in the LTE-U system. In this paper, we investigate joint interference detection and resource allocation in the LTE-U system to maximize the overall system throughput while guaranteeing each user&#39;s quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Firstly, to solve the hidden terminal problem and avoid the co-channel interference between the WiFi and LTE-U users, we adopt a cluster-based algorithm to find the potential WiFi interference for each LTE-U user according to their channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback and location information. Secondly, we formulate a joint subcarrier and power allocation problem over the licensed and unlicensed bands with each user&#39;s QoS provision. To make the original problem more tractable, we separate it into licensed and unlicensed subproblems and then derive the optimal solution. Moreover, we propose a low-complexity resource allocation scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly improve the system performance and outperform the existing schemes.},

To reduce the channel state information (CSI) feedback from the user terminals, which consequently reduces the latency and signaling overheads, we design a ZF precoder with matrix and vector normalizations using partial CSI and analyze its ergodic SR performance. We consider a practical scenario where the links between the satellite and user terminals are affected by rain fading attenuation and derive an analytical expression, upper and lower bounds, and asymptotic (in terms of transmit power) approximations for the ergodic SR achieved by this ZF precoder. Many important insights are obtained from these results. Also, the robustness of this ZF precoder to CSI estimation errors is numerically analyzed.},

To enhance the reliability of multi-point transmissions over MISO TWDP fading channels, we propose a zero-forcing based coordinated beamforming scheme, for which we can analytically characterize and optimize the outage probability of the multi-point transmissions. Based on the developed outage expressions, we furthermore propose a greedy coordinated scheduling approach that attempts to maximize the achievable rate of the system. Finally, we propose a transmission rate adaptation scheme for fixed size packet transmissions, which supports reliable and at the same time resource efficient multi-point transmissions.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) communications open a new frontier for the wireless network thanks to their dramatically wider available bandwidth compared to the current micro-wave and forthcoming millimeter-wave communications. However, due to the short length of THz waves, they also suffer from severe path attenuation and poor diffraction. To compensate for the THz-induced propagation loss, this paper proposes to combine two promising techniques, viz., massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), in THz multi-user communications, considering their significant beamforming and aperture gains. Nonetheless, channel estimation and low-cost beamforming turn out to be two main obstacles to realizing this combination, due to the passivity of IRS for sending/receiving pilot signals and the large-scale use of expensive RF chains in massive MIMO. In view of these limitations, this paper first develops a cooperative beam training scheme to facilitate the channel estimation with IRS. In particular, we design two different hierarchical codebooks for the proposed training procedure, which are able to balance between the robustness against noise and searching complexity. Based on the training results, we further propose two cost-efficient hybrid beamforming (HB) designs for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint beam training and HB scheme is able to achieve close performance to the optimal fully digital beamforming which is implemented even under perfect channel state information (CSI).},

Mobile IoT networks typically operate in complex and highly variable urban wireless channel environments. This makes effective and reliable communications challenging. To ensure efficient and stable communications, mobile IoT networks must adapt to the complex environment. This can be achieved by predicting the outage probability (OP). This paper investigates OP analysis and prediction for these networks. Exact closed-form OP expressions are derived and Monte-Carlo simulation is used to verify the analysis and evaluate the OP performance. Then, an OP prediction approach based on an improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) algorithm and Elman neural network (IGWO-Elman) is proposed. The IGWO algorithm employs improved opposition-based learning to optimize the population initialization and ensure sufficient population diversity. The Elman neural network uses the IGWO algorithm to obtain good network parameters. Simulation results are presented which demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of IGWO-Elman is better than SVM, ELM, and BP algorithms. In terms of prediction accuracy, the IGWO-Elman algorithm is increased by 44%.},

Assuming that this communication system operates in a Rician fading channel, firstly, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) CE complexity for both Non-OPs and orthogonal pilots (OPs) are derived and compared. It is also shown that the variance of the MMSE CE error with Non-OPs can be approximated as a linear fraction. Based on this CE analysis, the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) spectral efficiency (SE) performances with ideal and non-ideal channel state information (CSI) are derived. Furthermore, the UL-SE performances for both Non-OPs and OPs are compared to show the advantage of using Non-OPs for applications which have very high connectivity requirements. The power scaling law is also used to obtain additional insights on how these HWIs affect the overall M 2 -MIMO SE performance. In order to balance the total BS circuitry power consumption against UL-SE, the tradeoff between UL energy efficiency (EE) and UL-SE has been investigated by analyzing the performance of several receive detection strategies as a function of the employed ADC quantization bits (Q-bits). Moreover, the optimal ADC/DAC Q-bit region which maximizes the DL-EE is identified. Various performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulations have verified the analysis and validated the accuracy of the equivalent theoretical performance evaluation results.},

The effective allocation of the limited transmit power at a transmitter is critical to serve the data rate request of a legacy (untrusted) receiver while accomplishing the stealthy and secure transmissions of secret messages to a trusted receiver, which is challenging under OFDM settings due to the non-convexity of the secrecy rate. This paper presents a new iterative algorithm, which optimizes the allocation of the transmit power across the OFDM subcarriers to minimize the transmit power, subject to the data rate request of the (legacy) untrusted receiver and the required secrecy rate of the trusted receiver. The algorithm can also maximize the secrecy rate of the trusted receiver, subject to the data rate request of the untrusted receiver and the total transmit power. In particular, the proposed algorithm decouples the power allocations between the trusted and untrusted receivers. Semi-closed-form solutions are established for the powers, and can be alternately analyzed until convergence with local optimality. Corroborated by simulations, the proposed techniques outperform existing alternatives in terms of power saving and achievable secrecy rate. As the untrusted receiver moves further away from the transmitter, the number of subcarriers carrying superposed signals increases and the secret messages can be delivered unnoticed.},

In this paper, we translate the non-linear differential equations for the hole-electron recombination and photon emissions, into a discrete-time model with delay taps and non-linear coefficients. This LED model can be inverted, to actively eliminate or mitigate the non-linear dynamic LED distortion. We propose a further simplification of the compensation circuit that allows us to use a relatively simple structure with only a couple of parameters. We experimentally characterize and measure signals communicated via commercially available illumination LEDs that are also used for LiFi communication. In an Intensity Modulation Direct Detection (IM/DD) system employing Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), we show that the proposed equalizer can effectively widen the measured eye diagram, thereby reduce the error rate or can allow a larger constellation. For Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the reduction in distortion allows at least a 50% increase in bit rate, even on measured noisy channels. This confirms the suitability of the LED model on which our non-linear equalizer is based. We show how non-linear time-constants can be estimated from electrical measurements on the LED signal. With the proposed parameter estimation, the equalizer converges to appropriate compensation settings, in Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) sense.},

First, we study the channel estimation accuracy and its impact on the SE as the BS density increases and the network becomes densified. Second, we consider the special case of uncorrelated channels for which the stochastic geometry framework helps us to simplify the SE expressions, and obtain the minimum value of antenna-UE ratio over which the pilot contamination is dominant rather than the inter- and intra-cell interference. Finally, we provide some insights into the obtained SE for the spatially correlated channels, from a multi-cell processing scheme as well as the single-cell ones in terms of the BS density. Our results show that while all the detectors result in non-increasing SE in terms of the BS density, their area SE increases exponentially as the network becomes densified. Moreover, we conclude that in order to achieve a given SE, the required value of antenna-UE ratio decreases as the level of channel correlation increases.},

As the harvest-then-transmit protocol is employed by sensor nodes, a major challenge lies on the tradeoff between achievable throughput and energy harvesting opportunity of sensor nodes. Confronting this challenge, we develop an energy threshold approach by jointly considering geographic locations and energy states of sensor nodes, where wireless energy transfer occurs when none of the sensor nodes in the range of data transmission has more energy than the threshold, otherwise data transmission from one randomly chosen qualified sensor node to the HAP occurs. By comparing the range of energy harvesting and that of data transmission, we divide the network topology into two cases for throughput analysis, and formulate the energy states of sensor nodes as Markov chain processes with different energy state spaces in the two cases. Through monotonicity analysis of achievable throughput and probability distribution of energy states, we prove the existence of the optimal energy threshold that maximizes the achievable throughput, and find that the achievable throughput under infinite battery size could be viewed as the upper bound of that under the limited battery size. Finally, simulation results validate theoretical results of the optimal energy threshold, and show the impacts of system parameters on the achievable throughput.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), safety messages are exchanged among vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure to ensure passengers&#39; safety and efficiency in traffic. The source authentication as well as integrity checking of these messages are very necessary for a receiver. Based on certificateless cryptography (CLC), some state-of-the-art signature schemes have been proposed to address these. Although they fulfill the requirements of authentication and privacy, they are not efficient with respect to performance. Bilinear pairings and map-to-point hash functions are used in these schemes. These require a huge amount of time to process. The computational power and storing capacity of an on-board unit (OBU) in each vehicle are limited. Therefore, computational overhead is induced on vehicles that need to authenticate messages in areas of high traffic density. In this paper, a provably secure and efficient certificateless short signature-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CLSS-CPPA) scheme for V2V communication is designed. This scheme does not use bilinear parings and is based on the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). In addition, instead of map-to-point hash functions, general hash functions are used. Furthermore, the CLSS-CPPA scheme supports the batch signature verification method which allows multiple signatures to be verified simultaneously and efficiently. The CLSS-CPPA scheme ensures security against type-I and type-II attackers with respect to existential unforgeability against adaptively chosen message attacks (EUF-CMA) under a hardness assumption of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in the random oracle model (ROM). The proposed scheme significantly improves performance in terms of computational and communication costs in comparison with state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Significant progress has been made in transportation electrification in recent years. As the main energy storage device, lithium-ion batteries are one of the key components that need to be properly managed. The remaining useful life, which represents battery health, has attracted increasing attention. Because accurate and robust predictions provide important information for predictive maintenance and cascade utilization. This paper proposes a novel method to predict remaining useful life based on the optimized health indicators and online model correction with transfer learning. Gaussian process regression is used to optimize the threshold for health indicators to determine the end of life, and a usefulness evaluation strategy is proposed to assess the health indicators. Then, a combination of transfer learning and gated recurrent neural network is designed to predict the remaining useful life based on the optimized health indicators directly, which can promote online applications. The prediction model initially trained based on a relevant battery is further fine-tuned according to the early degradation cycling data of the test battery to provide accurate predictions. Moreover, a self-correction strategy is proposed to retrain the regression models so that the models can gradually reach the optimal prediction performance during the operating cycles, which could not be achieved by traditional methods. The recommended input sequence lengths for potential applications are discussed. The method is verified by experiments of a batch of batteries under fast charging conditions, and the results show that, after fine-tuning, the proposed method predicts remaining useful life with an error of fewer than 5 cycles.},

This way, large amounts of computational and testing times are required. The main objective of this work is to propose a methodology to simplify the process of obtaining a controller for antilock brake systems through a combination of optimization and simulation. To this end, an evolutionary algorithm based on the coevolution of two species has been used to tune the proposed fuzzy logic controller.

The ideal regrouping form for echelon utilization is conducted at the module level. However, existing sorting methods are generally only suitable at the cell level. To address this issue, a fast sorting and regrouping method is proposed at the module level based on a machine learning algorithm. First, the correlation between the charging curve and the remaining useful capacity of the battery is investigated. The charging curves of cells in a module are translated and supplemented to extract the capacity characteristics without disassembling the modules. Next, a rapid sorting model based on the support vector machine is proposed to estimate the capacity. Then, a regrouping method based on an improved K-means algorithm that considers different echelon utilization scenarios at the module level is proposed. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the capacity prediction accuracy is within 3%, and the consistency of the echelon utilization battery system obtained by the proposed regrouping method is higher than that obtained by the conventional method.},

The basic idea behind this is to avoid the heat losses caused by excessive air exchange and to ensure a satisfactory air quality in combination with a user defined temperature.

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand for Lithium-ion batteries in an electric vehicle (EV), it is always crucial to develop a highly accurate and low-cost state estimation method for the battery management system (BMS). Presently, the dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF) is extensively utilized for online SOC estimation. However, the problem of battery model parameter divergence from the true value greatly affects the estimation accuracy under realistic dynamic loading conditions. In this paper, the new dual forgetting factor-based adaptive extended Kalman filter (DFFAEKF) is proposed for SOC estimation. The proposed SOC estimation method is combined with the simple SOE estimation approach to develop the combined SOC and SOE estimation method. The quantitative relationships between SOC and SOE for all the test battery cells, which are established with the experimental data collected from different constant current discharge profiles are employed for SOE estimation. To evaluate the performance of the developed combined SOC and SOE estimation method, the three different chemistries battery cells are chosen for the testing under different dynamic loading profiles such as dynamic stress test (DST) and US06 drive cycle. For all the considered test battery cells, the experimental results indicated that the combined SOC and SOE estimation method using the proposed DFFAEKF can estimate the battery states under dynamic operating conditions with root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.85% and 0.95% respectively. The proposed method also demonstrates fast convergence to its true value under erroneous initial conditions. Additionally, the order of worst-case big O notation complexity of the proposed DFFAEKF is equivalent to DEKF. Besides, the simplicity of the proposed method also supports to reduce the computational burden of the processor used in BMSs, and therefore it is well-suited for EV applications.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems include all transportation modes, aiming to improve the efficiency of transportation in many situations. Identifying the transportation mode of users is a key performance and quality requirement for ITS. Many works have proposed the extraction of this contextual information from large datasets, in an offline manner, while fewer works have proposed techniques for detecting this type of context in real-time. Real-time detection could allow cost and latency reduction for ITS applications since all the processing can be made within smartphone devices and actions can be taken quicker, as the information will always be up to date. In this paper, we propose a real-time travel mode detection technique that applies supervised machine learning (ML) on location data extracted from smartphone sensors. We evaluate its performance through confusion matrix metrics obtained from inferences made during field tests with 37 users in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A total of 2519 samples were classified using a prototype application, namely CityTracks-RT, in which we implemented the proposed technique, using only smartphone hardware resources. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of a popular off-the-shelf activity recognition (AR) solution in the travel mode detection task, to justify the development of specialized techniques. For this, we implemented another prototype application named CityTracks-AWARE. Thus, it was possible to verify that generic AR solutions are not sufficient for travel mode detection, through the performance evaluations carried out, and that our proposed technique provides a good basis for a specialized solution.},

  abstract     = {The wind deflection of overhead contact lines (OCLs) challenges the stable and safe operation of electrified railways. The steady wind causes the static deflection of the contact line, while the fluctuating wind leads to the OCL buffeting. This paper performs a response spectrum analysis of the wind deflection caused by the combined effects of steady and fluctuating winds. Considering the initial configuration of OCL, an absolute nodal coordinate formulation method is employed to model the OCL. A spatial wind field including the fluctuating wind in three directions is constructed and the aerodynamic forces on the OCL are derived. A nonlinear solution procedure is proposed to include the geometrical nonlinearity and dropper slackness in the evaluation of static wind deflection. The pseudo-excitation method is utilised to evaluate the buffeting response of the OCL with stochastic wind load. The analysis results indicate that the dropper slackness has a significant effect on the vertical static deflection. Under an extreme wind speed of 40 m/s, the contact line is always within the safe working range of pantograph head when only the steady wind load is considered. However, the stochastic wind load causes non-negligible fluctuation of OCL, and the contact line may be outside of the pantograph working range under the same wind speed. Sensitivity analyses on the effects of some key parameters to the OCL buffeting suggest that the increases of damping ratio and the tension class are effective measures to improve the wind-resistance capability of OCL.},

  abstract     = {Providing pedestrians and other vulnerable road users with a clear indication about a fully autonomous vehicle status and intentions is crucial to make them coexist. In the last few years, a variety of external interfaces have been proposed, leveraging different paradigms and technologies including vehicle-mounted devices (like LED panels), short-range on-road projections, and road infrastructure interfaces (e.g., special asphalts with embedded displays). These designs were experimented in different settings, using mockups, specially prepared vehicles, or virtual environments, with heterogeneous evaluation metrics. Promising interfaces based on Augmented Reality (AR) have been proposed too, but their usability and effectiveness have not been tested yet. This paper aims to complement such body of literature by presenting a comparison of state-of-the-art interfaces and new designs under common conditions. To this aim, an immersive Virtual Reality-based simulation was developed, recreating a well-known scenario represented by pedestrians crossing in urban environments under non-regulated conditions. A user study was then performed to investigate the various dimensions of vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction leveraging objective and subjective metrics. Even though no interface clearly stood out over all the considered dimensions, one of the AR designs achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of safety and trust, at the cost of higher cognitive effort and lower intuitiveness compared to LED panels showing anthropomorphic features. Together with rankings on the various dimensions, indications about advantages and drawbacks of the various alternatives that emerged from this study could provide important information for next developments in the field.},

Topics tackled in this field of research include object collision routing optimization, delivery routing optimization, battery management optimization, and the addition of solar panels on the drones. Little publicly available research has been found to have been conducted on developing the methods to optimize the powertrain of the drones to maximize their delivery radii through modifying their electric motor and propeller parameters. In working towards that goal, this paper puts forth a delivery drone driving cycle simulation written in MATLAB with which to monitor their performance and fine-tune their properties. The driving cycle has been written to accommodate unmanned drones that use any number of propellers and perform vertical take-off and landing maneuvers. This driving cycle algorithm iteratively runs through multiple driving profiles to find the one which produces the maximal delivery radius for the drone. A data processing tool for polynomial interpolation, which is also written in MATLAB, is developed to manipulate the electric motor and propeller data into usable states for the simulation. For the tested drone configurations, no discernible pattern was noticed in the ideal power throttle needed to reach cruise altitude most efficiently. During cruise, an ideal pitch between 27 to 47 degrees which allowed them to displace horizontally while spending the least amount of energy per meter was found for all configurations.},

  abstract     = {System identification is very important for the controller design of unmanned helicopters, and it has significant impacts on the quality of flight missions. With the recent advances of reinforcement learning, we propose a generalized orthonormal basis function (GOBF)-based system identification scheme for unmanned helicopters. Using GOBF, the traditional parameter estimation problem in system identification not only becomes better numerical conditioned but also can be affected by the prior knowledge. The proposed novel GOBF-based system identification scheme can enable users to make good use of prior knowledge due to the learning capability of reinforcement learning. In addition, there is a theoretical guarantee of convergence in the proposed GOBF-based system identification scheme. Moreover, we develop an additional self-optimization process based on Bayes theory to enhance the robustness of the scheme and improve the search efficiency of the proposed scheme. Both simulations and practical experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Maneuver decision-making and trajectory planning play important roles in autonomous driving since a safe and flexible decision module is indispensable for navigation. Typical algorithms apply sampling methods to generate feasible trajectories. However, the fixed sampling distance and maneuver execution time in a sampling approach sacrifice the flexibility of algorithm. Moreover, since motion planning can be represented as a high-dimensional problem, it usually results in unnecessary samples that require additional resources to search the solution. Therefore, a semantic-level maneuver sampling and trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to solve the above problems. In the upper-level maneuver decision, the decision-making problem is formulated as a selection of the forward leading object. A semantic-level decision tree is built to sample long-term maneuver sequences, and the safety corridor of each maneuver sequence is calculated according to the surrounding environment. In the lower-level trajectory planning, the process is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral directions. First, a heuristic search method is proposed to generate longitudinal trajectory candidates for each maneuver sequence. Then, an exhaustive search algorithm is employed to synchronously generate the lateral trajectory within safety corridor. Among the generated trajectory candidates, the one with minimum cost will be chosen as the searching result. Furthermore, in order to improve the driving comfort, numerical optimization is adopted to refine the result by accounting for the constraints of kinematics and safety. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated through simulations of typical on-road dynamic scenarios, which help verify its performance with desirable computation efficiency of less than 32 ms.},

In particular, the impact of non-linear hardware distortions at the transmit and receiver chains, leading to residual self-interference (SI) and inter-carrier leakage (ICL), as well as the imperfect channel state information (CSI) are taken into account. In the first step, the known time-domain characterization of hardware impairments is transformed over a general orthonormal MC basis. As a result, the problem of linear precoding and decoding design is formulated to maximize the MC system sum-rate, however, leading to a non-convex mathematical structure. An alternating quadratic convex program (AQCP) is consequently proposed, with a monotonic improvement at each iteration, leading to a guaranteed convergence. The proposed AQCP framework is then extended, employing the Dinkelbach algorithm, in order to maximize the system energy efficiency in terms of bits-per-Joule. The proposed design strategies are considered both for per-subcarrier as well as the joint-subcarrier coding strategies, wherein the latter case the coding is performed jointly over all subcarriers. Numerical simulations show a significant gain in the performance of the proposed algorithms compared to the half-duplex (HD) counterparts or to the solutions where the impact of impairments are not considered, particularly when the hardware accuracy is not very high.},

Although, machine-learning-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed, there are limitations in detecting unknown attacks that the model has not learned because general supervised learning-based approaches depend on training dataset. To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised method for IVN anomaly detection using noised pseudo normal data. The proposed method consists of two deep-learning models of the generator and the detector, which generates noised pseudo normal data and detects anomalies, respectively. Firstly, the generator is trained with only normal network traffic to generate pseudo normal traffic data. Then, the anomaly detector is trained to classify normal traffic and noised pseudo normal traffic as normal and abnormal, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the anomaly detection models, trained with the proposed method, not only significantly improved in the detection of unknown attacks, but also outperformed other semi-supervised learning-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Transparent topology is common in many mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) such as vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks, and wireless sensor networks due to their decentralization and mobility nature. There are many existing works on distributed scheduling scheme design for topology-transparent MANETs. Most of them focus on delay-unconstrained settings. However, with the proliferation of real-time applications over wireless communications, it becomes more and more important to support delay-constrained traffic in MANETs. In such applications, each packet has a given hard deadline: if it is not delivered before its deadline, its validity will expire and it will be removed from the system. This feature is fundamentally different from the traditional delay-unconstrained one. In this article, we for the first time investigate distributed scheduling schemes for a topology-transparent MANET to support delay-constrained traffic. We analyze and compare probabilistic ALOHA scheme and deterministic sequence schemes, including the conventional time division multiple access (TDMA), the Galois field (GF) sequence scheme proposed by Chlamtac and Faragò and the combination sequence scheme that we propose for a special type of sparse network topology. We use both theoretical analysis and empirical simulations to compare all these schemes and summarize the conditions under which different individual schemes perform best.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate mobile devices&#39; (MUs&#39;) computational burden by offloading part or all of their computational tasks to a nearby edge server. To promote the wide deployment of MEC, charging the MUs and rewarding the edge server is a good mechanism to motivate the edge server to offer computing service. Current related literature usually assume a linear pricing strategy, in which the unit price in time is a linear function with the served computing capability. In this work, however, we explore the nonlinear pricing strategy for the first time, as the cost of a CPU presents super-linear feature with the computing capability. A MEC system with multiple MUs and a single edge server is considered and a two-level Stackelberg game with the leader being the edge server and the followers being MUs is formulated, whereby edge server&#39;s revenue is maximized in the upper level via optimizing the nonlinear pricing function while the defined cost function of individual MUs is minimized by deciding the amount of data for offloading and computing capability to purchase from the edge server in the lower level. Through analysis, steps of transformations, and relaxation, closed-form optimal solution for lower-level problem is derived, and the solution for upper-level problem is presented although it is non-convex. Numerical results verify the superiority of our proposed pricing strategy over traditional linear pricing strategy.},

In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is tractable for both finite and asymptotically large values of the metasurfaces. Furthermore, we derive the channel hardening factor as a function of the shape factor of Nakagami-m fading channel and the number of IRS elements. Finally, we derive a closed-form expression to calculate the maximum coverage range of the IRS for given network parameters.

  abstract     = {This work shows that a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) forms a natural extreme learning machine (ELM). The receive antennas at the base station serve as the hidden nodes of the ELM, and the low-resolution ADCs act as the ELM activation function. By adding random biases to the received signals and optimizing the ELM output weights, the system can effectively tackle hardware impairments, such as the nonlinearity of power amplifiers and the low-resolution ADCs. Moreover, the fast adaptive capability of ELM allows the design of an adaptive receiver to address time-varying effects of MIMO channels. Simulations demonstrate the promising performance of the ELM-based receiver compared to conventional receivers in dealing with hardware impairments.},

The proposed FGSM system changes the modulation sizes over the LEDs and the number of active LEDs, to improve the average symbol error rate (SER) and spectral efficiency compared to ASM with a fixed overall number of LEDs. The modulation sizes are selected in order to optimize the average SER under a predefined spectral efficiency value.

  abstract     = {Edge intelligence is an emerging network architecture that integrates sensing, communication, computing components, and supports various machine learning applications, where a fundamental communication question is: how to allocate the limited wireless resources (such as time, energy) to the simultaneous model training of heterogeneous learning tasks? Existing methods ignore two important facts: 1) different models have heterogeneous demands on training data; 2) there is a mismatch between the simulated environment and the real-world environment. As a result, they could lead to low learning performance in practice. This paper proposes the learning centric wireless resource allocation (LCWRA) scheme that maximizes the worst learning performance of multiple tasks. Analysis shows that the optimal transmission time has an inverse power relationship with respect to the generalization error. Finally, both simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed LCWRA scheme and its robustness in real implementation.},

In this paper, we propose a sparse vector coding (SVC)-aided URLLC multi-user transmission scheme by employing the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique. To reliably acquire the support information, we formulate the SVC decoding problem in multi-user massive MIMO systems as the problem to find out nonzero positions of a sparse vector. Then, the support recovery problem is transformed into a series of sub-problems by decoupling the support identification of each user, where the successive interference cancellation based matching pursuit (SIC-MP) algorithm is proposed to estimate the support sequentially. In addition, the user sorting scheme is proposed to alleviate the inter-user interference in the SVC decoding. The complexity of the proposed SIC-MP algorithm is only linear with the system parameters.},

  abstract     = {Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) has emerged as a novel paradigm for performing large-scale sensing tasks. Many incentive mechanisms have been proposed to encourage user participation in MCS. However, most of them ignore the inevitable cold start stage of MCS, where the MCS system has just begun releasing tasks. Also, they all adopt the single-round incentive without considerations of the continuous cumulative effect. Given the severe shortage of participants in the cold start stage of MCS, this paper proposes a Multi-Round Incentive Mechanism (MRIM). MRIM is based on monetary incentives by adopting multi-round cooperation and alternating between task information diffusion and task allocation operations, both of which are NP-hard problems even without inter-round coupling imposed by system budget constraints. We explore a method to predict the probability of users participating in tasks accurately. Furthermore, we present an efficient task information diffusion algorithm to maximize the number of users participating in tasks by submitting bids. We propose a fast task allocation algorithm based on truthful auction, comprising an approximation algorithm for solving the one-round winner selection and payment calculation. With budget constraints, MRIM maximizes the number of completed tasks by iteratively performing task information diffusion and task allocation. We also prove that MRIM also possesses desired properties such as computational efficiency, user rationality, platform profitability, and price truthfulness, which can further guarantee the robustness of MRIM. The extensive simulations conducted on real-world datasets have proved the efficiency of MRIM.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing has been considered as one of the key paradigms in the fifth-generation (5G) networks for enabling computation-intensive yet latency-sensitive vehicular Internet services. In this paper, we investigate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted vehicular edge computing via underlay spectrum sharing, in which vehicular computing-users (VUs) form a NOMA-group and reuse conventional cellular user&#39;s (CU&#39;s) channel for computation offloading. In spite of the benefit of spectrum sharing, the resulting co-channel interference degrades the CU&#39;s transmission. We thus firstly focus on a single-cell scenario of two VUs reusing one CU&#39;s channel, and analyze the CU&#39;s increased delay due to sharing channel with the VUs. We then jointly optimize the VUs&#39; partial offloading and the allocation of the communication and computing resources to minimize the VUs&#39; delay while limiting the CU&#39;s suffered increased delay. An efficient layered-algorithm is proposed to tackle with the non-convexity of the joint optimization problem. Based on our study on the single-cell scenario, we further investigate the multi-cell scenario in which a group of VUs flexibly form pairs to reuse the channels of different CUs for offloading, and formulate an optimal pairing problem to minimize the VUs&#39; overall-delay. To address the difficulty due to the combinatorial nature of the pairing problem, we propose a cross-entropy (CE) based probabilistic learning algorithm to find the optimal VU-pairings. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms for both the single-cell scenario and multi-cell scenario. The results also demonstrate that our NOMA-assisted MEC via spectrum sharing can outperform the conventional frequency division multiple access assisted offloading scheme.},

The Named Data Networking (NDN) presents a new data-centric mechanism and its advantages may help achieve VC. Therefore, we are motivated to exploit NDN to achieve VC. However, the intrinsic features of vehicles such as high mobility and the different architectures between NDN and vehicular networks make it challenging to deploy NDN in vehicular scenarios. For example, NDN employs limited broadcast and reverse paths to achieve data retrieval, which might lead to high data retrieval costs and frequent failures in vehicular environments. Furthermore, the lack of mobility support in NDN deteriorates the situation. Taking these issues into account, we propose a cost-efficient and VC-based data retrieval solution and aims to achieve VC by exploiting the advantages of NDN. In this solution, vehicles employ unicast and aggregation to acquire data from the nearest VC member via one data retrieval process, so efficient-cost and low-latency data retrieval is achieved. Moreover, this solution supports vehicle mobility and enhances stability of reverse paths, so data retrieval success rates are effectively improved. The proposal is evaluated, and the experimental results show that the proposal effectively reduces data retrieval costs and improve data retrieval success rates.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware scheme, named MobiPlace, to address the controller placement problem (CPP) at the Road Side Units (RSUs) in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (SDVNs). MobiPlace places local controllers at the selected RSUs to reduce the operational delay experienced in traditional SDVN architecture, where controllers are placed at the cloud. Additionally, we consider the effect of dynamic road traffic and propose dynamic adjustment of the placement of the controller with minimal changes. In contrast to the existing literature, we infuse traffic monitoring and traffic prediction strategies to ensure accurate delivery of control messages and data packets. We formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and propose a solution approach consisting of three modules - mobility management, controller placement, and controller selection. The mobility management module uses Markov predictor to predict vehicle movement and reduce controller synchronization overhead when a vehicle moves to a different controller&#39;s coverage area. The controller placement module applies a simulated annealing-based algorithm to select potential RSUs that serve as local controllers. The controller selection module determines the preferable controller location for processing the service requests. Simulation results depict that MobiPlace reduces the average flow setup delay by $13.85 \%$ compared to the existing state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Aerial base stations (ABSs) have shown significant potential to improve cellular networks&#39; performance due to their high mobility and on-demand deployment. In this paper, the trajectory optimization problem for a multi-ABS network is investigated. The objective is to maximize the minimum data rate of the cell-edge mobile users while the power constraint of the ABSs, including both propulsion and signal transmission powers, the backhaul link capacity constraint, and the collision avoidance constraint, are taken into account. To reach this goal, first, based on the modified K-means approach, the ABSs and users are partitioned into different clusters so that their associated ABS serve the users of each cluster. Afterward, the ABSs need to find an efficient trajectory optimization and resource allocation scheme to support the users. To solve this challenging problem, we convert the main trajectory optimization and resource allocation problem into three sub-problems: power allocation sub-problem, joint ABS-user association and sub-channel assignment sub-problem, and trajectory optimization sub-problem. Then, using the successive convex approximation approach, an efficient algorithm is proposed, which iteratively solves these sub-problems. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges fast and improves the network&#39;s data rate while it satisfies all the required constraints.},

  abstract     = {Technological evolutions in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry have granted UAVs more computing and storage resources, leading to the vision of UAVs-assisted edge computing, in which the computing missions can be offloaded from a cellular network to a UAV cloudlet. In this paper, we propose a UAVs-assisted computation offloading paradigm, where a group of UAVs fly around, while providing value-added edge computing services. The complex computing missions are decomposed as some typical task-flows with inter-dependencies. By taking into consideration the inter-dependencies of the tasks, dynamic network states, and energy constraints of the UAVs, we formulate the average mission response time minimization problem and then model it as a Markov decision process. Specifically, each time a mission arrives or a task execution finishes, we should decide the target helper for the next task execution and the fraction of the bandwidth allocated to the communication. To separate the evaluation of the integrated decision, we propose multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, where the target helper and the bandwidth allocation are determined by two agents. We design respective advantage evaluation functions for the agents to solve the multi-agent credit assignment challenge, and further extend the on-policy algorithm to off-policy. Simulation results show that the proposed MARL-based approaches have desirable convergence property, and can adapt to the dynamic environment. The proposed approaches can significantly reduce the average mission response time compared with other benchmark approaches.},

The proposed BCCPS first considers a BBR-based congestion control algorithm, MPTCP-BBR, for MPTCP by adaptively adjusting the sending rate of each subflow according to the real probing rate rather than the loss information to enhance the goodput while keeping bottleneck fairness with regular TCP. Then, considering that the different sending rates of the subflows in heterogeneous wireless networks will result in the problem of out-of-order (OFO) delivery, a fine-grained packet scheduling scheme is proposed to keep in-order delivery and so as to reduce the application layer completion time. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via both NS-3 and real network scenarios. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme far outperforms existing MPTCP schemes in heterogeneous wireless environment.},

The performance optimization in satellite-NOMA systems could be different from that in terrestrial-NOMA systems, e.g., considering distinctive channel models, performance metrics, power constraints, and limited flexibility in resource management. In this paper, we adopt a metric, offered capacity to requested traffic ratio (OCTR), to measure the requested-offered data rate mismatch in multi-beam satellite systems. In the considered system, NOMA is applied to mitigate intra-beam interference while precoding is implemented to reduce inter-beam interference. We jointly optimize power, decoding orders, and terminal-timeslot assignment to improve the max-min fairness of OCTR. The problem is inherently difficult due to the presence of combinatorial and non-convex aspects. We first fix the terminal-timeslot assignment, and develop an optimal fast-convergence algorithmic framework based on Perron-Frobenius theory (PF) for the remaining joint power-allocation and decoding-order optimization problem. Under this framework, we propose a heuristic algorithm for the original problem, which iteratively updates the terminal-timeslot assignment and improves the overall OCTR performance. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm improves the max-min OCTR by 40.2% over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in average.},

In a majority of multi-object scenarios, the prior knowledge of detection probability is usually uncertain, which is often estimated offline from the training data. In such cases, online filtering is always unfeasible or unrealistic, otherwise, significant parameter mismatches will result in biased estimates (e.g., state and cardinality of objects). As a consequence, the ability of adaptively estimating the detection probability for a sensor is essential in practice. Based on the analysis, we detail how the detection probability can be estimated accompanied with the state estimates. Besides, the closed-form solutions to the proposed method are derived by means of approximating the intensity of Poisson random finite set (RFS) to a Beta-Gaussian mixture (BGM) form and density of Bernoulli RFS to a single Beta-Gaussian form, named BGM-PMBM filter. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

This paper considers a two-tier federated Edge and Vehicular-Fog (EVF) system, where edge systems may partially offload user traffic to nearby VFs for potential cost reduction. Offloading configuration is to determine the ratios and targets of offloading traffic for maximal cost reduction, which is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem in this paper. We first present a decentralized offloading configuration protocol (DOCP) for an individual edge system to set up its own offloading configuration. We then propose a matching protocol among multiple edge systems to resolve resource contention when they simultaneously request resources from the same VF. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can leverage the heterogeneity of cost and capacity between edge systems and VFs. The proposed protocol outperforms greedy approaches by at most 40% and is comparable to a centralized off-line approach that is based on Particle Swarm Optimization.},

This methodology is based on a framework that simultaneously exploits the strengths of each individual network by using a set of decision rules. The implementation begins with a manual approach in which a typical, hierarchical decision tree characterizes the decision process of a single application when sending data to other users in the network. Analytical and simulation results validate the decision system approach when diversity is exploited as demonstrated by a boost in application performance, achieving an average latency under 100 ms and a 40% increase in throughput due to the increased packet delivery ratio. We then apply an ensemble learning technique, Random Forests (RF), to automatically reproduce the performance of the manually built tree system. Simulations under realistic traffic scenarios show the RF approach can replicate manually-built tree performance with up to 98% precision. A comparison with another state-of-the-art hybrid method also shows the RF scheme improves performance under a different application scenario without additional manual adjustments. With our methodology, we can add different application requirements and network characteristics to obtain a fully automated and adaptable decision system to optimize vehicular safety applications.},

In the mode of data breakpoint transmission, a single task can be reasonably split into multiple subtasks and thus scheduled in multiple time windows. At first, the task scheduling model of DRSN considering breakpoint transmission is defined. In addition, a two-stage method is designed to generate a high-quality initial solution. Moreover, we propose an adaptive variable neighborhood descent combined with a tabu list (AVND-TL) to iteratively improve the initial solution. In AVND-TL, two task reallocation neighborhood structures are incorporated and adaptively selected during the solution search process, which effectively prevent the algorithm from falling into local optimum. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to verify that the proposed breakpoint transmission mode and AVND-TL together can significantly improve the task completion rate and resource utilization rate.},

Although some privacy-preserving schemes have been designed that aim to protect the sensitive information of sensed data, the reliability cannot be guaranteed because of the system&#39;s centralized structure. The introduction of blockchain in crowdsensing applications provides reliable data storage, however, the reliability of data sources remains an open challenge. Under these circumstances, the crowdsourcing service requester may not be able to obtain quality data.

Specially, in certain special scenarios, such as sports events, parades and nature disasters, it is a great challenge to deploy fixed BSs/SBSs. Thus, a kind of flexible replacement of BSs/SBSs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are considered as the caching platform to serve users. Hence, this paper proposes a distributed delay optimization algorithm by using the massive UAVs to cache the request contents of users. The purpose of each UAV is to facilitate BSs/SBSs to minimize user delay in downloading content based on the popularity of content and the flight strategy. In addition, we consider the main disturbance caused by the atmospheric turbulence. For the control of large-scale UAVs, we take the robust mean field game theory to model this kind of caching and dynamic flight strategy problem, in which the atmospheric turbulence is described by the disturbance term in the drift function. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the download delay under the limited energy consumption and finally achieve the equilibrium.},

Firstly, the relative SDRN system models are given and a dynamic scheduling mechanism is designed to deal with the disturbance factors during the scheduling process. Then, based on the dynamic scheduling mechanism, the RTDS scheme is implemented in three stages, which include initial scheduling, dynamic scheduling for emergency tasks, and final scheduling.

Furthermore, a smart contract is also designed between the subscriber and broker by the cloud server to achieve higher utilities and match an appropriate broker for the subscriber by considering its type.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates collaborative computation offloading in a vehicular network. Although there are increasingly more smart vehicles on roads, a significant number of legacy vehicles that are not equipped with powerful computing devices are expected to exist for a long time. When mobile devices located in these legacy vehicles require computation offloading, they can offload the tasks to nearby smart vehicles that are available to serve as cloudlet servers. Due to high mobility of the vehicles, multiple tasks of an application may have to be offloaded to different vehicle-based cloudlets. The offloading problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) by considering the randomness of the vehicle moving speeds and wireless channel conditions. The objective is to minimize the average completion time of the application. The complexity for solving the problem directly, however, is prohibitively high due to the large size of the state space and state transition probability matrix. The problem is solved by exploring the special structure of the state space, which helps reduce the computational complexity. A heuristic solution, namely, site-by-site and task-by-task (SSTT), is then proposed that makes the offloading decisions for individual tasks with much lower complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed SSTT solution not only achieves much lower average completion time, compared to executing all tasks locally and using distance-based offloading decisions, but also significantly reduces the energy consumption of the mobile device.},

  abstract     = {The joint communication-radar system (JCRS) is promising in the future wireless network which can provide great advantages, such as structure simplification, interference mitigation and less resource occupation, compared with the traditional separate deployment of communication and radar systems. However, with the large number of users accessing the network both for communication and radar purposes, massive user data packets may arrive at the base station equipped with the JCRS in a short period of time, which can easily cause the backlog of user data packets and affect network stability. To solve this problem, we introduce orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technique into the JCRS to support communication function for massive users. Then, we design a queue scheduling model of user data packets to perceive the status of current queue backlog and schedule the queue dynamically. Different from the existing works, we formulate a transmit power minimization problem, while taking network stability and radar detection performance into account. Since the problem is a non-convex problem, we transform it into the upper-bound minimization of drift-plus-function by using the Lyapunov optimization technique. Further, the successive convex approximation method and parameter transformation method are exploited to convert this problem into a convex problem. Finally, we derive an optimal closed-form power allocation expression by using the Lagrangian dual decomposition method and propose a dynamic subcarrier and power allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve an [O(1/η), O(η)] power-backlog tradeoff and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in reducing transmit power while significantly enhancing network stability.},

However, secure data deduplication in edge-based mobile crowdsensing applications can be challenging to achieve in concurrent with protecting sensing data and participants (e.g., client and recruited mobile users) from various threats (i.e., inside attacks and outside attacks). In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure data deduplication protocol for edge-assisted mobile crowdsensing services. Specifically, certificateless public key cryptography is first employed to generate the private and public keys of the crowdsensing server center and edge nodes. Then, a novel method is created to detect and eliminate duplicates while preventing the duplicate-linking from being leaked. Next, we demonstrate that the presented scheme achieves both privacy and security attributes typically required of mobile crowdsening applications. Finally, the performance analysis shows that the proposed protocol incurs minimal computation and communication costs compared with the state of the art research.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a machine learning-based power allocation design for secure transmission in a cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, a neural network (NN)-based approach is proposed to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary receiver under the constraints of total transmit power of secondary transmitter, and the interference leakage to the primary receiver, within which three different regularization schemes are developed. The key advantage of the proposed algorithm over conventional approaches is the capability to solve the power allocation problem with both perfect and imperfect channel state information. In a conventional setting, two completely different optimization frameworks have to be designed, namely the robust and non-robust designs. Furthermore, conventional algorithms are often based on iterative techniques, and hence, they require a considerable number of iterations, rendering them less suitable in future wireless networks where there are very stringent delay constraints. To meet the unprecedented requirements of future ultra-reliable low-latency networks, we propose an NN-based approach that can determine the power allocation in a CR network with significantly reduced computational time and complexity. As this trained NN only requires a small number of linear operations to yield the required power allocations, the approach can also be extended to different delay sensitive applications and services in future wireless networks. When evaluate the proposed method versus conventional approaches, using a suitable test set, the proposed approach can achieve more than 94% of the secrecy rate performance with less than 1% computation time and more than 93% satisfaction of interference leakage constraints. These results are obtained with significant reduction in computational time, which we believe that it is suitable for future real-time wireless applications.},

Radio maps can be used to improve spectrum management and for localization systems, which are related to wireless systems in general such as cellular systems, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and vehicular communications. Researchers have shown that crowdsourcing using spatial interpolation techniques can be used to accurately construct a radio map to improve these applications; however, because of the limitation in the spatial domain, conventional methods can build a radio map for only those frequencies at which sensing can be performed. Our proposed method focuses on the fact that the shadowing values show strong correlation over a wide range of frequency domains. The main idea is to treat the shadowing values obtained over various frequencies as the ones over target frequency. Using the actual datasets obtained over 870, 2115, and 3500 MHz in a cellular system, we show that the proposed method can accurately generate a radio map, even if no (or few) datasets are available in the target frequency.},

By exploiting the above two capabilities, a new confrontation mechanism in the spectrum domain between two opposing teams denoted as the blue team (BT) and red team (RT), is designed. The basic idea is that by sacrificing parts of ally performance to severely deteriorate the opponent side communications. Specifically, a friendly and smart jammer (assuming in the BT) is deployed to weaken opponent (i.e., members in the RT) communications without causing great damages to other BT members, while the smart RT members try to evade the jamming and alleviate mutual interference. The interactions among the friendly jammer and other nodes are modeled as a Stackelberg game, with each player seeking for their respective utility maximization. We prove that each sub-game is an exact potential game. To efficiently search for the equilibrium solutions, a parallel log-linear learning algorithm is proposed, based on which each user intelligently decides their spectrum access policies. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) RT communications are effectively suppressed; meanwhile, mutual interference among ally BT communication pairs is significantly alleviated; 2) the proposed algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal solution; 3) compared with the current state of solutions, i.e., random selection, stochastic learning automata, our algorithm performs better in terms of both utility and convergence.},

In spite of these advantages, it suffers from large bandwidth and energy loss due to usage of half-duplex relaying and limited energy storage devices. To solve these issues, we integrate the full-duplex (FD) relaying and time splitting simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique at the D2D transmitters (DDTs). Moreover, to support the ubiquitous connectivity and reduce the latency, non-orthogonal multiple access is used at the base station. The SWIPT-FD-based DDTs and SWIPT-based cell user equipment (CUE) harvest the energy from the base station, after that the DDTs and CUEs decode the desired signal from the multiplexed signal using successive interference cancellation technique, and forward the desired signal to the D2D user equipment (DUE) to improve their QoS. In this paper, ergodic capacity at the DDTs and DUEs &amp; closed-form expressions of the outage probabilities are derived with imperfect CSI.

  abstract     = {Due to large amounts of available spectrum at high frequencies, millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology has gained extensive research attention in 5G communications, whereas mmWave links suffer from severe free space attenuation. Codebook-based beamforming techniques with multiple antennas can effectively alleviate this challenge with low computational complexity and low hardware cost. However, small delay and high-speed communications with beamforming techniques require beam alignment with small overhead so as to establish the wireless link quickly. In this context, this paper proposes a deep learning-based low overhead analog beam selection scheme by virtue of the super-resolution technology. To be concrete, deep neural networks are employed to conduct beam quality estimation based on partial beam measurements. Our proposed scheme can cover all the directions of arriving signals with low overhead by utilizing codebooks with different beam widths. Furthermore, for the purpose of further reducing the overhead, we formulate the beam quality prediction model based on the past beam sweepings. With these beam quality estimation and prediction model, the beam that achieves large signal-to-noise-power-ratio (SNR) can be selected based on partial beam measurements. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate beam qualities and give high probability of optimal beam selections with low overhead.},

The proposed FBLMS technique is also robust, since it does not require any second-order statistical information, such as the cross-covariance vector and covariance matrix. Next a beamspace domain representation of the mmWave MIMO channel is obtained, followed by the development of the sparse-FBLMS (SFBLMS) scheme for the estimation of the wideband mmWave MIMO channel that additionally exploits the angular-sparsity for improved channel estimation performance. Analytical expressions are derived for the mean squared estimation error (MSEE) and mean squared observation error (MSOE) of both the proposed FBLMS and SFBLMS techniques. Furthermore, a systematic procedure is developed for determining the beneficial range of the values of the regularization parameter, which ensures a high channel estimation accuracy of the SFBLMS over FBLMS. A hybrid precoder and combiner design is also proposed for SC wideband systems by employing the channel estimates obtained using the above techniques.

  abstract     = {The explosive growth of innovative applications imposes great challenges for future wireless communication systems with respect to ultra-high spectrum and power efficiency. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) have been acknowledged as two promising spectral-enhancing techniques to address the aforementioned issues. Orthogonal space-time block code (STBC), on the other hand, is capable of exploiting the full diversity gain of MIMO system. In this work, we explore how STBC can be utilized to enhance the performance of two-cell MIMO-NOMA networks. To this end, an uplink power minimization problem for the two-cell STBC-aided MIMO-NOMA system is investigated, wherein the joint detection technique is adopted to boost the cell-edge user&#39;s performance. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex and is intractable to be solved directly. A two-tier methodology is applied to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, namely the beamforming design and the power allocation. Specifically, for the beamforming design, a closed-form expression is derived based on the Gram matrix of channel matrix. In the meanwhile, an efficient iterative method is developed to determine the power allocation coefficients for both the cell-center and the cell-edge users. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms several golden baselines in terms of total power consumption.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) are one of the key enabling technologies for fifth generation (5 G) networks. In HetNets, the use of small base stations (SBSs) inside the coverage area of a macro base station (MBS) offers higher throughput and improved coverage. However, such multi-tier base station deployment introduces new challenges, e.g., (i) All users experience significant inter-cell interference (ICI) due to frequency reuse, (ii) SBS associated users experience severe MBS-interference due to higher MBS transmit power, and (iii) MBS coverage edge users receive lower signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) due to longer distances. To address the aforementioned challenges, this work proposes a framework, including a novel cell deployment strategy, which combines Stienen&#39;s model with soft frequency reuse (SFR) and the corresponding performance analysis. According to Stienen&#39;s cell based SBS deployment, SBSs are deployed in MBS coverage edge area to enhance downlink SIR. To further mitigate ICI and MBS-interference, SFR is employed along with Stienen&#39;s cell based SBS deployment. Based on stochastic geometry, we derive expressions for coverage probability with four different types of cell deployment and SFR employment combinations. Numerical results indicate that SFR-enabled Stienen&#39;s cell based SBS deployment leads to enhanced edge user coverage and, hence, improves network performance gain.},

  abstract     = {The effective trajectory design of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is investigated for improving the capacity of the communication system. The aim is for maximizing real-time downlink capacity under the coverage constraint by reaping the mobility benefits of UAVs. The problem of three-dimension (3D) dynamic movement of UAVs under coverage constraint is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem, while a constrained Deep Q-Network (cDQN) algorithm is proposed for solving the formulated problem. In the proposed cDQN model, each UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its 3D deploying policy. The aim of the proposed cDQN model is for obtaining the maximum capacity while attempting to guarantee that all ground terminals (GTs) are covered. In order to satisfy the coverage constraint, a primal-dual method is adopted for training primal variable and dual variable (lagrangian multiplier) in turn. Furthermore, in an effort to reduce the action space of the cDQN algorithm, prior information is utilized for eliminating the invalid actions by the action filter. Experiment results demonstrate that the cDQN algorithm is capable of converging after some training steps. Additionally, the UAVs are capable of adapting the movement of GTs under the coverage constraint according to the 3D deploying policy derived from the proposed cDQN algorithm.},

Furthermore, our evaluations provide interesting design insights: (i) higher base station/vehicle densities does not necessarily improve caching performance; (ii) although using a narrower beam leads to a higher SINR, it also reduces the connectivity probability; and (iii) V2X caching can be an inexpensive way of compensating some of the unwanted mmWave channel characteristics.},

Although advantages of mobility have been extensively explored, the random jitter of UAV platforms, caused by airflow and body vibrations, has been rarely studied. This work aims to answer the two fundamental questions: i) how to analyze the secrecy performance when considering UAV jitter and ii) can this inherent characteristic of UAV be exploited to enhance secrecy? Detailed, we study the modeling and analysis of UAV jitter on the secrecy performance in an air-to-ground (A2G) wiretap system with multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers, where a UAV-mounted transmitter equipped with directional antennas illuminates ground terminals in a finite area. Random waypoint model is applied to characterize the mobility of eavesdroppers. To be specific, by modeling UAV jitter in both horizontal azimuth and vertical elevation, distortion and shift of UAV illumination area are analyzed. Further, beam-illumination probability of a randomly located ground terminal is obtained. Following which, a tractable framework for analyzing the secrecy coverage probability (SCP) and ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) is developed. Expressions for SCP and ESC are derived with characterizations for the signal-to-noise ratio received at legitimate receiver and eavesdroppers. Finally, extensive simulations are provided to validate the theoretical analysis. This is the first work to find that UAV jitter can be exploited to enhanced secrecy performance of A2G wiretap system with appropriate UAV height and beamwidth.},

In this paper, an FD transceiver design is proposed to mitigate the phase noise contained in the multipath self-interference (SI) components. This design is featured by deploying two receive chains whose oscillator signals are originated from the transmit oscillator signal but with different delays. To work with the proposed design, an SI cancellation algorithm is developed, where the phase noise contained in the multipath SI components are extracted by dividing the two received signals. The cancellation capabilities of the proposed transceiver, as well as two typical conventional transceivers, are derived in closed-forms. The impacts of oscillator delay adjustment errors and SI channel estimation errors on the cancellation capability are also analyzed to reveal guidelines for FD transceiver designs. Simulation results show that the proposed transceiver design can expand the transmission power and relax the requirement for the analog canceller, which shows advantages in the long-range communication with high transmission power, or in the scenario where analog cancellations are not applicable.},

The proposed system achieves a win-win situation, i.e. improving the spectrum efficiency of the CUs that cannot meet their rate requirement while providing spectrum access for D2D pairs. Unlike previous works, to reduce the overhead, we design a novel two-timescale resource allocation scheme, in which the pairing between CUs and D2D pairs is decided at a long timescale and transmission time for CU and D2D pair is determined at a short timescale. Specifically, to characterize the long-term payoff of each potential CU-D2D pair, we investigate the optimal cooperation policy to decide the transmission time based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). We prove that the optimal policy is a threshold policy which can be achieved via binary search. Since CUs and D2D pairs are self-interested, they are paired only when they agree to cooperate mutually. Therefore, to study the cooperation behaviors of CUs and D2D pairs, we formulate the pairing problem as a matching game, based on the long-term payoff achieved by the optimal cooperation policy of each possible pairing. Furthermore, unlike most previous matching models in D2D networks, we allow transfer between CUs and D2D pairs to improve the performance. To solve the pairing problem, a distributed algorithm is proposed, which converges to an ϵ-stable matching. We show that there is a trade-off between the optimality and the computational complexity of the algorithm. We also analyze the algorithm in terms of the robustness to the unilateral deviation of D2D pairs. Finally, the simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed matching algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) is a promising network access technology to enable the high data rates, high reliability and ultra-low latency required by connected vehicle services in future vehicular networks. However, mmWave links are prone to blockages due to high penetration loss, which can cause frequent service interruptions and degrade the system performance in terms of reliability and latency. In this study, we analyze the latency and reliability performance of mmWave communications between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) in a highway scenario, where the line-of-sight (LOS) links can be blocked by vehicles. First, we establish a continuous-time Markov chain model of the blockage events. By using the steady-state solution of this model, we explicitly derive the blockage probability and average blockage duration, which can be used to characterize the reliability and latency performance. We validate the accuracy of the analytical model by comparing it with simulations using real-world traffic data and vehicle distributions. We demonstrate that reducing the duration of long-lasting blockage events is more challenging than reducing the frequency of blockages. We consider three approaches to control the blockage probability and distribution of blockage durations: (i) increasing RSU density, (ii) increasing RSU heights and (iii) managing the vehicular speed limits. We show that the first two approaches are effective in reducing the blockage probability, whereas the third approach can be used to eliminate long blockages and improve latency performance. We discuss the implications of our results in terms of the benefits and challenges associated with these approaches.},

An IRS implemented by configurable phase shifters is used to assist the transmission from an access point (AP) equipped with multiple antennas to a user having a single antenna. We aim to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the AP and the reflect beamforming at the IRS to maximize the spectral efficiency of the system. The considered joint optimization problem can be decoupled into the transmit and reflect beamforming design problems by applying the maximum-ratio transmission strategy. The former has a closed-form expression, whereas the latter requires solving a nonconvex optimization problem. A known solution based on manifold optimization (MO) is proposed to solve the reflect beamforming design problem. Although the MO-based algorithm achieves higher spectral efficiency than the conventional semidefinite relaxation approach, it incurs high time complexity. On this basis, we address this issue by proposing a computationally efficient gradient projection (GP)-based algorithm for the reflect beamforming design problem. When low-resolution (e.g., 1-2 bits) phase shifters are adopted, we leverage an innovative probability learning technique on the basis of the cross-entropy (CE) framework to alleviate the performance loss caused by the use of low-resolution phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GP-based algorithm nearly obtains the same spectral efficiency as the state-of-the-art MO-based algorithm at a low complexity. However, the running time is significantly reduced. When low-resolution phase shifters are employed, the proposed CE-based algorithm outperforms the test algorithms in terms of spectral and energy efficiency in various system configurations.},

Considering a massive-access communication scenario, we first derive the statistics of the channel gain at IoT receivers in closed form while taking into account the radiation patterns of both ground and aerial nodes. These are then used to calculate the ergodic achievable rate as a function of the height of the aerial receiver and the cumulative interference. We propose a low-complexity interference mitigation scheme that utilizes 3D antenna radiation pattern with different dipole antenna settings. Our results show that using the proposed scheme, the ergodic achievable rate improves as the height of the aerial receivers increases.

Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we investigate a PLS algorithm using linear virtual antenna array (VAA) constructed by multiple single-antenna nodes in mobile ad hoc networks such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile robots. Digital cooperative beamforming (CB) has been extensively explored such as cooperative null-steering or jamming. However, in spite of their effectiveness, the digital CB-based schemes incur prohibitive overhead and complexity, which creates difficulty in networks with limited hardware (e.g., IoT). To overcome this issue, we consider an analog CB-based PLS with linearly distributed VAA, which can be implemented in a fully distributed manner. In the proposed scheme, the received signal at the intended receiver is co-phased, while other receivers capture noise-like signals through randomized radiation patterns using the linear VAA. Assuming Rician channels, we derive secrecy rate of the proposed algorithm in a closed-from expression for an arbitrary K-factor, which is not available in previous work on the analog CB-based PLS. Furthermore, we show that the random location perturbations of the VAA elements following Gaussian distributions can enhance the secrecy performance by resolving the angle-of-departure ambiguity issue in linear arrays.},

Due to the large number of antennas in a massive array, it is not very practical to conduct an exhaustive search, especially when considering the small angular coverage of one directional narrow beam (hence the number of candidate beams). To address such a challenge, we consider the 3D beam matching problem for a multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, and propose a two-stage hierachical codebook along with the corresponding fast beam training scheme. The proposed codebook contains a primary codebook for hierarchical beams and an auxiliary codebook for narrow beams following the limited resolution of the phase shifters (PSs). The fast beam training scheme based on the codebook not only reduces beam training overhead, but also is applicable to the scenario where there exist multiple propagation paths for one mobile station (MS).

  abstract     = {This paper presents a systematic and accurate calculation method to design the parasitic decoupling technique (PDT) for increasing antenna isolation in the multiple-element multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) array. The mutual coupling among antennas is suppressed by incorporating the parasitic decoupling structure (PDS) to generate the desired interference against the original antenna coupling. The designed PDS is composed of the parasitic scatterers, transmission lines (TLs), and reactive loads. A general network model is developed to determine the TL lengths and load reactances to satisfy the criteria derived from antenna impedances for high isolation. The decoupling methodology is further verified by two benchmarks. The simulation and measurement results demonstrate that isolation over 25 dB, efficiency above 72%, and envelop correlation coefficient below 0.02 can be achieved for both examples after using the proposed PDT. Besides, the PDT leads to improved pattern diversity, suitable for MIMO applications.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian/non-Gaussian impulsive noises in underwater acoustic (UWA) channel seriously impact the quality of underwater acoustic communication. The common denoising algorithms are based on Gaussian noise model and are difficult to apply to the coexistence of Gaussian/non-Gaussian impulsive noises. Therefore, a new UWA noise model is described in this paper by combining the symmetric &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -stable (S &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; S) distribution and normal distribution. Furthermore, a novel underwater acoustic signal denoising algorithm called AWMF+GDES is proposed. First, the non-Gaussian impulsive noise is adaptively suppressed by the adaptive window median filter (AWMF). Second, an enhanced wavelet threshold optimization algorithm with a new threshold function is proposed to suppress the Gaussian noise. The optimal threshold parameters are obtained based on good point set and dynamic elite group guidance combined simulated annealing selection artificial bee colony (GDES-ABC) algorithm. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the convergence speed and the convergence precision of the proposed GDES-ABC algorithm can be increased by 25% &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\sim$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 66% and 21% &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\sim$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 73%, respectively, compared with the existing algorithms. Finally, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed underwater acoustic signal denoising algorithm and demonstrate that both the proposed wavelet threshold optimization method based on GDES-ABC and the AWMF+GDES algorithm can obtain higher output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), noise suppression ratio (NSR), and smaller root mean square error (RMSE) compared with the other algorithms.},

First, to guarantee the delay constraints of all UEs, we use the worst-case approach to cast the considered problem to a deterministic optimization problem. Then, for the scenario without inter-beam interference, the product of transmitting and receiving beams and the power allocation scheme for each pair of UEs and TRPs are derived iteratively, where the former is obtained by some relaxation operations under given power allocation policy, and the latter is searched by bisection under given beamwidth selection policy. After that, Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is used to find the joint TRP selection and resource allocation policy. For the scenario with inter-beam interference, coalition game is proposed to solve the considered problem, where UEs form coalitions to select their respective serving TRPs. At each iteration of the coalition game, the beamwidth control and power allocation are performed successively, where the transmitting and receiving beamwidths are solved by particle swarm algorithm under given power allocation policy, and the power allocation strategy is designed by a novel cooperative cost mechanism under given beamwidth selection policy. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided to verify that the proposed schemes achieve better weighted sum energy efficiency than existing schemes.},

The proposed framework is based on realistic communication scenarios as it takes into account the mobility of users and assumes imperfect channel-state information (CSI). In this context, tractable closed-form expressions are derived for the corresponding average sum-rate of NOMA-VLC and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-VLC. It is shown extensively that incurred CSI errors have a considerable impact on the average energy efficiency of both NOMA-VLC and OFDMA-VLC systems. Hence, they should be taken into detailed account in the design of practical systems. We further demonstrate that the average energy efficiency of the hybrid NOMA-VLC-RF system outperforms the NOMA-VLC system under imperfect CSI. Respective computer simulations corroborate the derived analytic results, and interesting theoretical and practical insights are provided, which will be useful in the effective design and deployment of conventional VLC and hybrid VLC-RF systems.},

However, studies in the literature dealing with SIR for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are relatively few. This paper analytically investigates OFDM system performance by including major channel impairments such as excess delay spread, synchronization error, sample timing error, frequency offset, and time-varying fading. We derive a closed-form expression for SIR, accounting for both variations of inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) with the number of subcarriers, and the susceptibility to channel impairments. A condition relating peak ISI to peak ICI is derived. An expression quantifying the impact of synchronization error in ISI is obtained. SIR behavior with respect to the tradeoff among numbers of subcarriers and other system parameters are investigated. A numerical method, as well as a polynomial equation for an analytical solution, is formulated to find the optimal number of subcarriers for a given set of constraints. We demonstrate the variations of SIR with various parameters and analyze the leakage of power (unwanted power distribution across subcarriers).},

  abstract     = {In the fifth-generation (5G) high-speed train (HST) system operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, a much higher Doppler shift occurs. Doppler shift severely degrades reception performance in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless communication systems. The performance of the Doppler shift estimator is directly related to safety in the HST because the 5G HST system is used for train control. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a fast and accurate Doppler shift estimator (DSE) with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning-based DSE (MLDSE). Taking note of the fact that an HST travels the same path repeatedly, the MLDSE estimates the Doppler shift by using the reference signal received power (RSRP) values measured by the mobile receiver at all times. However, since there is a one-to-many mapping problem when the RSRP values reflecting the 5G beam sweeping and selection correspond to Doppler shifts, machine learning cannot be performed. To solve this problem, we design an RSRP ambiguity reducer (AR) for the machine learning input so that the pattern of RSRP values can be mapped and learned into corresponding Doppler shifts. As a result, MLDSE can estimate Doppler shift more accurately than any HST DSEs known to the authors. In addition, an MLDSE consisting of only three layers is superior to the conventional techniques in terms of computational complexity as well as estimation accuracy.},

By sequentially utilizing the mapping relationship between the generalized array manifold, which has the spatial translation invariant relationship, and the signal subspace of TDID source, a closed-form solution of four parameters (central and spread parameters within azimuth and elevation dimension) of every TDID source can be obtained with low computational complexity. Furthermore, by properly using the signal subspace, the estimation accuracy is improved significantly. Numerical simulations illustrate the properties of the proposed method and show that it can simultaneously improve the robustness with respect to the scattering size and uncertainty of the spatial distribution. The proposed method has the potential to be used for fast and accurate multi-TDID source localization with arrays of small aperture and few array elements.},

For vehicle detection in autonomous mine, lack of diversity data on RSU LiDAR limits the application of deep learning based methods. To solve this issue, a voxel-based background filtering module is introduced into 3D object detectors for vehicle detection with RSU LiDAR in mine environments. The proposed background filtering method models average height and the number of points for each voxel as Gaussian distribution to generate a background table. To address the impact of the false negative points of the background filtering module, we also propose a multivariate Gaussian loss to model bounding box uncertainty. The predicted covariances between variates help to learn the relationship between the missed parts and the visible ones. Besides, a background filtering based data augmentation method for vehicle detection is also proposed in this paper. Three RSU LiDAR datasets with different terrains in the BaoLi mine area are used for comprehensive experiment evaluations. Experiments show that the proposed background filtering module and multivariate Gaussian loss can significantly improve the generalization ability and performance of several state-of-the-art 3D detectors on different terrain data. Moreover, most background voxels are filtered out, the inference time of the 3D detectors is about 2× faster. Besides, the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method is also demonstrated.},

The proposed observer checks for the errors in the system model by estimating the system premise variables, and the fuzzy controller then accurately compensates the estimated variables. The method is deduced from the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic model, which is described by a class of IF-THEN fuzzy systems. Fast computation with high precision is what makes them superior to proportional-integral-derivatives controllers. Their capability to deal with nonlinearity in time-varying systems makes them a suitable choice for traction dual rectifier control. The simulation model is formed in SIMULINK, and the waveforms are checked with a conventional fuzzy controller, predictive control, and conventional proportional-integral control. The proposed method can achieve better performance, such as fast transient, more damping, and small overshoot. Furthermore, the method can maintain stability when the system is subjected to external disturbance. In the end, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are performed to validate the proposed control algorithm.},

Unlike most single-wheel independent ABS, this design has more advantages when braking under the unusual road conditions, such as the transition of road conditions, the split-road conditions between the left-side wheels and the right-side wheels, even the extreme situation in which road conditions of each wheel are different, as it has the smooth-braking judgment module that is designed for wheel-to-wheel control. Besides, based on the nonlinear function of the tire-road interaction (TRI) model, the designed road condition detection module provides characteristics of the braking road that are required in the ABS operation. The model of vehicle and tire is established in Simulink by using parameters of a vehicle: BYD F0. The effectiveness of the proposed four-wheel ABS is validated through the combined use of MATLAB and RT-lab and via substantial simulations and RT-LAB co-simulations.},

  abstract     = {Energy management strategy (EMS) plays a vital role in improving the fuel economy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). By virtue of excellent real-time performance, deterministic rule-based (DRB) method is widely introduced into EMS for the control of actual PHEV. However, fixed parameters are usually used as thresholds in traditional DBR control, which makes it difficult for PHEV to achieve excellent fuel economy. To solve this problem, relevant parameters need to be optimized, but the resulting time-consuming and complex process is an obstacle for practical application of this scheme. Nowadays, the emergence of technologies, such as wireless communication, remote monitoring and so on, has gave birth to the concept of cyber-physical system (CPS). It provides an opportunity to optimize parameters of DRB EMS. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a cyber physical energy optimization control design for PHEVs. Among them, DRB control is designed to allocate power tasks for the engine and electric motor (EM), according to state of the charge (SOC) of battery and demand power of vehicle. Moreover, to further improve performance of EMS, an enhanced firework algorithm (EFWA) is firstly proposed to optimize parameters of controller. Compared with original algorithm, a novel selection mechanism for non-CF is introduced in EFWA. It makes the excellent parameters could be obtained in a shorter time, which is more suitable for the complex optimization of EMS. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed EMS is verified and evaluated. The results show that it improves the fuel economy of PHEV by 10% and 12% over that using the unoptimized rule-based EMS, under the China typical urban driving cycle and real-world driving cycle, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Modular Cascade Machines (MCM) system is a multi-machine system for the traction systems of electrified vehicles. Currently, MCM is composed of several machines of the same type, generally, several Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSM). This paper proposes a hybrid MCM system, which is composed of a PMSM and an Induction Machine (IM). This combination aims to fully benefit the properties of different machines. This hybrid MCM is compared with other traction systems, namely, PMSM-based MCM and single PMSM drive. For a fair comparison, the design specifications of all the traction systems are optimally sized by a specific sizing method, which can maximize the system high-efficiency area. Then, different traction systems are designed by Finite Element Method (FEM), in order to have accurate material consumptions and efficiency maps. The comparison study shows that the proposed hybrid MCM is competitive for energy saving. Therefore this new drive saves about 5% of energy in comparison with a single PMSM derive. The hybrid MCM energy saving is very close to the one of a PMSM-based MCM. Moreover, the hybrid MCM system reduces the PM volume (reduced by 53%) while increases the usage amount of winding copper, steel and aluminum, due to the existence of IM. Fortunately, the cost estimation proves that the hybrid MCM (not include inverters) has almost the same cost as the single PMSM. Hence the proposed hybrid MCM is a competitive alternative of the single PMSM than the PMSM-based MCM.},

Due to the difficulty in ensuring a satisfactory tracking performance with respective to a broad range of operation conditions in practice, an adaptive mechanism is further developed to estimate both the lumped uncertainty bound and the sliding mode parameters, such that no prior knowledge of the system is required in the controller leading to the effective improvement of the flexibility and simplicity of sliding mode-based ETV control systems.

  abstract     = {Rapidly-evolving connected vehicle technologies offer growing opportunities to improve the performance of energy management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In this context, a computationally efficient energy management approach based on a model predictive control (MPC) framework is proposed to obtain the optimal torque split and gearshift for a parallel HEV. The velocity is predicted by exploiting the information through V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) communication. The energy management problem is then reformulated by introducing equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) into MPC framework. A penalty index is directly incorporated into the objective function to avoid frequent gearshift activities considering both fuel economy and drivability. To derive an analytical optimal solution, the energy management is further simplified by assuming that the gearshift command keeps constant over each prediction horizon. As a result, the torque split and gearshift are jointly optimized in the same framework. A sensitivity study for different parameters is conducted, and an equivalence factor (EF) adaptation law is also devised for the ECMS-based MPC. Lastly, simulations are performed in standard cycles and three predicted cycles over different prediction horizons, verifying that the ECMS-based MPC produces a promising computational efficiency, relative to traditional dynamic programming (DP)-MPC, while fuel economy globally converges to that produced by DP.},

  abstract     = {Because of the enhanced utilization of dc-link voltage and the low cost of power supply, common dc-link dual-inverter is a desirable drive topology to solve the low power factor problem of open-winding linear permanent-magnet vernier motor (OW-LPMVM). However, the common dc-link structure causes a zero-sequence current (ZSC) in the motor windings, which increases current distortion and thrust ripple of the LPMVM. To effectively decrease the ZSC as well as thrust ripple, this paper proposes a three-vector-based model predictive current control (TV-MPCC) scheme. In the proposed TV-MPCC, one optimal vector produced by one of the dual-inverter is obtained based on the deadbeat current control principle, which simplifies the prediction process and reduce the switching frequency. On the other hand, the other two optimal vectors produced by another of the dual-inverter are obtained by means of a cost function cascade evaluation, which improves the steady-state performance. With the proposed scheme, the ZSC is effectively suppressed with the simple implementation, enhanced thrust performance, fast transient response, good robustness against parameter variations, and reduced switching frequency compared with the existing ZSC suppression methods. Simulation and experimental results are demonstrated for confirming the proposed TV-MPCC.},

This study proposes a new SoC estimator using an online parameter identification method in conjunction with a classification technique. This study investigates a new prototype Li-S cell. Experimental characterization tests are conducted under various conditions; the duty cycle - intended to represent a real-world application - is based on an electric city bus. The characterization results are then used to parameterize an equivalent-circuit-network (ECN) model, which is then used to relate real-time parameter estimates derived using a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm to state of charge using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to estimate an approximate SoC range. The estimate is used together with a conventional coulomb-counting technique to achieve continuous SoC estimation in real-time. It is shown that this method can provide an acceptable level of accuracy with less than 3% error under realistic driving conditions.},

It is structurally possible to implement by using an electric machine operating as a generator and an energy accumulation system. In addition to the widely used lithium-ion energy storage systems, nickel-metal hydride energy accumulation solutions are also an alternative. Battery systems are characterized by specific electrical parameters which include, among others: electrical capacity, open circuit voltage (cells), discharge/charge current, battery state of charge or power of the energy storage system. The article was aimed at determining these parameters of the nickel-metal hydride energy storage system. The actual characteristics of the above-mentioned electric battery indicators were obtained through the measurements carried out during road and bench tests with the use of research apparatus and research object (Toyota Prius the third generation). The tests showed that the battery voltage varied slightly from 203.42 ... 203.98 V (cell voltage -14.49 ... 14.57 V, link voltage -1.211 ... 1.214 V). On the other hand, the values of the charge/discharge current were in a wide range (-87.57 ... 132.74 A) and depended on road conditions. This parameter was largely dependent on the torque balance of electric machines (generator, electric motor), but it also had an impact on the battery state of charge and power. To determine the parameters, an electric model of the Three RC Network Model, powered from an open-circuit voltage source and consisted of three resistors and three capacitors, was used. This electric model was characterized by high accuracy (up to 2.93%) and described the behavior of the nickel-metal hydride system of energy accumulation in real conditions in a good way.},

To this end, a dynamic EF self-determining algorithm is designed according to the assumption that the electrical energy used at the current moment comes from past recuperation and charging, and an adaptive charge-sustaining algorithm is developed to balance the electrical self-sustainability and optimization performance. To show its effectiveness, the SECMS is implemented to a single-shaft parallel HEV over four standard driving cycles and benchmarked against two conventional ECMS-type control strategies: standard ECMS and adaptive ECMS (AECMS). The results show that the SECMS can achieve significant improvements regarding both the fuel economy and battery charge-sustainability compared to ECMS and AECMS.

  abstract     = {A recently growing literature discusses the topics of direct yaw moment control based on model predictive control (MPC), and energy-efficient torque-vectoring (TV) for electric vehicles with multiple powertrains. To reduce energy consumption, the available TV studies focus on the control allocation layer, which calculates the individual wheel torque levels to generate the total reference longitudinal force and direct yaw moment, specified by higher level algorithms to provide the desired longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. In fact, with a system of redundant actuators, the vehicle-level objectives can be achieved by distributing the individual control actions to minimize an optimality criterion, e.g., based on the reduction of different power loss contributions. However, preliminary simulation and experimental studies - not using MPC - show that further important energy savings are possible through the appropriate design of the reference yaw rate. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) implementation for energy-efficient TV, which is based on the concurrent optimization of the reference yaw rate and wheel torque allocation. The NMPC cost function weights are varied through a fuzzy logic algorithm to adaptively prioritize vehicle dynamics or energy efficiency, depending on the driving conditions. The results show that the adaptive NMPC configuration allows stable cornering performance with lower energy consumption than a benchmarking fuzzy logic TV controller using an energy-efficient control allocation layer.},

The misidentification of infrequent faults could lead to unpredictable consequences for the vehicle&#39;s safety. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting unexpected faults of high-speed train bogie based on Bayesian deep learning. First, a Monte Carlo-Based perturbation is imposed on input samples, which can magnify the difference between unexpected faults and known ones. Then, through dropout-based Bayesian deep learning, the diagnosis result can be obtained as well as a Bayesian indicator of whether the anomalies belong to known classes. The proposed method can capture the uncertainty of model outputs and identify unexpected faults, requiring only a few samples of unexpected anomalies for calibration. Also, it is compatible with most existing neural network structures. The experiments compare the proposed method with existing methods on two real-world applications, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.},

Due to the complex ocean environment, the unmanned marine vehicles are modeled as the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system with unknown membership functions. When the membership functions are not available, traditional sliding mode control technique becomes infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, a novel quantized sliding mode control strategy based on switching mechanism is designed to compensate for thruster faults effects. In addition, the phenomenon of time-varying delay leads to conservativeness of the existing dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy. Then a larger quantization parameter adjustment range, by taking time delay and fault factor into account, is given. Combining the novel sliding mode controller design and the improved dynamic quantization parameter adjustment strategy, the dynamic positioning of unmanned marine vehicles with thruster faults and quantization can be maintained. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through the simulation comparison results.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative on-ramp merging control for connected and automated vehicles have been widely studied in recent years. One of the major challenges for this multi-vehicle coordination problem is to execute a safe and efficient merging process considering realistic uncertainties in vehicle dynamics. This paper puts forward a two-layer merging control framework made up of centralized sequencing and distributed control. A Roadside Agent installed in the merging area identifies the merging sequence of vehicles approaching the merging area in terms of their estimated time of arrival at the merging point. Once the sequence is determined, distributed controllers will guide the vehicles to execute the merging process. The controller is designed based on Udwadia-Kalaba approach and Lyapunov stability theory and is capable of handling nonlinear vehicle dynamics and time-varying uncertainty. It renders both uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness performance for the spacing error and thus executes the merging process effectively. Simulations results verify the superiority of the proposed control method compared with baselines methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated under different traffic demands and multiple-vehicle-pack merging situation.},

In addition to foreground location, scale information is also introduced to improve the regression performance.

On the one hand, it analyzes and determines the motivations that cause the driving state to change for decision-making and planning. On the other hand, on the basis of the lateral trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles, the longitudinal trajectory propensity prediction of different drivers is added to construct a risk assessment model that can reflect risk of the future time domain. Based on this, the motivation-based decision method is mapped into the risk assessment model, and a cost function is established to decouple the path and speed, so that the geometry and speed can be flexibly adjusted according to environmental risks. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively make driving behavior decisions and plan the trajectory in real time according to the current environment, which can improve the computational efficiency of the decision-making process and guarantee the safety at the same time.},

To compromise between these conflicting objectives, the proposed system encompasses two subsystems that work in harmony, namely; the Travel-Time System-Optimum Navigation (TTSON) and the Vehicle Departure Control (VDC). The IoT-VCM uses different network sensory devices (connected vehicles and smartphones) to collect network information that is fused to compute the current road state conditions, based on which, the VDC determines the allowable vehicle departure rates, and the TTSON optimizes their navigation. The proposed system is developed in a microscopic traffic simulator and tested on a calibrated simulated real network.

To enhance its robustness against disturbances and solve the contradiction between response time and overshoot, a novel sliding mode control strategy based on disturbance observer (DOB-SMC) was proposed for a TPMM velocity drive system. The novelty of the proposed velocity control strategy lies in the incorporation of the mismatch disturbance observer in the sliding surface and the sliding mode control (SMC) law, and the introduction of internal model control (IMC) into the SMC law. The velocity control system is transformed to a first-order inertia model by IMC, thus the dynamic response performance is improved. The mismatched disturbances are estimated and the equivalent control voltage is employed, and then the effect of mismatched and matched disturbances can be restrained with little chattering. The simulated and experimental results are presented as validation for the proposed strategy.},

To ensure the real-time performance of MPC, the coupling relationships in the control output and the longitudinal/lateral motions are well decoupled, in this way a linear integrated model is utilized as the internal model of the controller. Then, the holistic MPC is proposed to acquire the steering angle and the force on each corner. Based on the advantages of the proposed structure, a weight adaptive mechanism is introduced to improve the handling ability of the controller to various driving conditions, especially some extreme conditions. For the uncertainties in tire cornering stiffness, a multiple-model adaptive law is designed with its convergence proved by Lyapunov theory.

It monitors the shuttle, wireless charger, renewable energy generation, and other loads and regulates charging behavior for demand charge mitigation. Within the control algorithm, an energy prediction is made to estimate the mobility needs of the vehicle and maintain uninterrupted service during operation while still minimizing peak demand. The proposed controller is designed and optimized using a Simulink model for the entire system. It is then implemented and tested in real time at the NREL campus using online cloud services. Two vehicle-use cases-charge-sustaining and charge-depletion operation-are tested under different campus power profiles and drive cycles to assess the controller&#39;s performance. The proposed controller showed a robust performance under different driving scenarios, with high correlation between simulation and experimental data. The results show that proper demand response can be achieved, with an average of 94% reduction of charging loads during peak demand events.},

Contrary to current PBFT implementations that only provide a single point of entry to the ordering service, we allow each ordering node to act as an entry point that proposes and conducts the consensus process of including new record in the distributed ledger. To ensure atomicity of record insertion in distributed ledger, we have developed a bandwidth reservation protocol that uses a modification of CSMA/CA protocol to regulate access to the broadcast medium formed by the P2P network of TCP connections between orderers. We have modeled record insertion service time in a cluster where ordering nodes have random position within Cartesian coordinate system. We have also modeled total request access time to the ledger which includes waiting time in the orderer&#39;s queue and record insertion time. These models are used to evaluate system performance under variable request rate ordering service, variable number of nodes and variable physical cluster dimensions. Our results show the interaction between decreased request waiting time in orderer&#39;s queue and increased contention among orderers when the number of orderers increases for the given total request arrival rate. This interaction is also investigated for two different physical cluster sizes which affect record insertion time. The interplay of request rate, number of orderers and physical cluster size determines system capacity expressed in total request rate. Our model can be used to make the trade-off between the required system capacity, number of orderers, and physical cluster dimensions under constraints on Byzantine fault rate.},

In this paper, we investigate the homogeneous and constant-time-headway-spacing-policy-based vehicle platoon longitudinal control problem, where communication impairments including the limited communication range, random packet losses, and time-varying communication delays are considered. Here, internal stability characterizes the system stability without disturbance while string stability is concerned with the error amplification when the vehicle platoon is affected by external disturbances. First, for the case when each vehicle utilizes the position, velocity, and acceleration information of multiple preceding and following vehicles, we obtain sufficient conditions to guarantee the internal stability of the vehicle platoon system based on the stability of matrix polynomials and the matrix eigenvalue perturbation theory. Then, considering random packet losses, we find that the effectiveness of platoon control relies on the frequency of packets being successfully received, or the delay till a new packet is received. We also obtain the upper bound for delays on all communication links such that the internal stability of the vehicle platoon can still be maintained when time-varying communication delays are within the bound. The L2-string stability is also analyzed through the transfer function for both ideal communication cases, and cases with uniform and constant delays. Extensive simulink-based numerical results validate our analysis, which reveals how communication impairments affect platoon control with a realistic information flow topology.},
