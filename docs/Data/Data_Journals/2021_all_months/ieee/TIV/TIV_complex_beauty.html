In order to estimate the pose information of moving vehicles accurately, 3D-LiDAR is widely used for accurate distance data. This paper proposed a real-time tracking algorithm based on L-Shape fitting. The algorithm detects the corners of moving vehicles and uses RANSAC to take a limited amount of noisy data. In addition, a vehicle tracking system with multi-weight Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filtering (RBPF) is built upon the orientation estimation given by L-Shape fitting. The proposed algorithm is validated on the KITTI dataset and a manually labeled dataset acquired from an autonomous vehicle at Carnegie Mellon University. Furthermore, the proposed solution is implemented in an autonomous vehicle at Tongji University. The experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves real-time performance, mitigates the effect of noisy data and improves estimation accuracy.},

It is difficult to handle these constraints uniformly within a trajectory planning framework. To overcome this limitation, a novel trajectory planning framework is proposed in this paper. Different from many existing studies which characterized the spatial positions of vehicles at the sampling time points as decision variables, we characterize the time points at the sampling spatial positions as decision variables to conveniently address the terrain constraints. Based on such a formulation, we further consider the kinematic constraints, engine power constraints and time window constraints. Various objectives (e.g., transport efficiency, fuel economy) can be considered in this trajectory planning framework, and the formulated trajectory planning problems can be efficiently solved. Finally, several case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework.},

While stationary plug-in methods have been the traditional approach to satisfying this demand, in-motion charging technologies have the potential to eliminate the inconvenience of long charging wait times and the high cost of large batteries. In this research, an agent-based model is developed to simulate vehicle charging demand and then validated against real traffic data. Driver behavior is estimated from travel survey data, and a method is introduced to estimate route-planning decisions in the presence of multiple charging options. The model is technology agnostic, allowing for its application to any kind of in-motion charging technology (i.e., inductive, conductive, and capacitive). A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the location of roadways with dynamic charging capabilities in the presence of the existing charging infrastructure. Both major highways and arterial roads were considered as potential candidates for dynamic charger installation. Results are presented for a case study in Salt Lake County, Utah.},

These models are instances of two larger model categories, distinguished by whether expert knowledge is explicitly crafted into the state representation (and thus is interpretable) or whether the representation is learned from data, respectively. Both have shown state-of-the-art performance in previous work. In order to provide a fair comparison, we ensure that both models are treated similarly with respect to the use of context cues and parameter estimation. Specifically, we describe (1) how to integrate the context cues (used previously by the DBN) into the RNN, and (2) how to optimize the DBN with back-propagation similar to the RNN, while keeping an interpretable state representation. Experiments are performed on a scenario where a cyclist might turn left at an intersection in front of the ego-vehicle. Results show that the RNN successfully leverages the context cues, and that optimizing the DBN improves its performance with respect to existing work. While the RNN outperforms the optimized DBN in predictive log-likelihood by a significant margin, both models attain similar average Euclidean distance errors (23–39 cm for DBN and 31–34 cm for RNN, predicting 1 s ahead).},

  abstract     = {An adequate charging infrastructure advocates to ameliorate the range anxiety to propel the disparaged electric vehicle (EV) market. But, the high initial installation cost, requirement of suitable places and the anticipated immense load on the grid during peak times hinder to elongate the charging station network, especially in urban areas. Fortunately, the bidirectional energy transferring capability between vehicles (i.e., V2V) may act as an auxiliary solution to charge an EV at any place and at any time without leaning on a stationary charging infrastructure. In this work, we assume a market where charging providers each has a number of charging trucks equipped with a larger battery and a fast charger to charge a number of EVs at some particular parking lots. A provider intends to maximize the served number of EVs using its limited number of charging trucks, when an EV should be considered as served only if it would be fully charged during its declared charging window. All charging requests are assumed to be received by an agent which provisions a route and schedule for each charging truck and all trucks should return to the depot after serving EVs. We formulate this combinatorially hard problem as an integer linear program (ILP) to maximize the number of served EVs by determining the optimal trajectory of each truck. Owing to its complexity, we present a solution methodology by decomposing the problem using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition approach; we divide the problem into one master problem and a set of pricing problems (one for each EV) and achieve the solution iteratively. Though the solution achieved from the decomposition might not be optimal, it is faster to be applicable in practice. We also compare the performance with two heuristic algorithms and report on the collected results.},

This study proposes a data-driven motion planning method capable of minimizing injury severity for vehicle occupants in unavoidable collisions. The method is based on establishing a metric that models the relationship between impact location and injury severity using real accident data, and subsequently including it in the cost function of a motion planning framework. The vehicle dynamics and associated constraints are considered through a precomputed trajectory library, which is generated by solving an optimal control problem. This allows for efficient computation as well as an accurate representation of the vehicle. The proposed motion planning approach is evaluated by simulation, and it is shown that the trajectory associated with the minimum cost mitigates the collision severity for occupants of passenger vehicles involved in the collision.},

  abstract     = {The design of cooperative adaptive cruise control is critical in mixed traffic flow, where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Compared with pure CAVs, the major challenge is how to handle the prediction uncertainty of HDVs, which can cause significant state deviation of CAVs from planned trajectories. In most existing studies, model predictive control (MPC) is utilized to replan CAVs’ trajectories to mitigate the deviation at each time step. However, as the replanning process is usually conducted by solving an optimization problem with information through inter-vehicular communication, MPC methods suffer from heavy computational and communicational burdens. To address this limitation, a robust platoon control framework is proposed based on tube MPC in this paper. The prediction uncertainty is dynamically mitigated by the feedback control and restricted inside a set with a high probability. When the uncertainty exceeds the set or additional external disturbance emerges, the feedforward control is triggered to plan a “tube” (a sequence of sets), which can bound CAVs’ actual trajectories. As the replanning process is usually not required, the proposed method is much more efficient regarding computation and communication, compared with the MPC method. Comprehensive simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Among various aspects that need to be thoughtfully considered for driving safety, vehicle stability is one of the most fundamental and important factors. In this paper, to describe a guaranteed vehicle stability control problem, a new time-varying control-dependent invariant set is introduced. Correspondingly, the concept of a time-varying control-dependent barrier function (CDBF) is proposed. The proposed time-varying CDBF is more general than conventional control barrier functions (CBF), since we additionally consider invariant sets that can be time-varying and control-dependent, which will have broader applications. Then, using the proposed framework, we design a vehicle stability control algorithm, which guarantees that the vehicle states are always kept in the time-varying and control-dependent lateral stability regions. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed theory and control method are verified and discussed through illustrative simulation results of high-speed J-turn and double lane change maneuvers for an AGV.},

The multiple-view image is created by blending left and right images from a stereo camera. This blended image can implicitly encode the appearance and view disparity of an object in a single image, which provides clues for detection and disparity estimation. Since a single object may have multiple overlaid correspondence in a blended image, the detection task is formulated as finding a group of associated bounding boxes with similar appearances. The distances between the associated bounding boxes can be used to estimate the disparity of the object. The proposed method has following benefits: 1) The detection and disparity estimation tasks can be accomplished using a single input image; 2) Even the task is more complex than the popular detection task, the increase in computation cost is negligible; 3) Very competitive detection and disparity estimation accuracy is obtained, even the detection is performed on the blended image which is unfriendly to human vision.

Because of the performance degeneration of cameras and lidars under inclement weather conditions, robust autonomy must rely on radar sensors to perform target detection and classification. Unlike basic target classifier methods in literature that make use of target velocity, the proposed approach is far more comprehensive and can be applied to targets with zero-Doppler. Depending on the radar type and target range, this paper presents four target classification models based on four different types of radar data: statistical RCS, distributed (time-domain) RCS, range-azimuth angle radar images and 3D radar images. The classification models are implemented by machine learning approaches artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with a comprehensive simulated dataset. Good classification accuracies are demonstrated, and the proposed model is validated with measured data. Different radar target classification approaches are compared, which clearly reveals the trade-off between classification performance and system complexity. The proposed radar target classification methods can be applied effectively to both static and dynamic targets, at near or far ranges, using traditional or imaging radars, resulting in improved safety for autonomous vehicles in a wide variety of complex environments.},

Researchers participating in these competitions hope to subsequently transfer their developed functionality to passenger vehicles, in order to improve self-driving technology for reasons of safety, and due to environmental and social benefits. The race track has the advantage of being a safe environment where challenging situations for the algorithms are permanently created. To achieve minimum lap times on the race track, it is important to gather and process information about external influences including, e.g., the position of other cars and the friction potential between the road and the tires. Furthermore, the predicted behavior of the ego-car&#39;s propulsion system is crucial for leveraging the available energy as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we therefore present an optimization-based velocity planner, mathematically formulated as a multi-parametric Sequential Quadratic Problem (mpSQP). This planner can handle a spatially and temporally varying friction coefficient, and transfer a race Energy Strategy (ES) to the road. It further handles the velocity-profile-generation task for performance and emergency trajectories in real time on the vehicle&#39;s Electronic Control Unit (ECU).},

  abstract     = {A pre-crash detection and warning system in a host vehicle needs to accurately determine the position of each remote vehicle in its vicinity and the context of the driving environment. ADAS (Advanced driver-assistance systems) have extensively used camera radar and LIDAR for automatic detection of vehicles, pedestrians and other road users and their behaviors. However, these vehicle-resident sensors have short operation ranges and require objects to be within the line-of-sight. V2V communication has emerged to be a promising technology to augment vehicle-resident sensors with extended ability of an overall vehicle safety system by addressing a broader range of crash scenarios with improved warning timing. In this paper we present an intelligent system, Geo+NN, developed using the synergy of neural network and geometric modeling. We extract the key geometric features using an analytic geometric model and use them as input to a neural network that is trained on real-world V2V signals to detect and predict remote vehicles’ positions. Geo+NN system is evaluated on V2V communication data recorded during real-world driving trips by vehicles installed with DSRC devices. Experimental results show that Geo+NN has the capabilities of effectively detecting and predicting remote vehicles within the context of 8 different positions.},

  abstract     = {Haptic guidance in a shared steering assistance system has drawn significant attention in intelligent vehicle fields, owing to its mutual communication ability for vehicle control. By exerting continuous torque on the steering wheel, both the driver and support system can share lateral control of the vehicle. However, current haptic guidance steering systems demonstrate some deficiencies in assisting lane changing. This study explored a new steering interaction method, including the design and evaluation of an intention-based haptic shared steering system. Such an intention-based method can support both lane keeping and lane changing assistance, by detecting a driver&#39;s lane change intention. By using a deep learning-based method to model a driver&#39;s decision timing regarding lane crossing, an adaptive gain control method was proposed for realizing a steering control system. An intention consistency method was proposed to detect whether the driver and the system were acting towards the same target trajectories and to accurately capture the driver&#39;s intention. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to test the system performance. Participants were required to perform six trials with assistive methods and one trial without assistance. The results demonstrated that the supporting system decreased the lane departure risk in the lane keeping tasks and could support a fast and stable lane changing maneuver.},

Time efficiency and safety are of key importance and here a two-step procedure is proposed. First, a convex optimization problem is solved, formulated as a support vector machine (SVM), in order to represent the surrounding environment of the ego vehicle and classify the search space as obstacles or obstacle free. This gives a reduced complexity search space and an A* algorithm is used in a state space lattice in 4 dimensions including position, heading angle and velocity for simultaneous path and velocity planning. Further, a heuristic derived from the SVM formulation is used in the A* search and a pruning technique is introduced to significantly improve search efficiency. Solutions from the proposed planner is compared to optimal solutions computed using optimal control techniques. Three traffic scenarios, a roundabout scenario and two complex takeover maneuvers, with multiple moving obstacles, are used to illustrate the general applicability of the proposed method.},

To do so, fully automated autonomous vehicles often adopt motion planners to ensure collision-free and comfortable trajectories. In contrast, in cooperative driving, feedback control is often used to achieve string-stable vehicle-following at very short inter-vehicle distances. In this work, the gap between cooperative vehicle following and trajectory planning is bridged, by using a trajectory planner to generate cooperative trajectories, such that the versatility of an autonomous vehicle is retained, but cooperation is included. The presented method uses B-splines to generate cooperative trajectories. Simulations are used to demonstrate that even under large communication delays, string stable behaviour can be achieved. The use of parametrized trajectories in the form of B-splines ensures only a small number of parameters needs to be communicated between vehicles.},

In this paper, we propose a novel lane detection system, called Scene Understanding Physics-Enhanced Real-time (SUPER) algorithm. The proposed method consists of two main modules: 1) a hierarchical semantic segmentation network as the scene feature extractor and 2) a physics enhanced multi-lane parameter optimization module for lane inference. We train the proposed system using heterogeneous data from Cityscapes, Vistas and Apollo, and evaluate the performance on four completely separate datasets (that were never seen before), including Tusimple, Caltech, URBAN KITTI-ROAD, and Mcity-3000. The proposed approach performs the same or better than lane detection models already trained on the same dataset, and performs well even on datasets that was never trained on. Real-world vehicle tests were also conducted. Preliminary test results show promising real-time lane-detection performance compared with the Mobileye.},

Our tool features three optimization configurations, namely using error terms for a minimal number of sensor pairs, or using terms for all sensor pairs in combination with loop closure constraints, or by adding terms for structure estimation in a probabilistic model. Apart from relative calibration where relative transformations between sensors are computed, our work also addresses absolute calibration that includes calibration with respect to the mobile robot&#39;s body. Two methods are compared to estimate the body reference frame using an external laser scanner, one based on markers and the other based on manual annotation of the laser scan. In the experiments, we evaluate the three configurations for relative calibration. Our results show that using terms for all sensor pairs is most robust, especially for lidar to radar, when minimum five board locations are used. For absolute calibration the median rotation error around the vertical axis reduces from 1 ° before calibration, to 0.33 ° using the markers and 0.02 ° with manual annotations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a method to dynamically harmonize the behaviors of cyclic vehicular platoons in a closed road network. Different from the open-chain counterpart, a cyclic platoon formulates a traffic flow ring constrained by interconnection coupling feature and finite-length geometry, which brings challenges for platoon control design and analysis. First, by exploiting the circulant structure of homogeneous cyclic platoons, the closed-loop dynamics is decomposed into a set of decoupled systems with the same low dimension as a single vehicle. Based on this decomposition, an analytical necessary and sufficient stability condition is derived for the design of distributed feedback controllers. This necessary and sufficient condition is further relaxed into sufficient conditions to remove the dependence on the platoon size. Next, the string stability is proved with the sufficient conditions derived above based on frequency-domain analysis. Then, based on integral sliding mode control, we prove that heterogeneous vehicles can behave like homogeneous ones so that the results on homogeneous cyclic platoons can be extended to heterogeneous cyclic platoons. Finally, the equilibrium velocity and spacing errors are derived to explain the effect of geometry conditions on the steady-state behavior. Numerical simulations using both linear and nonlinear vehicle models are conducted to validate our findings.},

The effectiveness of each model for trajectory planning is evaluated by testing the trajectories on an automated vehicle across friction conditions ranging from ice to dry asphalt. Comparisons between the outright performance of the car and the car&#39;s ability to track the optimal trajectory are made across the various models. The tests reveal that the advantage of more complex models is less that they better predict the vehicle&#39;s behavior, but that they provide a more nuanced view of the vehicle&#39;s limits and guidance on the proper coordination of the various actuators on the vehicle in order to make most efficient use of the available tire friction.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have been an effective solution for improved vehicle fuel efficiency and reduced emission pollution. However, the optimization design for HEVs is complicated due to the presence of nonlinear dynamics and complicated integration of the HEV systems. Moreover, there is a trade-off between fuel optimization and emission reduction. In this paper, a co-optimization scheme is proposed to optimize fuel efficiency for HEVs. The proposed optimization scheme uses obtainable future speed prediction as the basis to optimally tune control parameters for the existing powertrain control system. Moreover, the ramp-up time of the catalyst temperature to reach its light-off level in the exhaust emission system is also considered as an additional optimization constraint to reduce emission. At first, the Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model which is an integrated model for a powertrain and exhaust emission system is validated using real data from a number of real driving cycle scenarios. Then, to simplify the formulation of the proposed algorithm, the model employed for the optimization for both powertrain and exhaust emission systems is represented by a set of equivalent neural network (NN) models, which are learned using the data generated from the well-validated Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model. Using the NN model, a co-optimization algorithm is established that provides an optimal tuning of some fuel-sensitive powertrain control parameters using future speed prediction, leading to a novel co-optimization algorithm, achieving on average a further 9.22% fuel savings for the Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-Pedestrian communication can extend crash prevention capabilities of the current driver assistance systems in vehicles. This requires vehicles and pedestrians to exchange safety messages with each other. However, as the number of pedestrians increases, the numerous safety messages transmitted by pedestrians can quickly congest the network. This can severely affect Vehicle-to-Pedestrian and Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication. Hence, a mechanism for the mitigation of network congestion caused by pedestrian safety messages is required. This article proposes a Multi-channel Clustering-based Congestion Control (MC-COCO4V2P) algorithm, a proactive and infrastructure-independent clustering-based approach to mitigate the network congestion caused by pedestrians. Our approach clusters pedestrians based on their location and direction and uses separate channels for exchanging cluster and safety messages, thereby reducing the control information overhead. It also employs a transmit power control mechanism to make the clustering mechanism energy efficient. Our results show that the clustering of pedestrians can significantly improve network performance and reduce the power consumption of pedestrians&#39; devices.},

An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) based model predictive control (MPC) method is developed to solve the planning and tracking problem. With the PMPCS, the total computational burden can be reduced sharply because of the seamless connection and mutual promotion between the optimization of two layers. Besides we also propose a novel planning algorithm, which can take traffic lights and overtaking time constraint into account. To solve these problems, we first combine model predictive control with artificial potential field (APF) to get a collision-free path by treating the time-varying safety constraints as the scope of the repulsive force and an asymmetrical lane potential field function. Furthermore, the pseudo velocity planning method is adopted to take traffic lights into account in the planning module. Simulation results show the reliability of the proposed algorithm and the advantages of the scheme compared with general hierarchical algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Modeling and predicting human-driven vehicle behaviors are critically important for the planning and control of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic which includes both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Despite the tremendous efforts on this problem, the traditional general driver model-based approaches are subject to prediction accuracy issues and the state-of-the-art data-driven heuristic approaches are subject to scalability issues. To this end, this paper proposes a novel inverse model predictive control (IMPC) based approach to address these issues. The approach can learn the internal control process of human drivers through the automatic learning of their cost functions in a novel IMPC setup, which could result in improvements in both the accuracy and scalability. The approach was implemented and validated with realistic human driver studies. The experiments illustrated that the proposed approach could achieve a better accuracy and a better scalability for unseen scenarios compared to existing approaches.},

This restrains from augmenting platooning protocols with synchronized merging maneuvers, where cyclic communication is needed and creates algebraic loops that require well posedness of the inputs. We propose an adaptive protocol for synchronized merging in the cyclic communication scenario. The protocol exploits a set of adaptive control strategies, designed to cope with uncertain driveline time constants. Well-posedness of the control inputs is proven in a distributed way (using information from neighboring vehicles) in spite of uncertainty and cyclic communication.

  abstract     = {Object detectors are central to autonomous driving and are widely used in driver assistance systems. Object detectors are trained on a finite amount of data within a specific domain, hampering detection performance when applying object detectors to samples from other domains during inference, an effect known as domain gap. Domain gap is a concern for data-driven applications, evoking repetitive retraining of networks when the applications unfold into other domains. With object detectors that have been trained on day images only, a domain gap can be observed in object detection by night. Training object detectors on night images is critical because of the enormous effort required to generate an adequate amount of diversely labeled data, and existing data sets often tend to overfit specific domain characteristics. For the first time, this work proposes adapting domains by online image-to-image translation to expand an object detector&#39;s domain of operation. The domain gap is decreased without additional labeling effort and without having to retrain the object detector while unfolding into the target domain. The approach follows the concept of domain adaptation, shifting the target domain samples into the domain knownto the object detector (source domain). Firstly, the UNIT network is trained for domain adaptation and subsequently cast into an online domain adaptation module, which narrows down the domain gap. Domain adaptation capabilities are evaluated qualitatively by displaying translated samples and visualizing the domain shift through the 2D tSNE algorithm. We quantitatively benchmark the domain adaptation&#39;s influence on a state-of-the-art object detector, and on a retrained object detector, for mean average precision, mean recall, and the resulting F1-score. Our approach achieves an F1 score improvement of 5.27 % within object detection by night when applying online domain adaptation. The evaluation is executed on the BDD100K benchmark data set.},

More challengingly, it is assumed that the linear and angular velocities are unavailable. The proposed scheme includes a fault detection (FD) unit, a fault isolation (FI) unit and an FTC unit. The FD is performed by an adaptive interval observer (IO), where adaptive parameters instead of uncertainty bounds are used. The adaptive parameters change automatically until the interval widths between outputs and their upper/lower bounds reach a given range which is independent of uncertainty bounds. Hence the proposed FD scheme not only provides tighter upper and lower bound estimates of states, but also is more sensitive to faults. The FI unit which consists of a set of IOs determines the location of actuator fault. The FTC unit is developed to guarantee that the tracking errors satisfy the desired transient performance, where the unmeasurable states are expressed as a linear combination of their upper and lower bounds, provided by the FD and FI observers, and no additional state observers are needed to estimate unmeasurable states. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

To advance the active safety of vehicles, a cooperative control framework is proposed for human driver and the active rear steering system (ARS). Human driver model is established considering different driving characteristics to simulate different drivers. Moreover, vehicle-road model is built for ARS controller design. Then, the performance indexes of active safety, i.e., lateral stability, handling performance, rollover prevention and path tracking performance, are defined. Meanwhile, constraints for ARS controller design are proposed. Furthermore, linear-time-varying (LTV) model predictive control (MPC) is applied to ARS controller design with the consideration of multi-constraints. To evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the cooperative control framework, three maneuvers on the low adhesion road are conducted based on the co-simulation platform of CarSim and Simulink. Testing results indicate that the cooperative control framework can assist human driver to enhance vehicle&#39;s active safety. With the application of ARS control, the performance indexes of active safety are reduced more than 50%. In addition, it also shows that the ARS system has good adaptability and effectiveness to deal with different driving characteristics.},

As expected, the deepening impacts the processing times for inferences in tasks like object classification and localization. This demands solutions for balancing computational resource requirements and extend the versatility of a given model to suit a variety of applications. Often the solutions rely on architectural modifications to ease training times while achieving more accurate results. In this work, we propose a multistage algorithm with an initial stage adopting the YOLOv3 network for object detection and HART approach for object tracking. This is followed by an adaptive post-localization stage shift system taking into consideration the processing times of stage inferences, which are the number of located objects in image sequences. The goal is to change the localization strategy to achieve optimal processing time performance. For evaluation, we present results in terms of precision and processing times in varying traffic conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive multistage model in comparison to other real-time state-of-the-art detection strategies, as it achieves a frame rate gain of 49% over YOLOv3 while maintaining competitive task accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress in radar development enable high-resolution radar sensors to resolve multiple detections for an extended object. One of the main challenges in radar-based object detection and tracking is the handling of an uncertain measurement model problem dealing with wandering dominant scatter points on the extended object surface depending on the relative orientation and motion. This phenomenon needs to be considered for near extended object tracking in critical driving situations, e.g., for safety applications, which require fast and accurate target state estimation in high dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a method to detect rotating wheels of approaching targets. Using the position and velocity of detected wheels as input for a tracking procedure, instead of target detections, relaxes the uncertain measurement model problem. A generic radar signal processing method to detect the position and bulk velocities of rotating wheels for approaching target vehicles is presented. The method evaluates the micro-Doppler signals, generated by rotating wheels, of close targets. These wheel hypotheses serve as input for a subsequent sequential Monte Carlo tracking framework. The presented methods are evaluated on real experimental data where a target vehicle is used to reconstruct safety-critical dynamic evading maneuvers.},

Apart from GPS values, the model is further assisted by yaw rate data (converted to a lane change indicator signal) and visual cues in the form of the left and right lane marking types (dashed, solid, etc.). Having defined expressions for the HMM emission and transition probabilities, we evaluate our model to demonstrate that it achieves 95.1% recall and 3.3% median path length error for motorway trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Traditional methods for autonomous driving are implemented with many building blocks from perception, planning and control, making them difficult to generalize to varied scenarios due to complex assumptions and interdependencies. Recently, the end-to-end driving method has emerged, which performs well and generalizes to new environments by directly learning from expert-provided data. However, many existing methods on this topic neglect to check the confidence of the driving actions and the ability to recover from driving mistakes. In this paper, we develop an uncertainty-aware end-to-end trajectory generation method based on imitation learning. It can extract spatiotemporal features from the front-view camera images for scene understanding, and then generate collision-free trajectories several seconds into the future. The experimental results suggest that under various weather and lighting conditions, our network can reliably generate trajectories in different urban environments, such as turning at intersections and slowing down for collision avoidance. Furthermore, closed-loop driving tests suggest that the proposed method achieves better cross-scene/platform driving results than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end control method, where our model can recover from off-center and off-orientation errors and capture 80% of dangerous cases with high uncertainty estimations.},

  abstract     = {Lateral control of an autonomous and connected vehicle (ACV), especially in emergency situations, is important from the safety viewpoint. In these situations, the trajectory to be followed by an ACV must either be planned in real-time (e.g., for a possible evasion maneuver if the obstacle to be avoided is detected) or be communicated from its preceding vehicle. Typically, the trajectory information is available to the following ACV in the form of GPS time samples. From the viewpoint of lateral control, the lateral velocity information is not readily available and the feedback structure must reflect this reality. In this paper, we develop a methodology to synthesize a lateral control algorithm for a following ACV in a two-vehicle platoon in two steps: 1) From the limited preview information of the trajectory to be tracked via samples of GPS way points, we estimate the radius of curvature of the trajectory using “least-square” estimation and 2) develop a fixed-structure feedback control scheme for following the predecessor by synthesizing the set of stabilizing gains corresponding to lateral position error, heading error and heading rate error.

  abstract     = {A tractor-trailer system is an underactuated system that is subject to nonholonomic constraints and exhibits extremely nonlinear behaviors. Its trajectory planning and control issues remain widely researched. In this paper, on the basis of establishing a precise kinematic model, a novel method is proposed to realize autonomous motion control of an off-axle hitching tractor-trailer system with a drawbar. The proposed method is roughly divided into three steps: EXTRACTING (E) a virtual subsystem, trajectory PLANNING (P) for the original full system, and trajectory TRACKING (T) by feedback control techniques, thus the “EPT method”. In the E step, two alternative strategies are considered to construct a virtual subsystem by extracting a part of an original towed aircraft system. Then, in the P step, a two-layer optimal control-based method is developed to generate a reference trajectory. A trajectory for the virtual subsystem is generated in the first layer, where the Reeds-Shepp curve with artificial expertise in selecting intermediate nodes is introduced to provide initial guesses. The results obtained in the first layer are utilized to initialize partial state and control variables in the trajectory planning for the original full system in the second layer. Finally, in the T step, a receding horizon controller is designed to drive the carrier aircraft to track the reference trajectory under various external disturbances. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the EPT method is applicable and highly efficient. The proposed method is also applicable for generalized tractor-trailer systems and other chain-link systems.},

We also extended the previous work in the literature to allow more complex scenarios by expanding the model-incompliant information using set-theory to represent the perception capacity of the road-user agents. With this dynamic perception definition, we also support interactive scenarios and are not limited to reactive and pre-defined agent behavior. Our main focus is to give a framework to represent realistic road-user behavior to be used in simulation or computational tool to examine interaction patterns in mixed-traffic conditions. We believe that, by formalising the verbose definitions and extending theprevious work in DSL, we can support automatic scenario generation and dynamic/evolving agent behavior models for simulating mixed traffic situations and scenarios. In addition, we can obtain scenarios that are realistic but also can represent rare-conditions that are difficult to extract from field-tests and real driving data repositories.},

  abstract     = {Handling of critical situations is an important part in the architecture of an autonomous vehicle. A controller for autonomous collision avoidance is developed based on a wary strategy that assumes the least tire-road friction for which the maneuver is still feasible. Should the friction be greater, the controller makes use of this, and performs better. The controller uses an acceleration-vector reference obtained from optimal control of a friction-limited particle, whose applicability is verified by using numerical optimization on a full vehicle model. By employing an analytical tire model of the tire-road friction limit, to determine slip references for steering, and body-slip control, the result is a controller where the computation of its output is explicit, and independent of the actual tire-road friction. When evaluated in real-time on a high-fidelity simulation model, the developed controller performs close to that achieved by offline numerical optimization.},

Each vehicle is equipped with an ad-hoc dual-mode controller in charge of tracking along the leader-follower chain the predecessor vehicle (namely the target for the leader) and ensuring absence of collisions. Moreover, whenever the leader recognizes that the obstacle scenario obstructs its navigation, the current formation is properly reconfigured by preserving recursive feasibility and obstacle avoidance properties.

Secondly, the activity values of all AUVs in the BINN maps of each target are calculated. Then, the AUV with the highest activity value in the BINN map of the target is selected as the winning AUV for the target.

  abstract     = {Various drowsiness detection systems have been developed to prevent traffic accidents. Drivers feel such systems are annoying or useless when the systems provide many false drowsiness alarms. Drowsy driving prevention systems should satisfy the following three features to be accepted by many drivers: 1) Precise drowsiness detection, 2) Drowsy driving warning whereby drivers are less annoyed by false alarms, and 3) Mechanisms that promote drivers to adopt active behavior to maintain his/her wakefulness. The present work proposes a new drowsy driving prevention system that has these features. The proposed system, referred to as a wakefulness-keeping support system (WKSS), consists of a drowsiness detection system (DDS), which corresponds to the first feature, and an active game system (AGS), which corresponds to the second and third features. The AGS is a simple game, which encourages drivers to adopt specific active behavior to play the game. Drivers can keep their wakefulness by playing the AGS, while enjoying it, even though false drowsiness alarms may occur. The usefulness of the proposed WKSS was evaluated through experiments using a driving simulator, which suggest that WKSS could be accepted by many drivers and contributing to realizing a zero-traffic-accident society.},

The problem is formulated as a distributed optimal control problem for a system of multiple autonomous vehicles, and then solved using a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, where the distributed approach is used to make the problem computationally feasible in real-time. To provide safety, a collision avoidance constraint is introduced, also in a distributed way. In the proposed method, each vehicle computes its own control inputs using estimated states of neighboring vehicles. In addition, a compatibility constraint is defined that takes collision avoidance into account but also ensures that each vehicle does not deviate significantly from what is expected by neighboring vehicles. The method allows us to construct a cost function for several different traffic scenarios. The asymptotic convergence of the system to the desired destination is proven, in the absence of uncertainty, and disturbances, for a sufficiently small MPC control horizon. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm scales well with increasing number of vehicles.},

The first technique is a recursive least squares (RLS) approach, while the second method solves a nonlinear joint state and parameter estimation problem via particle filtering (PF). We provide a parameter identifiability analysis for both methods to analytically show that the model parameters are not identifiable using equilibrium driving. The accuracy and computational runtime of the online methods are compared to a commonly used offline simulation-based optimization (i.e., batch optimization) approach. The methods are tested on synthetic data as well as on empirical data collected directly from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle using data from sensors that are part of the stock ACC system. The online methods are scalable and provide comparable accuracy to the batch method. RLS runs in real time and is two orders of magnitude faster than the batch method for modest sized (e.g., 15 min) datasets. The particle filter also runs in real-time, and is also suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large.},

Our solution builds upon the path-velocity decomposition approach. Path planning is performed with state-of-the-art techniques, while a novel trajectory abstraction is used to reason about speed profiles without explicitly generating sequences of accelerations. To efficiently identify the best safe speed profile for every path candidate, a reachability-based analysis is also formulated. The proposed planning workflow is evaluated in roundabout scenarios. Our simulation study shows that the proposed context representation facilitates the decision-making in occluded scenes and that the reachability-based planning strategy is robust, computationally efficient, and outperforms a simpler reactive strategy.},

Simulation results for the episode costs show that, when there are no modeling errors and the testing inputs are within the training data range, the DRL solution is equivalent to MPC with a sufficiently long prediction horizon. Particularly, the DRL episode cost is only 5.8% higher than the benchmark optimal control solution provided by optimizing the entire episode via IPO. The DRL control performance degrades when the testing inputs are outside the training data range, indicating inadequate machine learning generalization.

In this paper, a hybrid electric autonomous vehicle is studied under significant amount of uncertainty and ambiguity in the road environment and driver behavior. A Type 1 fuzzy logic controller is constructed here to address the uncertainties of driving conditions. The design involves building an intelligent energy management system for the hybrid electric autonomous vehicle. We have also examined the potentials of the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, especially for energy consumption management. Two simulations are implemented, to demonstrate that the intelligent system, proposed trough Type 1 and Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, decreases the fuel usage of the vehicle from 6.74 to 6.58 L/100km, respectively. It is also demonstrated that the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic controller saves more battery life compared to the Type-1 when the vehicle works under uncertain and ambiguous road conditions. Finally, Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic controller facilitates a reduction of carbon footprint in the autonomous vehicle as desired by the automotive industry stakeholders.},

  abstract     = {There is currently a huge interest around autonomous vehicles from both industry and academia. This is mainly due to recent advances in machine learning and deep learning, allowing the development of promising methods for autonomous driving. The gap toward full autonomy is incrementally being reduced with essentially three main existing approaches. First, Modular systems that combine a pipeline of methods with each solving one specific sub-task of driving. Second, Direct Perception techniques that directly estimate affordances (car orientation, distances between lane borders, etc) used to compute control commands through a simple logic. Finally, end-to-end frameworks that automatically map raw sensor data to actuation values. The objective of this paper is to review some recent works focusing on end-to-end deep learning models for lane stable driving, as well as some publicly available real world datasets and open-source simulators that enable the development and evaluation of such methods.},

  abstract     = {Self-driving vehicles need to continuously analyse the driving scene, understand the behavior of other road users and predict their future trajectories in order to plan a safe motion and reduce their reaction time. Motivated by this idea, this paper addresses the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction over an extended horizon. On highways, human drivers continuously adapt their speed and paths according to the behavior of their neighboring vehicles. Therefore, vehicles&#39; trajectories are very correlated and considering vehicle interactions makes motion prediction possible even before the start of a clear maneuver pattern. To this end, we introduce and analyze trajectory prediction methods based on how they model the vehicles interactions. Inspired by human reasoning, we use an attention mechanism that explicitly highlights the importance of neighboring vehicles with respect to their future states. We go beyond pairwise vehicle interactions and model higher order interactions. Moreover, the existence of different goals and driving behaviors induces multiple potential futures. We exploit a combination of global and partial attention paid to surrounding vehicles to generate different possible trajectory. Experiments on highway datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive cruise control is one of the most common comfort features of road vehicles. Despite its large market penetration, current systems are not safe in all driving conditions and require supervision by human drivers. While several previous works have proposed solutions for safe adaptive cruise control, none of these works considers comfort, especially in the event of cut-ins. We provide a novel solution that simultaneously meets our specifications and provides comfort in all driving conditions, including cut-ins. This is achieved by an exchangeable nominal controller ensuring comfort, combined with a provably correct fail-safe controller that gradually engages an emergency maneuver—this ensures comfort, since most threats are already cleared before emergency braking is fully activated. As a consequence, one can easily exchange the nominal controller without having to have the overall system safety re-certified. We also provide the first user study into a provably-correct adaptive cruise controller. It shows that even though our approach never causes an accident, passengers rate the performance as good as a state-of-the-art solution that does not ensure safety.},

  abstract     = {Locating the vehicle in its road is a critical part of any autonomous vehicle system and has been subject to different research topics. In most works presented in the literature, ego-localization is split into three parts: Road level-localization consisting in the road on which the vehicle travels, Lane level localization which is the lane on which the vehicle travels, and Ego lane level localization being the lateral position of the vehicle in the ego-lane. For each part, several researches have been conducted. However, the relationship between the different parts has not been taken into consideration. Through this work, an end-to-end ego-localization framework is introduced with two main novelties. The first one is the proposition of a complete solution that tackles every part of the ego-localization. The second one lies in the information-driven approach used. Indeed, we use prior about the road structure from a digital map in order to reduce the space complexity for the recognition process. Besides, several fusion framework techniques based on Bayesian Network and Hidden Markov Model are elaborated leading to an ego-localization method that is, to a large extent, robust to erroneous sensor data. The robustness of the proposed method is proven on different datasets in varying scenarios.},

The probability distribution characterizes tolerated deviations from the deterministic requirements and is learned using maximum likelihood estimation from data. Further, this paper introduces both parametrized requirements for motion planning in autonomous driving applications and methods for the estimation of their parameters from driving data. Both the parametrized requirements and their joint probability distributions are estimated using a posterior distribution such that the control objective is personalized from a prior as driver data are accumulated. Finally, three variants of the learning method are presented that vary in computational complexity and data storage requirements. Key advantages of the proposed inverse learning method are a relatively low computational complexity, a need for a limited amount of data, and that the data do not have to be segmented into specific maneuvers, which makes the method easily implementable. Learning results using data of five human drivers in a simulation environment suggest that the proposed model for human-conscious driving along with the proposed learning method enable a more natural and personalized driving style of autonomous vehicles for their human passengers.},

This paper investigates how to perform robust visual tracking in adverse and challenging conditions using complementary visual and thermal infrared data (RGBT tracking). We propose a novel deep network architecture called quality-aware Feature Aggregation Network (FANet) for robust RGBT tracking. Unlike existing RGBT trackers, our FANet aggregates hierarchical deep features within each modality to dispose the challenge of significant changes in appearance which is triggered by low illumination,deformation, background clutter and occlusion. In particular, we employ the operations of max pooling to transform these hierarchical and multi-resolution features into uniform space with the same resolution, and use 1×1 convolution operation to compress feature dimensions to achieve more effective hierarchical feature aggregation. To model the interactions between RGB and thermal modalities, we elaborately design an adaptive aggregation subnetwork to integrate features from different modalities based on their reliabilities and thus are able to alleviate noise effects introduced by low-quality sources. The whole FANet is trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate the high-accurate performance against other state-of-the-art RGBT tracking methods.},

  abstract     = {Many achievements concerning developments in the field of automated driving have been made. However, automated driving still faces the challenge of safety validation. Conventional methods are not suitable any more for this highly complex automation system. Therefore, the method named Virtual Assessment of Automation in Field Operation (VAAFO) is motivated. In this approach, automated driving system has no access to actuators but rather runs parallel to the human driver. Consequently, this approach is divided into two modules: online trajectory comparison and offline safety assessment. This paper focuses on the second module, in which uncertainties in world model are reduced and then the safety of Automated Vehicle (AV) is evaluated. Retrospective post-processing combined with Joint Integrated Probabilistic Data Association (JIPDA) tracker is put forward to reduce existence uncertainties. State uncertainties are reduced by an Unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother (URTSS). Furthermore, inverse TTC and remaining lateral distance are utilized to assess the safety of AV in the corrected world model. The results demonstrate that retrospective post-processing combined with JIPDA can reduce existence uncertainties greatly. URTSS is very useful for reducing state uncertainties. The studied case illustrates that the safety of AV can be assessed by parallel running and critical scenarios are found accordingly.},

In this paper, by comparing the pros and cons of various object detection algorithms, two different algorithms with a different emphasis are selected for a weighted ensemble. Besides, a new ensemble method named the Soft-Weighted-Average method is proposed. The proposed method is attenuated by the confidence, and it “punishes” the detection result of the corresponding relationship by the confidence attenuation, instead of by deleting the output of a certain model. The proposed method can further reduce the vehicle misdetection of the target detection algorithm, obtaining a better detection result. Lastly, the ensemble method can achieve an average accuracy of 94.75% for simple targets, which makes it the third-ranked method in the KITTI evaluation system.},

The proposed approach follows a new paradigm that improves the detection performance, better generalizing the motorcycle dynamics with respect to the specific vehicle and the driving style.

To design the controller and decide the conditions of pilot tests on public roads, the vehicle dynamics, steering system, sensor dynamics, and disturbances are modelled. The steering system of the vehicle can be approximated as a second-order system, and the measuring time of the sensors are considered, which cause reduction of damping ratio in lateral dynamics. The numerical analysis revealed that the vehicle speed should be reduced to under 4.2 m/s (15 km/h) before precision docking starts, to make the lateral motion of the vehicle more stable. Experimental results show that the standard deviation of lateral error in precision docking using LiDAR for localization is 1.2 cm, which is slightly under the criterion threshold. The results also verify that the vehicle and sensor model describes the vehicle lateral motion appropriately.},

A sensing and estimation system suitable for use on a bicycle is therefore developed in order to track the trajectories of vehicles in a traffic intersection. An inexpensive solid-state low-density Lidar mounted at the front of an instrumented bicycle is used. The low angular resolution of the sensor creates many challenges. These challenges are addressed in this research by clustering based approaches for assigning measurement points to individual vehicles, by introducing a correction term with its own dynamic model for position measurement refinement, and by incorporating multi-target tracking using global nearest neighbor data association and interacting multiple model extended Kalman filtering. The tracking performance of the developed system is evaluated by both simulation and experimental results. Scenarios that involve straight driving (in all four directions) and left turning (opposing) vehicles at a traffic intersection are considered. Experimental results show that the developed system can successfully track cars accurately in these scenarios in spite of the low measurement resolution of the sensor.},

The approach is motivated by showing that a lattice-based planner can be cast and analyzed as a bilevel optimization problem. This insight is used to integrate a lattice-based planner and an optimal control-based method in a novel way. The lattice-based planner is applied to the problem in a first step using a discretized search space. In a second step, an optimal control-based method is applied using the lattice-based solution as an initial iterate. In contrast to prior work, the system dynamics and objective function used in the first step are chosen to coincide with those used in the second step. As an important consequence, the lattice planner provides a solution which is highly suitable as a warm-start to the optimal control step. This proposed combination makes, in a structured way, benefit of sampling-based methods ability to solve combinatorial parts of the problem and optimal control-based methods ability to obtain locally optimal solutions. Compared to previous work, the proposed approach is shown in simulations to provide significant improvements in terms of computation time, numerical reliability and objective function value.},

Previous works generally predict traffic line segmentation and obtain lane marking coordinates with a post-processing step, which are vulnerable to various challenging environments including occlusion, illumination variation, shadow, background clutter. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named as Lane marking Regression Network (LRN), which can simultaneously consider confidence area detection and field inference for producing more precise lane markings in an unified encoder-decoder framework. For obtaining confidence detection of lane area, we introduce the graph diffusion mechanism to aggregate the contextual information for better detecting hard areas. The field inference considers the geometric relationship between lane area and lane markings by adopting a novel constraint regression function. Comprehensive evaluations on CULane and GD datasets well demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed LRN over other state-of-the-arts for lane marking detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a vision-based collision-warning system for ADAS in intelligent vehicles, with a focus on urban scenarios. In most current systems, collision warnings are based on radar, or on monocular vision using pattern recognition. Since detecting collisions is a core functionality of intelligent vehicles, redundancy is essential, so that we explore the use of stereo vision. First, our approach is generic and class-agnostic, since it can detect general obstacles that are on a colliding path with the ego-vehicle without relying on semantic information. The framework estimates disparity and flow from a stereo video stream and calculates stixels. Then, the second contribution is the use of the new asteroids concept as a consecutive step. This step samples particles based on a probabilistic uncertainty analysis of the measurement process to model potential collisions. Third, this is all enclosed in a Bayesian histogram filter around a newly introduced time-to-collision versus angle-of-impact state space. The evaluation shows that the system correctly avoids any false warnings on the real-world KITTI dataset, detects all collisions in a newly simulated dataset when the obstacle is higher than 0.4 m, and performs excellent on our new qualitative real-world data with near-collisions, both in daytime and nighttime conditions.},

  abstract     = {Safety on roads is of uttermost importance, especially in the context of autonomous vehicles. A critical need is to detect and communicate disruptive incidents early and effectively. In this paper we propose a system based on an off-the-shelf deep neural network architecture that is able to detect and recognize types of unsigned (non-placarded, such as traffic signs), physical (visible in images) road incidents. We develop a taxonomy for unsigned physical incidents to provide a means of organizing and grouping related incidents. After selecting eight target types of incidents, we collect a dataset of twelve thousand images gathered from publicly-available web sources. We subsequently fine-tune a convolutional neural network to recognize the eight types of road incidents. The proposed model is able to recognize incidents with a high level of accuracy (higher than 90%). We further show that while our system generalizes well across spatial context by training a classifier on geostratified data in the United Kingdom (with an accuracy of over 90%), the translation to visually less similar environments requires spatially distributed data collection.},

  abstract     = {Connected vehicle technologies present new opportunities to minimize energy consumption in vehicles. Much of the prior work has focused on the impact of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication on energy savings. Here, we analyze the impact of connectivity on both energy savings and battery degradation reduction for an electric bus. Dynamic programming is employed to optimize the velocity profile of a single electric bus passing through a traffic intersection under a V2I regime wherein the intersection timing of the traffic light is known a priori. The optimization seeks to minimize the overall cost function consisting of the electric energy consumption and battery degradation. Simulations have been conducted for both the connected vehicle case and the baseline case without connectivity. Three different battery sizes were investigated, and the results indicate that connectivity confers the greatest cost savings for the smallest battery. An overall cost savings of 27% can be realized by using connectivity to reduce both energy consumption and battery degradation.},

  abstract     = {An open-source vehicle automation methodology, and platform for road vehicles (cars, and trucks) is presented. The platform hardware, and software, based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), are detailed. Two strategies are discussed for enabling the remote control of a vehicle (in this case, an electric 2013 Ford Focus). The first approach used digital filtering of Controller Area Network (CAN) messages. In the case of the test vehicle, this approach allowed for the control of acceleration from a tap-point on the CAN bus, and the OBD-II port. The second approach, based on the emulation of the analog output(s) of a vehicle&#39;s accelerator pedal, brake pedal, and steering torque sensors, is more generally applicable and, in the test vehicle, allowed for the full control vehicle acceleration, braking, and steering. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, and platform for vehicle automation research, a very basic low-level velocity, and steering controllers are developed. Additionally a high level path following algorithm was developed. Finally, the system is validated experimentally.},
