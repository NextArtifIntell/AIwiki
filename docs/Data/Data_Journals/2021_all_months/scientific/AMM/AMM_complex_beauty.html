  abstract  = {Nowadays the use of composites in all most all manufacturing sectors is developing rapidly and is likely to increase more rapidly shortly. Aluminum alloy is playing a greater role in all engineering fields. Modern mechanical parts require superior properties, the material available in pure form do not have the required mechanical properties such as strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, etc. A Composite is formed by two or more physically and chemically distinct substances and which is fabricated to enhance the distinctiveness of base metal. The Present work has focused on properties of Carbon nanoTubes (CNTs) reinforced aluminum metal matrix Al 6060; Nanocomposites. These Nanocomposites are fabricated by using the stir casting method by varying the CNT reinforcement with a multi-walled size 10 to 15 nm weight percentage (0.3%, 0.7%, and 1%) of the Al 6060 matrix. To study its properties, the fabricated specimens are tested for mechanical properties. The properties of the Nanocomposites are found to be greatly influenced by the increase in weight percentage of reinforcement. With the mixing of different weight proportion reinforced particles by stir casting process properties of Tensile, Flexural, Impact, and hardness strength of composites are increased. The experimental values obtained from tests more useful in the development of Nanocomposites for different applications.},

  abstract  = {Higher solar absorptance and lower thermal emittance are the key factors for solar collectors. The use of thin films that are having mechanically resistant coatings are common practice in industries. The primary motivation of carrying this research work is to lower thermal emittance and maximize solar absorptance on SS304 substrate material. W-Al2O3 composite coatings are developed using magnetron sputtering process by considering the process parameters. The experimental plan is achieved based on Taguchi L9 orthogonal under various levels for deposition parameters. The tungsten and alumina thin films deposited using a co-sputtering were characterized using 410 - solar instrument for measuring solar absorptance and ET 100 Emissometer for measuring thermal emittance. The optimization for process parameters on thermal emittance and absorptance were carried out. It was found that for deposition parameters of DC power 750W, RF power 1050W and Argon gas flow rate of 250 sccm, absorptance of 0.758 with thermal emittance of 0.061 is observed with deposition was carried out on SS304 substrates.},

  abstract  = {The primary objective of this research work is to explore the potential of walnut shell particles as a reinforcing agent in the thermoset matrix composite. Therefore, the number of composite samples was developed by varying the filler weight percentage (15%, 25%, 35%, and 45%) in an epoxy polymer. The composite samples were characterized in terms of mechanical properties by using tensile test, flexural or three-point bending test, Izod impact test, compression test, and Rockwell hardness test. Moreover, the effect of cellulosic filler content on the density and water absorptivity of epoxy-based composites was also investigated as per the ASTM standard. Agricultural waste in the form of walnut shell was characterized by the determination of grain size. The experimental results showed that the stiffness and hardness of epoxy thermoset were increased with the decrease in tensile and flexural strength after the addition of walnut shell fine particles. The composite of 35 wt% walnut filler exhibits a balanced combination of strength, stiffness, and toughness. It was found that the mechanical strength and modulus of filled composites were increased with the increase of filler content up to 35 wt%.},

A novel technique “Ultrasonic assisted cavitation” is followed for the synthesis of nancomposites for uniform dispersion and better properties. By keeping the size of reinforcement as 50 nm and varying the quantity from 0.1 to 0.5 by wt%; it is perceived that the hardness &amp;amp; drill thrust forces are increased and electrical conductivity is decreased when equated to pure alloy.},

  abstract  = {In an internal combustion engine poppet valve is the crucial component which often opens and closes, thereby regulating gas flow in an engine cylinder. During engine operation, the valve is exposed to high temperature gases (thermal load) along with spring and cam loads (mechanical load). Due to high temperatures and fatigue loads, the valves are subjected to metallurgical changes and leads to failure. In order to resist these extreme conditions of high temperature and mechanical loads, the engine valve should possess special properties such as high surface hardness, a good amount of thermal conductivity, and fatigue strength. In this work, the reasons for the failure of two wheeler engine valve were evaluated and found that failure takes place due to change in the chemical composition mainly due to thermal diffusion at the interfaces. Thermal barrier coatings on the valve surface arrest the temperature load and increase its life. In this work, the performance of various titanium based composite coatings, i.e., TiN, TiC, TiC-Al2O3, TiCN, TiAlN, TiN- Al2O3, DLC, and uncoated valves of two wheeler engine was simulated using Finite Element Analysis. The simulation results indicated that coated valves have less thermal and fatigue loading and have more life than the uncoated valve. The Finite element simulation results of both coated and uncoated valves are presented and analyzed in this paper.},

The Couette flow of the semisolid material between two parallel plates is considered. The flow field is presented by momentum conservation equation. The non-Newtoniun behaviour of the semisolid material is expressed by the Herschel-Bulkley model. The agglomeration and de-agglomeration phenomena of the suspended particles in semisolid state under shear are represented introducing a time dependent structural parameter. The proposed model fitted well with existing work in a wide range of shear rates and could predict the flow and apparent viscosity of semisolid M2 steel. Finally, the work involves prediction of the flow field, rate of strain and apparent viscosity of the semisolid material under transient condition. It is observed that the time dependent viscosity is highly non-linear during step-change in shear rate. It is noticed that the structural parameter decreases as the shear rate is increased. Whereas, the apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate but shows an undulation and after that gradually rises to a higher steady value as the plate velocity decreases suddenly.},

It has many applications that go beyond the provision of visual aesthetics, which includes a view of the inside and out. Due to extreme levels of clarity, structural glazing may be so transparent that it may go unnoticed by design or make a strong visual impact such as the focal point of a building. This paper focused on structural glass with various laminated/laminated conditions that were used to investigate the Dynamic Mechanical Properties. The storage modulus (G&#39;), loss modulus (G&#39;&#39;) and damping factor (tan delta) were determined at various levels, ranging from room temperature to elevated temperatures (250 °C) to understand the behavior of glass structure with and without laminated glass over a range of temperatures. The G&#39; &amp;amp; G&#39;&#39; were tested to understand the effect of bonding, fracture behavior between the pure glass and laminated glass to observe the response with respect to temperature. Results are found that G&#39; and G&#39;&#39; improve over a range of temperatures for laminated glass with enlightening fracture behavior. Laminated glass also has a major influence on the damping factor, but it also depends on the laminated thickness and materials. Thermo-Mechanical Properties of laminated glass are more improved, without affecting the transferability of glass.},

The application of the FDM process in the biomedical and casting industries is limited by its poor surface roughness which is most generally caused by the staircase effect and chordal error of the 3D model. Owing to the drawbacks of mechanical based finishing techniques, researchers have come up with a new technique known as Vapour Smoothing (VS). In this work, past literature of the VS process of FDM components is reported and it has been seen that the VS process is giving a promising improvement in surface roughness of FDM components.},

  abstract  = {This present investigation explore the microstructural properties of SDSS grade SAF2507 weldments produced by constant current GTAW and constant current GTAW with superimposed high frequency (HF) current. The macro, microstructural examination and mechanical characterization were performed. From the results, it was found that, the superimposition of high-frequency current on the welding current results in constriction of the arc during constant current GTAW with superimposed HF current. The superimposed HF current restricts the arc with for all intents and purposes a similar root and extended diameter. The weldment region unit considered the standard for mechanical and microstructural properties. The dominance of properties because of the association of inter pulse or HF current is described along with its related science concerned.},
