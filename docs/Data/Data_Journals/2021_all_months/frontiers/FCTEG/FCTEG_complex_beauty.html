  abstract     = {This paper presents a nonlinear control design for the stabilization of parallel and circular motion in a school of robotic fish actuated with internal reaction wheels. The closed-loop swimming dynamics of the fish robots are represented by the canonical Chaplygin sleigh. They exchange relative state information according to a connected, undirected communication graph to form a system of coupled, nonlinear, second-order oscillators. Prior work on collective motion of constant-speed, self-propelled particles serves as the foundation of our approach. However, unlike a self-propelled particle, the fish robots follow limit-cycle dynamics to sustain periodic flapping for forward motion with time-varying speed. Parallel and circular motions are achieved in an average sense without feedback linearization of the agents’ dynamics. Implementation of the proposed parallel formation control law on an actual school of soft robotic fish is described, including system identification experiments to identify motor dynamics and the design of a motor torque-tracking controller to follow the formation torque control. Experimental results demonstrate a school of four robotic fish achieving parallel formations starting from random initial conditions.},

A gain-scheduled dynamic output feedback controller, coupled with a disturbance observer to cancel out input disturbance effects, was augmented with an anti-windup compensator to locally stabilize the input-delay LPV system under saturation, model uncertainty, and exogenous disturbances. Sufficient delay-dependent conditions to asymptotically stabilize the closed-loop system were derived using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and a modified generalized sector condition to address the input saturation nonlinearity.

The results are examined in the context of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) control in the clinical resuscitation of critical hypotensive patients. The MAP variation response to the injection of vasopressor drugs was modeled as an LPV system with a varying input delay and was susceptible to model uncertainty and input/output disturbances. A Bayesian filtering method known as the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) was used to estimate the instantaneous values of the parameters. The varying delay was estimated via a multiple-model approach. The proposed input-delay LPV control was validated in closed-loop simulations to demonstrate its merits and capabilities in the presence of drug administration constraints.},

The proposed model predictive control (MPC) approach requires less online computational load compared to other neural network based MPC approaches. More importantly, the precision of the predictive model is enhanced with reduced computational load by operating an appropriate approximation of the predictive model. The approximation is proved to have no influence on the convergence of the predictive control algorithm.

  abstract     = {People with spinal cord injury (SCI) suffer from a drastic reduction in sitting stability which negatively impacts their postural control. Thus, sitting balance becomes one of the most challenging everyday exercises. To better understand the consequences of this pathology, we have to work with high-sized non-linear biomechanical models implying both theoretical and numerical difficulties. The main goal being to recover unmeasured inputs, the observer should have limited or no simplification at all to provide a better estimation quality. A Proportional Integral-observer (PI-observer) is designed and its convergence is formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMI) through convex optimization techniques. Using a unique high-sized observer, the LMI constraints problem can quickly reach current solvers limitations regarding the number of unknown parameters required. A way to solve this issue is to design a cascade observer in order to estimate the unmeasurable torques of a human with SCI. This approach consists in decomposing a biomechanical model into interconnected subsystems and to build “local” observers. The relevance of this approach is demonstrated in simulation and with real-time experimental data.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses a multi-layer linear parameter varying path tracking controller for autonomous full electric vehicles with 4 wheel drive. Many approaches for path tracking are present in the literature, but the majority of them utilize only the steering wheel. Nowadays, the massive introduction of electric vehicles opens new opportunities for vehicle dynamics control; multiple electric motors, via differential torque, offer an alternative way to influence vehicle motion. The multi-layer structure, managing separately steering wheel and electric motors, permits the exploitation of pre-existing control systems and maintains a straightforward tuning process. Furthermore, the robustness of the path tracking controller is enhanced by introducing tire nonlinearities. Linear parameter varying models offer a direct way to incorporate tire characteristics in the design process.

However, in practice, sensor measurements can be corrupted or attacked. In this study, we consider an AC microgrid comprising several synchronous generators and inverter-interface power supplies, and focus on securely estimating the dynamic states of the microgrid from a set of corrupted data. We propose a secure dynamic state estimator which allows the microgrid operator to reconstruct the dynamic states of the microgrid from a set of attacked or corrupted data without any assumption on attacks or corruptions. Finally, we consider an AC microgrid with the same topology as the IEEE 33-bus distribution system, and show that the proposed secure estimation algorithm can accurately reconstruct the attack signals.},

  abstract     = {In formation control, a robot (or an agent) learns to align itself in a particular spatial alignment. However, in a few scenarios, it is also vital to learn temporal alignment along with spatial alignment. An effective control system encompasses flexibility, precision, and timeliness. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms excel at learning to select an action given a state. However, executing an optimal action at an appropriate time remains challenging. Building a reinforcement learning agent which can learn an optimal time to act along with an optimal action can address this challenge. Neural networks in which timing relies on dynamic changes in the activity of population neurons have been shown to be a more effective representation of time. In this work, we trained a reinforcement learning agent to create its representation of time using a neural network with a population of recurrently connected nonlinear firing rate neurons. Trained using a reward-based recursive least square algorithm, the agent learned to produce a neural trajectory that peaks at the “time-to-act”; thus, it learns “when” to act. A few control system applications also require the agent to temporally scale its action. We trained the agent so that it could temporally scale its action for different speed inputs. Furthermore, given one state, the agent could learn to plan multiple future actions, that is, multiple times to act without needing to observe a new state.},

We present sufficient conditions in terms of multiple Lyapunov functions for the origin of a class of hybrid systems to be finite-time stable. More specifically, we show that even if the value of the Lyapunov function increases during continuous flow, i.e., if the unstable modes in the system are active for some time, finite-time stability can be guaranteed if the finite-time convergent mode is active for a sufficient amount of cumulative time. This is the first work on finite-time stability of hybrid systems using multiple Lyapunov functions. Prior work uses a common Lyapunov function approach, and requires the Lyapunov function to be decreasing during the continuous flows and non-increasing at the discrete jumps, thereby, restricting the hybrid system to only have stable modes, or to only evolve along the stable modes. In contrast, we allow Lyapunov functions to increase both during the continuous flows and the discrete jumps. As thus, the derived stability results are less conservative compared to the earlier results in the related literature, and in effect allow the hybrid system to have unstable modes.},

An extension of Lyapunov stability utilizing Krasovskii functionals is considered to derive stability analysis and synthesis conditions for delay-dependent dynamic output feedback LPV control design. The main challenges associated with this approach are selecting appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) and finding efficient integral inequalities to bound the derivative of the LKF. Accordingly, a novel modified parameter-dependent LKF candidate along with an affine version of Jensen’s inequality bounding technique are employed leading to the derivation of less conservative sufficient conditions expressed in terms of convex linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proposed methodology is compared with past work in the literature in terms of conservatism reduction and performance improvement through a numerical example. Finally, the application of the proposed output-feedback LPV control design is evaluated on the automated mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) regulation in critical patient resuscitation via vasoactive drug infusion. Closed-loop simulation results are presented to illustrate the potential of the introduced LPV gain-scheduling design to provide MAP set-point tracking in the presence of disturbances and varying input delays.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the bearing-only formation control problem of a class of second-order system with unknown disturbance is investigated, where the control law merely depends on the relative bearings between neighboring agents. In order to offset the effect of unknown disturbance on the system, adaptive estimation is introduced. In the design of the control law, the back-stepping design method and the negative gradient method are used. The Barbalat’s lemma is used to prove the global stability of the system. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed formation control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The applications of the deep reinforcement learning method to achieve the arcs welding by multi-robot systems are presented, where the states and the actions of each robot are continuous and obstacles are considered in the welding environment. In order to adapt to the time-varying welding task and local information available to each robot in the welding environment, the so-called multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is designed with a new set of rewards. Based on the idea of the distributed execution and centralized training, the proposed MADDPG algorithm is distributed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
