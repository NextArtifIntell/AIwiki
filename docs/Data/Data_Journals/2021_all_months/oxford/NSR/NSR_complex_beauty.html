Biologists use it to determine structures of proteins and other biomacromolecules; material scientists use it to analyze internal structures of different materials; physicists use it to explore the basic matter states; and physicians use it to perform medical imaging. A high-performance synchrotron light source is often the workhorse supporting a prosperous multi-disciplinary research center. In China, that is the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Since its opening to users in 2009, SSRF has bred many significant scientific achievements and laid the foundation for the Shanghai Zhangjiang Cluster of Big Science Facilities. On 3 August 2021, National Science Review ( NSR ) interviewed Professor Zhentang Zhao, Director of the SSRF Science Center and vice president of the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Prof. Zhao introduced the construction and development of the synchrotron light source and X-ray free electron laser facilities in Shanghai, as well as how SSRF experiences may be valuable for big science facilities and centers now under construction in China.},

However, whether prickles have new function and the molecular genetics of prickle patterning remain poorly explored. Here, we generated a high-quality reference genome assembly for ‘Basye&#39;s Thornless’ (BT), a prickle-free cultivar of Rosa wichuraiana , to identify genetic elements related to stem prickle development. The BT genome harbors a high level of sequence diversity in itself and with cultivar ‘Old Blush’ ( R. chinensis ), a founder genotype in rose domestication. Inheritance of stem prickle density was determined and two QTL were identified. Differentially expressed genes in QTL were involved in water-related functions, suggesting that prickle density may hitchhike with adaptations to moist environments. While the prickle-related gene-regulatory-network (GRN) was highly conserved, the expression variation of key candidate genes was associated with prickle density. Our study provides fundamental resources and insights for genome evolution in the Rosaceae. Ongoing efforts on identification of the molecular bases for key rose traits may lead to improvements for horticultural markets.},

The leaves are alternate, short petiolate and linear-lanceolate with low rank pinnate to reticulate venation. The infructescences are loose panicles bearing fruits in different stages of maturity, each containing four partly free carpels borne in a whorled arrangement. Each carpel has three to five seeds borne along its ventral margin. The nature of the leaves and axes indicates a terrestrial, herbaceous habit. In general organization, Gansufructus is closely similar to the fruit-bearing axes of Sinocarpus decussatus from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota, as well as other more or less contemporaneous angiosperms from the Far East, which together provide evidence of diverse eudicot angiosperms of low stature colonizing areas close to environments of deposition.},

However, reaching the level of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines may instead depend upon the air quality co-benefits of ambitious climate action. Here, we assess pathways of Chinese PM 2.5 air quality from 2015 to 2060 under a combination of scenarios that link global and Chinese climate mitigation pathways (i.e. global 2°C- and 1.5°C-pathways, National Determined Contributions (NDC) pledges and carbon neutrality goals) to local clean air policies. We find that China can achieve both its near-term climate goals (peak emissions) and PM 2.5 air quality annual standard (35 μg/m 3 ) by 2030 by fulfilling its NDC pledges and continuing air pollution control policies. However, the benefits of end-of-pipe control reductions are mostly exhausted by 2030, and reducing PM 2.5 exposure of the majority of the Chinese population to below 10 μg/m 3 by 2060 will likely require more ambitious climate mitigation efforts such as China&#39;s carbon neutrality goals and global 1.5°C-pathways. Our results thus highlight that China&#39;s carbon neutrality goals will play a critical role in reducing air pollution exposure to the level of the WHO guidelines and protecting public health.},

In recent years, the application of MOFs in Li-S batteries has been developed rapidly. This review summarizes the milestone works and recent advances of MOFs in various aspects of Li-S batteries, including cathode, separator and electrolyte. The factors affecting the performance of MOFs and the working mechanisms of MOFs in these different parts are also discussed in detail. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for the application of MOFs in Li-S batteries are proposed. We also put forward feasible solutions to related problems.

  abstract     = {Skywave refers to the electromagnetic wave reflected or refracted from the ionosphere and propagated in the form of a guided wave between the ionosphere and the Earth&#39;s surface. Since the skywave can propagate over large distances, it has been widely used in long-distance communication. This paper explores and demonstrates the feasibility of skywave for deep resource and energy exploration at depths of up to 10 km. Theoretical and technical advancements were accomplished in furthering skywave applications. A new solution method based on Green&#39;s function has been developed to study skywave propagation in a fully coupled lithosphere-air-ionosphere full space model. For the first time, the model allows one to study skywave distribution characteristics in the lithosphere containing inhomogeneity such as ore deposits or oil and gas reservoirs. This model also lays a foundation for skywave data processing and interpretation. On a parallel line, we have developed a multi-channel, broadband, low-noise, portable data acquisition system suitable for receiving skywave signals. Using the skywave field excited by a high-power fixed source located in central China, actual field surveys have been carried out in some areas in China including the Biyang depression of Henan Province. The initial results appear encouraging—the interpreted resistivity models prove to be consistent with those of seismic exploration and known geological information, and the exploration cost is only ∼1/4 to 1/10 that of seismic surveys. These initial successful applications of the skywave theory lay a solid foundation for further verification of the new method.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic graphene features semi-metallic characteristics that limit its applications in electronic devices, whereas graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising semiconductors because of their bandgap-opening feature. However, the controllable mass-fabrication of high-quality GNR arrays remains a major challenge. In particular, the in situ growth of GNR arrays through template-free chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has not been realized. Herein, we report a template-free CVD strategy to grow large-area, high-quality and self-aligned GNR arrays on liquid copper surface. The width of as-grown GNR could be optimized to sub-10 nm with aspect ratio up to 387, which is higher than those of reported CVD-GNRs. The study of the growth mechanism indicates that a unique comb-like etching-regulated growth process caused by a trace hydrogen flow guides the formation of the mass-produced self-aligned GNR arrays.

  abstract     = {Hadron spectroscopy provides a way to understand the dynamics of the strong interaction. For light hadron systems, only phenomenological models or lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are applicable, because of the failure of perturbation expansions for QCD at low energy. Experimental data on light hadron spectroscopy are therefore crucial to provide necessary constraints on various theoretical models. Light meson spectroscopy has been studied using charmonium decays with the Beijing Spectrometer Experiment (BES) at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, operating at 2.0–4.6 GeV center-of-mass energy, for nearly three decades. Charmonium data with unprecedented statistics and well-defined initial and final states provide BESIII with unique opportunities to search for glueballs, hybrids and multi-quark states, as well as perform systematic studies of the properties of conventional light mesons. In this article, we review BESIII results that address these issues.},

  abstract     = {The standard model (SM) of particle physics, comprised of the unified electroweak and quantum chromodynamic theories, accurately explains almost all experimental results related to the micro-world, and has made a number of predictions for previously unseen particles, most notably the Higgs scalar boson, that were subsequently discovered. As a result, the SM is currently universally accepted as the theory of the fundamental particles and their interactions. However, in spite of its numerous successes, the SM has a number of apparent shortcomings, including: many free parameters that must be supplied by experimental measurements; no mechanism to produce the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe; and no explanations for gravity, the dark matter in the universe, neutrino masses, the number of particle generations, etc. Because of these shortcomings, there is considerable incentive to search for evidence for new, non-SM physics phenomena that might provide important clues about what a new, beyond the SM theory (BSM) might look like. Although the center-of-mass energies that BESIII can access are far below the energy frontier, searches for new, BSM physics are an important component of its research program. This report reviews some of the highlights from BESIII’s searches for signs of new, BSM physics by: measuring rates for processes that the SM predicts to be forbidden or very rare; searching for non-SM particles such as dark photons; performing precision tests of SM predictions; and looking for violations of the discrete symmetries C and CP in processes for which the SM expectations are immeasurably small.},

Current experimental challenges and successes in understanding decays of the charmed hadrons are discussed. Precise calibrations of quantum chromodynamics and tests of the standard model are provided by measurements of purely leptonic and semi-leptonic decays of charmed hadrons, and lepton universality is probed in purely leptonic decays of charmed mesons to three generations of leptons. Quantum correlations in threshold data samples provide access to strong phases in the neutral D meson decays and probe the decay dynamics of the charmed Λ c baryon. Charm physics studies with near-threshold production of charmed particle pairs are unique to BESIII, and provide many important opportunities and challenges.},

  abstract     = {2020 was an unprecedented year, with rapid and drastic changes in human mobility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the variation in commuting patterns among the Chinese population across stable and unstable periods, we used nationwide mobility data from 318 million mobile phone users in China to examine the extreme fluctuations of population movements in 2020, ranging from the Lunar New Year travel season ( chunyun ), to the exceptional calm of COVID-19 lockdown, and then to the recovery period. We observed that cross-city movements, which increased substantially in chunyun and then dropped sharply during the lockdown, are primarily dependent on travel distance and the socio-economic development of cities. Following the Lunar New Year holiday, national mobility remained low until mid-February, and COVID-19 interventions delayed more than 72.89 million people returning to large cities. Mobility network analysis revealed clusters of highly connected cities, conforming to the social-economic division of urban agglomerations in China. While the mass migration back to large cities was delayed, smaller cities connected more densely to form new clusters. During the recovery period after travel restrictions were lifted, the netflows of over 55% city pairs reversed in direction compared to before the lockdown. These findings offer the most comprehensive picture of Chinese mobility at fine resolution across various scenarios in China and are of critical importance for decision making regarding future public-health-emergency response, transportation planning and regional economic development, among others.},

They exhibit rich vocalization, but the neural basis underlying this complex vocal communication is largely unknown. Here we report the existence of specific neuron populations in marmoset A1 that respond selectively to distinct simple or compound calls made by conspecific marmosets. These neurons were spatially dispersed within A1 but distinct from those responsive to pure tones. Call-selective responses were markedly diminished when individual domains of the call were deleted or the domain sequence was altered, indicating the importance of the global rather than local spectral-temporal properties of the sound. Compound call-selective responses also disappeared when the sequence of the two simple-call components was reversed or their interval was extended beyond 1 s. Light anesthesia largely abolished call-selective responses. Our findings demonstrate extensive inhibitory and facilitatory interactions among call-evoked responses, and provide the basis for further study of circuit mechanisms underlying vocal communication in awake non-human primates.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic chemotactic micro/nanomotors are envisioned to actively ‘seek out’ targets by following specific chemicals, but they are mainly powered by bioincompatible fuels and only show pseudochemotaxis (or advanced chemokinesis) due to their weak self-reorientation capabilities. Here we demonstrate that synthetic ZnO-based Janus micromotors can be powered by the alternative biocompatible fuel of CO 2 , and further provide the first example of self-reorientation-induced biomimetic chemotaxis using them. The ZnO-based micromotors are highly sensitive to dissolved CO 2 in water, which enables the corrosion of ZnO to continuously occur by providing H + through hydration. Thus, they can autonomously move even in water exposed to air based on self-diffusiophoresis. Furthermore, they can sense the local CO 2 gradient and perform positive chemotaxis by self-reorientations under the phoretic torque. Our discovery opens a gate to developing intelligent micro/nanomotors powered by, and sensitive to, biocompatible atmospheric or endogenous gaseous chemicals for biomedical and environmental applications.},

  abstract     = {Magmatic liquids, including silicate and carbonate melts, are principal agents of mass and heat transfer in the Earth and terrestrial planets, and they play a crucial role in various geodynamic processes and in Earth&#39;s evolution. Electrical conductivity data of these melts elucidate the cause of electrical anomalies in Earth&#39;s interior and shed light on the melt structure. With the improvement in high-pressure experimental techniques and theoretical simulations, major progress has been made on this front in the past several decades. This review aims to summarize recent advances in experimental and theoretical studies on the electrical conductivity of silicate and carbonate melts of different compositions and volatile contents under high temperature and pressure. The electrical conductivity of silicate melts depends strongly on temperature, pressure, water content and the ratio of non-bridging oxygens to tetrahedral cations (NBO/T). By contrast, the electrical conductivity of carbonate melts exhibits a weak dependence on temperature and pressure due to their fully depolymerized structure. The electrical conductivity of carbonate melts is higher than that of silicate melts by at least two orders of magnitude. Water can increase electrical conductivity significantly and reduce the activation energy of silicate melts. Conversely, this effect is weak for carbonate melts. In addition, the replacement of alkali-earth elements (Ca 2+ or Mg 2+ ) with alkali elements causes a significant decrease in the electrical conductivity of carbonate melts. A distinct compensation trend is revealed for the electrical conductivity of silicate and carbonate melts under anhydrous and hydrous conditions. Several important applications of laboratory-based melt conductivity are introduced in order to understand the origin of high-conductivity anomalies in the Earth&#39;s mantle. Perspectives for future studies are also provided.},

  abstract     = {In early 2020, unprecedented lockdowns and travel bans were implemented in Chinese mainland to fight COVID-19, which led to a large reduction in anthropogenic emissions. This provided a unique opportunity to isolate the effects from emission and meteorology on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Comparing the atmospheric NO 2 in 2020 with that in 2017, we found the changes of emission have led to a 49.3 ± 23.5% reduction, which was ∼12% more than satellite-observed reduction of 37.8 ± 16.3%. The discrepancy was mainly a result of changes of meteorology, which have contributed to an 8.1 ± 14.2% increase of NO 2 . We also revealed that the emission-induced reduction of NO 2 has significantly negative correlations to human mobility, particularly that inside the city. The intra-city migration index derived from Baidu Location-Based-Service can explain 40.4% ± 17.7% variance of the emission-induced reduction of NO 2 in 29 megacities, each of which has a population of over 8 million in Chinese mainland.},

  abstract     = {With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics was completed. This description encompasses all known subatomic particles and their interactions. Much of the public interest in high-energy physics now focuses on experimental searches for ‘new physics’ beyond the Standard Model. Yet it would be a mistake to imagine that the Standard Model is now fully understood. Many questions remain about the ways in which known fundamental particles interact and unite, especially at the very high energies needed to produce the most exotic varieties, such as heavy quarks (quarks are the constituents of hadrons, which include the ordinary nuclear particles protons and neutrons) and heavy leptons (leptons are members of the family that includes electrons). The Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPC), operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences&#39; Institute of High Energy Physics, is one of the installations that are probing these questions. It has been running since 1988, using a detector called the Beijing Spectrometer (BES). (The site also houses the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility for conducting studies in condensed matter using intense X-rays.) Since 2008, these two instruments have been operating in upgraded form: the BESIII detector and BEPCII accelerator. The facility is now one of the key international centers for investigating the properties and behavior of new exotic hadrons, in particular those that include the charm quark. Italian physicist Luciano Maiani, Director of the European particle physics center CERN in Switzerland from 1999 to 2003, is one of the world leaders in this area of high-energy physics, and played a central role in the identification of the charm quark itself. NSR spoke to him about the aims of the latest work at the BEPCII, and the prospects for new discoveries.},

However, commercialized approaches such as evaporative crystallizers consume a large amount of electricity with a significant carbon footprint, leading to calls for alternative energy-efficient and eco-friendly strategies. Here, inspired by schooling fish, we demonstrate a collective system self-assembled by expanded polystyrene (EPS)-core/graphene oxide (GO)-shell particles, which enables autonomous, efficient and complete water-solute separation powered by sunlight. By taking advantage of surface tension, these tailored particles school together naturally and are bonded as a system to function collectively and coordinatively, to nucleate, grow and output salt crystals continuously and automatically out of even saturated brine, to complete water-solute separation. Solar-vapor conversion efficiency over 90% and salt production rate as high as 0.39 kg m –2 h –1 are achieved under 1-sun illumination for this system. It reduces the carbon footprint of ∼50 kg for treating 1-ton saturated brine compared with the commercialized approaches.},

  abstract     = {Extreme El Niño events severely disrupt the global climate, causing pronounced socio-economic losses. A prevailing view is that extreme El Niño events, defined by total precipitation or convection in the Niño3 area, will increase 2-fold in the future. However, this projected change was drawn without removing the potential impacts of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models’ common biases. Here, we find that the models’ systematic biases in simulating tropical climate change over the past century can reduce the reliability of the projected change in the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and its related extreme El Niño frequency. The projected Pacific SST change, after removing the impacts of 13 common biases, displays a ‘La Niña-like’ rather than ‘El Niño-like’ change. Consequently, the extreme El Niño frequency, which is highly linked to the zonal distribution of the Pacific SST change, would remain mostly unchanged under CMIP5 warming scenarios. This finding increases confidence in coping with climate risks associated with global warming.},

  abstract     = {Advances in development of artificial muscles have enabled creation of soft robots with biological dexterity and self-adaption in unstructured environments; however, production of scalable artificial muscles with multiple-mode actuations remains elusive. Inspired by muscle-fiber arrays in muscular hydrostats, we present a class of versatile artificial muscles called MAIPAMs (muscle-fiber array inspired pneumatic artificial muscles), capable of multiple-mode actuations (such as parallel elongation-bending-spiraling actuations, 10 parallel bending actuations and cascaded elongation-bending-spiraling actuations). Our MAIPAMs consist of active 3D elastomer-balloon arrays reinforced by a passive elastomer membrane, achieved through a planar design and one-step rolling fabrication approach. We introduce prototypical designs for the MAIPAMs and demonstrate their muscle-mimic structures and versatility, as well as their scalable ability to integrate flexible but non-stretchable layers for contraction and twisting actuation modes and compliant electrodes for self-sensing. We further demonstrate that this class of artificial muscles shows potential for versatile robotic applications, such as carrying a camera for recording videos, gripping or manipulating objects, and climbing a pipe-line.},

  abstract     = {Polarization-sensitive photodetection is central to optics applications and has been successfully demonstrated in photodetectors of two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as layered hybrid perovskites; however, achieving high polarization sensitivity in such a photodetector remains extremely challenging. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a high-performance polarization-sensitive photodetector using single-crystalline 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, namely, (4-AMP)(MA) 2 Pb 3 Br 10 /MAPbBr 3 (MA = methylammonium; 4-AMP = 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium), which exhibits ultrahigh polarization sensitivity up to 17.6 under self-driven mode. To our knowledge, such a high polarization selectivity has surpassed all of the reported perovskite-based devices, and is comparable to, or even better than, the traditional inorganic heterostructure-based photodetectors. Further studies reveal that the built-in electric field formed at the junction can spatially separate the photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing the performance for polarization-sensitive photodetection. This work provides a new source of polarization-sensitive materials and insights into designing novel optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {The global deposition of superheavy pyrite (pyrite isotopically heavier than coeval seawater sulfate in the Neoproterozoic Era and particularly in the Cryogenian Period) defies explanation using the canonical marine sulfur cycle system. Here we report petrographic and sulfur isotopic data (δ 34 S py ) of superheavy pyrite from the Cryogenian Datangpo Formation (660–650 Ma) in South China. Our data indicate a syndepositional/early diagenetic origin of the Datangpo superheavy pyrite, with 34 S-enriched H 2 S supplied from sulfidic (H 2 S rich) seawater. Instructed by a novel sulfur-cycling model, we propose that the emission of 34 S-depleted volatile organosulfur compounds (VOSC) that were generated via sulfide methylation may have contributed to the formation of 34 S-enriched sulfidic seawater and superheavy pyrite. The global emission of VOSC may be attributed to enhanced organic matter production after the Sturtian glaciation in the context of widespread sulfidic conditions. These findings demonstrate that VOSC cycling is an important component of the sulfur cycle in Proterozoic oceans.},

Our analyses confirm theoretical predictions that temperature, precipitation, and plant height and density jointly regulate the quotient of leaf biomass and total biomass, and that they have a much weaker effect on shoot (leaf plus stem) biomass fractions at a global scale. Moreover, biotic factors have larger effects than abiotic factors. Climatic variables act equally on shoot and root growth, and differences in plant body size and age, as well as community species composition, which vary with climate in ways that drown out the variations in biomass fractions. The theory and data presented here provide mechanistic explanations of why climate has little effect on biomass fractions.},

However, the role of ARID2 in the pathogenesis of LUADs remains largely unknown. Here we find that ARID2 expression is decreased during the malignant progression of both human and mice LUADs. Using two Kras G12D -based genetically engineered murine models, we demonstrate that ARID2 knockout significantly promotes lung cancer malignant progression and shortens overall survival. Consistently, ARID2 knockdown significantly promotes cell proliferation in human and mice lung cancer cells. Through integrative analyses of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data, we find that Hspa1a is up-regulated by Arid2 loss. Knockdown of Hspa1a specifically inhibits malignant progression of Arid2 -deficient but not Arid2 -wt lung cancers in both cell lines as well as animal models. Treatment with an HSPA1A inhibitor could significantly inhibit the malignant progression of lung cancer with ARID2 deficiency. Together, our findings establish ARID2 as an important tumor suppressor in LUADs with novel mechanistic insights, and further identify HSPA1A as a potential therapeutic target in ARID2-deficient LUADs.},

The review gives a valuable summary of new insights into the matching between SCR catalyst design principles and the characteristics of Cu 2+ -exchanged zeolitic catalysts, highlighting the significant opportunity presented by zeolite-based catalysts. Principles for designing zeolites with excellent NH 3 -SCR performance and hydrothermal stability are proposed. On the basis of these principles, more hydrothermally stable Cu-AEI and Cu-LTA zeolites are elaborated as well as other alternative zeolites applied to NH 3 -SCR.

Satellite-based aerosol optical depth has been used to estimate PM 2.5 , but estimations have largely been undermined by massive missing values, low sampling frequency and weak predictive capability. Here, using a novel feature engineering approach to incorporate spatial effects from meteorological data, we developed a robust LightGBM model that predicts PM 2.5 at an unprecedented predictive capacity on hourly (R 2 = 0.75), daily (R 2 = 0.84), monthly (R 2 = 0.88) and annual (R 2 = 0.87) timescales. By taking advantage of spatial features, our model can also construct hourly gridded networks of PM 2.5 . This capability would be further enhanced if meteorological observations from regional stations were incorporated. Our results show that this model has great potential in reconstructing historical PM 2.5 datasets and real-time gridded networks at high spatial-temporal resolutions. The resulting datasets can be assimilated into models to produce long-term re-analysis that incorporates interactions between aerosols and physical processes.},

Regarded as an attractive capacity-boosting strategy, triggering the O-related anionic redox activity has not been achieved within a sealed KIB system. Herein, in contrast to the typical gaseous open K-O 2 battery (O 2 /KO 2 redox), we originally realize the reversible superoxide/peroxide (KO 2 /K 2 O 2 ) interconversion on a KO 2 -based cathode. Controlled within a sealed cell environment, the irreversible O 2 evolution and electrolyte decomposition (induced by superoxide anion (O 2 − ) formation) are effectively restrained. Rationally controlling the reversible depth-of-charge at 300 mAh/g (based on the mass of KO 2 ), no obvious cell degradation can be observed during 900 cycles. Moreover, benefitting from electrolyte modification, the KO 2 -based cathode is coupled with a limited amount of K-metal anode (merely 2.5 times excess), harvesting a K-metal full-cell with high energy efficiency (∼90%) and long-term cycling stability (over 300 cycles).},

We uncover a type of transient synchronization behavior in spatial ecological networks whose local dynamics are of the chaotic, predator–prey type. In the parameter regime where there is phase synchronization among all the patches, complete synchronization (i.e. synchronization in both phase and amplitude) can arise in certain pairs of patches as determined by the network symmetry—henceforth the phenomenon of  ‘synchronization within synchronization.’ Distinct patterns of complete synchronization coexist but, due to intrinsic instability or noise, each pattern is a transient and there is random, intermittent switching among the patterns in the course of time evolution. The probability distribution of the transient time is found to follow an algebraic scaling law with a divergent average transient lifetime. Based on symmetry considerations, we develop a stability analysis to understand these phenomena. The general principle of symmetry can also be exploited to explain previously discovered, counterintuitive synchronization behaviors in ecological networks.},

By controlling the phase of the temporal slits with an external field, a time domain interferometer that preserves both attosecond temporal resolution and hundreds of meV energy resolution is implemented. We apply this exceptional temporal resolution to reconstruct the waveform of an arbitrarily polarized optical pulse, and utilize the provided energy resolution to interrogate the abnormal character of the transition dipole near the Cooper minimum in argon.

  abstract     = {With the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks worldwide, research on sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications has commenced. It is expected that 6G networks can accommodate numerous heterogeneous devices and infrastructures with enhanced efficiency and security over diverse, e.g. spectrum, computing and storage, resources. However, this goal is impeded by a number of trust-related issues that are often neglected in network designs. Blockchain, as an innovative and revolutionary technology that has arisen in the recent decade, provides a promising solution. Building on its nature of decentralization, transparency, anonymity, immutability, traceability and resiliency, blockchain can establish cooperative trust among separate network entities and facilitate, e.g. efficient resource sharing, trusted data interaction, secure access control, privacy protection, and tracing, certification and supervision functionalities for wireless networks, thus presenting a new paradigm towards 6G. This paper is dedicated to blockchain-enabled wireless communication technologies. We first provide a brief introduction to the fundamentals of blockchain, and then we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the most recent efforts in incorporating blockchain into wireless communications from several aspects. Importantly, we further propose a unified framework of the blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) as a trustworthy and secure paradigm for 6G networking by utilizing blockchain technologies with enhanced efficiency and security. The critical elements of B-RAN, such as consensus mechanisms, smart contract, trustworthy access, mathematical modeling, cross-network sharing, data tracking and auditing and intelligent networking, are elaborated. We also provide the prototype design of B-RAN along with the latest experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The multi-metallene with an ultrahigh surface area has great potential in precise tuning of surface heterogeneous d-electronic correlation by surface strain effect for the distinctive surface electronic structure, which is a brand new class of promising 2D electrocatalyst for sustainable energy device application. However, achieving such an atomically thin multi-metallene still presents a great challenge. Herein, we present a new synthetic method for an atomic-level palladium-iridium (PdIr) bimetallene with an average thickness of only ∼1.0 nm for achieving superior catalysis in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). The curved PdIr bimetallene presents a top-ranked high electrochemical active area of 127.5 ± 10.8 m 2 g Pd+Ir −1 in the reported noble alloy materials, and exhibits a very low overpotential, ultrahigh activity and improved stability for HER and FAOR. DFT calculation reveals that the PdIr bimetallene herein has a unique lattice tangential strain, which can induce surface distortion while concurrently creating a variety of concave-convex featured micro-active regions formed by variously coordinated Pd sites agglomeration. Such a strong strain effect correlates the abnormal on-site active 4d 10 -t 2g -orbital Coulomb correlation potential and directly elevates orbital-electronegativity exposure within these active regions, resulting in a preeminent barrier-free energetic path for significant enhancement of FAOR and HER catalytic performance.},

Here we design a strong yet ductile carbon cage from an easily processing capillary shrinkage of graphene hydrogel followed by precise tailoring of inner voids. Such a structure, analog to the stable structure of plant cells, presents ‘imperfection-tolerance’ to volume variation of irregular Si microparticles, maintaining the electrode integrity over 1000 cycles with Coulombic efficiency over 99.5%. This design enables the use of a dense and thick (3 mAh cm –2 ) microparticulate Si anode with an ultra-high volumetric energy density of 1048 Wh L –1 achieved at pouch full-cell level coupled with a LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathode.},

However, whether and how synaptic associativity are implemented into context-dependent relapse of extinguished memory (i.e. fear renewal) is unknown. Here, using an auditory fear conditioning paradigm in mice, we show that fear renewal is determined by the associativity between convergent inputs from the auditory cortex (ACx) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) onto the lateral amygdala (LA) that reactivate ensembles engaged during learning. Fear renewal enhances synaptic strengths of both ACx to LA and the previously unknown vHPC to LA monosynaptic inputs. While inactivating either of the afferents abolishes fear renewal, optogenetic activation of their input associativity in the LA recapitulates fear renewal. Thus, input associativity underlies fear memory renewal.},

However, previous data limitations have prevented a robust evaluation of the global rates and mechanisms driving C accumulation. Here, we go beyond recent soil C stock estimates to reveal global tidal wetland C accumulation and predict changes under relative sea level rise, temperature and precipitation. We use data from literature study sites and our new observations spanning wide latitudinal gradients and 20 countries. Globally, tidal wetlands accumulate 53.65 (95%CI: 48.52–59.01) Tg C yr −1 , which is ∼30% of the organic C buried on the ocean floor. Modeling based on current climatic drivers and under projected emissions scenarios revealed a net increase in the global C accumulation by 2100. This rapid increase is driven by sea level rise in tidal marshes, and higher temperature and precipitation in mangroves. Countries with large areas of coastal wetlands, like Indonesia and Mexico, are more susceptible to tidal wetland C losses under climate change, while regions such as Australia, Brazil, the USA and China will experience a significant C accumulation increase under all projected scenarios.},

To date, however, the manipulation of hot electrons has been mostly based on conceptual interpretations rather than a direct observation. The problem arises from a fundamental fact that energy-differential electrons are mixed up in real-space, making it hard to distinguish them from each other by standard measurements. Here we demonstrate a distinct approach to artificially (spatially) separate hot electrons from cold ones in semiconductor nanowire transistors, which thus offers a unique opportunity to observe and modulate electron occupied state, energy, mobility and even path. Such a process is accomplished through the scanning-photocurrent-microscopy measurements by activating the intervalley-scattering events and 1D charge-neutrality rule. Findings here may provide a new degree of freedom in manipulating non-equilibrium electrons for both electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Metal halide perovskites possess unique atomic and electronic configurations that endow them with high defect tolerance and enable high-performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Perovskite light-emitting diodes have achieved an external quantum efficiency of over 20%. Despite tremendous progress, fundamental questions remain, such as how structural distortion affects the optical properties. Addressing their relationships is considerably challenging due to the scarcity of effective diagnostic tools during structural and property tuning as well as the limited tunability achievable by conventional methods. Here, using pressure and chemical methods to regulate the metal off-centering distortion, we demonstrate the giant tunability of photoluminescence (PL) in both the intensity (&gt;20 times) and wavelength (&gt;180 nm/GPa) in the highly distorted halide perovskites [CH 3 NH 3 GeI 3 , HC(NH 2 ) 2 GeI 3 , and CsGeI 3 ]. Using advanced in situ high-pressure probes and first-principles calculations, we quantitatively reveal a universal relationship whereby regulating the level of off-centering distortion towards 0.2 leads to the best PL performance in the halide perovskites. By applying this principle, intense PL can still be induced by substituting CH 3 NH 3 + with Cs + to control the distortion in (CH 3 NH 3 ) 1-x Cs x GeI 3 , where the chemical substitution plays a similar role as external pressure. The compression of a fully substituted sample of CsGeI 3 further tunes the distortion to the optimal value at 0.7 GPa, which maximizes the emission with a 10-fold enhancement. This work not only demonstrates a quantitative relationship between structural distortion and PL property of the halide perovskites but also illustrates the use of knowledge gained from high-pressure research to achieve the desired properties by ambient methods.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic lethality was proposed nearly a century ago by geneticists and recently applied to develop precision anti-cancer therapies. To exploit the synthetic lethality concept in the design of chemical anti-cancer agents, we developed a bio-orthogonally catalyzed lethality (BCL) strategy to generate targeting anti-tumor metallodrugs both in vitro and in vivo. Metallodrug Ru-rhein was generated from two non-toxic species Ru-N 3 and rhein-alkyne via exclusive endogenous copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction without the need of an external copper catalyst. The non-toxic species Ru-arene complex Ru-N 3 and rhein-alkyne were designed to perform this strategy, and the mitochondrial targeting product Ru-rhein was generated in high yield (&gt;83%) and showed high anti-tumor efficacy in vitro . This BCL strategy achieved a remarkable tumor suppression effect on the tumor-bearing mice models. It is interesting that the combination of metal-arene complexes with rhein via CuAAC reaction could transform two non-toxic species into a targeting anti-cancer metallodrug both in vitro and in vivo , while the product Ru-rhein was non-toxic towards normal cells. This is the first example that exclusive endogenous copper was used to generate metal-based anti-cancer drugs for cancer treatment. The anti-cancer mechanism of Ru-rhein was studied and autophagy was induced by increased reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial damage. The generality of this BCL strategy was also studied and it could be extended to other metal complexes such as Os-arene and Ir-arene complexes. Compared with the traditional methods for cancer treatment, this work presented a new approach to generating targeting metallodrugs in vivo via the BCL strategy from non-toxic species in metal-based chemotherapy.},

  abstract     = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for most cytoplasmic signaling in response to extracellular ligands with different efficacy profiles. Various spectroscopic techniques have identified that agonists exhibiting varying efficacies can selectively stabilize a specific conformation of the receptor. However, the structural basis for activation of the GPCR-G protein complex by ligands with different efficacies is incompletely understood. To better understand the structural basis underlying the mechanisms by which ligands with varying efficacies differentially regulate the conformations of receptors and G proteins, we determined the structures of β 2 AR-Gα s β γ bound with partial agonist salbutamol or bound with full agonist isoprenaline using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy at resolutions of 3.26 Å and 3.80 Å, respectively. Structural comparisons between the β 2 AR-Gs-salbutamol and β 2 AR-Gs-isoprenaline complexes demonstrated that the decreased binding affinity and efficacy of salbutamol compared with those of isoprenaline might be attributed to weakened hydrogen bonding interactions, attenuated hydrophobic interactions in the orthosteric binding pocket and different conformational changes in the rotamer toggle switch in TM6. Moreover, the observed stronger interactions between the intracellular loop 2 or 3 (ICL2 or ICL3) of β 2 AR and Gα s with binding of salbutamol versus isoprenaline might decrease phosphorylation in the salbutamol-activated β 2 AR-Gs complex. From the observed structural differences between these complexes of β 2 AR, a mechanism of β 2 AR activation by partial and full agonists is proposed to provide structural insights into β 2 AR desensitization.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale low-cost synthesis methods for potassium ion battery (PIB) anodes with long cycle life and high capacity have remained challenging. Here, inspired by the structure of a biological cell, biomimetic carbon cells (BCCs) were synthesized and used as PIB anodes. The protruding carbon nanotubes across the BCC wall mimicked the ion-transporting channels present in the cell membrane, and enhanced the rate performance of PIBs. In addition, the robust carbon shell of the BCC could protect its overall structure, and the open space inside the BCC could accommodate the volume changes caused by K + insertion, which greatly improved the stability of PIBs. For the first time, a stable solid electrolyte interphase layer is formed on the surface of amorphous carbon. Collectively, the unique structural characteristics of the BCCs resulted in PIBs that showed a high reversible capacity (302 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 and 248 mAh g −1 at 500 mA g −1 ), excellent cycle stability (reversible capacity of 226 mAh g −1 after 2100 cycles and a continuous running time of more than 15 months at a current density of 100 mA g −1 ), and an excellent rate performance (160 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 ). This study represents a new strategy for boosting battery performance, and could pave the way for the next generation of battery-powered applications.},

  abstract     = {The Himalaya are among the youngest and highest mountains in the world, but the exact timing of their uplift and origins of their biodiversity are still in debate. The Himalayan region is a relatively small area but with exceptional diversity and endemism. One common hypothesis to explain the rich montane diversity is uplift-driven diversification—that orogeny creates conditions favoring rapid in situ speciation of resident lineages. We test this hypothesis in the Himalayan region using amphibians and reptiles, two environmentally sensitive vertebrate groups. In addition, analysis of diversification of the herpetofauna provides an independent source of information to test competing geological hypotheses of Himalayan orogenesis. We conclude that the origins of the Himalayan herpetofauna date to the early Paleocene, but that diversification of most groups was concentrated in the Miocene. There was an increase in both rates and modes of diversification during the early to middle Miocene, together with regional interchange (dispersal) between the Himalaya and adjacent regions. Our analyses support a recently proposed stepwise geological model of Himalayan uplift beginning in the Paleocene, with a subsequent rapid increase of uplifting during the Miocene, finally giving rise to the intensification of the modern South Asian Monsoon.},

Anchoring LnCo 3 on phosphorus-doped graphitic carbon nitrides (PCN) shows efficient overall water splitting without any sacrificial reagents. The NdCo 3 /PCN-c photocatalyst exhibits excellent water splitting activity and a quantum efficiency of 2.0% at 350 nm. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed the transfer of a photoexcited electron and hole into the PCN and LnCo 3 for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. A density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed the cooperative water activation on lanthanide and O−O bond formation on transition metal for water oxidation. This work not only prepares a synthetic model of a bio-inspired oxygen-evolving center but also provides an effective strategy to realize light-driven overall water splitting.},

Here, we report an anomalous strain effect on the thermal conductivity of monolayer silicene, a representative low-buckled two-dimensional (LB-2D) material. ReaxFF-based molecular dynamics simulations are performed to show that biaxially stretched monolayer silicene exhibits a remarkable increase in thermal conductivity, by as much as 10 times the freestanding value, with increasing applied strain in the range of [0, 0.1], which is attributed to increased contributions from long-wavelength phonons. A further increase in strain in the range of [0.11, 0.18] results in a plateau of the thermal conductivity in an oscillatory manner, governed by a unique dynamic bonding behavior under extreme loading. This anomalous effect reveals new physical insights into the thermal properties of LB-2D materials and may provide some guidelines for designing heat management and energy conversion devices based on such materials.},

However, despite recent developments, large-scale fabrication with a continuous synthetic methodology, which could produce core-sheath hydrogel fibers with the desired optical and mechanical properties suitable for deep-tissue applications, has yet to be achieved. In this study, we report a versatile concept of integrated light-triggered dynamic wet spinning capable of continuously producing core-sheath hydrogel optical fibers with tunable fiber diameters, and mechanical and optical propagation properties. Furthermore, this concept also exhibited versatility for various kinds of core-sheath functional fibers. The wet spinning synthetic procedure and fabrication process were optimized with the rational design of the core/sheath material interface compatibility [core = poly(ethylene glycol diacrylate- co -acrylamide); sheath = Ca-alginate], optical transparency, refractive index and spinning solution viscosity. The resulting hydrogel optical fibers exhibited desirable low optical attenuation (0.18 ± 0.01 dB cm −1 with 650 nm laser light), excellent biocompatibility and tissue-like Young&#39;s modulus (&lt;2.60 MPa). The optical waveguide hydrogel fibers were successfully employed for deep-tissue cancer therapy and brain optogenetic stimulation, confirming that they could serve as an efficient versatile tool for diverse deep-tissue therapy and brain optogenetic applications.},

  abstract     = {Aerospace milestones in human history, including returning to the moon and manned Martian missions, have been implemented in recent years. Space exploration has become one of the global common goals, and to ensure the survival and development of human beings in the extraterrestrial extreme environment has been becoming the basic ability and technology of manned space exploration. For the purpose of fulfilling the goal of extraterrestrial survival, researchers in Nanjing University and the China Academy of Space Technology proposed extraterrestrial artificial photosynthesis (EAP) technology. By simulating the natural photosynthesis of green plants on the Earth, EAP converts CO 2 /H 2 O into fuel and O 2 in an in-situ , accelerated and controllable manner by using waste CO 2 in the confined space of spacecraft, or abundant CO 2 resources in extraterrestrial celestial environments, e.g. Mars. Thus, the material loading of manned spacecraft can be greatly reduced to support affordable and sustainable deep space exploration. In this paper, EAP technology is compared with existing methods of converting CO 2 /H 2 O into fuel and O 2 in the aerospace field, especially the Sabatier method and Bosch reduction method. The research progress of possible EAP materials for in-situ utilization of extraterrestrial resources are also discussed in depth. Finally, this review lists the challenges that the EAP process may encounter, which need to be focused on for future implementation and application. We expect to deepen the understanding of artificial photosynthetic materials and technologies, and aim to strongly support the development of manned spaceflight.},

Implications of OIHP polarity to photovoltaic conversion are also discussed, and new insights gained through research efforts. In the future, integration of a local scanning probe with global macroscopic measurements in situ will provide invaluable microscopic insight into the intriguing macroscopic phenomena, while synchrotron diffractions and scanning transmission electron microscopy on more stable samples may ultimately settle the debate.},

To mitigate viral escape, we developed a cocktail of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting epitopes located on different domains of spike (S) protein. Screening of a library of monoclonal antibodies generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 convalescent patients yielded potent NAbs, targeting the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD domain of S, effective at nM concentrations. Remarkably, a combination of RBD-targeting NAbs and NTD-binding NAbs, FC05, enhanced the neutralization potency in cell-based assays and an animal model. Results of competitive surface plasmon resonance assays and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of antigen-binding fragments bound to S unveil determinants of immunogenicity. Combinations of immunogens, identified in the NTD and RBD of S, when immunized in rabbits and macaques, elicited potent protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, two immunizations of this combination of NTD and RBD immunogens provided complete protection in macaques against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. These results provide a proof of concept for neutralization-based immunogen design targeting SARS-CoV-2 NTD and RBD.},

  abstract     = {Photosystem II (PSII) is a fascinating photosynthesis-involved enzyme, participating in sunlight-harvest, water splitting, oxygen release, and proton/electron generation and transfer. Scientists have been inspired to couple PSII with synthetic hierarchical structures via biomimetic assembly, facilitating attainment of natural photosynthesis processes, such as photocatalytic water splitting, electron transfer and ATP synthesis, in vivo . In the past decade, there has been significant progress in PSII-based biomimetic systems, such as artificial chloroplasts and photoelectrochemical cells. The biomimetic assembly approach helps PSII gather functions and properties from synthetic materials, resulting in a complex with partly natural and partly synthetic components. PSII-based biomimetic assembly offers opportunities to forward semi-biohybrid research and synchronously inspire optimization of artificial light-harvest micro/nanodevices. This review summarizes recent studies on how PSII combines with artificial structures via molecular assembly and highlights PSII-based semi-natural biosystems which arise from synthetic parts and natural components. Moreover, we discuss the challenges and remaining problems for PSII-based systems and the outlook for their development and applications. We believe this topic provides inspiration for rational designs to develop biomimetic PSII-based semi-natural devices and further reveal the secrets of energy conversion within natural photosynthesis from the molecular level.},

However, the commercialization of this class of emerging materials still faces serious challenges, one of which is the instability against external stimuli such as moisture, heat and irradiation. Much focus has deservedly been placed on understanding the different origins of intrinsic instability and thereby enhancing their stability. Among these, tensile strain in perovskite films is an important source of instability that cannot be overcome using conventionally extrinsic stabilization approaches such as encapsulation. Here we review recent progress in the understanding of the origin of strain in perovskites as well as its corresponding characterization methods, and their impacts on the physical properties of perovskites and the performance of PSCs including efficiency and stability. We then summarize the latest advances in strain-regulation strategies that improve the intrinsic stability of perovskites and photovoltaic devices. Finally, we provide a perspective on how to make further progress in stable and high-efficiency PSCs via strain engineering.},

  abstract     = {Developing photovoltaic materials with simple chemical structures and easy synthesis still remains a major challenge in the industrialization process of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, an ester substituted poly(thiophene vinylene) derivative, PTVT-T, was designed and synthesized in very few steps by adopting commercially available raw materials. The ester groups on the thiophene units enable PTVT-T to have a planar and stable conformation. Moreover, PTVT-T presents a wide absorption band and strong aggregation effect in solution, which are the key characteristics needed to realize high performance in non-fullerene-acceptor (NFA)-based OSCs. We then prepared OSCs by blending PTVT-T with three representative fullerene- and NF-based acceptors, PC 71 BM, IT-4F and BTP-eC9. It was found that PTVT-T can work well with all the acceptors, showing great potential to match new emerging NFAs. Particularly, a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 16.20% is achieved in a PTVT-T:BTP-eC9-based device, which is the highest value among the counterparts based on PTV derivatives. This work demonstrates that PTVT-T shows great potential for the future commercialization of OSCs.},

  abstract     = {A series of ternary organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are fabricated with one wide bandgap polymer D18-Cl as donor, and well compatible Y6 and Y6-1O as acceptor. The open-circuit-voltage ( V OC ) of ternary OPVs is monotonously increased along with the incorporation of Y6-1O, indicating that the alloy state should be formed between Y6 and Y6-1O due to their excellent compatibility. The energy loss can be minimized by incorporating Y6-1O, leading to the V OC improvement of ternary OPVs. By finely adjusting the Y6-1O content, a power conversion efficiency of 17.91% is achieved in the optimal ternary OPVs with 30 wt% Y6-1O in acceptors, resulting from synchronously improved short-circuit-current density ( J SC ) of 25.87 mA cm −2 , fill factor (FF) of 76.92% and V OC of 0.900 V in comparison with those of D18-Cl : Y6 binary OPVs. The J SC and FF improvement of ternary OPVs should be ascribed to comprehensively optimal photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge transport in ternary active layers. The more efficient charge separation and transport process in ternary active layers can be confirmed by the magneto-photocurrent and impedance spectroscopy experimental results, respectively. This work provides new insight into constructing highly efficient ternary OPVs with well compatible Y6 and its derivative as acceptor.},

However, the parasitic light absorption of catalysts and metal layers in the MIS junction, as well as the lack of low work function metals to form a large band offset with p-Si, severely limit their performance. This paper describes an MIS photocathode fabricated from n-Si, rather than the commonly used p-Si, to spatially decouple light absorption from reaction sites, which enables the majority carriers, instead of the commonly used minority carriers, to drive the surface reaction, making it possible to place the reaction sites far away from the light absorption region. Thus, the catalysts could be moved to the backside of the MIS junction to avoid light shielding. Moreover, the adoption of n-Si unlocks a variety of high work function materials for photovoltage generation. The obtained n-Si MIS photocathode exhibits an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 10.26% with a stability up to 300 h.},

However, many far-reaching policies in China have been targeting these deficiencies since then, providing a perspective on how a country approaches sustainable development by promoting evenness among all SDGs.

This heterojunction system can be fabricated by two simple deposition steps. Under unilateral illumination, the TiO 2 /C 3 N 4 heterojunction nanotube membrane can generate a photocurrent of about 9 μA/cm 2 , corresponding to a pumping stream of ∼5500 ions per second per nanotube. By changing the position of TiO 2 and C 3 N 4 , a reverse equivalent ionic current can also be realized. Directional transport of photogenerated electrons and holes results in a transmembrane potential, which is the basis of the light-driven ion transport phenomenon. As a proof of concept, we also show that this system can be used for enhanced osmotic energy generation. The artificial light-driven ion transport system proposed here offers a further step forward on the roadmap for development of ionic photoelectric conversion and integration into other applications, for example water desalination.},

  abstract     = {After the significant discovery of the hole-doped nickelate compound Nd 0.8 Sr 0.2 NiO 2 , analyses of the electronic structure, orbital components, Fermi surfaces and band topology could be helpful to understand the mechanism of its superconductivity. Based on first-principle calculations, we find that Ni 3 d x 2 − y 2 states contribute the largest Fermi surface. The L n 5 d 3 z 2 − r 2 states form an electron pocket at Γ, while 5 d xy states form a relatively bigger electron pocket at A. These Fermi surfaces and symmetry characteristics can be reproduced by our two-band model, which consists of two elementary band representations: B 1 g @1 a ⊕ A 1 g @1 b . We find that there is a band inversion near A, giving rise to a pair of Dirac points along M-A below the Fermi level upon including spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we perform density functional theory based Gutzwiller (DFT+Gutzwiller) calculations to treat the strong correlation effect of Ni 3d orbitals. In particular, the bandwidth of 3 d x 2 − y 2 has been renormalized largely. After the renormalization of the correlated bands, the Ni 3 d xy states and the Dirac points become very close to the Fermi level. Thus, a hole pocket at A could be introduced by hole doping, which may be related to the observed sign change of the Hall coefficient. By introducing an additional Ni 3 d xy orbital, the hole-pocket band and the band inversion can be captured in our modified model. Besides, the nontrivial band topology in the ferromagnetic two-layer compound La 3 Ni 2 O 6 is discussed and the band inversion is associated with Ni 3 d x 2 − y 2 and La 5 d xy orbitals.},

  abstract     = {Development of novel catalysts for nitrogen reduction at ambient pressures and temperatures with ultrahigh ammonia (NH 3 ) yield and selectivity is challenging. In this work, an atomic catalyst with separated Pd atoms on graphdiyne (Pd-GDY) was synthesized, which shows fascinating electrocatalytic properties for nitrogen reduction. The catalyst has the highest average NH 3 yield of 4.45 ± 0.30 mg NH3 mg Pd −1 h −1 , almost tens of orders larger than for previously reported catalysts, and 100% reaction selectivity in neutral media. Pd-GDY exhibits almost no decreases in NH 3 yield and Faradaic efficiency. Density functional theory calculations show that the reaction pathway prefers to perform at the (Pd, C1, C2) active area because of the strongly coupled (Pd, C1, C2), which elevates the selectivity via enhanced electron transfer. By adjusting the p–d coupling accurately, reduction of self-activated nitrogen is promoted by anchoring atom selection, and side effects are minimized.},

  abstract     = {Marine diatoms construct their hierarchically ordered, three-dimensional (3D) external structures called frustules through precise biomineralization processes. Recapitulating the remarkable architectures and functions of diatom frustules in artificial materials is a major challenge that has important technological implications for hierarchically ordered composites. Here, we report the construction of highly ordered, mineralized composites based on fabrication of complex self-supporting porous structures—made of genetically engineered amyloid fusion proteins and the natural polysaccharide chitin—and performing in situ multiscale protein-mediated mineralization with diverse inorganic materials, including SiO 2 , TiO 2 and Ga 2 O 3 . Subsequently, using sugar cubes as templates, we demonstrate that 3D fabricated porous structures can become colonized by engineered bacteria and can be functionalized with highly photoreactive minerals, thereby enabling co-localization of the photocatalytic units with a bacteria-based hydrogenase reaction for a successful semi-solid artificial photosynthesis system for hydrogen evolution. Our study thus highlights the power of coupling genetically engineered proteins and polysaccharides with biofabrication techniques to generate hierarchically organized mineralized porous structures inspired by nature.},

We review research, including species catalogues; biodiversity monitoring; the origins, distributions, maintenance and threats to biodiversity; biodiversity-related ecosystem function and services; and species and ecosystems’ responses to global change. Next, we identify priority topics and offer suggestions and priorities for future biodiversity research in China. These priorities include (i) the ecology and biogeography of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and surrounding mountains, and that of subtropical and tropical forests across China; (ii) marine and inland aquatic biodiversity; and (iii) effective conservation and management to identify and maintain synergies between biodiversity and socio-economic development to fulfil China&#39;s vision for becoming an ecological civilization. In addition, we propose three future strategies: (i) translate advanced biodiversity science into practice for biodiversity conservation; (ii) strengthen capacity building and application of advanced technologies, including high-throughput sequencing, genomics and remote sensing; and (iii) strengthen and expand international collaborations. Based on the recent rapid progress of biodiversity research, China is well positioned to become a global leader in biodiversity research in the near future.},

We generated Snx14 -deficient mouse models and observed severe motor deficits and cell-autonomous Purkinje cell degeneration. SNX14 deficiency disrupted microtubule organization and mitochondrial transport in axons by destabilizing the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin, which is implicated in dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia, and compromised axonal integrity and mitochondrial function. Axonal transport disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction further led to degeneration of high-energy-demanding Purkinje cells, which resulted in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia. The antiepileptic drug valproate ameliorated motor deficits and cerebellar degeneration in Snx14 -deficient mice via the restoration of mitochondrial transport and function in Purkinje cells. Our study revealed an unprecedented role for SNX14-dependent axonal transport in cerebellar ataxia, demonstrated the convergence of SNX14 and spastin in mitochondrial dysfunction, and suggested valproate as a potential therapeutic agent.},

Widespread coal burning in rural households and a photo-assisted process were the primary source of BrCl and other bromine gases. BrCl contributed about 55% of both bromine and chlorine atoms. The halogen atoms increased the abundance of ‘conventional’ tropospheric oxidants (OH, HO 2 and RO 2 ) by 26%–73%, and enhanced oxidation of hydrocarbon by nearly a factor of two and the net ozone production by 55%.

  abstract     = {Under ambient conditions, the only known valence state of calcium ions is +2, and the corresponding crystals with calcium ions are insulating and nonferromagnetic. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we report direct observation of two-dimensional (2D) CaCl crystals on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) membranes, in which the calcium ions are only monovalent (i.e. +1). Remarkably, metallic rather than insulating properties are displayed by those CaCl crystals. More interestingly, room-temperature ferromagnetism, graphene–CaCl heterojunction, coexistence of piezoelectricity-like property and metallicity, as well as the distinct hydrogen storage and release capability of the CaCl crystals in rGO membranes are experimentally demonstrated. We note that such CaCl crystals are obtained by simply incubating rGO membranes in salt solutions below the saturated concentration, under ambient conditions. Theoretical studies suggest that the formation of those abnormal crystals is attributed to the strong cation-π interactions of the Ca cations with the aromatic rings in the graphene surfaces. The findings highlight the realistic potential applications of such abnormal CaCl material with unusual electronic properties in designing novel transistors and magnetic devices, hydrogen storage, catalyzers, high-performance conducting electrodes and sensors, with a size down to atomic scale.},

  abstract     = {The minimized diffusion limitation and completely exposed strong acid sites of the ultrathin zeolites make it an industrially important catalyst especially for converting bulky molecules. However, the structure-controlled and large-scale synthesis of the material is still a challenge. In this work, the direct synthesis of the single-layer MWW zeolite was demonstrated by using hexamethyleneimine and amphiphilic organosilane as structure-directing agents. Characterization results confirmed the formation of the single-layer MWW zeolite with high crystallinity and excellent thermal/hydrothermal stability. The formation mechanism was rigorously revealed as the balanced rates between the nucleation/growth of the MWW nanocrystals and the incorporation of the organosilane into the MWW unit cell, which is further supported by the formation of MWW nanosheets with tunable thickness via simply changing synthesis conditions. The commercially available reagents, well-controlled structure and the high catalytic stability for the alkylation of benzene with 1-dodecene make it an industrially important catalyst.},

Regenerated isotropic wood (RGI-wood) exceeds the limitations of the anisotropic and inconsistent mechanical properties of natural wood, having isotropic flexural strength of ∼170 MPa and flexural modulus of ∼10 GPa. RGI-wood also shows superior water resistance and fire retardancy properties to natural pine wood.

  abstract     = {Metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer deaths in many tumor types including breast cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the driving force for the occurrence and progression of metastasis, however, no targeted strategies to block the EMT program are currently available to combat metastasis. Diverse engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have been reported to exert promising anti-cancer effects, however, no ENMs have been designed to target EMT. Palladium (Pd) nanomaterials, a type of ENM, have received substantial attention in nanomedicine due to their favorable photothermal performance for cancer therapeutics. Herein, Pd nanoplates (PdPL) were found to be preferentially biodistributed to both primary tumors and metastatic tumors. Importantly, PdPL showed a significant inhibition of lung metastasis with and without near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that EMT was significantly compromised in breast cancer cells upon the PdPL treatment, which was partially due to the inhibition of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. Strikingly, the PdPL was found to directly interact with TGF-β proteins to diminish TGF-β functions in activating its downstream signaling, as evidenced by the reduced phosphorylation of Smad2. Notably, TGF-β-independent pathways were also involved in undermining EMT and other important biological processes that are necessary for metastasis. Additionally, NIR irradiation elicited synergistic effects on PdPL-induced inhibition of primary tumors and metastasis. In summary, these results revealed that the PdPL remarkably curbed metastasis by inhibiting EMT signaling, thereby indicating the promising potential of PdPL as a therapeutic agent for treating breast cancer metastasis.},

Conventional cancer chemotherapy based on nanomaterials has been hindered by their low drug loading and poor penetration in tumor tissue. To overcome these difficulties, novel materials systems are urgently needed. Hereby, the lanthanide-based porphyrin metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (NSs) with promising cancer imaging/chemotherapy capacities are fabricated, which display superior performance in the drug loading and tumor tissue penetration. The biodegradable PPF-Gd NSs deliver an ultrahigh drug loading (&gt;1500%) and demonstrate the stable and highly sensitive stimuli-responsive degradation/release for multimodal tumor imaging and cancer chemotherapy. Meanwhile, PPF-Gd NSs also exhibit excellent fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging capability in vitro and in vivo . Compared to the traditional doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, the in vivo results confirm the evident suppression of the tumor growth by the PPF-Gd/DOX drug delivery system with negligible side effects. This work further supports the potential of lanthanide-based MOF nanomaterials as biodegradable systems to promote the cancer theranostics technology development in the future.},

  abstract     = {Hollow nanoparticles with large specific surface area and high atom utilization are promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We describe herein the design and synthesis of a series of ultra-small hollow ternary alloy nanostructures using a simple one-pot strategy. The same technique was demonstrated for hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles, hollow PtCoCu nanoparticles and hollow CuNiCo nanoparticles. During synthesis, the displacement reaction and oxidative etching played important roles in the formation of hollow structures. Moreover, our hollow PtNiCu and PtCoCu nanoparticles were single crystalline, with an average diameter of 5 nm. Impressively, ultra-small hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles, containing only 10% Pt, exhibited greater electrocatalytic HER activity and stability than a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The overpotential of hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles at 10 mA cm −2 was 28 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The mass activity was 4.54 A mg Pt −1 at −70 mV versus RHE, which is 5.62-fold greater than that of a commercial Pt/C system (0.81 A mg Pt −1 ). Through analyses of bonding and antibonding orbital filling, density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the bonding strength of different metals to the hydrogen intermediate (H * ) was in the order of Pt &gt; Co &gt; Ni &gt; Cu. The excellent HER performance of our hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles derives from moderately synergistic interactions between the three metals and H * . This work demonstrates a new strategy for the design of low-cost and high-activity HER catalysts.},

Although type-II WPs have unique spectral characteristics compared with type-I counterparts, ideal type-II WPs have not yet been reported because of a lack of an experimental platform with enough flexibility to produce strongly tilted dispersion bands. Here, we experimentally realize a topological circuit that hosts only topological bands with a minimal number of four ideal type-II WPs. By stacking two-dimensional (2D) layers of inductor-capacitor ( LC ) resonator dimers with the broken parity inversion symmetry ( P ), we achieve a strongly tilted band structure with two group velocities in the same direction, and topological surface states in an incomplete bandgap. Our results establish an ideal system for the further study of Weyl physics and other exotic topological phenomena.},

The derived CeO x /Bi interface structure compared to pure Bi counterpart delivers substantially enhanced performance with a formate Faradaic efficiency approaching 90% for 24 hours in a wide potential window. The formate Faradaic efficiency can be further increased by using isotope D 2 O instead of H 2 O. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the regenerative CeO x /Bi interfacial sites can not only promote water activation to increase local * H species for CO 2 protonation appropriately, but also stabilize the key intermediate * OCHO in formate pathway.},

However, Na-DIBs are generally subject to poor rate capability and cycling stability for the lack of suitable anodes to accommodate large Na + ions. Herein, we propose a molecular grafting strategy to in situ synthesize tin pyrophosphate nanodots implanted in N-doped carbon matrix (SnP 2 O 7 @N-C), which exhibits a high fraction of active SnP 2 O 7 up to 95.6 wt% and a low content of N-doped carbon (4.4 wt%) as the conductive framework. As a result, this anode delivers a high specific capacity ∼400 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , excellent rate capability up to 5.0 A g −1 and excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 92% after 1200 cycles under a current density of 1.5 A g −1 . Further, pairing this anode with an environmentally friendly KS6 graphite cathode yields a SnP 2 O 7 @N-C||KS6 Na-DIB, exhibiting an excellent rate capability up to 30 C, good fast-charge/slow-discharge performance and long-term cycling life with a capacity retention of ∼96% after 1000 cycles at 20 C.

How and when the continental collision occurred remains a long-standing controversy. Here we present two new paleomagnetic data sets from rocks deposited on the distal part of the Indian passive margin, which indicate that the Tethyan Himalaya terrane was situated at a paleolatitude of ∼19.4°S at ∼75 Ma and moved rapidly northward to reach a paleolatitude of ∼13.7°N at ∼61 Ma. This implies that the Tethyan Himalaya terrane rifted from India after ∼75 Ma, generating the North India Sea. We document a new two-stage continental collision, first at ∼61 Ma between the Lhasa and Tethyan Himalaya terranes, and subsequently at ∼53−48 Ma between the Tethyan Himalaya terrane and India, diachronously closing the North India Sea from west to east.

Here, we present the records of dissolved Fe (DFe) and total Fe (TDFe) in North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) ice core over the past 110 kyr BP. The Fe records are significantly negatively correlated with the carbon-dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations during cold periods. The results suggest that the changes in Fe fluxes over the past 110 kyr BP in the NEEM ice core are consistent with those in Chinese loess records because the mineral-dust distribution is controlled by the East Asian deserts. Furthermore, the variations in the dust input on a global scale are most likely driven by changes in solar radiation during the last glacial–interglacial cycle in response to Earth&#39;s orbital cycles. In the last glacial–interglacial cycle, the DFe/TDFe ratios were higher during the warm periods (following the post-Industrial Revolution and during the Holocene and last interglacial period) than during the main cold period (i.e. the last glacial maximum (LGM)), indicating that the aeolian input of iron and the iron fertilization effect on the oceans have a non-linear relationship during different periods. Although the burning of biomass aerosols has released large amounts of DFe since the Industrial Revolution, no significant responses are observed in the DFe and TDFe variations during this period, indicating that severe anthropogenic contamination has no significant effect on the DFe (TDFe) release in the NEEM ice core.},

  abstract     = {Liposomes, especially cationic liposomes, are the most common and well-investigated nanocarriers for biomedical applications, such as drug and gene delivery. Like other types of nanomaterials, once liposomes are incubated in a biological milieu, their surface can be immediately cloaked by biological components to form a protein corona, which confers a new ‘biological identity’ and modulates downstream interactions with cells. However, it remains unclear how the protein corona affects the transportation mechanism after liposomes interact with cells. Here, we employed home-made aggregation-induced-emission-visualized nanoliposomes TR4@Lipo as a model to investigate transportation with or without the protein corona by optical imaging techniques. The results show that the protein corona can change the cellular transportation mechanism of TR4@Lipo from energy-independent membrane fusion to energy-dependent endocytosis. The protein corona also modulates the intracellular distribution of loaded cargoes. This knowledge furthers our understanding of bio-nano interactions and is important for the efficient use of cationic liposomes.},

Boron, especially, has played a central role in the design of luminescent main-group complexes. However, these complexes still suffer the disadvantage of aggregation-caused quenching as well as typical organic fluorophores. It has recently been reported that some types of boron complexes exhibit the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property. Moreover, AIE behavior from complexes and organometallic compounds composed of the other group 13 elements, such as aluminum and gallium, has emerged in this decade. These observations greatly encourage us to develop advanced functional materials based on the group 13 elements. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that these classes of materials are potentially versatile scaffolds for constructing chromic luminophores, efficiently emissive π-conjugated polymers and so on. This review mainly describes AIE-active group 13 complexes with four-coordinate structures and their application as photo-functional materials. Proposed mechanisms of the origins of AIE behavior are briefly discussed.},

In this review, we summarize the recent advances in synthetic methodologies for light-emitting metallacages, and highlight some representative applications of these metallacages. In particular, we focus on the favorable photophysical properties—including high luminescence efficiency in various physical states, good modularity in photophysical properties and stimulus responsiveness—that have resulted from incorporating ligands displaying aggregation-induced emission (AIE) into metallacages. These features show that the synergy between carrying out coordination-driven self-assembly and using luminophores with novel photophysical characteristics like AIE could stimulate the development of supramolecular luminophores for applications in fields as diverse as sensing, biomedicine and catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Red blood cell (RBC)-mimicking nanoparticles (NPs) offer a promising platform for drug delivery because of their prolonged circulation time, reduced immunogenicity and specific targeting ability. Herein, we report the design and preparation of RBC membrane-bound NPs (M@AP), for tumoral photodynamic-immunotherapy. The M@AP is formed by self-assembly of the positively charged aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) (named P2-PPh3) and the negatively charged polyinosinic : polycytidylic acid (Poly(I : C)), followed by RBC membrane encapsulation. P2-PPh3 is an AIE-active conjugated polyelectrolyte with additional photosensitizing ability for photodynamic therapy (PDT), while Poly(I : C) serves as an immune-stimulant to stimulate both tumor and immune cells to activate immunity, and thus reduces tumor cell viability. When applied in tumor-bearing mice, the M@AP NPs are enriched in both the tumor region as a result of an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and the spleen because of the homing effect of the RBC-mimicking shell. Upon light irradiation, P2-PPh3 promotes strong ROS generation in tumor cells, inducing the release of tumor antigens (TA). The anti-tumor immunity is further enhanced by the presence of Poly(I : C) in M@AP. Thus, this strategy combines the PDT properties of the AIE-active polyelectrolyte and immunotherapy properties of Poly(I : C) to achieve synergistic activation of the immune system for anti-tumor activity, providing a novel strategy for tumor treatment.},

  abstract     = {Telomerase acts as an important biomarker for tumor identification, and synthesizes telomeric repeats at the end of chromosome telomeres during the replicative phase of the cell cycle; thus, the expression level of telomerase changes as the cell cycle progresses. TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity were significantly increased in over 80% of human cancers from tissue specimens. Although many efforts have been made in detecting the activity of TERT mRNA and active telomerase, the heterogeneous behavior of the cell cycle was overlooked, which might affect the accuracy of the detection results. Herein, the AIEgen-based biosensing systems of PyTPA-DNA and Silole-R were developed to detect the cellular level of TERT mRNA and telomerase in different cell cycles. As a result, the fluorescence signal of cancer cells gradually increased from G0/G1, G1/S to S phase. In contrast, both cancer cells arrested at G2/M phase and normal cells exhibited negligible fluorescence intensities. Compared to normal tissues, malignant tumor samples demonstrated a significant turn-on fluorescence signal. Furthermore, the transcriptomics profiling revealed that tumor biomarkers changed as the cell cycle progressed and biomarkers of CA9, TK1 and EGFR were more abundantly expressed at early S stage. In this vein, our study presented advanced biosensing tools for more accurate analysis of the cell-cycle-dependent activity of TERT mRNA and active telomerase in clinical tissue samples.},

This new material not only shows an optimized luminescence due to the minimized π–π stacking and efficient charge transfer properties benefitting from the existence of pillar[5]arene rings, but also exhibits tunable multicolor emission induced by different external stimuli including solvent, ions and acid, indicating great application potential as a fluorescent sensory material, especially for Fe 3+ . With this pillar[5]arene-based dual-ligand hybrid material, valid optimization and regulation on the fluorescence of the original chromophore have been achieved, which demonstrates a plausible strategy for the design of tunable solid-state luminescent materials and also a prototypical model for the effective regulation of fluorescent properties of planar π systems using synthetic macrocycle-based building blocks.},

  abstract     = {mRNA m 5 C, which has recently been implicated in the regulation of mRNA mobility, metabolism and translation, plays important regulatory roles in various biological events. Two types of m 5 C sites are found in mRNAs. Type I m 5 C sites, which contain a downstream G-rich triplet motif and are computationally predicted to be located at the 5 ′ end of putative hairpin structures, are methylated by NSUN2. Type II m 5 C sites contain a downstream UCCA motif and are computationally predicted to be located in the loops of putative hairpin structures. However, their biogenesis remains unknown. Here we identified NSUN6, a methyltransferase that is known to methylate C72 of tRNA Thr and tRNA Cys , as an mRNA methyltransferase that targets Type II m 5 C sites. Combining the RNA secondary structure prediction, miCLIP, and results from a high-throughput mutagenesis analysis, we determined the RNA sequence and structural features governing the specificity of NSUN6-mediated mRNA methylation. Integrating these features into an NSUN6-RNA structural model, we identified an NSUN6 variant that largely loses tRNA methylation but retains mRNA methylation ability. Finally, we revealed a weak negative correlation between m 5 C methylation and translation efficiency. Our findings uncover that mRNA m 5 C is tightly controlled by an elaborate two-enzyme system, and the protein-RNA structure analysis strategy established may be applied to other RNA modification writers to distinguish the functions of different RNA substrates of a writer protein.},

  abstract     = {The reductionist approach to science seeks to understand the behaviour of systems by studying their individual components. It has been an enormously productive approach, but it is also widely acknowledged now that in some systems the behaviour of interest is an emergent property that cannot be discerned in the separate parts. Biology is replete with such examples, from the flocking of birds to the way metabolic processes in cells rely on a dynamic interplay of proteins and other components. Yet molecular systems do not have to be particularly complex before their properties become more than the sum of the parts. A classic example is the appearance of bulk-like metallic behaviour in small clusters of metal atoms only once they exceed a certain critical size. One of the most striking instances became apparent in 2001, when Ben Zhong Tang of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and his co-workers found that heterocyclic silicon-containing molecules called siloles become luminescent as nanoscopic aggregates even though the individual molecules in dilute solution do not emit light [ 1 ]. This looked like the opposite of the well-known phenomenon of concentration quenching, in which energy transfer between fluorescent (generally organic) molecules quenches the emission, an effect explained in 1955 [ 2 ]. Aggregation-induced ‘switching off’ is intuitively understandable, but ‘switching on’ due to aggregation was more surprising. Yet this effect of ‘aggregation-induced emission’ (AIE), as Tang and colleagues called it, was apparently seen, but not understood, much earlier [ 3 ]. In the 1850s, George Stokes noted that some inorganic complexes were fluorescent in the condensed, solid state but not in solution. At first, AIE was seen as a curiosity and deemed likely to be rare. However, subsequent research has shown not only that it is a rather common effect but also that it can be considered just one manifestation of a wide range of behaviours that arise from aggregation—leading to the proposed field of ‘aggregate science’, manifesting at the supramolecular level of small clusters or groups of molecules held together by relatively weak interactions. The field might be considered to illustrate George Whitesides’ notion of a chemistry ‘beyond the molecule’ [ 4 ], which bridges disciplines ranging from colloid science to crystal growth, nanotechnology, liquid crystals, photochemistry and molecular biology. At the same time, it echoes the famous insight of physicist Philip Anderson about emergent phenomena and the hierarchical nature of science: ‘More is different’ [ 5 ]. An ability to switch properties on and off by controlling intermolecular interactions and aggregation suggests various applications, from optical device technologies to targeted drugs for cancer therapy [ 6 ]. NSR spoke to Ben Zhong Tang about the origins and possibilities of the field.},

This technique can directly detect the deflection angle of a focused electron beam, thus allowing clear identification of the real magnetic structures of two magnetic objects including three-ring and complex arch-shaped vortices in Fe 3 Sn 2 by Lorentz-TEM imaging. Numerical calculations based on real material-specific parameters well reproduced the experimental results, showing that the magnetic objects can be attributed to integral magnetizations of two types of complex three-dimensional (3D) magnetic bubbles with depth-modulated spin twisting. Magnetic configurations obtained using the high-resolution TEM are generally considered as two-dimensional (2D) magnetic objects previously. Our results imply the importance of the integral magnetizations of underestimated 3D magnetic structures in 2D TEM magnetic characterizations.},

Herein, we report an unprecedented ‘ amphiphilic AIEgen’ sensor QM-SO 3 -ER based on the AIE building block of quinoline-malononitrile (QM). The introduced hydrophilic sulfonate group can well control the specific solubility in a hydrophilic system with desirable initial ‘ fluorescence-off ’ state. Moreover, the incorporated p -toluenesulfonamide group plays two roles: enhancing the lipophilic dispersity, and behaving as binding receptor to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K ATP ) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to generate the docking assay confinement effect with targetable AIE signal. The amphiphilic AIEgen has for the first time settled down the predicament of unexpected ‘ always-on ’ fluorescence in the aqueous system and the untargetable aggregation signal in the lipophilic organelle before binding to ER, thus successfully overcoming the bottleneck of AIEgens&#39; targetability.},

Although myopia itself appears to be selected against, many of the mutant alleles are associated with reproductive benefits, suggesting that reproduction-related selection inadvertently contributes to the myopia epidemic. We estimate that, in the UK alone, natural selection adds more than 100 000 myopia cases per generation, and argue that antagonistic pleiotropy be broadly considered in explaining the spreads of apparently disadvantageous phenotypes in humans and beyond.},

NIR-II-photothermal nanoplatforms with high biocompatibility as well as high photothermal effect are urgently needed but rarely reported so far. Te nanomaterials possess high absorbance to NIR-II light but also exhibit high cytotoxicity, impeding their biomedical applications. In this work, the controllable incorporation of biocompatible Se into the lattice of Te nanostructures is proposed to intrinsically tune their inherent cytotoxicity and enhance their biocompatibility, developing TeSe x nano-alloys as a new kind of theranostic nanoplatform. We have uncovered that the cytotoxicity of Te nanomaterials primarily derives from irreversible oxidation stress and intracellular imbalance of organization and energy, and can be eliminated by incorporating a moderate proportion of Se (x = 0.43). We have also discovered that the as-prepared TeSe x nano-alloys have extraordinarily high NIR-II-photothermal conversion efficiency (77.2%), 64 Cu coordination and computed tomography contrast capabilities, enabling high-efficacy multimodal photothermal/photoacoustic/positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging-guided NIR-II-photothermal therapy of cancer. The proposed nano-alloying strategy provides a new route to improve the biocompatibility of biomedical nanoplatforms and endow them with versatile theranostic functions.},

Herein, we report a novel boron doping-induced interconnection-assembly approach for fabricating an unprecedented assembly of mesoporous silicon oxycarbide nanospheres, which are derived from periodic mesoporous organosilicas. The as-prepared architecture is composed of interconnected, strongly coupled nanospheres with coarse surfaces. Significantly, through delicate analysis of the as-formed boron doped species, a novel melt-etching and nucleation-growth mechanism is proposed, which offers a new horizon for the developing interconnected assembling technique. Furthermore, such unique strategy shows precise controllability and versatility, endowing the architecture with tunable interconnection size, surface roughness and switchable primary nanoparticles. Impressively, this interconnected assembly along with tunable surface roughness enables intrinsically dual (both structural and interfacial) stable characteristics, achieving extraordinary long-term cycle life when used as a lithium-ion battery anode.},

  abstract     = {A key issue for redox reactions in plasmon-induced photocatalysis, particularly for water oxidation, is the concentration of surface-accumulating charges (electrons or holes) at a reaction site for artificial photosynthesis. However, where plasmonic charge accumulated at a catalyst&#39;s surface, and how to improve local charge density at active sites, remains unknown because it is difficult to identify the exact spatial location and local density of the plasmon-induced charge, particularly with regard to holes. Herein, we show that at the single particle level, plasmon-coupling-induced holes can be greatly accumulated at the plasmonic Au nanoparticle dimer/TiO 2 interface in the nanogap region, as directly evidenced by the locally enhanced surface photovoltage. Such an accumulation of plasmonic holes can significantly accelerate the water oxidation reaction (multi-holes involved) at the interfacial reaction site, with nearly one order of magnitude enhancement in photocatalytic activities compared to those of highly dispersed Au nanoparticles on TiO 2 . Combining Kelvin probe force microscopy and theoretical simulation, we further clarified that the local accumulated hole density is proportional to the square of the local near-field enhancement. Our findings advance the understanding of how charges spatially distribute in plasmonic systems and the specific role that local charge density at reaction sites plays in plasmonic photocatalysis.},

Here we show that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-modulated fires in Southeast Asia, rather than Asian fossil fuel plumes, dominate the interannual variability of springtime trans-Pacific transport of ozone across the entire North Pacific Ocean. During El Niño springs, the intensified fires from both the Indochinese Peninsula and Indonesia, together with large-scale circulation anomalies, result in enhanced ozone plumes that stretch over 15 000 km in both the lower-middle and upper troposphere. This enhancement is also observed in the in situ measurements of ozone concentration, with an almost 10% increase at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, a unique site to monitor the long-distance transport over the North Pacific. This study reports an unexpectedly strong influence of vegetation fires, linked with climate variability, on global tropospheric chemistry and proves once more how complex the interactions in the climate system are.},

The entire 254 kb sequence was 95.27% occupied by encoded data. The Transformation-Associated Recombination method was used in the construction of this chromosome from DNA fragments and necessary autonomous replication sequences. The stability was demonstrated by transmitting the data-carrying chromosome to the 100th generation.

Yet, fine-tuning the dynamics of colloids in microscale confined spaces is still a formidable task due to the complexity of the dynamics of colloidal suspension and to the lack of methodology to probe colloids in confinement. Here, we show that the collective dynamics of confined magnetic colloids can be finely tuned by external magnetic fields. In particular, the mechanical properties of the confined colloidal suspension can be probed in real time and this strategy can be also used to tune microscale fluid transport. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the collective configuration characterized by the colloidal entropy is controlled by the colloidal concentration, confining ratio and external field strength and direction. Indeed, our results show that mechanical properties of the colloidal suspension as well as the transport of the solvent in microfluidic devices can be controlled upon tuning the entropy of the colloidal suspension. Our approach opens new avenues for the design and application of drug delivery, microfluidic logic, dynamic fluid control, chemical reaction and beyond.},

One escape from this impasse might be homoeologous meiotic pairing, during which homoeologous exchanges (HEs) generate phenotypically variable progeny. However, the immediate genome-wide patterns and resulting phenotypic diversity generated by HEs remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the genome composition of 202 phenotyped euploid segmental allopolyploid individuals from the fourth selfed generation following chromosomal doubling of reciprocal F1 hybrids of crosses between rice subspecies, using whole-genome sequencing. We describe rampant occurrence of HEs that, by overcoming incompatibility or conferring superiority of hetero-cytonuclear interactions, generate extensive and individualized genomic mosaicism across the analyzed tetraploids. We show that the resulting homoeolog copy number alteration in tetraploids affects known-function genes and their complex genetic interactions, in the process creating extraordinary phenotypic diversity at the population level following a single initial hybridization. Our results illuminate the immediate genomic landscapes possible in a tetraploid genomic environment, and underscore HE as an important mechanism that fuels rapid phenotypic diversification accompanying the initial stages of allopolyploid evolution.},

Significant efforts have been devoted to material synthesis and structural designs to realize the mechanical flexibility of various batteries. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a unique one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure and are convenient to further assemble into diverse macroscopic structures, such as 1D fibers, 2D films and 3D sponges/aerogels. Due to their outstanding mechanical and electrical properties, CNTs and CNT-based hybrid materials are superior building blocks for different components in flexible batteries. This review summarizes recent progress on the application of CNTs in developing flexible batteries, from closed-system to open-system batteries, with a focus on different structural designs of CNT-based material systems and their roles in various batteries. We also provide perspectives on the challenges and future research directions for realizing practical applications of CNT-based flexible batteries.},

We found that full HOI-inclusive models improved our ability to model and predict the survival and growth of trees, providing empirical evidence that HOIs strongly influence tree performance in this temperate forest. Specifically, assessed HOIs mitigate the competitive direct effects of neighbours on survival and growth of focal trees. Our study lays a foundation for future investigations of the prevalence and relative importance of HOIs in global forests and their impact on species diversity.},

  abstract     = {An error-correction code (ECC) sequencing approach has recently been reported to effectively reduce sequencing errors by interrogating a DNA fragment with three orthogonal degenerate sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) reactions. However, similar to other non-single-molecule SBS methods, the reaction will gradually lose its synchronization within a molecular colony in ECC sequencing. This phenomenon, called dephasing, causes sequencing error, and in ECC sequencing, induces distinctive dephasing patterns. To understand the characteristic dephasing patterns of the dual-base flowgram in ECC sequencing and to generate a correction algorithm, we built a virtual sequencer in silico . Starting from first principles and based on sequencing chemical reactions, we simulated ECC sequencing results, identified the key factors of dephasing in ECC sequencing chemistry and designed an effective dephasing algorithm. The results show that our dephasing algorithm is applicable to sequencing signals with at least 500 cycles, or 1000-bp average read length, with acceptably low error rate for further parity checks and ECC deduction. Our virtual sequencer with our dephasing algorithm can further be extended to a dichromatic form of ECC sequencing, allowing for a potentially much more accurate sequencing approach.},

Phys Rev X 2018; 8: 011042), but the sensitivity was limited by the large spectral broadening of ensemble spins in nanodiamonds. To overcome this limitation, here we show an improved design of a hybrid nanothermometer using a single NV center in a diamond nanopillar coupled with a single magnetic nanoparticle of copper-nickel alloy, and demonstrate a temperature sensitivity of 76 μ K H z − 1 / 2 ⁠ . This hybrid design enables detection of 2 mK temperature changes with temporal resolution of 5 ms.

These phenotypes show that the ectotympanic and the malleus-incus complex changed notably during their retreating from the dentary at various evolutionary stages and suggest convergent evolution of some features to extant mammals. In contrast, the incudomalleolar joint was conservative in having a braced hinge configuration, which narrows the morphological gap between the quadroarticular jaw joint of non-mammalian cynodonts and the incudomalleolar articulations of extant mammals. The saddle-shaped and abutting malleus-incus complexes in therians and monotremes, respectively, could have evolved from the braced hinge joint independently.

The 50-day mouse survival rate was increased from 0% to 100% after the photocatalytic therapy. The breakthrough was owing to the cell membrane rupture and the cytoplasmic loss caused by photogenerated holes inside cancer cells. The porphyrin-based photocatalysts can be internalized in a targeted manner by cancer cells due to the size selection effect, without entering the normal cells. The therapy has no toxicity or side effects for normal cells and organisms. Moreover, the photocatalytic therapy is effective for a variety of cancer cell lines.

  abstract     = {Elastomers are essential for stretchable electronics, which have become more and more important in bio-integrated devices. To ensure high compliance with the application environment, elastomers are expected to resist, and even self-repair, mechanical damage, while being friendly to the human body. Herein, inspired by peptidoglycan, we designed the first room-temperature autonomous self-healing biodegradable and biocompatible elastomers, poly(sebacoyl 1,6-hexamethylenedicarbamate diglyceride) (PSeHCD) elastomers. The unique structure including alternating ester-urethane moieties and bionic hybrid crosslinking endowed PSeHCD elastomers superior properties including ultrafast self-healing, tunable biomimetic mechanical properties, facile reprocessability, as well as good biocompatibility and biodegradability. The potential of the PSeHCD elastomers was demonstrated as a super-fast self-healing stretchable conductor (21 s) and motion sensor (2 min). This work provides a new design and synthetic principle of elastomers for applications in bio-integrated electronics.},

  abstract     = {Superhydrophobic surfaces are widely used in many industrial settings, and mainly consist of rough solid protrusions that entrap air to minimize the liquid/solid area. The stability of the superhydrophobic state favors relatively small spacing between protrusions. However, this in turn increases the lateral adhesion force that retards the mobility of drops. Here we propose a novel approach that optimizes both properties simultaneously. Inspired by the hydrophobic leaves of Salvinia molesta and the slippery Nepenthes pitcher plants, we designed a Salvinia -like slippery surface (SSS) consisting of protrusions with slippery heads. We demonstrate that compared to a control surface, the SSS exhibits increased stability against pressure and impact, and enhanced lateral mobility of water drops as well as reduced hydrodynamic drag. We also systematically investigate the wetting dynamics on the SSS. With its easy fabrication and enhanced performance, we envision that SSS will be useful in a variety of fields in industry.},

Here, by importing cobalt single clusters as strong electron-donating promoter into the catalyst, the rate-determining step of ammonia synthesis is altered to the subsequent proton addition so that the barrier of N 2 dissociation can be successfully overcome. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the N 2 dissociation becomes exothermic over the cobalt single cluster upon the strong electron backdonation from metal to the N 2 antibonding orbitals. The energy barrier of the positively shifted rate-determining step is also greatly reduced. At the same time, advanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations indicate a barrier-less process of the N 2 approaching the active sites that greatly facilitates the mass transfer. With suitable thermodynamic and dynamic property, a high ammonia yield rate of 76.2 μg h –1 mg c a t . − 1 and superior Faradaic efficiency of 52.9% were simultaneously achieved.},

  abstract     = {Fluctuations in the Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC), a zonally oriented overturning cell across the tropical Pacific, can cause widespread climatic and biogeochemical perturbations. It remains unknown how the PWC developed during the Cenozoic era, with its substantial changes in greenhouse gases and continental positions. Through a suite of coupled model simulations on tectonic timescales, we demonstrate that the PWC was ∼38° broader and ∼5% more intense during the Early Eocene relative to present. As the climate cooled from the Early Eocene to the Late Miocene, the width of the PWC shrank, accompanied by an increase in intensity that was tied to the enhanced Pacific zonal temperature gradient. However, the locations of the western and eastern branches behave differently from the Early Eocene to the Late Miocene, with the western edge remaining steady with time due to the relatively stable geography of the western tropical Pacific; the eastern edge migrates westward with time as the South American continent moves northwest. A transition occurs in the PWC between the Late Miocene and Late Pliocene, manifested by an eastward shift (both the western and eastern edges migrate eastward by &gt;12°) and weakening (by ∼22%), which we show here is linked with the closure of the tropical seaways. Moreover, our results suggest that rising CO 2 favors a weaker PWC under the same land-sea configurations, a robust feature across the large spread of Cenozoic climates considered here, supporting a weakening of the PWC in a warmer future.},

  abstract     = {N-heterocyclic phosphines (NHPs) have recently emerged as a new group of promising catalysts for metal-free reductions, owing to their unique hydridic reactivity. The excellent hydricity of NHPs, which rivals or even exceeds those of many metal-based hydrides, is the result of hyperconjugative interactions between the lone-pair electrons on N atoms and the adjacent σ * (P–H) orbital. Compared with the conventional protic reactivity of phosphines, this umpolung P–H reactivity leads to hydridic selectivity in NHP-mediated reductions. This reactivity has therefore found many applications in the catalytic reduction of polar unsaturated bonds and in the hydroboration of pyridines. This review summarizes recent progress in studies of the reactivity and synthetic applications of these phosphorus-based hydrides, with the aim of providing practical information to enable exploitation of their synthetically useful chemistry.},

Here, we report a breakthrough that allows direct determination of quantum relaxation time at zero and non-zero frequencies using optical measurement. Through dielectric loss function, we connect bound electron effects to the physical parameters of plasma resonance and find an extra term of quantum relaxation time from inelastic scattering between bound electrons and conduction electrons at non-zero frequencies. We demonstrate here that the frequency-dependent inelastic polarization effect of bound electrons is the dominant contribution to quantum relaxation time of conduction electrons at optical frequencies, and the elastic polarization effect of bound electrons also dramatically changes the plasma resonance frequency through effective screening to charge carriers.},

  abstract     = {A large and ideal Rashba-type spin-orbit splitting is desired for the applications of materials in spintronic devices and the detection of Majorana fermions in solids. Here, we propose an approach to achieve giant and ideal spin-orbit splittings through a combination of ordered surface alloying and interface engineering, that is, growing alloy monolayers on an insulating polar surface. We illustrate this unique strategy by means of first-principle calculations of buckled hexagonal monolayers of SbBi and PbBi supported on Al 2 O 3 (0001). Both systems display ideal Rashba-type states with giant spin-orbit splittings, characterized with energy offsets over 600 meV and momentum offsets over 0.3 Å −1 , respectively. Our study thus points to an effective way of tuning spin-orbit splitting in low-dimensional materials to draw immediate experimental interest.},

Most studies so far focused on making EEG-based BCI spellers faster and more reliable; however, few have considered their security. This study, for the first time, shows that P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential BCI spellers are very vulnerable, i.e. they can be severely attacked by adversarial perturbations, which are too tiny to be noticed when added to EEG signals, but can mislead the spellers to spell anything the attacker wants. The consequence could range from merely user frustration to severe misdiagnosis in clinical applications. We hope our research can attract more attention to the security of EEG-based BCI spellers, and more broadly, EEG-based BCIs, which has received little attention before.},

However, protein receptors occur on both cancer and normal cells; as such, aptamers are now taxed with identifying high vs. low levels of protein expression. Inspired by the flexible template mechanism and elegant control of natural nucleic acid-based structures, we report an allosteric regulation strategy for constructing a structure-switching aptamer for enhanced target cell recognition by engineering aptamers with DNA intercalated motifs (i-motifs) responsive to the microenvironment, such as pH. Structure-switching sensitivity can be readily tuned by manipulating i-motif sequences. However, structure-switching sensitivity is difficult to estimate, making it equally difficult to effectively screen modified aptamers with the desired sensitivity. To address this problem, we selected a fluorescent probe capable of detecting G-quadruplex in complicated biological media.},

In addition, human retinal aging occurred in a region- and cell-type-specific manner. Aging of human retina exhibited a foveal to peripheral gradient. MYO9A − rods and a horizontal cell subtype were greatly reduced in aging retina, indicating their vulnerability to aging. Moreover, we generated a dataset showing the cell-type- and region-specific gene expression associated with 55 types of human retinal disease, which provides a foundation to understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human retinal diseases. Such datasets are valuable to understanding of the molecular characteristics of primate retina, as well as molecular regulation of aging progression and related diseases.},

  abstract     = {Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are not only functional devices but also represent an important tool for measuring the charge-transport properties of organic semiconductors (OSs). Thus, efforts to understand the performance and characteristics of OFET devices are not only useful in helping achieve higher device efficiencies but also critical to ensuring accuracy in the evaluations of OS charge mobilities. These studies rely on OFET device models, which connect the measured current characteristics to the properties of the OSs. Developing such OFET models requires good knowledge of the charge-transport processes in OSs. In device active layers, the OS thin films are either amorphous (e.g. in organic light-emitting diodes and organic solar cells) or crystalline (e.g. those optimized for charge transport in OFETs). When the electronic couplings between adjacent OS molecules or polymer chain segments are weak, the charge-transport mechanism is dominated by hopping processes, which is the context in which we frame the discussion in this Review. Factors such as disorder, mobility anisotropy, traps, grain boundaries or film morphology all impact charge transport. To take these features fully into account in an OFET device model requires considering a nano-scale, molecular-level resolution. Here, we discuss the recent development of such molecular-resolution OFET models based on a kinetic Monte Carlo approach relevant to the hopping regime. We also briefly describe the applicability of these models to high-mobility OFETs, where we underline the need to extend them to incorporate aspects related to charge delocalization.},

Here, we take advantage of the solid-state intramolecular motion of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecular rotors and one-dimensional fibers, developing highly sensitive optical fiber sensors that respond to ambient humidity rapidly and reversibly with observable chromatic fluorescence change. Moisture environments induce the swelling of the polymer fibers, activating intramolecular motions of AIE molecules to result in red-shifted fluorescence and linear response to ambient humidity. In this case, polymer fiber provides a process-friendly architecture and a physically tunable medium for the embedded AIE molecules to manipulate their fluorescence response characteristics. Assembly of sensor fibers could be built into hierarchical structures, which are adaptive to diverse-configuration for spatial-temporal humidity mapping, and suitable for device integration to build light-emitting sensors as well as touchless positioning interfaces for intelligence systems.},

Here, we report the condensation reaction between o -phthalaldehyde (OPA) and N -nucleophiles (primary amine, hydrazide and aminooxy) for hydrogel formation for the first time. When four-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (4aPEG) capped with OPA was mixed with various N -nucleophile-terminated 4aPEG as building blocks, hydrogels were formed with superfast gelation rate, higher mechanical strength and markedly lower critical gelation concentrations, compared to benzaldehyde-based counterparts. Small molecule model reactions indicate the key to these cross-links is the fast formation of heterocycle phthalimidine product or isoindole (bis)hemiaminal intermediates, depending on the N -nucleophiles. The second-order rate constant for the formation of phthalimidine linkage (4.3 M −1 s −1 ) is over 3000 times and 200 times higher than those for acylhydrazone and oxime formation from benzaldehyde, respectively, and comparable to many cycloaddition click reactions. Based on the versatile OPA chemistry, various hydrogels can be readily prepared from naturally derived polysaccharides, proteins or synthetic polymers without complicated chemical modification. Moreover, biofunctionality is facilely imparted to the hydrogels by introducing amine-bearing peptides via the reaction between OPA and amino group.},

  abstract     = {The functionalization of otherwise unreactive C–H bonds adds a new dimension to synthetic chemistry, yielding useful molecules for a range of applications. Arylation has emerged as an increasingly viable strategy for functionalization of heteroarenes which constitute an important class of structural moieties for organic materials. However, direct bisarylation of heteroarenes to enable aryl-heteroaryl-aryl bond formation remains a formidable challenge, due to the strong coordination between heteroatom of N or S and transitional metals. Here we report Pd interstitial nanocatalysts supported on ordered mesoporous carbon as catalysts for a direct and highly efficient bisarylation method for five-membered heteroarenes that allows for green and mild reaction conditions. Notably, in the absence of any base, ligands and phase transfer agents, high activity (turn-over frequency, TOF, up to 107 h −1 ) and selectivity (&gt;99%) for the 2,5-bisarylation of five-membered heteroarenes are achieved in water. A combination of characterization reveals that the remarkable catalytic reactivity here is attributable to the parallel adsorption of heteroarene over Pd clusters, which breaks the barrier to electron transfer in traditional homogenous catalysis and creates dual electrophilic sites for aryl radicals and adsorbate at C2 and C5 positions. The d -band filling at Pd sites shows a linear relationship with activation entropy and catalytic activity. The ordered mesopores facilitate the absence of a mass transfer effect. These findings suggest alternative synthesis pathways for the design, synthesis and understanding of a large number of organic chemicals by ordered mesoporous carbon supported palladium catalysts.},

The phylogenetic signal, nevertheless, indicated weak clustering of PSMs compared to a random distribution across all seed plants. The observed signal suggests strong diversifying selection during seed-plant evolution and/or relatively weak evolutionary constraints on the evolution of PSMs. In the survey of the current phylogenetic distributions of PSMs, we found that multiple origins of PSM biosynthesis due to external selective forces for diverse genetic pathways may have played important roles. In contrast, a single origin of PSMs seems rather uncommon. The distribution patterns for PSMs observed in this study may also be useful in the search for natural compounds for medicinal purposes.},

Here, we conducted high pressure-temperature experiments mimicking the conditions of the deep lower mantle (DLM, 1800–2890 km in depth) and observed surprising mineralogical transformations in the presence of water. Ferropericlase, (Mg, Fe)O, which is the most abundant oxide mineral in Earth, reacts with H 2 O to form a previously unknown (Mg, Fe)O 2 H x ( x ≤ 1) phase. The (Mg, Fe)O 2 H x has a pyrite structure and it coexists with the dominant silicate phases, bridgmanite and post-perovskite. Depending on Mg content and geotherm temperatures, the transformation may occur at 1800 km for (Mg 0.6 Fe 0.4 )O or beyond 2300 km for (Mg 0.7 Fe 0.3 )O. The (Mg, Fe)O 2 H x is an oxygen excess phase that stores an excessive amount of oxygen beyond the charge balance of maximum cation valences (Mg 2+ , Fe 3+ and H + ). This important phase has a number of far-reaching implications including extreme redox inhomogeneity, deep-oxygen reservoirs in the DLM and an internal source for modulating oxygen in the atmosphere.},

The OE-phase is fully recoverable to ambient conditions for ex situ investigation using transmission electron microscopy, which indicates that the OE-phase contains ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) as in Fe 2 O 3 but holds excess oxygen through interactions between oxygen atoms. The new OE-phase provides strong evidence that H 2 O has extraordinary oxidation power at high pressure. Unlike the formation of pyrite-type FeO 2 H x which usually requires saturated water, the OE-phase can be formed with under-saturated water at mid-mantle conditions, and is expected to be more ubiquitous at depths greater than 1000 km in the Earth&#39;s mantle. The emergence of oxygen-excess reservoirs out of primordial or subducted (Mg, Fe)-bearing hydrous materials may revise our view on the deep-mantle redox chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion are essential for the establishment of successful infection by SARS-CoV-2. Halting these steps can cure COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at sub-nM concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion. Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no obvious adverse events when administrated with 10 times the effective dose of HB27. Cryo-EM studies on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal that three Fab fragments work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding to the ACE2 receptor. Binding of the antibody also restrains any further conformational changes of the receptor binding domain, possibly interfering with progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. These results suggest that HB27 is a promising candidate for immuno-therapies against COVID-19.},

Here, we investigated and found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and transmits efficiently in minks via respiratory droplets; pulmonary lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 in minks are similar to those seen in humans with COVID-19. We further found that a spike protein-based subunit vaccine largely prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks. Our study indicates that minks are a useful animal model for evaluating the efficacy of drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 and that vaccination is a potential strategy to prevent minks from transmitting SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract     = {Surface and interface play critical roles in energy storage devices, calling for operando characterization techniques to probe the electrified surfaces/interfaces. In this work, surface science methodology, including electron spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy, has been successfully applied to visualize electrochemical processes at operating electrode surfaces in an Al/graphite model battery. Intercalation of anions together with cations is directly observed in the surface region of a graphite electrode with tens of nanometers thickness, the concentration of which is one order higher than that in bulk. An intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism and a double specific capacity in the electrode surface region are expected based on the super-dense intercalants and anion/cation co-intercalation, which are in sharp contrast to the battery-like mechanism in the electrode bulk. The distinct electrochemical mechanism at the electrode surface is verified by performance tests of real battery devices, showing that a surface-dominant, nanometer-thick graphite cathode outperforms a bulk-dominant, micrometer-thick graphite cathode. Our findings highlight the important surface effect of working electrodes in charge storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Logarithmic finite-size scaling of the O( n ) universality class at the upper critical dimensionality ( d c = 4) has a fundamental role in statistical and condensed-matter physics and important applications in various experimental systems. Here, we address this long-standing problem in the context of the n -vector model ( n = 1, 2, 3) on periodic four-dimensional hypercubic lattices. We establish an explicit scaling form for the free-energy density, which simultaneously consists of a scaling term for the Gaussian fixed point and another term with multiplicative logarithmic corrections. In particular, we conjecture that the critical two-point correlation g ( r , L ), with L the linear size, exhibits a two-length behavior: follows r 2 − d c governed by the Gaussian fixed point at shorter distances and enters a plateau at larger distances whose height decays as L − d c / 2 ( l n L ) p ^ with p ^ = 1 / 2 a logarithmic correction exponent. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we provide complementary evidence for the predictions through the finite-size scaling of observables, including the two-point correlation, the magnetic fluctuations at zero and nonzero Fourier modes and the Binder cumulant. Our work sheds light on the formulation of logarithmic finite-size scaling and has practical applications in experimental systems.},

We show the first-principles plus Monte Carlo simulation evidence that many hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics (e.g. organic PhMDA) can be ideal candidates, which are also flexible and lead-free. Owing to the specific features of hydrogen bonding, their proton hopping barrier will drastically increase with prolonged proton transfer distance, while their hydrogen-bonded network can be easily compressed or stretched due to softness of hydrogen bonds. Their barriers as well as the Curie temperature can be approximately doubled upon a tensile strain as low as 2%. Their Curie temperature can be tuned exactly to room temperature by fixing a strain in one direction, and in another direction, an unprecedented ultra-high piezoelectric coefficient of 2058 pC/N can be obtained. This value is even underestimated and can be greatly enhanced when applying a smaller strain. Aside from sensors, they can also be utilized for converting either mechanical or thermal energies into electrical energies due to high pyroelectric coefficients.},

In this study, the catalytic activity of pyridine-containing materials was for the first time structurally demonstrated in CO 2 RR by crystalline supramolecular coordination compounds model system. The system consists of three stable supramolecular coordination compounds (Ni-TPYP, Ni-TPYP-1 and Ni-TPP) with different numbers (4, 2 and 0) of active pyridine groups (i.e. uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen atoms). The electrocatalytic test results show that with the decrease of the number of active pyridine groups, the CO 2 RR performance is gradually reduced, mainly showing the reduction of highest FE CO (99.8%, 83.7% and 25.6%, respectively). The crystallographic, experimental and theoretical evidences prove that the CO 2 RR activity is more likely derived from uncoordinated pyridine nitrogen than the electrocatalytic inert metal nickel in porphyrin center.

  abstract     = {High throughput single-cell RNA-seq has been successfully implemented to dissect the cellular and molecular features underlying hematopoiesis. However, an elaborate and comprehensive transcriptome reference of the whole blood system is lacking. Here, we profiled the transcriptomes of 7551 human blood cells representing 32 immunophenotypic cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells, progenitors and mature blood cells derived from 21 healthy donors. With high sequencing depth and coverage, we constructed a single-cell transcriptional atlas of blood cells (ABC) on the basis of both protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and showed a high consistence between them. Notably, putative lncRNAs and transcription factors regulating hematopoietic cell differentiation were identified. While common transcription factor regulatory networks were activated in neutrophils and monocytes, lymphoid cells dramatically changed their regulatory networks during differentiation. Furthermore, we showed a subset of nucleated erythrocytes actively expressing immune signals, suggesting the existence of erythroid precursors with immune functions. Finally, a web portal offering transcriptome browsing and blood cell type prediction has been established. Thus, our work provides a transcriptional map of human blood cells at single-cell resolution, thereby offering a comprehensive reference for the exploration of physiological and pathological hematopoiesis.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) and its variants have led to many state-of-the-art results in various fields. However, a clear theoretical understanding of such networks is still lacking. Recently, a multilayer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) model has been proposed and proved to equal such simply stacked networks (plain networks). Here, we consider the initialization, the dictionary design and the number of iterations to be factors in each layer that greatly affect the performance of the ML-CSC model. Inspired by these considerations, we propose two novel multilayer models: the residual convolutional sparse coding (Res-CSC) model and the mixed-scale dense convolutional sparse coding (MSD-CSC) model. They are closely related to the residual neural network (ResNet) and the mixed-scale (dilated) dense neural network (MSDNet), respectively. Mathematically, we derive the skip connection in the ResNet as a special case of a new forward propagation rule for the ML-CSC model. We also find a theoretical interpretation of dilated convolution and dense connection in the MSDNet by analyzing the MSD-CSC model, which gives a clear mathematical understanding of each. We implement the iterative soft thresholding algorithm and its fast version to solve the Res-CSC and MSD-CSC models. The unfolding operation can be employed for further improvement. Finally, extensive numerical experiments and comparison with competing methods demonstrate their effectiveness.},

Despite the considerably different emissions of chemical species among the sites, a common relationship was found between the characteristics of NPF and the stability intensity. The stability parameter (ζ = Z / L , where Z is the height above ground and L is the Monin–Obukhov length) is found to play an important role; it drops significantly before NPF as the atmosphere becomes more unstable, which may serve as an indicator of nucleation bursts. As the atmosphere becomes unstable, the NPF duration is closely related to the tendency for turbulence development, which influences the evolution of the condensation sink. Presumably, the unstable atmosphere may dilute pre-existing particles, effectively reducing the condensation sink, especially at coarse mode to foster nucleation. This new mechanism is confirmed by model simulations using a molecular dynamic model that mimics the impact of turbulence development on nucleation by inducing and intensifying homogeneous nucleation events.},

  abstract     = {Climate change and increased urban population are two major concerns for society. Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.},

However, it is challenging to obtain uniform TMDCs with clean surfaces, because of the difficulties in controlling the way the reactants are supplied to the reaction in the current chemical vapor deposition growth process. Here, we report a new growth approach called ‘dissolution-precipitation’ (DP) growth, where the metal sources are sealed inside glass substrates to control their feeding to the reaction. Noteworthy, the diffusion of metal source inside glass to its surface provides a uniform metal source on the glass surface, and restricts the TMDC growth to only a surface reaction while eliminating unwanted gas-phase reaction. This feature gives rise to highly uniform monolayer TMDCs with a clean surface on centimeter-scale substrates. The DP growth works well for a large variety of TMDCs and their alloys, providing a solid foundation for the controlled growth of clean TMDCs by the fine control of the metal source.},

However, the discovery of novel electro-optic crystals is sporadic due to the difficulties of large-sized crystal growth for electro-optic coefficient measurement. Herein, to address this issue, a high-efficacy evaluation method using accessible powder samples is proposed in which the second-harmonic-generation effect, infrared reflectance spectrum and Raman spectrum are introduced to predict the magnitude of the electro-optic coefficient. The calculated electro-optic coefficients of numerous reported electro-optic crystals through this approach give universal agreement to the experimental values, evidencing the validity of the strategy. Based on this method, CsLiMoO 4 is screened as a novel potential electro-optic crystal and a high-quality crystal is grown by the Czochralski technique for electro-optic coefficient measurement using the half-wave voltage method, the result of which is also comparable to the calculated value. Consequently, the evaluation strategy presented here will pave a new way to explore promising electro-optic crystals efficiently.},

MAF-9 and MAF-2F can adsorb large amounts of organic solvents but completely exclude water, showing superhydrophobicity with water contact angles of 152 o in between those of FMOF-1 and MAF-2. MAF-9 exhibits very large N 2 -induced breathing and colossal positive and negative thermal expansions like FMOF-1, but the lower molecular weight and smaller volume of MAF-9 give 16% and 4% higher gravimetric and volumetric N 2 uptakes, respectively. In contrast, MAF-2F is quite rigid and does not show the inversed temperature-dependent N 2 adsorption and large guest-induced expansion like MAF-2. Further, despite the higher molecular weight and larger volume, MAF-2F possesses 6% and 25% higher gravimetric and volumetric CO 2 uptakes, respectively. These results can be explained by the different pore sizes and side group arrangements in the two classic framework prototypes, which demonstrate the delicate roles of ligand side groups in controlling porosity, surface characteristic and flexibility.},

  abstract     = {The oxygenation of Earth&#39;s atmosphere is widely regarded to have played an important role in early-life evolution. Chromium (Cr) isotopes recorded in sedimentary rocks have been used to constrain the atmospheric oxygen level (AOL) over geological times based on the fact that a positive Cr isotopic signature is linked to the presence of Cr(VI) as a result of oxidative continental weathering. However, there is no direct evidence of the presence of Cr(VI) in sedimentary rocks yet. Carbonates are most widely distributed over geological times and were thought to have incorporated Cr(VI) directly from seawater. Here, we present results of Cr valence states in carbonates which show Cr(III) is the dominant species in all samples spanning a wide range of geological times. These findings indicate that Cr(VI) in seawater was reduced either before or after carbonate precipitation, which might have caused Cr isotopic fractionation between seawater and carbonates, or marine carbonates preferentially uptake Cr(III) from seawater. As Cr(III) can come from non-redox Cr cycling, which also can cause isotopic fractionation, we suggest that positively fractionated Cr isotopic values do not necessarily correspond to the rise in AOL.},

In this work, we report the hierarchical structural complexity of atomically precise nanoclusters in micrometric linear chains (1D array), grid networks (2D array) and superstructures (3D array). In the crystal lattice, the Ag 29 (SSR) 12 (PPh 3 ) 4 nanoclusters can be viewed as unassembled cluster dots ( Ag 29 –0D ). In the presence of Cs + cations, the Ag 29 (SSR) 12 nano-building blocks are selectively assembled into distinct arrays with different oxygen-carrying solvent molecules―Cs@Ag 29 (SSR) 12 (DMF) x as 1D linear chains ( Ag 29 –1D ), Cs@Ag 29 (SSR) 12 (NMP) x as 2D grid networks ( Ag 29 –2D ), and Cs@Ag 29 (SSR) 12 (TMS) x as 3D superstructures ( Ag 29 –3D ). Such self-assemblies of these Ag 29 (SSR) 12 units have not only been observed in their crystalline state, but also in their amorphous state. Due to the diverse surface structures and crystalline packing modes, these Ag 29 -based assemblies manifest distinguishable optical absorptions and emissions in both solutions and crystallized films. Furthermore, the surface areas of the nanocluster crystals are evaluated, the maximum value of which occurs when the cluster nano-building blocks are assembled into 2D arrays (i.e. Ag 29 –2D ). Overall, this work presents an exciting example of the hierarchical assembly of atomically precise nanoclusters by simply controlling the adsorbed molecules on the cluster surface.},

  abstract     = {Waveguides and resonators are core components in the large-scale integration of electronics, photonics and phononics, both in existing and future scenarios. In certain situations, there is critical coupling of the two components; i.e. no energy passes through the waveguide after the incoming wave couples into the resonator. The transmission spectral characteristics resulting from this phenomenon are highly advantageous for signal filtering, switching, multiplexing and sensing. In the present study, adopting an elastic-wave platform, we introduce topological insulator (TI), a remarkable achievement in condensed matter physics over the past decade, into a classical waveguide-ring-resonator configuration. Along with basic similarities with classical systems, a TI system has important differences and advantages, mostly owing to the spin-momentum locked transmission states at the TI boundaries. As an example, a two-port TI waveguide resonator can fundamentally eliminate upstream reflections while completely retaining useful transmission spectral characteristics, and maximize the energy in the resonator, with possible applications being novel signal processing, gyro/sensing, lasering, energy harvesting and intense wave–matter interactions, using phonons, photons or even electrons. The present work further enhances confidence in using topological protection for practical device performance and functionalities, especially considering the crucial advantage of introducing (pseudo)spins to existing conventional configurations. More in-depth research on advancing phononics/photonics, especially on-chip, is foreseen.},

More recently, functional hydrogel coatings with controlled thickness and tough adhesion have been achieved on various substrates. Hydrogel-coated substrates combine the advantages of hydrogels, such as lubricity, biocompatibility and anti-biofouling properties, with the advantages of substrates, such as stiffness, toughness and strength. In this review, we focus on three aspects of functional hydrogel coatings: (i) applications and functions enabled by hydrogel coatings, (ii) methods of coating various substrates with different functional hydrogels with tough adhesion, and (iii) tests to evaluate the adhesion between functional hydrogel coatings and substrates.

We demonstrate herein a blue emissive rare earth cerium(III) complex Ce-2 showing a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95% and a short excited state lifetime of 52.0 ns in doped film, which is considerably faster than that achieved in typical efficient phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (typical lifetimes &gt;1 μs). The corresponding OLED shows a maximum EQE up to 20.8% and a still high EQE of 18.2% at 1000 cd m −2 , as well as an operation lifetime 70 times longer than that of a classic phosphorescence OLED. The excellent performance indicates that cerium(III) complex could be a candidate for efficient and stable blue OLEDs because of its spin- and parity-allowed d−f transition from the Ce 3+ ion.},

A neuromorphic vision system with brain-inspired visual perception provides a promising solution to the problem. Here we propose and demonstrate a prototype neuromorphic vision system by networking a retinomorphic sensor with a memristive crossbar. We fabricate the retinomorphic sensor by using WSe 2 /h-BN/Al 2 O 3 van der Waals heterostructures with gate-tunable photoresponses, to closely mimic the human retinal capabilities in simultaneously sensing and processing images. We then network the sensor with a large-scale Pt/Ta/HfO 2 /Ta one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) memristive crossbar, which plays a similar role to the visual cortex in the human brain. The realized neuromorphic vision system allows for fast letter recognition and object tracking, indicating the capabilities of image sensing, processing and recognition in the full analog regime. Our work suggests that such a neuromorphic vision system may open up unprecedented opportunities in future visual perception applications.},

Here, we report a strategy of achieving multiple competitive lasing signals in responsive organic microspheres where a donor–acceptor pair was introduced. The competitive lasing from the donor and acceptor was reversibly switched by modulating the competition between the radiative rate of the donor and the rate of energy transfer, and the generated multiple lasing signals enabled a quaternary coding for recognizable cryptographic implementation. Data encryption and extraction were demonstrated using a 4 × 4 microlaser array, showing vast prospects in avoiding the disclosure of security information. The results offer a comprehensive understanding of excited-state dynamics in organic composite materials, which may play a major role in high-security optical recording and information encryption.},

In this review, we categorize such nanomaterials into (i) nanomaterials that elevate oxygen levels in tumors for enhanced oxygen-dependent tumor therapy and (ii) nanomaterials with diminished oxygen dependence for hypoxic tumor therapy. To elevate oxygen levels in tumors, oxygen-carrying nanomaterials, oxygen-generating nanomaterials and oxygen-economizing nanomaterials can be used. To diminish oxygen dependence of nanomaterials for hypoxic tumor therapy, therapeutic gas-generating nanomaterials and radical-generating nanomaterials can be used.

  abstract     = {The dendrite growth of Li anodes severely degrades the performance of lithium-oxygen (Li-O 2 ) batteries. Recently, hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) has been regarded as one of the most promising routes to tackle this problem. However, before this is realized, the HSE needs to simultaneously satisfy contradictory requirements of high modulus and even, flexible contact with Li anode, while ensuring uniform Li + distribution. To tackle this complex dilemma, here, an HSE with rigid Li 1.5 Al 0.5 Ge 1.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (LAGP) core@ultrathin flexible poly (vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) shell interface has been developed. The introduced large amount of nanometer-sized LAGP cores can not only act as structural enhancer to achieve high Young&#39;s modulus but can also construct Li + diffusion network to homogenize Li + distribution. The ultrathin flexible PVDF-HFP shell provides soft and stable contact between the rigid core and Li metal without affecting the Li + distribution, meanwhile suppressing the reduction of LAGP induced by direct contact with Li metal. Thanks to these advantages, this ingenious HSE with ultra-high Young&#39;s modulus of 25 GPa endows dendrite-free Li deposition even at a deposition capacity of 23.6 mAh. Moreover, with the successful inhibition of Li dendrites, the HSE-based quasi-solid-state Li-O 2 battery delivers a long cycling stability of 146 cycles, which is more than three times that of gel polymer electrolyte-based Li-O 2 battery. This new insight may serve as a starting point for further designing of HSE in Li-O 2 batteries, and can also be extended to various battery systems such as sodium-oxygen batteries.},

For nine regions covering nearly the whole globe, we collected inventory estimates of carbon-stock changes complemented by satellite estimates of biomass changes where inventory data are missing. The net land–atmospheric carbon exchange (NEE) was calculated by taking the sum of the carbon-stock change and lateral carbon fluxes from crop and wood trade, and riverine-carbon export to the ocean. Summing up NEE from all regions, we obtained a global ‘bottom-up’ NEE for net land anthropogenic CO 2 uptake of –2.2 ± 0.6 PgC yr −1 consistent with the independent top-down NEE from the global atmospheric carbon budget during 2000–2009. This estimate is so far the most comprehensive global bottom-up carbon budget accounting, which set up an important milestone for global carbon-cycle studies. By decomposing NEE into component fluxes, we found that global soil heterotrophic respiration amounts to a source of CO 2 of 39 PgC yr −1 with an interquartile of 33–46 PgC yr −1 —a much smaller portion of net primary productivity than previously reported.},

However, the relationship between phytoplankton biomass and DMS emissions is debated and inconclusive. Our study presents field observations from 100 freshwater lakes, in concert with data of global ocean DMS emissions, showing that DMS and algal biomass show a hump-shaped relationship, i.e. DMS emissions to the atmosphere increase up to a pH of about 8.1 but, at higher pH, DMS concentrations decline, likely mainly due to decomposition. Our findings from lake and ocean ecosystems worldwide were corroborated in experimental studies. This novel finding allows assessments of more accurate global patterns of DMS emissions and advances our knowledge on the negative feedback regulation of phytoplankton-driven DMS emissions on climate.},

Despite such large decreases in primary pollution, there were nonetheless several periods of heavy haze pollution in eastern China, raising questions about the well-established relationship between human activities and air quality. Here, using comprehensive measurements and modeling, we show that the haze during the COVID lockdown was driven by enhancements of secondary pollution. In particular, large decreases in NO x emissions from transportation increased ozone and nighttime NO 3 radical formation, and these increases in atmospheric oxidizing capacity in turn facilitated the formation of secondary particulate matter. Our results, afforded by the tragic natural experiment of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicate that haze mitigation depends upon a coordinated and balanced strategy for controlling multiple pollutants.},

  abstract     = {Aging-related degeneration of pancreatic islet cells contributes to impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Endocrine cells age heterogeneously, complicating the efforts to unravel the molecular drivers underlying endocrine aging. To overcome these obstacles, we undertook single-cell RNA sequencing of pancreatic islet cells obtained from young and aged non-diabetic cynomolgus monkeys. Despite sex differences and increased transcriptional variations, aged β-cells showed increased unfolded protein response (UPR) along with the accumulation of protein aggregates. We observed transcriptomic dysregulation of UPR components linked to canonical ATF6 and IRE1 signaling pathways, comprising adaptive UPR during pancreatic aging. Notably, we found aging-related β-cell-specific upregulation of HSP90B1, an endoplasmic reticulum-located chaperone, impeded high glucose-induced insulin secretion. Our work decodes aging-associated transcriptomic changes that underlie pancreatic islet functional decay at single-cell resolution and indicates that targeting UPR components may prevent loss of proteostasis, suggesting an avenue to delaying β-cell aging and preventing aging-related diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Classical r- vs. K -selection theory describes the trade-offs between high reproductive output and competitiveness and guides research in evolutionary ecology. While its impact has waned in the recent past, cancer evolution may rekindle it. Herein, we impose r - or K -selection on cancer cell lines to obtain strongly proliferative r cells and highly competitive K cells to test ideas on life-history strategy evolution. RNA-seq indicates that the trade-offs are associated with distinct expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, adhesion, apoptosis, and contact inhibition. Both empirical observations and simulations based on an ecological competition model show that the trade-off between cell proliferation and competitiveness can evolve adaptively. When the r and K cells are mixed, they exhibit strikingly different spatial and temporal distributions. Due to this niche separation, the fitness of the entire tumor increases. The contrasting selective pressure may operate in a realistic ecological setting of actual tumors.},

  abstract     = {Contact interface properties are important in determining the performances of devices that are based on atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially for those with short channels. Understanding the contact interface is therefore important to design better devices. Herein, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations to reveal the electronic structures within the metallic (1T ′ )-semiconducting (2H) MoTe 2 coplanar phase boundary across a wide spectral range and correlate its properties to atomic structures. We find that the 2H-MoTe 2 excitonic peaks cross the phase boundary into the 1T ′ phase within a range of approximately 150 nm. The 1T ′ -MoTe 2 crystal field can penetrate the boundary and extend into the 2H phase by approximately two unit-cells. The plasmonic oscillations exhibit strong angle dependence, that is a red-shift of π+σ (approximately 0.3–1.2 eV) occurs within 4 nm at 1T ′ /2H-MoTe 2 boundaries with large tilt angles, but there is no shift at zero-tilted boundaries. These atomic-scale measurements reveal the structure–property relationships of the 1T ′ /2H-MoTe 2 boundary, providing useful information for phase boundary engineering and device development based on 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {Many layered superlattice materials intrinsically possess large Seebeck coefficient and low lattice thermal conductivity, but poor electrical conductivity because of the interlayer transport barrier for charges, which has become a stumbling block for achieving high thermoelectric performance. Herein, taking BiCuSeO superlattice as an example, it is demonstrated that efficient interlayer charge release can increase carrier concentration, thereby activating multiple Fermi pockets through Bi/Cu dual vacancies and Pb codoping. Experimental results reveal that the extrinsic charges, which are introduced by Pb and initially trapped in the charge-reservoir [Bi 2 O 2 ] 2+ sublayers, are effectively released into [Cu 2 Se 2 ] 2− sublayers via the channels bridged by Bi/Cu dual vacancies. This efficient interlayer charge release endows dual-vacancy- and Pb-codoped BiCuSeO with increased carrier concentration and electrical conductivity. Moreover, with increasing carrier concentration, the Fermi level is pushed down, activating multiple converged valence bands, which helps to maintain a relatively high Seebeck coefficient and yield an enhanced power factor. As a result, a high ZT value of ∼1.4 is achieved at 823 K in codoped Bi 0.90 Pb 0.06 Cu 0.96 SeO, which is superior to that of pristine BiCuSeO and solely doped samples. The present findings provide prospective insights into the exploration of high-performance thermoelectric materials and the underlying transport physics.},

Although many of these materials have already become ‘stars’ in materials science and condensed-matter physics, little attention has been paid to the roles of the SMR unit across a wide range of compositions and structures. In this article, we systematically analyze these materials with respect to their very basic SMR structural unit, which has been found to play a deterministic role in the occurrence of many intriguing properties and phenomena, such as Dirac electronic and phononic spectra, superconductivity and topology. As a result, we have defined this group of materials as SMR inorganic materials, opening up a new perspective on materials research and development. With their unique properties, SMR materials deserve wide attention and in-depth investigation from materials design, new physical discoveries to target-wizard applications. It is expected that SMR materials will find niche applications in next-generation information technology, renewable energy, space, etc.},

By applying the ‘individual-output’ model of genetic drift to the SARS-CoV-2 diversities, we obtain I 0 &lt; 10, which could have been achieved by one infected traveler in a long-distance flight. The conclusion is robust regardless of the source population, the continuation of inputs ( I t for t &gt; 0) or the fitness of the variants. With such a tiny trickle of human movement igniting many outbreaks, the crucial stage of repressing an epidemic in any region should, therefore, be the very first sign of local contagion when positive cases first become identifiable. The implications of the highly ‘portable’ epidemics, including their early evolution prior to any outbreak, are explored in the companion study (Ruan et al. , personal communication).},

  abstract     = {Targeted immunization of centralized nodes in large-scale networks has attracted significant attention. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited, thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or quarantine) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central among these n nodes is immunized. This process can globally immunize a network. We find that even for small n (≈10) there is significant improvement in the immunization (quarantine), which is very close to the levels of immunization with full knowledge. We develop an analytical framework for our method and determine the critical percolation threshold p c and the size of the giant component P ∞ for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P ( k ). In the limit of n → ∞ we recover prior work on targeted immunization, whereas for n = 1 we recover the known case of random immunization. Between these two extremes, we observe that, as n increases, p c increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization with complete information. In particular, we find a new general scaling relationship between | p c (∞) − p c ( n )| and n as | p c (∞) − p c ( n )| ∼ n −1 exp(−α n ). For scale-free (SF) networks, where P ( k ) ∼ k −γ , 2 &lt; γ &lt; 3, we find that p c has a transition from zero to nonzero when n increases from n = 1 to O (log N ) (where N is the size of the network). Thus, for SF networks, having knowledge of  ≈log N nodes and immunizing the most optimal among them can dramatically reduce epidemic spreading. We also demonstrate our limited knowledge immunization strategy on several real-world networks and confirm that in these real networks, p c increases significantly even for small n .},

Utilizing our newly developed deep-ultraviolet laser ionization mass spectrometry technique, here we observe the reactions of neutral cobalt clusters with oxygen and find a very stable cluster species of Co 13 O 8 that dominates the mass distribution in the presence of a large flow rate of oxygen gas. The results of global-minimum structural search reveal a unique cubic structure and distinctive stability of the neutral Co 13 O 8 cluster that forms a new class of metal oxides that we named as ‘metalloxocubes’. Thermodynamics and kinetics calculations illustrate the structural evolution from icosahedral Co 13 to the metalloxocube Co 13 O 8 with decreased energy, enhanced stability and aromaticity. This class of neutral oxygen-passivated metal clusters may be an ideal candidate for genetic materials because of the cubic nature of the building blocks and the stability due to cubic aromaticity.},

  abstract     = {Topological photonics is an emerging research area that focuses on the topological states of classical light. Here we reveal the topological phases that are intrinsic to the quantum nature of light, i.e. solely related to the quantized Fock states and the inhomogeneous coupling strengths between them. The Hamiltonian of two cavities coupled with a two-level atom is an intrinsic one-dimensional Su-Schriefer-Heeger model of Fock states. By adding another cavity, the Fock-state lattice is extended to two dimensions with a honeycomb structure, where the strain due to the inhomogeneous coupling strengths of the annihilation operator induces a Lifshitz topological phase transition between a semimetal and three band insulators within the lattice. In the semimetallic phase, the strain is equivalent to a pseudomagnetic field, which results in the quantization of the Landau levels and the valley Hall effect. We further construct an inhomogeneous Fock-state Haldane model where the topological phases can be characterized by the topological markers. With d cavities being coupled to the atom, the lattice is extended to d − 1 dimensions without an upper limit. In this study we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between the topological phases in quantum and classical optics and provide a novel platform for studying topological physics in dimensions higher than three.},

We investigated the associations between macronutrients, body composition, blood hormones and glucose homeostasis. We fed C57BL/6N mice 29 different diets with variable macronutrients for 12 weeks. After 10 weeks, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed. Generalized linear models were generated to evaluate the impacts of macronutrients, body composition and blood hormones on glucose homeostasis. The area under the glucose curve (AUC) was strongly associated with body fat mass, but not dietary macronutrients. AUC was significantly associated with fasting insulin levels. Six genes from transcriptomic analysis of epididymal white adipose tissue and subcutaneous white adipose tissue were significantly associated with AUC. These genes may encode secreted proteins that play important previously unanticipated roles in glucose homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge of intrinsic wettability at solid/liquid interfaces at the molecular level perspective is significant in understanding crucial progress in some fields, such as electrochemistry, molecular biology and earth science. It is generally believed that surface wettability is determined by the surface chemical component and surface topography. However, when taking molecular structures and interactions into consideration, many intriguing phenomena would enrich or even redress our understanding of surface wettability. From the perspective of interfacial water molecule structures, here, we discovered that the intrinsic wettability of crystal metal oxide is not only dependent on the chemical components but also critically dependent on the crystal faces. For example, the |$( {1\bar{1}02} )$| crystal face of α-Al 2 O 3 is intrinsically hydrophobic with a water contact angle near 90°, while another three crystal faces are intrinsically hydrophilic with water contact angles &lt;65°. Based on surface energy analysis, it is found that the total surface energy, polar component and Lewis base portion of the hydrophobic crystal face are all smaller than the other three hydrophilic crystal faces indicating that they have different surface states. DFT simulation further revealed that the adsorbed interfacial water molecules on each crystal face hold various orientations. Herein, the third crucial factor for surface wettability from the perspective of the molecular level is presented, that is the orientations of adsorbed interfacial water molecules apart from the macro-level chemical component and surface topography. This study may serve as a source of inspiration for improving wetting theoretical models and designing controllable wettability at the molecular/atomic level.},

  abstract     = {Salt stress is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth and productivity. We recently discovered an important new salt tolerance pathway, where the cell wall leucine-rich repeat extensins LRX3/4/5, the RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides RALF22/23 and receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) function as a module to simultaneously regulate plant growth and salt stress tolerance. However, the intracellular signaling pathways that are regulated by the extracellular LRX3/4/5-RALF22/23-FER module to coordinate growth, cell wall integrity and salt stress responses are still unknown. Here, we report that the LRX3/4/5-RALF22/23-FER module negatively regulates the levels of jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Blocking JA pathway rescues the dwarf phenotype of the lrx345 and fer-4 mutants, while disruption of ABA biosynthesis suppresses the salt-hypersensitivity of these mutants. Many salt stress-responsive genes display abnormal expression patterns in the lrx345 and fer-4 mutants, as well as in the wild type plants treated with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an inhibitor of pectin methylesterases, suggesting cell wall integrity as a critical factor that determines the expression pattern of stress-responsive genes. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is constitutively increased in the lrx345 and fer-4 mutants, and inhibition of ROS accumulation suppresses the salt-hypersensitivity of these mutants. Together, our work provides strong evidence that the LRX3/4/5-RALF22/23-FER module controls plant growth and salt stress responses by regulating hormonal homeostasis and ROS accumulation.},

Human brain has a unique network structure with different regions of interesting to perform cognitive tasks. Using coupled neural mass oscillators on human cortical network and paying attention to both global and local regions, we observe a new feature of chimera states with multiple spatial scales and a positive correlation between the synchronization preference of local region and the degree of symmetry of the connectivity of the region in the network. Further, we use the concept of effective symmetry in the network to build structural and dynamical hierarchical trees and find close matching between them. These results help to explain the multiple brain rhythms observed in experiments and suggest a generic principle for complex brain network as a structure substrate to support diverse functional patterns.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT) is able to ablate tumors using an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to heat up magnetocaloric agents (e.g. magnetic nanoparticles) administered into the tumors. For clinical applications, there is still a demand to find new magnetocaloric agents with strong AMF-induced heating performance and excellent biocompatibility. As a kind of biocompatible and biodegradable material, magnesium (Mg) and its alloys have been extensively used in the clinic as an implant metal. Herein, we discovered that the eddy thermal effect of the magnesium alloy (MgA) could be employed for MHT to effectively ablate tumors. Under low-field-intensity AMFs, MgA rods could be rapidly heated, resulting in a temperature increase in nearby tissues. Such AMF-induced eddy thermal heating of MgA could not only be used to kill tumor cells in vitro , but also be employed for effective and accurate ablation of tumors in vivo . In addition to killing tumors in mice, we further demonstrated that VX 2 tumors of much larger sizes growing in rabbits after implantation of MgA rods could also be eliminated after exposure to an AMF, illustrating the ability of MgA-based MHT to kill large-sized tumors. Moreover, the implanted MgA rods showed excellent biocompatibility and ∼20% of their mass was degraded within three months. Our work thus discovered for the first time that non-magnetic biodegradable MgA, an extensively used implant metal in clinic, could be used for effective magnetic thermal ablation of tumors under a low-field-intensity AMF. Such a strategy could be readily translated into clinical use.},

Here, we argue that these are misconceptions derived in large part from simplistic geodynamic and climate modeling, as well as proxy misinterpretation. The growth of Tibet was a complex process involving mostly Mesozoic collisions of several Gondwanan terranes with Asia, thickening the crust and generating complex relief before the arrival of India. In this review, Earth system modeling, paleoaltimetry proxies and fossil finds contribute to a new synthetic view of the topographic evolution of Tibet. A notable feature overlooked in previous models of plateau formation was the persistence through much of the Cenozoic of a wide east–west orientated deep central valley, and the formation of a plateau occurred only in the late Neogene through compression and internal sedimentation.},

The detailed electrocatalytic studies reveal that the Pt 3 Fe nanocrystals exhibit shape-dependent NRR electrocatalysis. The optimized Pt 3 Fe nanowires bounded with high-index facets exhibit excellent selectivity (no N 2 H 4 is detected), high activity with NH 3 yield of 18.3 μg h −1 mg −1 cat (0.52 μg h −1 cm −2 ECSA ; ECSA: electrochemical active surface area) and Faraday efficiency of 7.3% at −0.05 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming the {200} facet-enclosed Pt 3 Fe nanocubes and {111} facet-enclosed Pt 3 Fe nanorods. They also show good stability with negligible activity change after five cycles.

The distribution of these characteristics mapped onto the phylogeny of Phasmatodea reveals that abdominal extensions and femoral spines developed multiple times during the evolution of stick insects, and indicates that the origin of abdominal extensions predates other modifications, while tergal extensions predate other expansions of the body, such as those of the sterna and pleura, as well as defensive femoral spines. The new fossil provides clues into early antipredator defensive strategies, allows inferences as to the potential environment and predators, and reveals the mimetic and defensive mechanisms of stick insects from 165 million years ago.},

  abstract     = {The interplay between Pleistocene climatic variability and hominin adaptations to diverse terrestrial ecosystems is a key topic in human evolutionary studies. Early and Middle Pleistocene environmental change and its relation to hominin behavioural responses has been a subject of great interest in Africa and Europe, though little information is available for other key regions of the Old World, particularly from Eastern Asia. Here we examine key Early Pleistocene sites of the Nihewan Basin, in high-latitude northern China, dating between ∼1.4 and 1.0 million years ago (Ma). We compare stone-tool assemblages from three Early Pleistocene sites in the Nihewan Basin, including detailed assessment of stone-tool refitting sequences at the ∼1.1-Ma-old site of Cenjiawan. Increased toolmaking skills and technological innovations are evident in the Nihewan Basin at the onset of the Mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MPT). Examination of the lithic technology of the Nihewan sites, together with an assessment of other key Palaeolithic sites of China, indicates that toolkits show increasing diversity at the outset of the MPT and in its aftermath. The overall evidence indicates the adaptive flexibility of early hominins to ecosystem changes since the MPT, though regional abandonments are also apparent in high latitudes, likely owing to cold and oscillating environmental conditions. The view presented here sharply contrasts with traditional arguments that stone-tool technologies of China are homogeneous and continuous over the course of the Early Pleistocene.},
