  abstract     = {Males and females are subjected to distinct kinds of selection pressures, often leading to the evolution of sex-specific genetic architecture, an example being sex-specific dominance. Sex-specific dominance reversals (SSDRs), where alleles at sexually antagonistic loci are at least partially dominant in the sex they benefit, have been documented in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and seed beetles. Another interesting feature of many sexually reproducing organisms is the asymmetric inheritance pattern of X chromosomes, which often leads to distinct evolutionary outcomes on X chromosomes compared to autosomes. Examples include the higher efficacy of sexually concordant selection on X chromosomes, and X chromosomes being more conducive to the maintenance of sexually antagonistic polymorphisms under certain conditions. Immunocompetence is a trait that has been extensively investigated for sexual dimorphism with growing evidence for sex-specific or sexually antagonistic variation. X chromosomes have been shown to harbor substantial immunity-related genetic variation in the fruit fly, ; . Here, using interpopulation crosses and cytogenetic cloning, we investigated sex-specific dominance and the role of the X chromosome in improved postinfection survivorship of laboratory populations of ;  selected against pathogenic challenge by ; . We could not detect any contribution of the X chromosome to the evolved immunocompetence of our selected populations, as well as to within-population variation in immunocompetence. However, we found strong evidence of sex-specific dominance related to surviving bacterial infection. Our results indicate that alleles that confer a survival advantage to the selected populations are, on average, partially dominant in females but partially recessive in males. This could also imply an SSDR for overall fitness, given the putative evidence for sexually antagonistic selection affecting immunocompetence in ; . We also highlight sex-specific dominance as a potential mechanism of sex differences in immunocompetence, with population-level sex differences primarily driven by sex differences in heterozygotes.},

If so, reduced or curtailed reproductive effort might be expected to increase immunity. In support of this notion, work in ; has shown that worms lacking a germline exhibit improved immunity, but whether the antagonistic relation between germline proliferation and immunity also holds for other organisms is less well understood. Here, we report that transgenic ablation of germ cells in late development or early adulthood in ; causes elevated baseline expression and increased induction of Toll and Imd immune genes upon bacterial infection, as compared to fertile flies with an intact germline. We also identify immune genes whose expression after infection differs between fertile and germline-less flies in a manner that is conditional on their mating status. We conclude that germline activity strongly impedes the expression and inducibility of immune genes and that this physiological trade-off might be evolutionarily conserved.},

  abstract     = {Tripartite interactions between plants, herbivores, and pollinators hold fitness consequences for most angiosperms. However, little is known on how plants evolve in response—and in particular what the net selective outcomes are for traits of shared relevance to pollinators and herbivores. In this study, we manipulated herbivory (“presence” and “absence” treatments) and pollination (“open” and “hand pollination” treatments) in a full factorial common-garden experiment with woodland strawberry (; L.). This design allowed us to quantify the relative importance and interactive effects of herbivore- and pollinator-mediated selection on nine traits related to plant defence and attraction. Our results showed that pollinators imposed stronger selection than herbivores on traits related to both direct and indirect (i.e., tritrophic) defence. However, conflicting selection was imposed on inflorescence density: a trait that appears to be shared by herbivores and pollinators as a host plant signal. However, in all cases, selection imposed by one agent depended largely on the presence or ecological effect of the other, suggesting that dynamic patterns of selection could be a common outcome of these interactions in natural populations. As a whole, our findings highlight the significance of plant-herbivore-pollinator interactions as potential drivers of evolutionary change, and reveal that pollinators likely play an underappreciated role as selective agents on direct and in direct plant defence.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary innovations can facilitate diversification if the novel trait enables a lineage to exploit new niches or by expanding character space. The elaborate pharyngeal jaw apparatus of cichlid fishes is often referred to as an evolutionary “key innovation” that has promoted the spectacular adaptive radiations in these fishes. This goes back to the idea that the structural and functional independence of the oral and pharyngeal jaws for food capturing and food processing, respectively, permitted each jaw type to follow independent evolutionary trajectories. This “evolutionary decoupling” is thought to have facilitated novel trait combinations and, hence, ecological specialization, ultimately allowing more species to coexist in sympatry. Here, we test the hypotheses of evolutionary decoupling of the oral and pharyngeal jaws in the massive adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in African Lake Tanganyika. Based on phylogenetic comparative analyses of oral jaw morphology and lower pharyngeal jaw shape across most of the ∼240 cichlid species occurring in that lake, we show that the two jaws evolved coupled along the main axes of morphological variation, yet most other components of these trait complexes evolved largely independently over the course of the radiation. Further, we find limited correlations between the two jaws in both overall divergence and evolutionary rates. Moreover, we show that the two jaws were evolutionary decoupled at a late stage of the radiation, suggesting that decoupling contributed to micro-niche partitioning and the associated rapidly increasing trophic diversity during this phase.},

Our analyses revealed that ; shapes global expression patterns, most likely via linked variation, but the extent of this effect is variable, with much stronger effects in adults than larvae. Furthermore, within adults, both common as well as sex-specific patterns were found. The vast majority of these differentially expressed genes mapped to ; . However, genes that were differentially expressed in a single context (i.e., in males, females, or larvae) were more likely to be located outside of ; . By combining our findings with genomic scans for environmentally associated SNPs, we were able to pinpoint candidate variants in the inversion that may underlie mechanistic pathways that determine phenotypes. Together the results of this study, combined with previous findings, support the notion that the polymorphic ; inversion in this species is a major factor shaping both coding and regulatory variation resulting in highly complex adaptive effects.},

The widespread availability of genome data, along with novel statistical techniques, has made it easier to detect these changes. We apply one such method, the “Singleton Density Score” (SDS), to the Holstein breed of ; to detect recent selection (arising up to around 740 years ago). We identify several genes as candidates for targets of recent selection, including some relating to cell regulation, catabolic processes, neural-cell adhesion and immunity. We do not find strong evidence that three traits that are important to humans—milk protein content, milk fat content, and stature—have been subject to directional selection. Simulations demonstrate that because ; recently experienced a population bottleneck, singletons are depleted so the power of SDS methods is reduced.

This division of labor, however, is vulnerable to genetic elements that favor the development of their carriers into queens. Several factors, such as intracolonial relatedness, can modulate the spread of such caste-biasing genotypes. Here we investigate the effects of a notable yet understudied ecological setting: where larvae produced by hybridization develop into sterile workers. Using mathematical modeling, we show that the coevolution of hybridization with caste determination readily triggers an evolutionary arms race between nonhybrid larvae that increasingly develop into queens, and queens that increasingly hybridize to produce workers. Even where hybridization reduces worker function and colony fitness, this race can lead to the loss of developmental plasticity and to genetically hard-wired caste determination. Overall, our results may help understand the repeated evolution toward remarkable reproductive systems (e.g., social hybridogenesis) observed in several ant species.},

Here, we examine the prevalence of and variation in introgression using phylogenomic data from a large (1300+ species), geographically widespread avian group, the suboscine birds. We first examine patterns of gene tree discordance across the geographic distribution of the entire clade. We then evaluate the signal of introgression in a subset of 206 species triads using Patterson&#39;s ; -statistic and test for associations between introgression signal and evolutionary, geographic, and environmental variables. We find that gene tree discordance varies across lineages and geographic regions. The signal of introgression is highest in cases where species occur in close geographic proximity and in regions with more dynamic climates since the Pleistocene. Our results highlight the potential of phylogenomic datasets for examining broad patterns of hybridization and suggest that the degree of introgression between diverging lineages might be predictable based on the setting in which they occur.},

  abstract     = {A meiotic driver is a selfish genetic element that interferes with the process of meiosis to promote its own transmission. The most common mechanism of interference is gamete killing, where the meiotic driver kills gametes that do not contain it. A killer meiotic driver is predicted to spread rapidly through a population at the expense of other genes in the rest of the genome. The rapid spread of a killer meiotic driver is expected to be chased by the rapid spread of a suppressor that returns fair meiosis. Paradoxically, while this might imply that meiotic drivers should be evolutionarily transient, numerous ancient killer meiotic drivers have been discovered that have persisted for millions of years. To understand the rationale that could potentially explain such evolutionary robustness, we explore different possible mechanisms of killer meiotic drive and the different possible associated mechanisms of suppression. We use a framework that considers how the different stages of meiosis result in different structured interactions among cells with different genotypes in various combinations. Across possible interactions, we show that there are three genotypically distinct drive mechanisms that create alternative selective conditions for the spread of different types of suppressors. We show that killer meiotic drivers are more evolutionarily robust if they operate among sister cells (after meiosis I and before meiosis II) than at any other point during meiosis. The different drive mechanisms we identify make testable predictions that could explain why some killer meiotic drivers are transient while others are ancient.},

Mating trials revealed strong sexual isolation between ; males and SC ; females, as well as more moderate bi-directional isolation between ; populations. Mating behavior data indicate SC ; males have the highest courtship efficiency and, unlike males of the other populations, are accepted by females of all species. Quantification of cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles—chemosensory signals that are used for species recognition and mate finding in ; —shows that the SC ; population differs from the other populations primarily on the basis of compound carbon chain-length. Moreover, manipulation of male CHC composition via heterospecific perfuming—specifically perfuming ; males with SC ; males—abolishes their sexual isolation from these ; females. Of a set of candidates, a single gene—elongase CG17821—had patterns of gene expression consistent with a role in CHC differences between species. Sequence comparisons indicate ; and our Nebraska (NE) ; population share a derived CG17821 truncation mutation that could also contribute to their shared “short” CHC phenotype.

  abstract     = {Whether females should prefer to mate with old males is controversial. Old males may sire offspring of low quality because of an aging germline, but their proven ability to reach an old age can also be an excellent indicator of superior genetic quality, especially in natural populations. These genetic effects are, however, hard to study in nature, because they are often confounded with direct benefits offered by old males to the female, such as experience and high territory quality. We, therefore, used naturally occurring extra-pair young to disentangle different aspects of male age on female fitness in a natural population of collared flycatchers because any difference between within- and extra-pair young within a nest should be caused by paternal genetic effects only. Based on 18 years of long-term data, we found that females paired with older males as social partners experienced an overall reproductive advantage. However, offspring sired by old males were of lower quality as compared to their extra-pair half-siblings, whereas the opposite was found in nests attended by young males. These results imply a negative genetic effect of old paternal age, given that extra-pair males are competitive middle-age males. Thus, offspring may benefit from being sired by young males but raised by old males, to maximize both genetic and direct effects. Our results show that direct and genetic benefits from pairing with old males may act in opposing directions and that the quality of the germline may deteriorate before other signs of senescence become obvious.},

  abstract     = {Selection pressures can vary within localized areas and across massive geographical scales. Temperature is one of the best studied ecologically variable abiotic factors that can affect selection pressures across multiple spatial scales. Organisms rely on physiological (thermal tolerance) and behavioral (thermal preference) mechanisms to thermoregulate in response to environmental temperature. In addition, spatial heterogeneity in temperatures can select for local adaptation in thermal tolerance, thermal preference, or both. However, the concordance between thermal tolerance and preference across genotypes and sexes within species and across populations is greatly understudied. The house fly, ; , is a well-suited system to examine how genotype and environment interact to affect thermal tolerance and preference. Across multiple continents, house fly males from higher latitudes tend to carry the male-determining gene on the Y chromosome, whereas those from lower latitudes usually have the male determiner on the third chromosome. We tested whether these two male-determining chromosomes differentially affect thermal tolerance and preference as predicted by their geographical distributions. We identify effects of genotype and developmental temperature on male thermal tolerance and preference that are concordant with the natural distributions of the chromosomes, suggesting that temperature variation across the species range contributes to the maintenance of the polymorphism. In contrast, female thermal preference is bimodal and largely independent of congener male genotypes. These sexually dimorphic thermal preferences suggest that temperature-dependent mating dynamics within populations could further affect the distribution of the two chromosomes. Together, the differences in thermal tolerance and preference across sexes and male genotypes suggest that different selection pressures may affect the frequencies of the male-determining chromosomes across different spatial scales.},

  abstract     = {Body temperature is a crucial variable in animals that affects nearly every aspect of their lives. Here we analyze for the first time largescale patterns in the evolution of body temperatures across terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods: including amphibians, mammals, birds and other reptiles). Despite the traditional view that endotherms (birds and mammals) have higher body temperatures than ectotherms, we find they are not significantly different. However, rates of body-temperature evolution are significantly different, with lower rates in endotherms than ectotherms, and the highest rates in amphibians. We find that body temperatures show strong phylogenetic signal and conservatism over 350 million years of evolutionary history in tetrapods, and some lineages appear to have retained similar body temperatures over time for hundreds of millions of years. Although body temperatures are often unrelated to climate in tetrapods, we find that body temperatures are significantly related to day-night activity patterns. Specifically, body temperatures are generally higher in diurnal species than nocturnal species, both across ectotherms and, surprisingly, across endotherms also. Overall, our results suggest that body temperatures are significantly linked to phylogeny and diel-activity patterns within and among tetrapod groups, rather than just climate and the endotherm-ectotherm divide.},

Consequently, considerable effort has been invested in developing more evolutionarily robust vaccines, either by targeting highly conserved components of the pathogen (universal vaccines) or by including multiple immunological targets within a single vaccine (multi-epitope vaccines). An unexplored third possibility is to vaccinate individuals with one of a number of qualitatively different vaccines, creating a “mosaic” of individual immunity in the population. Here we explore whether a mosaic vaccination strategy can deliver superior epidemiological outcomes to “conventional” vaccination, in which all individuals receive the same vaccine. We suppose vaccine doses can be distributed between distinct vaccine “targets” (e.g., different surface proteins against which an immune response can be generated) and/or immunologically distinct variants at these targets (e.g., strains); the pathogen can undergo antigenic evolution at both targets. Using simple mathematical models, here we provide a proof-of-concept that mosaic vaccination often outperforms conventional vaccination, leading to fewer infected individuals, improved vaccine efficacy, and lower individual risks over the course of the epidemic.},

  abstract     = {There is tantalizing evidence that phenotypic plasticity can buffer novel, adaptive genetic variants long enough to permit their evolutionary spread, and this process is often invoked in explanations for rapid adaptive evolution. However, the strength and generality of evidence for it is controversial. We identify a conceptual problem affecting this debate: recombination, segregation, and independent assortment are expected to quickly sever associations between genes controlling novel adaptations and genes contributing to trait plasticity that facilitates the novel adaptations by reducing their indirect fitness costs. To make clearer predictions about this role of plasticity in facilitating genetic adaptation, we describe a testable genetic mechanism that resolves the problem: genetic covariance between new adaptive variants and trait plasticity that facilitates their persistence within populations. We identify genetic architectures that might lead to such a covariance, including genetic coupling via physical linkage and pleiotropy, and illustrate the consequences for adaptation rates using numerical simulations. Such genetic covariances may also arise from the social environment, and we suggest the indirect genetic effects that result could further accentuate the process of adaptation. We call the latter mechanism of adaptation ; , and identify methods to test it. We suggest that genetic coupling of plasticity and adaptations could promote unusually rapid ‘runaway’ evolution of novel adaptations. The resultant dynamics could facilitate evolutionary rescue, adaptive radiations, the origin of novelties, and other commonly studied processes.},

We found that responses to salinity exposure differed among the revived cohorts, with plants from the early 20th century exhibiting greater salinity tolerance than those from the mid to late 20; century. Fluctuations in salinity tolerance could reflect stochastic variation but a congruent record of genotypic variation points to the alternative possibility that the loss and gain in functionality are driven by selection, with comparisons to historical rainfall and paleosalinity records suggesting that selective pressures vary according to shifting estuarine conditions.

We analyze the whole genomes of 23 wild rhesus macaques captured at high altitude (mean altitude &gt; 4000 m above sea level) to 22 wild rhesus macaques captured at low altitude (mean altitude &lt; 500 m above sea level) and find evidence of local adaptation in the high-altitude population at or near 303 known genes and several unannotated regions. We find the strongest signal for adaptation at EGLN1, a classic target for convergent evolution in several species living in low oxygen environments. Furthermore, many of the 303 genes are involved in processes related to hypoxia, regulation of ROS, DNA damage repair, synaptic signaling, and metabolism.

Despite considerable focus on estimating these matrices, their underlying biological mechanisms are largely speculative. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that ; and ; are structured by hormonal pleiotropy, which occurs when one hormone influences multiple phenotypes. Using juvenile brown anole lizards (; ) bred in a paternal half-sibling design, we elevated the steroid hormone testosterone with slow-release implants while administering empty implants to siblings as a control. We quantified the effects of this manipulation on the genetic architecture of a suite of sexually dimorphic traits, including body size (males are larger than females) and the area, hue, saturation, and brightness of the dewlap (a colorful ornament that is larger in males than in females). Testosterone masculinized females by increasing body size and dewlap area, hue, and saturation, while reducing dewlap brightness. Control females and males differed significantly in ; , but treatment of females with testosterone rendered ; statistically indistinguishable from males. Whereas ; was characterized by low between-sex genetic correlations when estimated between control females and males, these same correlations increased significantly when estimated between testosterone females and either control or testosterone males. The full ; matrix (including ; ) for testosterone females and either control or testosterone males was significantly less permissive of sexually dimorphic evolution than was ; estimated between control females and males, suggesting that natural sex differences in testosterone help decouple genetic variance between the sexes.

Although representing an appealing unitary explanation for the generation of domestic phenotypes, support for this hypothesis from morphological data and for the validity of the DS remains a topic of debate. This study used the frameworks of morphological integration and modularity to assess patterns that concern the embryonic origin of the skull and issues around the neural crest hypothesis. Geometric morphometric landmarks were used to quantify cranial trait interactions between six pairs of wild and domestic mammals, comprising representatives that express between five and 17 of the traits included in the DS, and examples from each of the pathways by which animals entered into relationships with humans. We predicted the presence of neural crest vs mesoderm modular structure to the cranium, and that elements in the neural crest module would show lower magnitudes of integration and higher disparity in domestic forms compared to wild forms. Our findings support modular structuring based on tissue origin (neural crest, mesoderm) modules, along with low module integration magnitudes for neural crest cell derived cranial elements, suggesting differential capacity for evolutionary response among those elements. Covariation between the neural crest and mesoderm modules accounted for major components of shape variation for most domestic/wild pairs. Contra to our predictions, however, we find domesticates share similar integration magnitudes to their wild progenitors, indicating that higher disparity in domesticates is not associated with magnitude changes to integration among either neural crest or mesoderm derived elements. Differences in integration magnitude among neural crest and mesoderm elements across species suggest that developmental evolution preserves a framework that promotes flexibility under the selection regimes of domestication.},

When mating takes place locally, in structured populations, a female-biased sex ratio is favored to reduce competition between related males, and to provide more mates for males. However, there are a number of wasp species in which the sex ratios appear to more female biased than predicted by Hamilton&#39;s theory. It has been hypothesized that the additional female bias in these wasp species results from cooperative interactions between females. We investigated theoretically the extent to which cooperation between related females can interact with local mate competition to favor even more female-biased sex ratios. We found that (i) cooperation between females can lead to sex ratios that are more female biased than predicted by local competition theory alone, and (ii) sex ratios can be more female biased when the cooperation occurs from offspring to mothers before dispersal, rather than cooperation between siblings after dispersal. Our models formally confirm the verbal predictions made in previous experimental studies, which could be applied to a range of organisms. Specifically, cooperation can help explain sex ratio biases in ; and ; wasps, although quantitative comparisons between predictions and data suggest that some additional factors may be operating.},

Here, we study the effect of thousands of gene knockout mutations on 202 mouse phenotypes to explore how regulatory variation affects SD. We show that many traits are dimorphic to some extent, and that a surprising proportion of knockouts have sex-specific phenotypic effects. Many traits, regardless whether they are monomorphic or dimorphic, harbor cryptic differences in genetic architecture between the sexes, resulting in sexually discordant phenotypic effects from sexually concordant regulatory changes.

  abstract     = {Despite the far-reaching evolutionary implications of sexual conflict, the effects of metapopulation structure, when populations are subdivided into several demes connected to some degree by migration, on sexual conflict dynamics are unknown. Here, we used experimental evolution in an insect model system, the seed beetle ; , to assess the independent and interacting effects of selection histories associated with mating system (monogamy vs. polygamy) and population subdivision on sexual conflict evolution. We confirm traditional predictions from sexual conflict theory by revealing increased resistance to male harm in females from populations with a history of intense sexual selection (polygamous populations) compared to females from populations with a history of relaxed sexual selection (monogamous populations). However, selection arising from metapopulation structure reversed the classic pattern of sexually antagonistic coevolution and led to reduced resistance in females from polygamous populations. These results underscore that population spatial structure moderates sexual selection and sexual conflict, and more broadly, that the evolution of sexual conflict is contingent on ecological context. The findings also have implications for population dynamics, conservation biology, and biological control.},

  abstract     = {Theory predicts that the ability of selection and recombination to purge mutation load is enhanced if selection against deleterious genetic variants operates more strongly in males than females. However, direct empirical support for this tenet is limited, in part because traditional quantitative genetic approaches allow dominance and intermediate-frequency polymorphisms to obscure the effects of the many rare and partially recessive deleterious alleles that make up the main part of a population&#39;s mutation load. Here, we exposed the partially recessive genetic load of a population of ; seed beetles via successive generations of inbreeding, and quantified its effects by measuring heterosis—the increase in fitness experienced when masking the effects of deleterious alleles by heterozygosity—in a fully factorial sex-specific diallel cross among 16 inbred strains. Competitive lifetime reproductive success (i.e., fitness) was measured in male and female outcrossed F; s as well as inbred parental “selfs,” and we estimated the 4 × 4 male-female inbred-outbred genetic covariance matrix for fitness using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of a custom-made general linear mixed effects model. We found that heterosis estimated independently in males and females was highly genetically correlated among strains, and that heterosis was strongly negatively genetically correlated to outbred male, but not female, fitness. This suggests that genetic variation for fitness in males, but not in females, reflects the amount of (partially) recessive deleterious alleles segregating at mutation-selection balance in this population. The population&#39;s mutation load therefore has greater potential to be purged via selection in males. These findings contribute to our understanding of the prevalence of sexual reproduction in nature and the maintenance of genetic variation in fitness-related traits.},

Such estimates require the experimental separation of the act of mating from that of ejaculation, which is a nontrivial logistical challenge. Here, we overcome this challenge using a novel morphological manipulation (gonopodium tip ablation) in the eastern mosquitofish (; ) to tease apart investment in mating effort from that in sperm replenishment following ejaculation. We quantified the relative cumulative costs of investing in mating effort and ejaculation by comparing somatic traits and reproductive performance among three types of males: ablated males that could attempt to mate but not ejaculate; unablated males that could both mate ; ejaculate; and control males that had no access to females. We show that, after eight weeks, mating investment significantly reduces both body growth and immunocompetence and results in a significant decline in mating effort. In contrast, cumulative investment into sperm replenishment following ejaculation has few detectable effects that are only apparent in smaller males. These minor costs occur despite the fact that ; has very high levels of sperm competition and multiple mating by both sexes, which is usually associated with elevated levels of sperm production. Crucially, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to experimentally compare the relative costs of pre- and postcopulatory investment on components of male fitness in a vertebrate.},

At all scales, we showed that the ratio of nucleus size to cell size (the ‘N: C’ ratio) decreased systematically in larger cells. Size evolution appears more constrained in nuclei than cells: cell size spans across six orders of magnitude, whereas nucleus size varies by only three.

  abstract     = {The evolutionary pressures that determine the location (chromosomal or plasmid-borne) of bacterial genes are not fully understood. We investigate these pressures through mathematical modeling in the context of antibiotic resistance, which is often found on plasmids. Our central finding is that gene location is under positive frequency-dependent selection: the higher the frequency of one form of resistance compared to the other, the higher its relative fitness. This can keep moderately beneficial genes on plasmids, despite occasional plasmid loss. For these genes, positive frequency dependence leads to a priority effect: whichever form is acquired first—through either mutation or horizontal gene transfer—has time to increase in frequency and thus becomes difficult to displace. Higher rates of horizontal transfer of plasmid-borne than chromosomal genes therefore predict moderately beneficial genes will be found on plasmids. Gene flow between plasmid and chromosome allows chromosomal forms to arise, but positive frequency-dependent selection prevents these from establishing. Further modeling shows that this effect is particularly pronounced when genes are shared across a large number of species, suggesting that antibiotic resistance genes are often found on plasmids because they are moderately beneficial across many species. We also revisit previous theoretical work—relating to the role of local adaptation in explaining gene location and to plasmid persistence—in light of our findings.},

Several models of pollinator-mediated floral evolution have been proposed; floral divergence may (i) be directly involved in driving speciation or may occur after speciation driven by (ii) drift or local adaptation in allopatry or (iii) negative interactions between species in sympatry. Here, we generate predictions for patterns of trait divergence and community assembly expected under these three models, and test these predictions in ; (Proteaceae), a diverse genus in the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. We quantified functional richness for two key floral traits (pistil length and flower color), as well as phylogenetic distances between species, across ecological communities, and compared these to patterns generated from null models of community assembly. We also estimated the statistical relationship between rates of trait evolution and lineage diversification across the phylogeny. Patterns of community assembly suggest that flower color, but not floral phenology or morphology, or phylogenetic relatedness, is more divergent in communities than expected. Rates of lineage diversification and flower color evolution were negatively correlated across the phylogeny and rates of flower colour evolution were positively related to branching times. These results support a role for diversity-dependent species interactions driving floral divergence during the Hakea radiation, contributing to the development of the extraordinary species richness of southwest Australia.},

However, substantial genetic and phenotypic variation in emergence timing is harbored within and among plant populations, making it important to characterize the selective agents—including biotic interactions—that contribute to this variation. In seasonal herbaceous communities, we hypothesized that consumption of early-emerging individuals by vertebrates could weaken the strength of directional selection for earlier emergence in competitive environments. To investigate this, we carried out phenotypic selection analyses on emergence timing in two California grass species, the native ; and non-native ; , growing in intraspecific competitive neighborhoods with and without vertebrate herbivore exclusion. Vertebrate herbivores consistently weakened directional selection for earlier emergence. Our results demonstrate that vertebrate herbivores play an underappreciated selective role on phenology in plant populations, with implications for contemporary evolution, such as the potential of species to adapt to global environmental changes.},

However, despite many decades of inquiry, the advantages and costs of vertebral column regionalization in anatomically distinct blocks, their functional specialization, and how they channel new evolutionary outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we investigate morphological integration (and how this integration is structured [modularity]) between all the presacral vertebrae of mammalian carnivorans to provide a better understanding of how regionalization in metameric structures evolves. Our results demonstrate that the subunits of the presacral column are highly integrated. However, underlying to this general pattern, three sets of vertebrae are recognized as presacral modules—the cervical module, the anterodorsal module, and the posterodorsal module—as well as one weakly integrated vertebra (diaphragmatic) that forms a transition between both dorsal modules. We hypothesize that the strength of integration organizing the axial system into modules may be associated with motion capability. The highly integrated anterior dorsal module coincides with a region with motion constraints to avoid compromising ventilation, whereas for the posterior dorsal region motion constraints avoid exceeding extension of the posterior back. On the other hand, the weakly integrated diaphragmatic vertebra belongs to the “Diaphragmatic joint complex”—a key region of the mammalian column of exceedingly permissive motion. Our results also demonstrate that these modules do not match with the traditional morphological regions, and we propose natural selection as the main factor shaping this pattern to stabilize some regions and to allow coordinate movements in others.},

  abstract     = {Actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes) are the most diversified group of vertebrates and are characterized by a variety of protective structures covering their integument, the evolution of which has intrigued biologists for decades. Paleontological records showed that the first mineralized vertebrate skeleton was composed of dermal bony plates covering the body, including odontogenic and skeletogenic components. Later in evolution, the exoskeleton of actinopterygian&#39;s trunk was composed of scale structures. Although scales are nowadays a widespread integument cover, some contemporary lineages do not have scales but bony plates covering their trunk, whereas other lineages are devoid of any such structures. To understand the evolution of the integument coverage and particularly the transition between different structures, we investigated the pattern of scale loss events along with actinopterygian evolution and addressed the functional relationship between the scaleless phenotype and the ecology of fishes. Furthermore, we examined whether the emergence of trunk bony plates was dependent over the presence or absence of scales. To this aim, we used two recently published actinopterygian phylogenies, one including &gt;11,600 species, and by using stochastic mapping and Bayesian methods, we inferred scale loss events and trunk bony plate acquisitions. Our results reveal that a scaled integument is the most frequent state in actinopterygians, but multiple independent scale loss events occurred along their phylogeny with essentially no scale re-acquisition. Based on linear mixed models, we found evidence supporting that after a scale loss event, fishes tend to change their ecology and adopt a benthic lifestyle. Furthermore, we show that trunk bony plates appeared independently multiple times along the phylogeny. By using fitted likelihood models for character evolution, we show that trunk bony plate acquisitions were dependent on a previous scale loss event. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that integument cover is a key evolutionary trait underlying actinopterygian radiation.},

In theory, this enables male-harming mutations to accumulate in mitochondrial genomes as long as they are neutral, beneficial, or only slightly deleterious to females. Ultimately, this bias could drive the evolution of male-specific mitochondrial mutation loads, an idea known as mother&#39;s curse. Earlier work on this hypothesis has mainly used small ; panels, in which naturally sourced mitochondrial genomes were coupled to an isogenic nuclear background. The lack of nuclear genetic variation in these designs has precluded robust generalization. Here, we test the predictions of mother&#39;s curse using a large ; mitonuclear genetic panel, comprising nine isogenic nuclear genomes coupled to nine mitochondrial haplotypes, giving a total of 81 different mitonuclear genotypes. Following a predictive framework, we tested the mother&#39;s curse hypothesis by screening our panel for wing size. This trait is tightly correlated with overall body size and is sexually dimorphic in ; . Moreover, growth is heavily reliant on metabolism and mitochondrial function, making wing size an ideal trait for the study of the impact of mitochondrial variation. We detect high levels of mitonuclear epistasis, and more importantly, we report that mitochondrial genetic variance is larger in male than female ; for eight out of the nine nuclear genetic backgrounds used.

Divergence by sexual selection is implicated in faster rates of divergence of the X chromosome and of genes thought to underlie sexually selected traits, including genes that are sex biased in expression. However, accurately inferring the relative importance of complex and interacting forms of natural selection, demography, and neutral processes that occurred in the evolutionary past is challenging. Experimental evolution provides an opportunity to apply controlled treatments for multiple generations and examine the consequent genomic divergence. Here, we altered sexual selection intensity, elevating sexual selection in polyandrous lines and eliminating it in monogamous lines, and examined patterns of allele frequency divergence in the genome of ; after more than 160 generations of experimental evolution. Divergence is not uniform across the genome but concentrated in “islands,” many of which contain candidate genes implicated in mating behaviors and other sexually selected phenotypes. These are more often seen on the X chromosome, which also shows greater divergence in ; than neutral expectations. There are characteristic signatures of selection seen in these regions, with lower diversity on the X chromosome than the autosomes, and differences in diversity on the autosomes between selection regimes. Reduced Tajima&#39;s ; within some of the divergent regions may imply that selective sweeps have occurred, despite considerable recombination. These changes are associated with both differential gene expression between the lines and sex-biased gene expression within the lines. Our results are very similar to those thought to implicate sexual selection in divergence between species and natural populations, and hence provide experimental support for the likely role of sexual selection in driving such types of genetic divergence, but also illustrate how variable outcomes can be for different genomic regions.},

However, to fully understand their importance for local adaptation we need to know their influence on phenotypes under divergent selection. For this, the marine snail ; provides an ideal study system. Divergent ecotypes adapted to wave action and crab predation occur in close proximity on intertidal shores with gene flow between them. Here, we used F2 individuals obtained from crosses between the ecotypes to test for associations between genomic regions and traits distinguishing the Crab-/Wave-adapted ecotypes including size, shape, shell thickness, and behavior. We show that most of these traits are influenced by two previously detected inversion regions that are divergent between ecotypes. We thus gain a better understanding of one important underlying mechanism responsible for the rapid and repeated formation of ecotypes: divergent selection acting on inversions. We also found that some inversions contributed to more than one trait suggesting that they may contain several loci involved in adaptation, consistent with the hypothesis that suppression of recombination within inversions facilitates differentiation in the presence of gene flow.},

  abstract     = {Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are pervasive in diploid genomes and expose the effects of deleterious recessive mutations, but how exactly these regions contribute to variation in fitness remains unclear. Here, we combined empirical analyses and simulations to explore the deleterious effects of ROH with varying genetic map lengths in wild Soay sheep. Using a long-term dataset of 4879 individuals genotyped at 417K SNPs, we found that inbreeding depression increases with ROH length. A 1\% genomic increase in long ROH (&gt;12.5 cM) reduced the odds of first-year survival by 12.4\% compared to only 7.7\% for medium ROH (1.56–12.5 cM), whereas short ROH (&lt;1.56 cM) had no effect on survival. We show by forward genetic simulations that this is predicted: compared to shorter ROH, long ROH will have higher densities of deleterious alleles, with larger average effects on fitness and lower population frequencies. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that the mutation load decreases in older haplotypes underlying shorter ROH, where purifying selection has had more time to purge deleterious mutations. Finally, our study demonstrates that strong inbreeding depression can persist despite ongoing purging in a historically small population.},

  abstract     = {Queens of eusocial species live extraordinarily long compared to their workers. So far, it has been argued that these lifespan divergences are readily explained by the classical evolutionary theory of ageing. As workers predominantly perform risky tasks, such as foraging and nest defense, and queens stay in the well-protected nests, selection against harmful genetic mutations expressed in old age should be weaker in workers than in queens due to caste differences in extrinsic mortality risk, and thus, lead to the evolution of longer queen and shorter worker lifespans. However, these arguments have not been supported by formal models. Here, we present a model for the evolution of caste-specific ageing in social insects, based on Williams’ antagonistic pleiotropy theory of ageing. In individual-based simulations, we assume that mutations with antagonistic fitness effects can act within castes, that is, mutations in early life are accompanied by an antagonistic effect acting in later life, or between castes, where antagonistic effects emerge due to caste antagonism or indirect genetic effects between castes. In monogynous social insect species with sterile workers, large lifespan divergences between castes evolved under all different scenarios of antagonistic effects, but regardless of the degree of caste-specific extrinsic mortality. Mutations with antagonistic fitness effects within castes reduced lifespans of both castes, while mutations with between-caste antagonistic effects decreased worker lifespans more than queen lifespans, and consequently increased lifespan divergences. Our results challenge the central explanatory role of extrinsic mortality for caste-specific ageing in eusocial organisms and suggest that antagonistic pleiotropy affects castes differently due to reproductive monopolization by queens, hence, reproductive division of labor. Finally, these findings provide new insights into the evolution of tissue-specific ageing in multicellular organisms in general.},

  abstract     = {The maintenance of sex is paradoxical as sexual species pay the “twofold cost of males” and should thus quickly be replaced by asexual mutants reproducing clonally. However, asexuals may not be strictly clonal and engage in “cryptic sex,” challenging this simple scenario. We study the cryptic sex life of the brine shrimp ; , which has once been termed an “ancient asexual” and where no genetic differences have ever been observed between parents and offspring. This asexual species rarely produces males, which can hybridize with sexual females of closely related species and transmit asexuality to their offspring. Using such hybrids, we show that recombination occurs in asexual lineages, causing loss-of-heterozygosity and parent-offspring differences. These differences cannot generally be observed in field-sampled asexuals because once heterozygosity is lost, subsequent recombination leaves no footprint. Furthermore, using extensive paternity tests, we show that hybrid females can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and transmit asexuality to both sexually and asexually produced offspring in a dominant fashion. Finally, we show that, contrary to previous reports, field-sampled asexual females also rarely reproduce sexually (rate ∼2‰). Overall, most previously known facts about ; asexuality turned out to be erroneous. More generally, our findings suggest that the evidence for strictly clonal reproduction of asexual species needs to be reconsidered, and that rare sex and consequences of nonclonal asexuality, such as gene flow within asexuals, need to be more widely taken into account in more realistic models for the maintenance of sex and the persistence of asexual lineages.},

For sexual populations, fertilization is the key stage that links one generation to the next, yet the effects of fertilization environment on the adaptive potential at the vulnerable stages that then unfold during development are rarely considered, despite climatic stress posing risks for gamete function and fertility in many taxa and external fertilizers especially. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model exploring the effects of environmental stress at fertilization and development on the adaptive potential in early life. We then test our model with a quantitative genetic breeding design exposing family groups of a marine external fertilizer, the tubeworm ; , to a factorial manipulation of current and projected temperatures at fertilization and development. We find that adaptive potential in early life is substantially reduced, to the point of being no longer detectable, by genotype-specific carryover effects of fertilization under projected warming. We interpret these results in light of our fitness landscape model, and argue that the thermal environment at fertilization deserves more attention than it currently receives when forecasting the adaptive potential of populations confronting climate change.},

In cooperatively breeding species, where offspring care is shared between breeders and helpers, the alloparental care provided by helpers is predicted to mitigate the impact of parental senescence on offspring provisioning and, subsequently, offspring survival. We test this prediction using data from a long-term study on cooperatively breeding Seychelles warblers (; ). We find that the nestling provisioning rate of female breeders declines with their age. Further, the total brood provisioning rate and the first-year survival probability of offspring decline progressively with age of the female breeder, but these declines are mitigated when helpers are present. This effect does not arise because individual helpers provide more care in response to the lower provisioning of older dominant females, but because older female breeders have recruited more helpers, thereby receiving more overall care for their brood. We do not find such effects for male breeders. These results indicate that alloparental care can alleviate the fitness costs of senescence for breeders, which suggests an interplay between age and cooperative breeding.},

Here, we sampled 11 populations of scarlet monkeyflower (; ), collecting seeds across the plants’ northern, central, and southern range to track trait evolution from the lowest to the greatest moisture anomaly over a 7-year period. We grew families generated from these populations across well-watered and terminal drought treatments in a greenhouse and quantified five traits associated with dehydration escape and avoidance. When considering pre-drought to peak-drought phenotypes, we find that later date of flowering evolved across the range of ; , suggesting a shift away from dehydration escape. Instead, traits consistent with dehydration avoidance evolved, with smaller and/or thicker leaves evolving in central and southern regions. The southern region also saw a loss of plasticity in these leaf traits by the peak of the drought, whereas flowering time remained plastic across all regions. This observed shift in traits from escape to avoidance occurred only in certain regions, revealing the importance of geographic context when examining adaptations to climate change.},

We did this by tracking fluorescent sperm—using transgenics—through the transparent body of sperm recipients, enabling to observe postcopulatory processes ; . Moreover, we sequentially exposed focal worms to three independent mating groups, and in each assessed their mating success, sperm-transfer efficiency, sperm fertilizing efficiency, and partner fecundity. Based on these multiple measures, we could, for each fitness component, combine the variance (; ) with the repeatability (; ) in individual success to assess the amount of repeatable variance in individual success—a measure we call the repeatable opportunity for selection (; ). We found higher repeatable opportunity for selection in sperm-transfer efficiency and sperm fertilizing efficiency compared to mating success, which clearly suggests that postcopulatory selection is stronger than precopulatory selection.

We tested the extent of genomic isolation between two recurrently hybridizing nonbiting midge sister taxa, ; and ; , by analyzing the divergence landscape. Using a principal component-based method, we estimated that only about 28.44\% of the genomes were mutually isolated, whereas the rest was still exchanged. The divergence landscape was fragmented into isolated regions of on average 30 kb, distributed throughout the genome. Selection and divergence time strongly influenced lengths of isolated regions, whereas local recombination rate only had minor impact. Comparison of divergence time distributions obtained from several coalescence-simulated divergence scenarios with the observed divergence time estimates in an approximate Bayesian computation framework favored a short and concluded divergence event in the past. Most divergence happened during a short time span about 4.5 million generations ago, followed by a stable equilibrium between mutual gene flow through ongoing hybridization for the larger part of the genome and isolation in some regions due to rapid purifying selection of introgression, supported by high effective population sizes and recombination rates.},

Two extensions of this effect are (1) the expectation that asymmetric hybridization or gene flow will have asymmetric effects on reproductive barrier strength and (2) the expectation that local hybridization will affect only local reproductive barrier strength and could therefore alter within-species compatibility. We tested these hypotheses in a pair of morning glory species that exhibit asymmetric gene flow from highly selfing ; into mixed-mating ; in regions where they co-occur. Because of the direction of this gene flow, we predicted that reproductive barrier strength would be more strongly affected in ; than ; . We also predicted that changes to reproductive barriers in sympatric ; populations would affect compatibility with allopatric populations of that species. We tested these predictions by measuring the strength of a reproductive barrier to seed set across the species’ ranges. Consistent with our first prediction, we found that sympatric and allopatric ; produce the same number of seeds in crosses with ; , whereas crosses between sympatric ; and ; are more successful than crosses between allopatric ; and ; . This difference in compatibility appears to reflect an asymmetric decrease in the strength of the barrier to seed set in sympatric ; , which could be caused by ; alleles that have introgressed into ; . We further demonstrated that changes to sympatric ; have decreased its ability to produce seeds with allopatric populations of the same species, in line with our second prediction. Thus, in a manner analogous to cascade reinforcement, we suggest that introgression associated with hybridization not only influences between-species isolation but can also contribute to isolation within a species.},

However, the theoretical basis for this concentration of particular types of mutations at particular loci remains largely unexplored. In addition, historical contingency is known to play a major role in evolutionary trajectories, but has not been reconciled with the existence of such hotspots. For example, do the appearance of hotspots and the fixation of different types of mutations at those loci depend on the starting state and/or on the nature and direction of selection? Here, we use a computational approach to examine these questions, focusing the anthocyanin pigmentation pathway, which has been extensively studied in the context of flower color transitions. We investigate two transitions that are common in nature, the transition from blue to purple pigmentation and from purple to red pigmentation. Both sets of simulated transitions occur with a small number of mutations at just four loci and show strikingly similar peaked shapes of evolutionary trajectories, with the mutations of the largest effect occurring early but not first. Nevertheless, the types of mutations (biochemical vs. regulatory) as well as their direction and magnitude are contingent on the particular transition. These simulated color transitions largely mirror findings from natural flower color transitions, which are known to occur via repeated changes at a few hotspot loci. Still, some types of mutations observed in our simulated color evolution are rarely observed in nature, suggesting that pleiotropic effects further limit the trajectories between color phenotypes. Overall, our results indicate that the branching structure of the pathway leads to a predictable concentration of evolutionary change at the hotspot loci, but the types of mutations at these loci and their order is contingent on the evolutionary context.},

  abstract     = {Ongoing adaptive evolution, and resulting “evolutionary rescue” of declining populations, requires additive genetic variation in fitness. Such variation can be increased by gene flow resulting from immigration, potentially facilitating evolution. But, gene flow could in fact constrain rather than facilitate local adaptive evolution if immigrants have low additive genetic values for local fitness. Local migration-selection balance and micro-evolutionary stasis could then result. However, key quantitative genetic effects of natural immigration, comprising the degrees to which gene flow increases the total local additive genetic variance yet counteracts local adaptive evolutionary change, have not been explicitly quantified in wild populations. Key implications of gene flow for population and evolutionary dynamics consequently remain unclear. Our quantitative genetic analyses of long-term data from free-living song sparrows (; ) show that mean breeding value for local juvenile survival to adulthood, a major component of fitness, increased across cohorts more than expected solely due to drift. Such micro-evolutionary change should be expected given nonzero additive genetic variance and consistent directional selection. However, this evolutionary increase was counteracted by negative additive genetic effects of recent immigrants, which increased total additive genetic variance but prevented a net directional evolutionary increase in total additive genetic value. These analyses imply an approximate quantitative genetic migration-selection balance in a major fitness component, and hence demonstrate a key mechanism by which substantial additive genetic variation can be maintained yet decoupled from local adaptive evolutionary change.},

  abstract     = {Human-driven habitat fragmentation and loss have led to a proliferation of small and isolated plant and animal populations with high risk of extinction. One of the main threats to extinction in these populations is inbreeding depression, which is primarily caused by recessive deleterious mutations becoming homozygous due to inbreeding. The typical approach for managing these populations is to maintain high genetic diversity, increasingly by translocating individuals from large populations to initiate a “genetic rescue.” However, the limitations of this approach have recently been highlighted by the demise of the gray wolf population on Isle Royale, which declined to the brink of extinction soon after the arrival of a migrant from the large mainland wolf population. Here, we use a novel population genetic simulation framework to investigate the role of genetic diversity, deleterious variation, and demographic history in mediating extinction risk due to inbreeding depression in small populations. We show that, under realistic models of dominance, large populations harbor high levels of recessive strongly deleterious variation due to these mutations being hidden from selection in the heterozygous state. As a result, when large populations contract, they experience a substantially elevated risk of extinction after these strongly deleterious mutations are exposed by inbreeding. Moreover, we demonstrate that, although genetic rescue is broadly effective as a means to reduce extinction risk, its effectiveness can be greatly increased by drawing migrants from small or moderate-sized source populations rather than large source populations due to smaller populations harboring lower levels of recessive strongly deleterious variation. Our findings challenge the traditional conservation paradigm that focuses on maximizing genetic diversity in small populations in favor of a view that emphasizes minimizing strongly deleterious variation. These insights have important implications for managing small and isolated populations in the increasingly fragmented landscape of the Anthropocene.},

(2021). Does genetic diversity protect host populations from
parasites? A meta-analysis across natural and agricultural systems.

  abstract     = {If parasites transmit more readily between closely related hosts, then parasite burdens should decrease with increased genetic diversity of host populations. This important hypothesis is often accepted at face value—notorious epidemics of crop monocultures testify to the vulnerability of host populations that have been purged of diversity. Yet the relationship between genetic diversity and parasitism likely varies across contexts, differing between crop and noncrop hosts and between experimental and natural host populations. Here, we used a meta-analytic approach to ask if host diversity confers protection against parasites over the range of contexts in which it has been tested. We synthesized the results of 102 studies, comprising 2004 effect sizes representing a diversity of approaches and host-parasite systems. Our results validate a protective effect of genetic diversity, while revealing significant variation in its strength across biological and empirical contexts. In experimental host populations, genetic diversity reduces parasitism by ∼20\% for noncrop hosts and by ∼50\% for crop hosts. In contrast, observational studies of natural host populations show no consistent relationship between genetic diversity and parasitism, with both strong negative and positive correlations reported. This result supports the idea that, if parasites preferentially attack close relatives, the correlation of genetic diversity with parasitism could be positive or negative depending upon the potential for host populations to evolve in response to parasite selection. Taken together, these results reinforce genetic diversity as a priority for both conservation and agriculture and emphasize the challenges inherent to drawing comparisons between controlled experimental populations and dynamic natural populations.},

  abstract     = {Spatially varying selection promotes variance in allele frequencies, increasing genetic differentiation between the demes of a metapopulation. For that reason, outliers in the genome-wide distribution of summary statistics measuring genetic differentiation, such as ; , are often interpreted as evidence for alleles that contribute to local adaptation. However, theoretical studies have shown that in spatially structured populations the spread of beneficial mutations with spatially uniform fitness effects can also induce transient genetic differentiation. In recent years, numerous empirical studies have suggested that such species-wide, or global, adaptation makes a substantial contribution to molecular evolution. In this perspective, we discuss how commonly such global adaptation may influence the genome-wide distribution of ; and generate genetic differentiation patterns, which could be mistaken for local adaptation. To illustrate this, we use forward-in-time population genetic simulations assuming parameters for the rate and strength of beneficial mutations consistent with estimates from natural populations. We demonstrate that the spread of globally beneficial mutations in parapatric populations may frequently generate ; outliers, which could be misinterpreted as evidence for local adaptation. The spread of beneficial mutations causes selective sweeps at flanking sites, so in some cases, the effects of global versus local adaptation may be distinguished by examining patterns of nucleotide diversity within and between populations in addition to ; . However, when local adaptation has been only recently established, it may be much more difficult to distinguish from global adaptation, due to less accumulation of linkage disequilibrium at flanking sites. Through our discussion, we conclude that a large fraction of ; outliers that are presumed to arise from local adaptation may instead be due to global adaptation.},
