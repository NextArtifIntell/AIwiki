  abstract     = {The spatial information of sound plays a crucial role in various situations, ranging from daily activities to advanced engineering technologies. To fully utilize its potential, numerous research studies on spatial audio signal processing have been carried out in the literature. Sound field estimation is one of the key foundational technologies that can be applied to a wide range of acoustic signal processing techniques, including sound field reproduction using loudspeakers and binaural playback through headphones. The purpose of this monograph is to present an overview of sound field estimation methods. After providing the necessary mathematical background, two different approaches to sound field estimation will be explained. This monograph focuses on clarifying the essential theories of each approach, while also referencing state-of-the-art developments. Finally, several acoustic signal processing technologies will be discussed as examples of the application of sound field estimation.},
