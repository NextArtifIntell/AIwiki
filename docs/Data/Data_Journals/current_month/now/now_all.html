  abstract     = {A fundamental question in theoretical machine learning is generalization. Over the past decades, the PAC-Bayesian approach has been established as a flexible framework to address the generalization capabilities of machine learning algorithms and design new ones. Recently, it has garnered increased interest due to its potential applicability for a variety of learning algorithms, including deep neural networks. In parallel, an information-theoretic view of generalization has developed, wherein the relation between generalization and various information measures has been established. This framework is intimately connected to the PAC-Bayesian approach, and a number of results have been independently discovered in both strands. In this monograph, we highlight this strong connection and present a unified treatment of PAC-Bayesian and information- theoretic generalization bounds. We present techniques and results that the two perspectives have in common, and discuss the approaches and interpretations that differ. In particular, we demonstrate how many proofs in the area share a modular structure, through which the underlying ideas can be intuited. We pay special attention to the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework, analytical studies of the information complexity of learning algorithms, and the application of the proposed methods to deep learning. This monograph is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to information-theoretic generalization bounds and their connection to PAC-Bayes, serving as a foundation from which the most recent developments are accessible. It is aimed broadly towards researchers with an interest in generalization and theoretical machine learning.},

  abstract     = {We provide a comprehensive survey of Integer Programming Games (IPGs), focusing on both simultaneous games and bilevel programs. These games are characterized by integral constraints within the players’ strategy sets. We start from the fundamental definitions of these games and various solution concepts associated with them, and derive the properties of the games and the solution concepts. For each of the two types of games – simultaneous and bilevel – we have one section dedicated to the analysis of the games and another section dedicated to the development and analyses of algorithms to solve them. The analyses sections present results on the computational complexity of the general game as well as various other restricted versions. These sections also discuss the structural properties of the games and the equilibrium concepts associated with them. The algorithm sections, in contrast, present some of the state-of-the-art algorithms developed to solve these games, either exactly, approximately or fast under fixed-parameter assumptions. These sections also contain proofs of the correctness of these algorithms and an assessment of their theoretical run times in the worst-case scenario.},

  abstract     = {The spatial information of sound plays a crucial role in various situations, ranging from daily activities to advanced engineering technologies. To fully utilize its potential, numerous research studies on spatial audio signal processing have been carried out in the literature. Sound field estimation is one of the key foundational technologies that can be applied to a wide range of acoustic signal processing techniques, including sound field reproduction using loudspeakers and binaural playback through headphones. The purpose of this monograph is to present an overview of sound field estimation methods. After providing the necessary mathematical background, two different approaches to sound field estimation will be explained. This monograph focuses on clarifying the essential theories of each approach, while also referencing state-of-the-art developments. Finally, several acoustic signal processing technologies will be discussed as examples of the application of sound field estimation.},
