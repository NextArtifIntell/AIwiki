  abstract     = {Abstract. Mesh quality is crucial in the simulation of surface evolution equations using parametric finite element methods (FEMs). Energy-diminishing schemes may fail even when the surface remains smooth due to poor mesh distribution. In this paper, we aim to develop mesh-preserving and energy-stable parametric finite element schemes for the mean curvature flow and surface diffusion of two-dimensional surfaces. These new schemes are based on a reformulation of general surface evolution equations, achieved by coupling the original equation with a modified harmonic map heat flow. We demonstrate that our Euler schemes are energy-diminishing, and the proposed BDF2 schemes are energy-stable under a mild assumption on the mesh distortion. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed schemes perform exceptionally well in maintaining mesh quality.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The multiscale hybrid-mixed (MHM) method for the Stokes operator was formally introduced in [R. Araya et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 324, pp. 29–53, 2017] and numerically validated. The method has face degrees of freedom associated with multiscale basis functions computed from local Neumann problems driven by discontinuous polynomial spaces on skeletal meshes. The two-level MHM version approximates the multiscale basis using a stabilized finite element method. This work proposes the first numerical analysis for the one- and two-level MHM method applied to the Stokes/Brinkman equations within a new abstract framework relating MHM methods to discrete primal hybrid formulations. As a result, we generalize the two-level MHM method to include general second-level solvers and continuous polynomial interpolation on faces and establish abstract conditions to have those methods well-posed and optimally convergent on natural norms. We apply the abstract setting to analyze the MHM methods using stabilized and stable finite element methods as second-level solvers with (dis)continuous interpolation on faces. Also, we find that the discrete velocity and pressure variables preserve the balance of forces and conservation of mass at the element level. Numerical benchmarks assess theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, the irrational-window-filter projection method (IWFPM), for quasiperiodic systems with concentrated spectral point distribution. Based on the projection method (PM), IWFPM filters out dominant spectral points by defining an irrational window and uses a corresponding index-shift transform to make the FFT available. The error analysis on the function approximation level is also given. We apply IWFPM to one-dimensional, two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) quasiperiodic Schrödinger eigenproblems (QSEs) to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. IWFPM exhibits a significant computational advantage over PM for both extended and localized quantum states. More importantly, by using IWFPM, the existence of Anderson localization in 2D and 3D QSEs is numerically verified.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Efficient simulation of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on general domains requires noise discretization. This paper employs piecewise linear interpolation of noise in a fully discrete finite element approximation of a semilinear stochastic reaction-advection-diffusion equation on a convex polyhedral domain. The Gaussian noise is white in time, spatially correlated, and modeled as a standard cylindrical Wiener process on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This paper provides the first rigorous analysis of the resulting noise discretization error for a general spatial covariance kernel. The kernel is assumed to be defined on a larger regular domain, allowing for sampling by the circulant embedding method. The error bound under mild kernel assumptions requires nontrivial techniques like Hilbert–Schmidt bounds on products of finite element interpolants, entropy numbers of fractional Sobolev space embeddings, and an error bound for interpolants in fractional Sobolev norms. Examples with kernels encountered in applications are illustrated in numerical simulations using the FEniCS finite element software. Key findings include the following: noise interpolation does not introduce additional errors for Matérn kernels in ; there exist kernels that yield dominant interpolation errors; and generating noise on a coarser mesh does not always compromise accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Crystalline materials exhibit long-range elastic fields due to the presence of defects, leading to significant domain size effects in atomistic simulations. A rigorous far-field expansion of these long-range fields identifies low-rank structure in the form of a sum of discrete multipole terms and continuum predictors [J. Braun, T. Hudson, and C. Ortner, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 245 (2022), pp. 1437–1490]. We propose a novel numerical scheme that exploits this low-rank structure to accelerate material defect simulations by minimizing the domain size effects. Our approach iteratively improves the boundary condition, systematically following the asymptotic expansion of the far field. We provide both rigorous error estimates for the method and a range of empirical numerical tests to assess its convergence and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Gaussian process regression is a classical kernel method for function estimation and data interpolation. In large data applications, computational costs can be reduced using low-rank or sparse approximations of the kernel. This paper investigates the effect of such kernel approximations on the interpolation error. We introduce a unified framework to analyze Gaussian process regression under important classes of computational misspecification: Karhunen–Loève expansions that result in low-rank kernel approximations, multiscale wavelet expansions that induce sparsity in the covariance matrix, and finite element representations that induce sparsity in the precision matrix. Our theory also accounts for epistemic misspecification in the choice of kernel parameters.},

In this paper, we show that the monomial basis is generally as good as a well-conditioned polynomial basis for interpolation, provided that the condition number of the Vandermonde matrix is smaller than the reciprocal of machine epsilon. This leads to a practical algorithm for piecewise polynomial interpolation over general regions in the complex plane using the monomial basis. Our analysis also yields a new upper bound for the condition number of an arbitrary Vandermonde matrix, which generalizes several previous results.},
