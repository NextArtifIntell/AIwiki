  abstract     = {In Machine Learning (ML), the use of subsets of training data, referred to as batches, rather than the entire dataset, has been extensively researched to reduce computational costs, improve model efficiency, and enhance algorithm generalization. Despite extensive research, a clear definition and consensus on what constitutes batch training have yet to be reached, leading to a fragmented body of literature that could otherwise be seen as different facets of a unified methodology. To address this gap, we propose a theoretical redefinition of batch training, creating a clearer and broader overview that integrates diverse perspectives. We then apply this refined concept specifically to Genetic Programming (GP). Although batch training techniques have been explored in GP, the term itself is seldom used, resulting in ambiguity regarding its application in this area. This review seeks to clarify the existing literature on batch training by presenting a new and practical classification system, which we further explore within the specific context of GP. We also investigate the use of dynamic batch sizes in ML, emphasizing the relatively limited research on dynamic or adaptive batch sizes in GP compared to other ML algorithms. By bringing greater coherence to previously disjointed research efforts, we aim to foster further scientific exploration and development. Our work highlights key considerations for researchers designing batch training applications in GP and offers an in-depth discussion of future research directions, challenges, and opportunities for advancement.},

ENSO events’ irregularity and unpredictability arise from intricate ocean–atmosphere interactions and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, complicating their prediction of timing, intensity, and geographic impacts. This study applies Genetic Programming and Genetic Algorithms within the EASEA (EAsy Specification of Evolutionary Algorithms) Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) framework to develop a repository of symbolic equations for El Niño and La Niña events, spanning their various intensities. By analyzing data from the Oceanic Niño Index, this approach yields equation-based characterizations of ENSO events. This methodology not only enhances ENSO characterization strategies but also contributes to expanding the use of EAs in climate event analysis. The resulting equations have the potential to offer insights beyond academia, benefiting education, climate policy, and environmental management. This highlights the importance of ongoing refinement, validation, and exploration in these fields through EAs.},

The technique integrates grammar-based design, Cartesian Genetic Programming, and a (1+ $$\lambda$$ ) Evolutionary Strategy and is demonstrated through the implementation of a wearable hardware predictor for blood glucose prediction. People with diabetes need to manage their blood glucose levels to prevent life-threatening situations and long-term complications. Effective glucose management requires accurate blood glucose predictions, yet most existing methods rely on heuristic estimators. This system enables the training and testing of personalized models using real patient data. We validated the approach by generating and evaluating models for 30- and 60-min forecasting predictions on ten patients, creating a total of 200 models. The system achieved state-of-the-art results, with 98% and 90% of predictions falling within clinically acceptable regions according to Clarke error grid analysis, for 30- and 60-min horizons, respectively. Unlike software implementations, our technique does not suffer from hardware limitations and provides an efficient, adaptable solution through wearable hardware with minimal errors and low power consumption. This is the first demonstration of combining Cartesian Genetic Programming with a hardware implementation for grammar-based blood glucose prediction, potentially enabling real-time embedded systems for portable devices.},

We concluded that representation choice is more impactful with a higher maximum depth, and that CFG-GP better explores the search space for deeper trees, achieving better results. Furthermore, we find that CFG-GP relies more on feature construction, whereas GE and SGE rely more on feature selection. Additionally, we altered the GGGP methods in two ways: using $$\epsilon$$ -lexicase selection, which solved the overfitting problem of CFG-GP and helps it to adapt to patients with high glucose variability; and with a penalization of complex trees, to create more interpretable trees. Combining $$\epsilon$$ -lexicase selection with CFG-GP performed best. In this work, we extend on the previous work and evaluated the impact of initialization methods in the quality of solutions. We found that they have no significant impact, even when the change of representation has.},

  abstract     = {Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) reimagined how to search for symbolic models using an evolutionary process. It addressed one of the main weaknesses of standard Genetic Programming (GP) by performing the search directly within the semantic space of a problem, which can define a convex and unimodal fitness landscape. Since the method does not require the syntactic evaluation of offspring, GSGP allowed more efficient and effective learning systems compared to standard GP. However, recent benchmarking results have suggested that GSGP is no longer a competitive approach, particularly in the symbolic regression domain, despite its previous success in several real-world tasks. Therefore, the research question of this work is an empirical one, stated as: Is GSGP still a competitive symbolic regression method 10 years after it was proposed? A comprehensive benchmark of black-box problems and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods were used to answer this question. In particular, a recently developed parallel version of GSGP is used, extending the implementation to also include the previously proposed optimal mutation step computation, as well as using the analytical quotient operator instead of a protected division. Results show that with simple, but important, extensions to the original GSGP algorithm, the answer to the research question is yes.},

  abstract     = {This paper establishes the potential of accelerating the evaluation phase of tree-based genetic programming through contemporary field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. This exploration stems from the fact that FPGAs can sometimes leverage increased levels of both data and function parallelism, as well as superior power/energy efficiency, when compared to general-purpose CPU/GPU systems. In this investigation, we introduce a fixed-depth, tree-based architecture that can fully parallelize tree evaluation for type-consistent primitives that are unrolled and pipelined. We show that our accelerator on a 14nm FPGA achieves an average speedup of 43 $$\times$$ when compared to a recent open-source GPU solution, TensorGP, implemented on 8nm process-node technology, and an average speedup of 4,902 $$\times$$ when compared to a popular baseline GP software tool, DEAP, running parallelized across all cores of a 2-socket, 28-core (56-thread), 14nm CPU server. Despite our single-FPGA accelerator being 2.4 $$\times$$ slower on average when compared to the recent state-of-the-art Operon tool executing on the same 2-processor, 28-core CPU system, we show that this single-FPGA system is 1.4 $$\times$$ better than Operon in terms of performance-per-watt. Importantly, we also describe six future extensions that could provide at least a 64–192 $$\times$$ speedup over our current design. Therefore, our initial results provide considerable motivation for the continued exploration of FPGA-based GP systems. Overall, any success in significantly improving runtime and energy efficiency could potentially enable novel research efforts through faster and/or less costly GP runs, similar to how GPUs unlocked the power of deep learning during the past fifteen years.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach called semantic boosting regression (SBR), leveraging the principles of boosting algorithms in symbolic regression using a Memetic Semantic GP for Symbolic Regression (MSGP) algorithm as weak learners. Memetic computation facilitates the integration of domain knowledge into a population-based approach, and semantic-based algorithms enhance local improvements to achieve targeted outputs. The fusion of memetic and semantic approaches allows us to augment the exploration and exploitation capabilities inherent in Genetic Programming (GP) and identify concise symbolic expressions that maintain interpretability without compromising the expressive power of symbolic regression. Our approach echoes the boosting algorithm’s characteristic, where weak learners (e.g., MSGP) are sequentially improved upon, focusing on correcting previous errors and continuously enhancing overall performance. This iterative strategy, intrinsic to boosting methods, is adeptly adapted to our SBR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our memetic-semantic approach has equal or better performance when compared to state-of-the-art evolutionary-based techniques when addressing real-world symbolic regression challenges. This advancement helps tackle the bloating issue in GP and significantly improves generalization capabilities. However, akin to classic boosting algorithms, one limitation of our approach is the increased computational cost due to the sequential training of boosting learners.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary symbolic regression approaches are powerful tools that can approximate an explicit mapping between input features and observation for various problems. However, ensuring that explored expressions maintain consistency with domain-specific constraints remains a crucial challenge. While neural networks are able to employ additional information like conservation laws to achieve more appropriate and robust approximations, the potential remains unrealized within genetic algorithms. This disparity is rooted in the inherent discrete randomness of recombining and mutating to generate new mapping expressions, making it challenging to maintain and preserve inferred constraints or restrictions in the course of the exploration. To address this limitation, we propose an approach centered on semantic backpropagation incorporated into the Gene Expression Programming (GEP), which integrates domain-specific properties in a vector representation as corrective feedback during the evolutionary process. By creating backward rules akin to algorithmic differentiation and leveraging pre-computed subsolutions, the mechanism allows the enforcement of any constraint within an expression tree by determining the misalignment and propagating desired changes back. To illustrate the effectiveness of constraining GEP through semantic backpropagation, we take the constraint of physical dimension as an example. This framework is applied to discover physical equations from the Feynman lectures. Results have shown not only an increased likelihood of recovering the original equation but also notable robustness in the presence of noisy data.},

  abstract     = {Requirements selection is one of the essential aspects of requirement engineering. So far, a lot of work has been done in this field. But, it is difficult to choose the right set of software requirements, taking into account their interactions and dependencies and only a few researches have paid attention to interactions and dependencies between requirements. However, in this paper, an attempt has been made to provide a method by considering interactions and dependencies between requirements. To better manage these features, we have also improved the search-based methods used in this area. According to the proposed method called RSCID, before choosing the optimized subset of requirements, dependencies between requirements are extracted. In  the next step, an algorithm is proposed based on the NSGA-II method. In this algorithm, a hybrid fitness function is introduced in addition to two other functions that are used. To tradeoff between cost and value functions, user interactions are also deployed. Another algorithm is used in this paper to choose an appropriate requirements subset, the combination of the NSGA-II method and a genetic algorithm to obtain three fitness functions. The results of the proposed methods have been compared to other methods based on the evaluation criteria in this field. The experiments show the efficiency of the proposed methods to select efficient and useful requirements.},
