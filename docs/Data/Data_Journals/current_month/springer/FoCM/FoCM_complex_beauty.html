  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with orthonormal systems in real intervals, given with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. More specifically, our interest is in systems with a skew-symmetric differentiation matrix (this excludes orthonormal polynomials). We consider a simple construction of such systems and pursue its ramifications. In general, given any $$\text {C}^1(a,b)$$ weight function such that $$w(a)=w(b)=0$$ , we can generate an orthonormal system with a skew-symmetric differentiation matrix. Except for the case $$a=-\infty $$ , $$b=+\infty $$ , only few powers of that matrix are bounded and we establish a connection between properties of the weight function and boundedness. In particular, we examine in detail two weight functions: the Laguerre weight function $$x^\alpha \textrm{e}^{-x}$$ for $$x&gt;0$$ and $$\alpha &gt;0$$ and the ultraspherical weight function $$(1-x^2)^\alpha $$ , $$x\in (-1,1)$$ , $$\alpha &gt;0$$ , and establish their properties. Both weights share a most welcome feature of separability, which allows for fast computation. The quality of approximation is highly sensitive to the choice of $$\alpha $$ , and we discuss how to choose optimally this parameter, depending on the number of zero boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {We present an algorithm that, given an irreducible polynomial g over a general valued field (K, v), finds the factorization of g over the Henselianization of K under certain conditions. The analysis leading to the algorithm follows the footsteps of Ore, Mac Lane, Okutsu, Montes, Vaquié and Herrera–Olalla–Mahboub–Spivakovsky, whose work we review in our context. The correctness is based on a key new result (Theorem 4.10), exhibiting relations between generalized Newton polygons and factorization in the context of an arbitrary valuation. This allows us to develop a polynomial factorization algorithm and an irreducibility test that go beyond the classical discrete, rank-one case. These foundational results may find applications for various computational tasks involved in arithmetic of function fields, desingularization of hypersurfaces, multivariate Puiseux series or valuation theory.},

By using a new approach, we extend this class to finite or periodic sequences, allowing a general representation of discrete pseudo-differential operators obtained by finite differences approximations and easily transferred to time discretizations. In particular we can define the notion of order and regularity, and we recover the fundamental property, well known in pseudo-differential calculus, that the commutator of two discrete operators gains one order of regularity. As examples of practical applications, we revisit standard error estimates for the convergence of splitting methods, obtaining in some Hamiltonian cases no loss of derivative in the error estimates, in particular for discretizations of general waves and/or water-waves equations. Moreover, we give an example of preconditioner constructions inspired by normal form analysis to deal with the similar question for more general cases.},

  abstract     = {We propose a modification of the standard linear implicit Euler integrator for the weak approximation of parabolic semilinear stochastic PDEs driven by additive space-time white noise. This new method can easily be combined with a finite difference method for the spatial discretization. The proposed method is shown to have improved qualitative properties compared with the standard method. First, for any time-step size, the spatial regularity of the solution is preserved, at all times. Second, the proposed method preserves the Gaussian invariant distribution of the infinite dimensional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process obtained when the nonlinearity is removed, for any time-step size. The weak order of convergence of the proposed method is shown to be equal to 1/2 in a general setting, like for the standard Euler scheme. A stronger weak approximation result is obtained when considering the approximation of a Gibbs invariant distribution, when the nonlinearity is a gradient: one obtains an approximation in total variation distance of order 1/2, which does not hold for the standard method. This is the first result of this type in the literature and this is the major and most original result of this article.},

  abstract     = {The Gromov–Wasserstein problem is a non-convex optimization problem over the polytope of transportation plans between two probability measures supported on two spaces, each equipped with a cost function evaluating similarities between points. Akin to the standard optimal transportation problem, it is natural to ask for conditions guaranteeing some structure on the optimizers, for instance, if these are induced by a (Monge) map. We study this question in Euclidean spaces when the cost functions are either given by (i) inner products or (ii) squared distances, two standard choices in the literature. We establish the existence of an optimal map in case (i) and of an optimal 2-map (the union of the graphs of two maps) in case (ii), both under an absolute continuity condition on the source measure. Additionally, in case (ii) and in dimension one, we numerically design situations where optimizers of the Gromov–Wasserstein problem are 2-maps but are not maps. This suggests that our result cannot be improved in general for this cost. Still in dimension one, we additionally establish the optimality of monotone maps under some conditions on the measures, thereby giving insight into why such maps often appear to be optimal in numerical experiments.},

This paper concisely reviews established results from the literature which all restrict to the lowest-order case of piecewise constants. Its main contribution consists of the generalization of these decompositions to 3D and of novel decompositions for piecewise affine vector fields in terms of Fortin–Soulie functions. While the classical lowest-order decompositions include one conforming and one nonconforming part, the decompositions of piecewise affine vector fields require a nonconforming enrichment in both parts. The presentation covers two and three spatial dimensions as well as generalizations to deviatoric tensor fields in the context of the Stokes equations and symmetric tensor fields for the linear elasticity and fourth-order problems. While the proofs focus on contractible domains, generalizations to multiply connected domains and domains with non-connected boundary are discussed as well.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies separating invariants: mappings on D-dimensional domains which are invariant to an appropriate group action and which separate orbits. The motivation for this study comes from the usefulness of separating invariants in proving universality of equivariant neural network architectures. We observe that in several cases the cardinality of separating invariants proposed in the machine learning literature is much larger than the dimension D. As a result, the theoretical universal constructions based on these separating invariants are unrealistically large. Our goal in this paper is to resolve this issue. We show that when a continuous family of semi-algebraic separating invariants is available, separation can be obtained by randomly selecting $$2D+1 $$ of these invariants. We apply this methodology to obtain an efficient scheme for computing separating invariants for several classical group actions which have been studied in the invariant learning literature. Examples include matrix multiplication actions on point clouds by permutations, rotations, and various other linear groups. Often the requirement of invariant separation is relaxed and only generic separation is required. In this case, we show that only $$D+1$$ invariants are required. More importantly, generic invariants are often significantly easier to compute, as we illustrate by discussing generic and full separation for weighted graphs. Finally we outline an approach for proving that separating invariants can be constructed also when the random parameters have finite precision.},

  abstract     = {Due to its appearance in a remarkably wide field of applications, such as audio processing and coherent diffraction imaging, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) phase retrieval problem has seen a great deal of attention in recent years. A central problem in STFT phase retrieval concerns the question for which window functions $$g \in {L^2({\mathbb R}^d)}$$ and which sampling sets $$\Lambda \subseteq {\mathbb R}^{2d}$$ is every $$f \in {L^2({\mathbb R}^d)}$$ uniquely determined (up to a global phase factor) by phaseless samples of the form $$\begin{aligned} |V_gf(\Lambda )| = \left\{ |V_gf(\lambda )|: \lambda \in \Lambda \right\} , \end{aligned}$$ where $$V_gf$$ denotes the STFT of f with respect to g. The investigation of this question constitutes a key step towards making the problem computationally tractable. However, it deviates from ordinary sampling tasks in a fundamental and subtle manner: recent results demonstrate that uniqueness is unachievable if $$\Lambda $$ is a lattice, i.e $$\Lambda = A{\mathbb Z}^{2d}, A \in \textrm{GL}(2d,{\mathbb R})$$ . Driven by this discretization barrier, the present article centers around the initiation of a novel sampling scheme which allows for unique recovery of any square-integrable function via phaseless STFT-sampling. Specifically, we show that square-root lattices, i.e., sets of the form $$\begin{aligned} \Lambda = A \left( \sqrt{{\mathbb Z}} \right) ^{2d}, \ \sqrt{{\mathbb Z}} = \{ \pm \sqrt{n}: n \in {\mathbb N}_0 \}, \end{aligned}$$ guarantee uniqueness of the STFT phase retrieval problem. The result holds for a large class of window functions, including Gaussians},
