  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of adaptive fuzzy control for stochastic biological systems with stage structure is studied. Firstly, considering the species itself in nature will be affected by a variety of uncertain factors, a more realistic stochastic biological model is established. Then, aiming at the unknown nonlinear functions in the stochastic biological system, the fuzzy logic system (FLS) is used to approximate the unknown nonlinear terms. Secondly, the backsteppting method and adaptive fuzzy means are applied to the prey–predator model with stage structure, and the corresponding adaptive fuzzy controller is designed. It is guaranteed that all states in the biological system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), the juvenile prey density can track the given desired density, and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood near zero. Finally, a simulation experiment is carried out with reference to the real case of the significant reduction of the number of lampreys. The results show that compared with the general adaptive control method, the control strategy proposed shows higher superiority in the stochastic biological system.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering has the virtue of simple structure and easy implementation; however, it relies on the initial cluster centers and is sensitive to noise. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a novel FCM clustering method with slime mold and a Fisher score. First, logistics chaotic mapping is introduced to initialize the slime mold population and increase the population diversity. Modifying the convergence factor of the slime mold enhances the convergence speed and accuracy of the slime mold algorithm (SMA). Second, an adaptive weight is introduced into the SMA to promote the transition between exploration and development. Then, this optimal solution for SMA initializes the cluster center of FCM to avoid initialization sensitivity. Third, when considering the influence of feature differentiation degrees on the samples, the feature evaluation criteria of the Fisher score is constructed and then the importance of the feature is ranked to identify noise. The square root error criterion selects the most effective features to improve the clustering effect. Finally, by constructing uncertainty relations and introducing information entropy, the objective function of FCM is constructed to effectively solve the issue of FCM being sensitive to noise. The experimental results on 13 benchmark test functions for optimization, and 25 datasets for clustering show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other compared algorithms in terms of several evaluation metrics.},

Existing approaches regarding label-specific features usually assume that the importance of each label to an instance is equal. However, this popular strategy might be suboptimal as the importance of labels actually is different. In this paper, a multi-label-specific features learning algorithm based on label importance and fuzzy rough set is proposed. First, the importance of labels is measured based on the similarity of instances, which not only preserves the ranking of relevant and irrelevant labels, but also follows the principles of smoothness and normalization. Second, the correlation between labels is analyzed, and label-specific features of each label are extracted through a fuzzy rough set model. Experiments on several public available data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper delves into the application of integral sliding mode control (ISMC) in addressing the complexities of fuzzy time-delay systems with periodic impulses. Unlike the sliding mode control method for continuous systems, the design of ISMC for impulsive hybrid systems is much more difficult due to the presence of pulses, especially to ensure the continuity of the sliding mode surface. Initially, a sophisticated fuzzy sliding mode surface is introduced, accompanied by a purposefully crafted fuzzy ISMC scheme incorporating impulsive signals. Subsequently, by employing a piecewise time-dependent Lyapunov function, we establish the globally asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. To enhance practical applicability, a control design algorithm is devised, determining optimal control and feedback gains. This algorithm, rooted in derived sufficient conditions and guided by linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory, ensures a systematic parameter selection process. The culmination lies in a compelling simulation example, vividly illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy ISMC scheme in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement and ongoing evolution of data information technology, the methods and approaches for data collection have become increasingly varied. The synthesis of heterogeneous big data to minimize information loss during the aggregation process poses a significant challenge. In practical applications, fuzzy dimensionality reduction characterization has proven to be an effective approach for handling heterogeneous big data. In this study, a novel approach is proposed for characterizing and evaluating heterogeneous big data using an interval intuitionistic fuzzy framework. We establish the interval intuitionistic fuzzy transformation method for large-scale quantitative data by defining satisfaction intervals, dissatisfaction intervals, and hesitation intervals. To integrate calculation and processing for linguistic evaluation information with different granularities, a transformation formula that handles multi-granularity uncertain linguistic information and interval intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is introduced. The proposed formula aggregates heterogeneous attribute values into interval intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. We employ interval intuitionistic fuzzy entropy to determine the objective weight of each evaluation indicator. Subsequently, the interval intuitionistic fuzzy comprehensive evaluation information for each alternative scheme, enabling effective ranking based on the information, is derived. Finally, the applicability of our proposed method is verified through a case study conducted on forest land in the county area of Fujian province. This case study comprehensively assesses and ranks the forest land quality in 16 sample plots. The evaluation serves as a theoretical framework for advancing sustainable development and conservation initiatives about forest land within the county.},

  abstract     = {A new class of kernels is constructed via incorporating fuzzy information into learning to enhance the performance of kernel-based algorithms. The fuzzy information is given in the form of Takagi–Sugeno (TS) models. First, a TS model is transformed into a structure that includes an inner product. Then an insensitive loss function is employed to identify the parameters in the consequent parts of TS fuzzy rules. By virtue of the kernel tick, the inner product is replaced with common kernels (e.g., Gaussian kernels) in the corresponding dual optimization problem. Consequently, the new kernels, called fuzzy membership kernels (FMKs), are constructed via TS models and common kernels. Note that some research focuses on transforming fuzzy rules into the weights of kernels, or simply, fuzzy weight kernels (FWK), for short. However, FWKs only consider the weights of training points and neglect the weights of test points. Compared with FWKs, the representations of FMKs show that the fuzzy information is incorporated into learning by adding weights to feature mappings of training and test points, respectively. Therefore, FMKs can overcome the shortcomings of FWKs. Finally, a function approximation problem is employed to validate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {With the popularization and application of mobile medical applications (apps), the privacy and security of personal medical data has received widespread concerns. Given that privacy leaks can cause serious privacy violations and personal safety issues, it is particularly important to adopt failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) in privacy risk assessment to ensure reliability and security. In particular, FMEA risk assessment requires the participation of numerous experts from different fields. Experts often express opinions with a level of individual concerns and confidence levels that needs to be considered in the risk assessment process. In this paper, a large group FMEA considering individual concerns and integrated consensus mechanism in the social network environment is developed for privacy risk assessment of mobile medical apps. Firstly, this paper constructs a complete social trust network (STN) based on the trust propagation operator proposed by the trust propagation path, which is conducive to comprehensively analyzing the social relationship among experts. Secondly, a hierarchical clustering method is proposed that considers both opinion similarity and concerns similarity between experts. This clustering method processes information from both subjective and objective perspectives to ensure a more reasonable cluster division. Next, considering that the level of consensus within a cluster affects the efficiency of consensus reaching, an integrated consensus mechanism that considers both intra-group consensus and inter-group consensus is developed to promote the unification of opinions. Additionally, this paper utilizes social trust relationships to guide the adjustment of the consensus level to reduce information loss on the premise of satisfying the expert&#39;s confidence level. Finally, a case study on assessing privacy risks of mobile medical apps illustrates the effectiveness of this approach, and the superiority and rationality of the method are confirmed by multi-angle comparative analysis, simulation analysis and parameter analysis.},

A fuzzy logic system is suggested for the purpose of approximating uncertainty terms in USV motion model. All state variables and control input signal are assumed to be quantized by the uniform quantizer, respectively. Then, the quantized control input signal is described linearly so that the designed fuzzy quantised controller does not need to anticipate specific information about the quantization parameters. Subsequently, the analysis of the control system without considering state quantization and the bounded nature of the quantization error within the fuzzy adaptive feedback control architecture are demonstrated through the elucidation of several pivotal theoretical lemmas. Based on these lemmas, the stability of the devised system with input and state quantization is established.

  abstract     = {The issue of command filter-based fault-tolerant fast finite-time control is explored for manipulator systems with actuator faults. By using finite-time control and a finite-time command filter, all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and converge to the bounded regions in finite time. In addition, the problems of complicated calculation and influence of filtering errors are solved by the introduction of the finite-time command filter and a compensation mechanism. It is especially emphasized that the main contribution of this paper is as follows: (1) Several advanced control methods are integrated, which takes into account the speed, reliability, and adaptability of the controlled system. (2) In the last step of the design based on backstepping, an intermediate variable is designed which can simplify the proposed control algorithm. In the end, with the help of a numerical simulation example, it is shown that better transient/steady state performance and the fast finite-time stability of the closed-loop system can be obtained. As a result, it is concluded that our scheme is effective.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a predefined-time adaptive fuzzy tracking control method is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems with multiple actuator constraints and external disturbances. The unknown dynamic part of the system is dealt with by means of the fuzzy approximation theory, and the unmeasured state in the system is approximated by the constructed fuzzy state observer. On the basis of the observer, a novel predefined-time control scheme is developed to ensure that the system can achieve the practical predefined time stable (PPTS). Combined with the stability analysis, the virtual control input with predefined time can be obtained, and its derivative can be estimated by the first-order filter. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed controller achieves a small residual set of error convergence to the origin in a predefined time. Finally, the feasibility of the theoretical results is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper displays the set up and simulation of a compact neuro-fuzzy adaptive scheme for the filling regulation of two coupled spherical tanks. The suggested scheme employs two compact neuro-fuzzy blocks: the first one to model the plant, and the second one for the controller implementation. In this scheme, the controller is trained employing the fuzzy model estimated with data of the system working in closed-loop. Thus, the controller optimization iteratively is performed when plant variations occur. The work also includes the deduction of the equations for training, showing the adaptive process employing neuro-fuzzy systems. Moreover, the training (optimization) process of the controller’s neuro-fuzzy system includes within the adjustment function the control action and the error signal. Various experimental cases are considered using statistical analysis to verify behaviors in the adaptive control system. In this order, the main contribution of this work consists of the adjustment (coupling) of two structures of compact neuro-fuzzy systems used for identification and control, as well as the deduction and adjustment of the training algorithms to implement the adaptive control system.},

  abstract     = {In a networked power system, communication delay in the feedback signal during transmission process can have a detrimental impact on the effectiveness of the power system stabilizer (PSS) in suppressing low-frequency oscillations. To address this problem, a controller design method to compensate for short constant time delays is proposed. The proposed approach utilizes Mamdani fuzzy inference system to design a fuzzy delay compensation damping controller (FDCDC) and establishes control rules based on the amplitude compensation method. The proposed FDCDC takes the delayed feedback signal as input and generates additional excitation control signal as output. The controller considers the effect of delay on the performance of PSS controller and compensates for the delay through fuzzy output. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed FDCDC, a networked power system model is developed using MATLAB Simulink’s SimPowerSystems library and TrueTime 2.0 toolbox. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of short constant time delay on the performance of PSS controller in a networked environment and to assess the performance of the proposed controller. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDCDC exhibits good adaptability and robustness in compensating for the effect of delay on PSS control.},

  abstract     = {In the present era, the most delicate environmental issue is global warming, and because of this, countries across the globe are trying to manage the most hazardous emissions by making certain investments in projects to promote green industrial practices. In the current study, the inventory models are developed by including the emission of CO2 from transportation which is controlled by the optimum investments in green technology (GT). Here, sustainable deteriorating inventory models in both crisp and cloudy fuzzy (CF) environments with a two-level trade credit scheme are proposed to boost the demand, where a delay in payment opportunity is there for suppliers and retailers. In this credit scenario, delay in payment options is given from the supplier to the retailer, and also from the retailer to the customer. In the present research, two warehouses are considered to manage the stock-out situation. For the model problems, demand is considered to be time dependent, where a multiple prepayment option for the purchasing cost involving an installment is provided to the retailers. Here the solution processes for the proposed models suggest algorithms, and then a numerical approach is followed to test the optimality criteria. The said optimum results are also presented in graphs. Again, a comparative study of the obtained results concerning the models is also highlighted. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis is performed to study the influence of variations in input parameters, which allows drawing some managerial insights.},

Based on the mean-value theorem, multiple Lyapunov functions scheme, and universal approximation ability of fuzzy logic systems, a switching fuzzy adaptive controller is designed to ensure that all closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Furthermore, the norm of an ideal weighting vector in fuzzy logic systems is taken as the estimation parameter instead of the elements of the weighting vector to reduce the dimension of adaptation laws. This switching controller can weaken the conservativeness brought by the application of the same controller for each subsystem. Finally, some examples are provided to verify the validity of the proposed approach.},

As an important part of the modern transportation system, railway transportation appears in most transportation scenarios. Therefore, choosing an eco-friendly railway transport selection scheme is conducive to further reducing pollution emissions and preventing the further deterioration of the ecological environment. Triangular Dense Fuzzy Linguistic Term Lock Set (TDFLTS) is a tool for describing uncertain information. CODAS-COPRAS is a method to solve the multi-attribute group decision-making problem. This paper first introduces TDFLTS to describe uncertain information. Secondly, the distance measure and similarity measure between TDFLTS are proposed. Then, MEREC and DEMATEL methods are used to obtain attribute weights. Finally, CODAS-COPRAS method is used to solve the multi-attribute decision-making problem under TDFLTS environment, and it is applied to the research of railway transportation scheme selection.},
