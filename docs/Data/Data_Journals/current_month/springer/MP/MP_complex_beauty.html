Our algorithm is very simple and it can be extended to give a dynamic data structure that maintains a $$(1-\varepsilon )$$ -approximate maximum weight matching under (1) one-sided vertex deletions (with incident edges) and (2) one-sided vertex insertions (with incident edges sorted by weight) to the other side. The total time time used is $$O(m\varepsilon ^{-1})$$ , where m is the sum of the number of initially existing and inserted edges.},

  abstract     = {We consider the bilevel knapsack problem with interdiction constraints, a fundamental bilevel integer programming problem which generalizes the 0–1 knapsack problem. In this problem, there are two knapsacks and n items. The objective is to select some items to pack into the first knapsack such that the maximum profit attainable from packing some of the remaining items into the second knapsack is minimized. We present a combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm which outperforms the current state-of-the-art solution method in computational experiments for 99% of the instances reported in the literature. On many of the harder instances, our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster, which enabled it to solve 53 of the 72 previously unsolved instances. Our result relies fundamentally on a new dynamic programming algorithm which computes very strong lower bounds. This dynamic program solves a relaxation of the problem from bilevel to 2n-level where the items are processed in an online fashion. The relaxation is easier to solve but approximates the original problem surprisingly well in practice. We believe that this same technique may be useful for other interdiction problems.},

  abstract     = {The Matroid Secretary Conjecture is a notorious open problem in online optimization. It claims the existence of an O(1)-competitive algorithm for the Matroid Secretary Problem (MSP). Here, the elements of a weighted matroid appear one-by-one, revealing their weight at appearance, and the task is to select elements online with the goal to get an independent set of largest possible weight. O(1)-competitive MSP algorithms have so far only been obtained for restricted matroid classes and for MSP variations, including Random-Assignment MSP (RA-MSP), where an adversary fixes a number of weights equal to the ground set size of the matroid, which then get assigned randomly to the elements of the ground set. Unfortunately, these approaches heavily rely on knowing the full matroid upfront. This is an arguably undesirable requirement, and there are good reasons to believe that an approach towards resolving the MSP Conjecture should not rely on it. Thus, both Soto (SIAM Journal on Computing 42(1): 178-211, 2013.) and Oveis Gharan and Vondrák (Algorithmica 67(4): 472-497, 2013.) raised as an open question whether RA-MSP admits an O(1)-competitive algorithm even without knowing the matroid upfront. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Our result makes RA-MSP the first well-known MSP variant with an O(1)-competitive algorithm that does not need to know the underlying matroid upfront and without any restriction on the underlying matroid. Our approach is based on first approximately learning the rank-density curve of the matroid, which we then exploit algorithmically.},

  abstract     = {In multicommodity network flows, a supply–demand graph pair (G, H) (called a multiflow topology) is cut-sufficient if, for all capacity and demand weights, the cut condition is enough to guarantee the existence of a feasible multiflow. We characterize cut-sufficiency for two classes of directed 2-commodity flows: roundtrip demands, where H is a 2-cycle, and 2-path demands, where H is a directed path of length two. We then extend these characterizations to some larger demand graphs, namely directed stars and directed triangles. To obtain such characterizations, we introduce a theory of relevant minors. Unlike the undirected setting, for directed graphs the cut-sufficient topologies are not minor-closed. They are however relevant-minor-closed. A single forbidden relevant minor characterizes roundtrip cut-sufficiency, and two suffice for the other classes. We also provide a partial characterization in the case of two independent demands (2-matching demands), showing that one of two relevant minors exists if the weights that break cut-sufficiency have unit demand values. As an application of our results, we show that recognizing cut-sufficiency for directed multiflow topologies is co-NP-hard, even for roundtrip demands. This is in contrast to undirected 2-commodity flows, for which topologies are always cut-sufficient.},

Previous progress on this question, in particular for $$\Delta =2$$ , relies on algorithms that solve an important special case, namely strictly $$\Delta $$ -modular IPs, which further restrict the $$n\times n$$ minors of A to be within $$\{-\Delta , 0, \Delta \}$$ . Even for $$\Delta =2$$ , such problems include well-known combinatorial optimization problems like the minimum odd/even cut problem. The conjecture remains open even for strictly $$\Delta $$ -modular IPs. Prior advances were restricted to prime $$\Delta $$ , which allows for employing strong number-theoretic results. In this work, we make first progress beyond the prime case by presenting techniques not relying on such strong number-theoretic prime results. In particular, our approach implies that there is a randomized algorithm to check feasibility of strictly $$\Delta $$ -modular IPs in strongly polynomial time if $$\Delta \le 4$$ .},

We call this a vertex-supported belief. We prove that this formulation is piecewise affine over the so-called chamber complex of the feasible set of the high-point relaxation. We propose two algorithmic approaches to solve general problems enjoying this last property. The first one is based on enumerating the vertices of the chamber complex. This approach is not scalable, but we present it as a computational baseline and for its theoretical interest. The second one is a Monte-Carlo approximation scheme based on the fact that randomly drawn points of the domain lie, with probability 1, in the interior of full-dimensional chambers, where the problem (restricted to this chamber) can be reduced to a linear program. Finally, we evaluate these methods through computational experiments showing both approaches’ advantages and challenges.},

We believe such post-hoc analysis of BB trees may assist in identifying helpful general disjunctions in BB algorithms.

  abstract     = {The intersection cut framework was introduced by Balas in 1971 as a method for generating cutting planes in integer optimization. In this framework, one uses a full-dimensional convex S-free set, where S is the feasible region of the integer program, to derive a cut separating S from a non-integral vertex of a linear relaxation of S. Among all S-free sets, it is the inclusion-wise maximal ones that yield the strongest cuts. Recently, this framework has been extended beyond the integer case in order to obtain cutting planes in non-linear settings. In this work, we consider the specific setting when S is defined by a homogeneous quadratic inequality. In this ‘quadratic-free’ setting, every function $$\Gamma : D^m \rightarrow D^n$$ , where $$D^k$$ is the unit sphere in $$\mathbb {R}^k$$ , generates a representation of a quadratic-free set. While not every $$\Gamma $$ generates a maximal quadratic free set, it is the case that every full-dimensional maximal quadratic free set is generated by some $$\Gamma $$ . Our main result shows that the corresponding quadratic-free set is full-dimensional and maximal if and only if $$\Gamma $$ is non-expansive and satisfies a technical condition. This result yields a broader class of maximal S-free sets than previously known. Our result stems from a new characterization of maximal S-free sets (for general S beyond the quadratic setting) based on sequences that ‘expose’ inequalities defining the S-free set.},

A necessary condition for the existence of the desired distribution is that $$\sum _{e \in P} \rho _e \ge \pi _P$$ for all $$P \in \mathcal {P}$$ . We show that this condition is sufficient if and only if $$\mathcal {P}$$ has the weak max-flow/min-cut property. We further provide an efficient combinatorial algorithm for computing the corresponding distribution in the special case where $$(E, \mathcal {P})$$ is an abstract network. As a consequence, equilibria for the security game in [6] can be efficiently computed in a wide variety of settings (including arbitrary digraphs). As a subroutine of our algorithm, we provide a combinatorial algorithm for computing shortest paths in abstract networks, partially answering an open question by McCormick [20]. We further show that a conservation law proposed in [6] for the requirement vector $$\pi $$ in DAGs can be reduced to the setting of affine requirements described above.},

In this paper, we formulate the optimal general factor problem as the jump system intersection, and reveal when the algorithm by Dudycz and Paluch can be applied to this abstract form of the problem. By using this abstraction, we give another correctness proof of the algorithm, which is simpler than the original one. We also extend our result to the valuated case.},

  abstract     = {Disjunctive cutting planes can tighten a relaxation of a mixed-integer linear program. Traditionally, such cuts are obtained by solving a higher-dimensional linear program, whose additional variables cause the procedure to be computationally prohibitive. Adopting a $$\mathcal {V}$$ -polyhedral perspective is a practical alternative that enables the separation of disjunctive cuts via a linear program with only as many variables as the original problem. The drawback is that the classical approach of monoidal strengthening cannot be directly employed without the values of the extra variables appearing in the extended formulation, which constitute a certificate of validity of the cut. We derive how to compute this certificate from a solution to the linear program generating $$\mathcal {V}$$ -polyhedral disjunctive cuts. We then present computational experiments with monoidal strengthening of cuts from disjunctions with as many as 64 terms. Some instances are dramatically impacted, with strengthening increasing the gap closed by the cuts from 0 to 100%. However, for larger disjunctions, monoidal strengthening appears to be less effective, for which we identify a potential cause. Lastly, the certificates of validity also enable us to verify which disjunctive cuts are equivalent to intersection cuts, which happens increasingly rarely for larger disjunctions.},

Similarly, we describe the geometry for affine maximizers for n players and m items, showing that they correspond to regular subdivisions of the m-fold product of $$(n-1)$$ -dimensional simplices. These observations are then used to construct mechanisms that are robust in the sense that the sets of items allocated to the players change only slightly when the players’ reported types are changed slightly.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing conjecture for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) states that the integrality gap of the standard linear programming relaxation of the TSP (sometimes called the Subtour LP or the Held-Karp bound) is at most 4/3 for symmetric instances of the TSP obeying the triangle inequality; that is, the cost of an optimal tour is at most 4/3 times the value of the value of the corresponding linear program. There is a variety of evidence in support of the conjecture (see, for instance, Goemans in Math Program 69:335–349, 1995; Benoit and Boyd in Math Oper Res 33:921–931, 2008). It has long been known that the integrality gap is at most 3/2 (Wolsey in Math Program Study 13:121–134, 1980; Shmoys and Williamson in Inf Process Lett 35:281–285, 1990). Despite significant efforts by the community, the conjecture remains open. In this paper we consider the half-integral case, in which a feasible solution to the LP has solution values in $$\{0, 1/2, 1\}$$ . Such instances have been conjectured to be the most difficult instances for the overall four-thirds conjecture (Schalekamp et al. in Math Oper Res 39(2):403–417, 2014). Karlin et al. (in: Proceedings of the 52nd Annual ACM Symposium on the the Theory of Computing, ACM, New York, 2020), in a breakthrough result, were able to show that in the half-integral case, the integrality gap is at most 1.49993; Gupta et al. (in: Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2022. https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09290 ) showed a slight improvement of this result to 1.4983. Additionally, this result led to the first significant progress on the overall conjecture in decades; the same authors showed the integrality gap of the Subtour LP is at most $$1.5-\epsilon $$ for some $$\epsilon &gt;10^{-36}$$ Karlin et al. in 2022 IEEE 63rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS). https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS54457.2022.00084 . With the improvements on the 3/2 bound remaining very incremental, even in the half-integral case, we turn the question around and look for a large class of half-integral instances for which we can prove that the 4/3 conjecture is correct, preferably one containing the known worst-case instances. In Karlin et al.’s work on the half-integral case, they perform induction on a hierarchy of critical tight sets in the support graph of the LP solution, in which some of the sets correspond to cycle cuts and the others to degree cuts. Here we show that if all the sets in the hierarchy correspond to cycle cuts, then we can find a distribution of tours whose expected cost is at most 4/3 times the value of the half-integral LP solution; sampling from the distribution gives us a randomized 4/3-approximation algorithm. We note that two important bad cases with an integrality gap of 4/3 have a half-integral LP solution in which all the critical tight sets in the hierarchy are cycle cuts; thus our result is tight. Our overall approach is novel. Most recent work has focused on showing that some variation of the Christofides-Serdyukov algorithm (Christofides in “Worst case analysis of a new heuristic for the traveling salesman problem”. Report 388, Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 1976; Serdyukov in Upravlyaemye Sistemy 17:76–79, 1978) that combines a randomly sampled spanning tree plus a T-join (or a matching) can be shown to give a bound better than 1.5. Here we show that for any point in a region of “patterns” of edges incident to each cycle cut, we can give a distribution of patterns connecting all the child cycle cuts such that the distribution of patterns for each child also falls in the region. This region gives rise to a distribution on Eulerian tours in which each edge in the support of the LP is used at most four-thirds of its LP value of the time, which then gives the result.},

In particular, we show a competitive ratio of $$(1+3\sqrt{3})\approx 6.197$$ for the deterministic and of $$\approx 3.032$$ for the randomized strategy, by making use of the largest eigenvalue of a Toeplitz matrix. In addition, we show that the preemptive Weighted Shortest Elapsed Time First (WSETF) rule is 2-competitive when jobs are released online, matching the lower bound for the unit weight case with trivial release dates for any non-clairvoyant algorithm. Using this result as well as the competitiveness of round-robin for multiple machines, we prove performance guarantees smaller than 10 for adaptions of the b-scaling strategy to online release dates and unweighted jobs on identical parallel machines.},

It is known that the correlation gap of a monotone submodular function is at least $$1-1/e$$ , and this is tight for simple matroid rank functions. We initiate a fine-grained study of the correlation gap of matroid rank functions. In particular, we present an improved lower bound on the correlation gap as parametrized by the rank and girth of the matroid. We also show that for any matroid, the correlation gap of its weighted rank function is minimized under uniform weights. Such improved lower bounds have direct applications for submodular maximization under matroid constraints, mechanism design, and contention resolution schemes.},

First, we show that for any undirected graph with n nodes, there is a neural network (with fixed weights and biases) of size $$\mathcal {O}(n^3)$$ that takes the edge weights as input and computes the value of a minimum spanning tree of the graph. Second, we show that for any directed graph with n nodes and m arcs, there is a neural network of size $$\mathcal {O}(m^2n^2)$$ that takes the arc capacities as input and computes a maximum flow. Our results imply that these two problems can be solved with strongly polynomial time algorithms that solely use affine transformations and maxima computations, but no comparison-based branchings.},

We provide an upper bound on the optimal number of loadouts and provide a family of constructions that have an asymptotically optimal number of loadouts. The upper bound is based on a connection between our problem and the study of triangulations of point sets arising from polyhedral combinatorics, and specifically the combinatorics of the cyclic polytope. Our asymptotically optimal construction also draws inspiration from the properties of the cyclic polytope.},

Stable graphs play a key role in characterizing the existence of stable solutions for popular combinatorial games that involve the structure of matchings in graphs, such as network bargaining games and cooperative matching games. The vertex-stabilizer problem asks to compute a minimum number of players to block (i.e., vertices of $$G$$ to remove) in order to ensure stability for such games. The problem has been shown to be solvable in polynomial-time, for unit-capacity graphs. This stays true also if we impose the restriction that the set of players to block must not intersect with a given specified maximum matching of $$G$$ . In this work, we investigate these algorithmic problems in the more general setting of arbitrary capacities. We show that the vertex-stabilizer problem with the additional restriction of avoiding a given maximum matching remains polynomial-time solvable. Differently, without this restriction, the vertex-stabilizer problem becomes NP-hard and even hard to approximate, in contrast to the unit-capacity case.},

Our algorithm performs first order update steps, followed by iterations that aim to ‘stabilize’ the current iterate with additional projections, i.e., find a locally optimal solution whilst keeping the current tight inequalities. Such steps have been previously used in active set methods for the nonnegative least squares (NNLS) problem. We bound on the number of iterations polynomially in the dimension and in the associated circuit imbalance measure. In particular, the algorithm is strongly polynomial for network flow instances. Classical NNLS algorithms such as the Lawson–Hanson algorithm are special instantiations of our framework; as a consequence, we obtain convergence bounds for these algorithms.

  abstract     = {The configuration balancing problem with stochastic requests generalizes well-studied resource allocation problems such as load balancing and virtual circuit routing. There are given m resources and n requests; each request has multiple possible configurations, each of which increases the load of each resource by some amount. The goal is to select one configuration for each request to minimize the makespan: the load of the most-loaded resource. In the stochastic setting, the amount by which a configuration increases the resource load is uncertain until the configuration is chosen, but we are given a probability distribution. We develop both offline and online algorithms for configuration balancing with stochastic requests. When the requests are known offline, we give a non-adaptive policy for configuration balancing with stochastic requests that $$O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$$ -approximates the optimal adaptive policy, which matches a known lower bound for the special case of load balancing on identical machines. When requests arrive online in a list, we give a non-adaptive policy that is $$O(\log m)$$ competitive. Again, this result is asymptotically tight due to information-theoretic lower bounds for special cases (e.g., for load balancing on unrelated machines). Finally, we show how to leverage adaptivity in the special case of load balancing on related machines to obtain a constant-factor approximation offline and an $$O(\log \log m)$$ -approximation online. A crucial technical ingredient in all of our results is a new structural characterization of the optimal adaptive policy that allows us to limit the correlations between its decisions.},

  abstract     = {Approximate integer programming is the following: For a given convex body $$K \subseteq {\mathbb {R}}^n$$ , either determine whether $$K \cap {\mathbb {Z}}^n$$ is empty, or find an integer point in the convex body $$2\cdot (K - c) +c$$ which is K, scaled by 2 from its center of gravity c. Approximate integer programming can be solved in time $$2^{O(n)}$$ while the fastest known methods for exact integer programming run in time $$2^{O(n)} \cdot n^n$$ . So far, there are no efficient methods for integer programming known that are based on approximate integer programming. Our main contribution are two such methods, each yielding novel complexity results. First, we show that an integer point $$x^* \in (K \cap {\mathbb {Z}}^n)$$ can be found in time $$2^{O(n)}$$ , provided that the remainders of each component $$x_i^* \mod \ell $$ for some arbitrarily fixed $$\ell \ge 5(n+1)$$ of $$x^*$$ are given. The algorithm is based on a cutting-plane technique, iteratively halving the volume of the feasible set. The cutting planes are determined via approximate integer programming. Enumeration of the possible remainders gives a $$2^{O(n)}n^n$$ algorithm for general integer programming. This matches the current best bound of an algorithm by Dadush (Integer programming, lattice algorithms, and deterministic, vol. Estimation. Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, 2012) that is considerably more involved. Our algorithm also relies on a new asymmetric approximate Carathéodory theorem that might be of interest on its own. Our second method concerns integer programming problems in equation-standard form $$Ax = b, 0 \le x \le u, \, x \in {\mathbb {Z}}^n$$ . Such a problem can be reduced to the solution of $$\prod _i O(\log u_i +1)$$ approximate integer programming problems. This implies, for example that knapsack or subset-sum problems with polynomial variable range $$0 \le x_i \le p(n)$$ can be solved in time $$(\log n)^{O(n)}$$ . For these problems, the best running time so far was $$n^n \cdot 2^{O(n)}$$ .},

The algorithm is based on a new insight revealing that the linearizability of the QSPP for acyclic digraphs can be seen as a local property. Our approach extends to the more general higher-order shortest path problem.},

  abstract     = {We consider the computational problem of finding short paths in the skeleton of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph. We prove that unless $${\textsf {P}}={\textsf {NP}}$$ , there is no polynomial-time algorithm that computes a path of constant length between two vertices at distance two of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph. Conditioned on $${\textsf {P}}\ne {\textsf {NP}}$$ , this disproves a conjecture by Ito et al. (SIAM J Discrete Math 36(2):1102–1123, 2022). Assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis we prove the stronger result that there exists no polynomial-time algorithm computing a path of length at most $$\left( \frac{1}{4}-o(1)\right) \log N / \log \log N$$ between two vertices at distance two of the perfect matching polytope of an N-vertex bipartite graph. These results remain true if the bipartite graph is restricted to be of maximum degree three. The above has the following interesting implication for the performance of pivot rules for the simplex algorithm on simply-structured combinatorial polytopes: If $${\textsf {P}}\ne {\textsf {NP}}$$ , then for every simplex pivot rule executable in polynomial time and every constant $$k \in {\mathbb {N}}$$ there exists a linear program on a perfect matching polytope and a starting vertex of the polytope such that the optimal solution can be reached in two monotone non-degenerate steps from the starting vertex, yet the pivot rule will require at least k non-degenerate steps to reach the optimal solution. This result remains true in the more general setting of pivot rules for so-called circuit-augmentation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Robust combinatorial optimization with budgeted uncertainty is one of the most popular approaches for integrating uncertainty into optimization problems. The existence of a compact reformulation for (mixed-integer) linear programs and positive complexity results give the impression that these problems are relatively easy to solve. However, the practical performance of the reformulation is quite poor when solving robust integer problems, in particular due to its weak linear relaxation. To overcome this issue, we propose procedures to derive new classes of valid inequalities for robust combinatorial optimization problems. For this, we recycle valid inequalities of the underlying deterministic problem such that the additional variables from the robust formulation are incorporated. The valid inequalities to be recycled may either be readily available model constraints or actual cutting planes, where we can benefit from decades of research on valid inequalities for classical optimization problems. We first demonstrate the strength of the inequalities theoretically, by proving that recycling yields a facet-defining inequality in many cases, even if the original valid inequality was not facet-defining. Afterwards, we show in an extensive computational study that using recycled inequalities can lead to a significant improvement of the computation time when solving robust optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Explorable heap selection is the problem of selecting the nth smallest value in a binary heap. The key values can only be accessed by traversing through the underlying infinite binary tree, and the complexity of the algorithm is measured by the total distance traveled in the tree (each edge has unit cost). This problem was originally proposed as a model to study search strategies for the branch-and-bound algorithm with storage restrictions by Karp, Saks and Widgerson (FOCS ’86), who gave deterministic and randomized $$n\cdot \exp (O(\sqrt{\log {n}}))$$ time algorithms using $$O(\log (n)^{2.5})$$ and $$O(\sqrt{\log n})$$ space respectively. We present a new randomized algorithm with running time $$O(n\log (n)^3)$$ against an oblivious adversary using $$O(\log n)$$ space, substantially improving the previous best randomized running time at the expense of slightly increased space usage. We also show an $$\Omega (\log (n)n/\log (\log (n)))$$ lower bound for any algorithm that solves the problem in the same amount of space, indicating that our algorithm is nearly optimal.},

  abstract     = {The reformulation–linearization technique (RLT) is a prominent approach to constructing tight linear relaxations of non-convex continuous and mixed-integer optimization problems. The goal of this paper is to extend the applicability and improve the performance of RLT for bilinear product relations. First, we present a method for detecting bilinear product relations implicitly contained in mixed-integer linear programs, which is based on analyzing linear constraints with binary variables, thus enabling the application of bilinear RLT to a new class of problems. Strategies for filtering product relations are discussed and tested. Our second contribution addresses the high computational cost of RLT cut separation, which presents one of the major difficulties in applying RLT efficiently in practice. We propose a new RLT cutting plane separation algorithm which identifies combinations of linear constraints and bound factors that are expected to yield an inequality that is violated by the current relaxation solution. This algorithm is applicable to RLT cuts generated for all types of bilinear terms, including but not limited to the detected implicit products. A detailed computational study based on independent implementations in two solvers evaluates the performance impact of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the information complexity of mixed-integer convex optimization under different types of oracles. We establish new lower bounds for the standard first-order oracle, improving upon the previous best known lower bound. This leaves only a lower order linear term (in the dimension) as the gap between the lower and upper bounds. This is derived as a corollary of a more fundamental “transfer” result that shows how lower bounds on information complexity of continuous convex optimization under different oracles can be transferred to the mixed-integer setting in a black-box manner. Further, we (to the best of our knowledge) initiate the study of, and obtain the first set of results on, information complexity under oracles that only reveal partial first-order information, e.g., where one can only make a binary query over the function value or subgradient at a given point. We give algorithms for (mixed-integer) convex optimization that work under these less informative oracles. We also give lower bounds showing that, for some of these oracles, every algorithm requires more iterations to achieve a target error compared to when complete first-order information is available. That is, these oracles are provably less informative than full first-order oracles for the purpose of optimization.},
