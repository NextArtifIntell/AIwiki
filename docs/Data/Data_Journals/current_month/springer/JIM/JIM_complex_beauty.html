  abstract     = {The forming quality of Fiber metal laminates (FMLs) heavily depends on the material properties, fiber placing angles, blank holder force, and other process parameters. In some circumstances, the numerical perturbation of the key parameters has a potential impact on the mechanical properties of final products. To efficiently design a set of available system parameters to ensure the forming quality, a manifold learning-assisted approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method is proposed to identify system parameters with uncertainties. In this study, the nonlinear manifold learning approach is employed to extract the feature vector of physical field information of sheet metal and composite core after hot forming. Furthermore, the mapping transformation of system parameters based on different modeling techniques is performed to shorten the time of obtaining feature vectors of new samples. The nested sampling method involving the wavelet mutation strategy is proposed to improve the sampling efficiency of the posterior distribution of system parameters while the tolerance criterion is guaranteed. Two hot stamp-forming cases are employed to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The numerical results show that the proposed method is effective in obtaining the system parameters necessary for achieving the high-quality forming of FMLs.},

  abstract     = {In advanced manufacturing, the incorporation of sensing technology provides an opportunity to achieve efficient in situ process monitoring using machine learning methods. Meanwhile, the advances of information technologies also enable a connected and decentralized environment for manufacturing systems, making different manufacturing units in the system collaborate more closely. In a decentralized manufacturing system, the involved units may fabricate same or similar products and deploy their own machine learning model for online process monitoring. However, due to the possible inconsistency of task progress during the operation, it is also common that some units have more informative data while some have less informative data. Thus, the monitoring performance of machine learning model for each unit may highly vary. Therefore, it is extremely valuable to achieve efficient and secured knowledge sharing among the units in a decentralized manufacturing system for enhancement of poorly performed models. To realize this goal, this paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation-based information sharing (KD-IS) framework, which could distill informative knowledge from well performed models to improve the monitoring performance of poorly performed models. To validate the effectiveness of this method, a real-world case study is conducted in a connected fused filament fabrication (FFF)-based additive manufacturing (AM) platform. The experimental results show that the developed method is very efficient in improving model monitoring performance at poorly performed models, with solid protection on potential data privacy.},

  abstract     = {In the semiconductor industry, wafer bin maps (WBMs) refer to image data that reveal the defect of each chip positioned on that wafer. The WBMs provide crucial information that can facilitate the identification of underlying causes for any defects present on a wafer. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a significant amount of research has been conducted leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to automatically classify wafer bin map defects. Although there have been various attempts to enhance performance by using both unlabeled and labeled data, current research is constrained by its narrow focus on improving the detection of known defect patterns. However, in the real world, multiple novel patterns frequently arise that have not been previously encountered. Hence, AI models must exhibit the capacity to detect not only existing known defect patterns but also newly emerging defect patterns, while ensuring effective classification of these new patterns among themselves. In this study, we propose the contrastive open-world semi-supervised learning that can classify multiple novel patterns in WBMs simultaneously. We introduce a contrastive loss function to address the challenges associated with the existence of significantly fewer new defect patterns than existing patterns in the WBM problem. We confirm that the proposed methodology effectively detects and classifies diverse new patterns separately in real-world open data, WM-811 K. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other existing open-world semi-supervised learning in WBM classification.},

  abstract     = {Monocrystalline silicon is an essential raw material for the photovoltaic industry, and industrial production requires keeping monocrystalline silicon crystals free of defects. Monocrystalline silicon production requires the staff to adjust the monocrystalline furnace parameters according to the state of the monocrystalline silicon to control the crystal growth process. The high-temperature environment inside the furnace causes the staff to observe the status of the crystal lines only through the industrial camera. The crystallization process is based on the generation of crystal lines to determine if the crystal is in a stable state. The isometric growth process determines whether dislocations have occurred in the crystal by crystal line characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to automatically detect the status of the crystal lines through algorithms. We have built a monocrystal silicon crystal line dataset by analyzing the image features of the crystallization process and the isometry process of monocrystal silicon. Then we propose an improved YoloX-tinys model based on the YoloX-tiny model, which can detect crystal line features accurately and quickly at low arithmetic power. The backbone network is replaced with ShufferNetV2 lightweight network and the internal 3*3 convolutional kernel is replaced with a 5*5 size to improve the computational power of the model. DFC(Decoupled Fully Connected Attention) attention mechanism is added to the Neck network to enhance the feature processing capability. We also optimize the Neck network by replacing the depthwise separable convolution and applying the h-swish activation function. The improved model achieves 99.53% mAP on the proposed dataset. Meanwhile, the number of parameters of the model decreases from 5.03M to 2.35M, and the FPS(Frames Per Second) increase from 45.34 to 59.41. The results demonstrate that our model is able to achieve accurate crystal line detection with less computational consumption compared to other models, while achieving higher detection accuracy and speed.},

In addition, data is collected without assigned labels. How can someone use run-to-failure data to develop a suitable solution toward achieving predictive maintenance (PdM) in this case? These issues arise in our case, which refers to a cold-forming press. Such a setting calls for an unsupervised solution that can predict upcoming failures investigating a wide spectrum of approaches, namely similarity-based, forecasting-based and deep-learning ones. But before we decide on the best solution, we first need to understand which key performance indicators are appropriate to evaluate the impact of each such solution. A comprehensive study of available evaluation methods is presented, highlighting misconceptions and limitations of broadly used evaluation metrics concerning run-to-failure data, while proposing an extension of state-of-the-art range-based anomaly detection evaluation metrics to serve PdM purposes. Finally, an investigation of pre-processing, distance metrics, incorporation of domain expertise, and the role of deep learning shows how to engineer an unsupervised solution for predictive maintenance providing insightful answers to all these problems.

  abstract     = {Despite the many advantages and increasing adoption of Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-EB) additive manufacturing by industry, current PBF-EB systems remain largely unstable and prone to unpredictable anomalous behaviours. Additionally, although featuring in-situ process monitoring, PBF-EB systems show limited capabilities in terms of timely identification of process failures, which may result into considerable wastage of production time and materials. These aspects are commonly recognized as barriers for the industrial breakthrough of PBF-EB technologies. On top of these considerations, in our research we aim at introducing real-time anomaly detection capabilities into the PBF-EB process. To do so, we build our case-study on top of a Arcam EBM A2X system, one of the most diffused PBF-EB machines in industry, and make access to the most relevant variables made available by this machine during the layering process. Thus, seeking a proficient interpretation of such data, we introduce a deep learning autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework. We demonstrate that this framework is able not only to early identify anomalous patterns from such data in real-time during the process with a F1 score around 90%, but also to anticipate the failure of the current job by 6 h, on average, and in one case by almost 20 h. This avoids waste of production time and opens the way to a more controllable PBF-EB process.},

To evaluate and predict the quality of LPBF-built parts, engaging in real-time monitoring of the LPBF process by leveraging thermal information derived from the melt pool becomes significant. In this work, the insights conveyed by near-infrared (NIR) thermal-imaging on melt pools during the LPBF process were explored, with the assistance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, aiming to develop ML and DL models capable of recognizing NIR melt-pool monitoring images and predicting invisible geometries of laser-tracks. Traditional ML models, including support vector machines, were used to establish a non-linear mapping relationship between NIR thermal images and cross-sectional geometries of solidified laser-tracks. That was achieved by extracting melt-pool NIR image features based on prior knowledge while analyzing the influence of laser parameters on the melt pools. Then, DL models such as convolutional neural networks were improved to extract multi-scale features from the melt-pool thermal images through self-learning mechanisms. By comprehensively merging multi-scale features, these DL models effectively captured and reflected vital NIR image information from the melt pool. The various methodologies collectively provided real-time insights for monitoring and controlling the LPBF processes, thereby facilitating reasoning about and predicting imperceptible geometries of the cross-sectional solidified laser-tracks within the as-built parts.},

  abstract     = {In-process monitoring of production quality plays a significant role in intelligent manufacturing. Both part deformation and vibration happen simultaneously in machining processes. They are two prominent issues that can affect the surface quality of machined parts, especially those with low rigidity. The purpose of this study is to explore a hybrid modeling solution to simultaneously monitor the diametrical errors and early chatter vibrations when turning a slender workpiece. A generic analytical model of the slender workpiece turning is formulated based on dynamics of machining. It is proved that the system complies with the principle of superposition. Accordingly, the explicit expressions free from cutting force modeling that is widely used in literature are derived for characterizing the finished surface quality with analytical and finite element methods, respectively. A data-driven model is also developed using the wavelet packet transform to the displacement signals. The independent decompositions of the displacement signals are then correlated with both the dimensional error model and the turning chatter model. Interconnecting the dynamics-based model and the data-driven model contributes to a digital-twin prototype, which allows for in-process detection of the geometrical distortion and the onset of chatter on the part surface. Finally, two different machining cases were performed to verify the proposed methodology. The results show that the developed model consisting of the formulated deflection correlation and chatter indicator is capable of simultaneously evaluating and detecting the dimensional error prediction and the early-onset chatter. By comparison with the analytical modeling, the high fidelity digital twin using the finite element modeling could exhibit higher prediction accuracy. The proposed monitoring strategy could provide a pragmatic approach to online quality control for intelligent machining of flexible workpieces on the shop floor.},

Passive methods are used to characterize the loading on a feeder stepper in an FFF machine, forming a model that can identify early signs of filament-based failure with 85.65% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy.

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the sheet resistance of laser-induced graphitic carbon (LIGC) is crucial for optimizing process conditions and designing high-performance LIGC-based devices. However, identifying the most significant process parameter for predicting the sheet resistance of LIGC is challenging. In addition, training an accurate model with a small dataset remains a challenge. To address the first issue, a novel transformer encoder with a self-attention mechanism is introduced to determine the most and least significant process parameters affecting the sheet resistance of LIGC. To address the second issue, a contrastive learning method is developed to augment a small training dataset. Unlike conventional deep learning approaches that establish a direct relationship between process parameters and sheet resistance, the proposed method can learn the relationship between the difference in features extracted from process parameter settings and the difference in the corresponding sheet resistances. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed transformer encoder-enabled contrastive learning method accurately predicted the sheet resistance of LIGC and outperformed other machine learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the tool-tip dynamics is crucial for evaluating the performance in milling and essential for chatter prediction; obtaining and predicting tool-tip modes efficiently and accurately is thus essential, especially when the milling parameters or tool-holder assembly change. However, there is currently no such efficient and explainable method with high generalization ability for obtaining and predicting the tool-tip modes considering the above change. To address this issue, the stochastic subspace identification (SSI) method is initially used to acquire multiple operational modes more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods under varying milling parameters. Subsequently, machine learning (ML) models are trained to predict the above modes under varying spindle speeds and axial cutting depth. Moreover, when changes occur in the tool-holder assembly, a transfer learning (TL) model based on receptance coupling substructure analysis (RCSA) theory is proposed to re-establish the modes prediction model efficiently with the above data. The TL model has a modal frequency prediction error below 2% and a damping ratio prediction error below 10%, thereby demonstrating robust generalization capabilities. Finally, predicting milling stability with the above modes prediction model, which can provide a stability lobe diagram with higher accuracy than the traditional method, is introduced. In conclusion, the multiple operational modes are acquired more efficiently with the SSI method, and the ML model or TL model with RCSA theory is thus established efficiently when milling parameters or tool-holder assembly change. The obtained model is used for chatter prediction as follows and performs better in prediction accuracy.},

To enhance the partnership, probe card manufacturer is responsible for troubleshooting of the sold probe cards in short time as part of after-sales maintenance to enhance the productivity. In practice, maintenance engineers relied on domain knowledge for probe card maintenance. However, owing the continuously migration of advanced technologies for semiconductor manufacturing and exponentially increasing product complexity, probe card maintenance has become challenging and time-consuming. Most of the existing studies have not addressed the root cause analysis problem for identifying corrective actions for abnormal symptoms, nor considered the effectiveness of maintenance. The selection of appropriate maintenance actions is crucial in root cause analysis. To fill the gaps, this study integrates domain knowledge and data-driven approaches to develop a smart maintenance solution based on Bayesian inference for multi-label classification to derive effective suggestions to enhance after-sales service quality for probe cards. An empirical study was conducted in a leading probe card company for validation.

  abstract     = {Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is an important operation for surface modification of wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. Productivity and quality of wafers depends strongly on the efficiency of CMP and virtual metrology (VM) is a promising tool not only to facilitate wafer-to-wafer control but also to reduce cycle time. Development of VM tools for CMP is still not a reality due to the complexity of CMP and unavailability of critical process measurements such as slurry temperature and abrasive particle size distribution in real-time. To overcome these challenges, a novel hybrid modeling framework is proposed for creating a VM solution for CMP. Physics-based models are utilized for estimating slurry temperature and mean abrasive particle size (MAPS) from sensor data. They supplement other sensor data for developing soft sensors to predict slurry temperature, MAPS, and the material removal rate (MRR). This hybrid framework is tested with about 3000 sets of published industrial sensor data. Exploratory analysis indicated two distinct regimes of operation, low and high MRR, and a strong relationship of MRR with slurry temperature and MAPS. Several machine learning (ML) algorithms such as random forest, Lasso regression and support vector machine are explored and XGBoost is found to be the best amongst them. The optimum operating conditions are determined through model-based optimization using the hybrid modeling framework and particle swarm optimization. These results suggested CMP to be carried out at the smallest MAPS to maximize MRR. This framework would be useful for building a digital twin system of CMP.},

To address this issue, we introduce a novel interwoven network architecture that synergizes convolution and Transformer models. This integrated approach is specifically designed to surmount the dual challenges of classification and joint segmentation in wafer defects, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. Our research, grounded in real-world production line data from IC chip manufacturing, demonstrates that our network attains a segmentation accuracy of 83.15% and a classification accuracy of 96.88%. The proposed method for automatic defect information extraction is shown to be viable for industrial application. The merger of convolutional neural networks with Transformer models in this innovative architecture shows considerable promise for enhancing wafer defect analysis, thereby improving the precision of defect classification and segmentation in semiconductor manufacturing processes.},

However, the dearth of data in manufacturing is one of the biggest obstacles to realizing an intelligent defect detection system. This work presents a framework for bridging the data gap in manufacturing using the potential of synthetic datasets generated using the finite element method-based digital twin. The non-destructive technique under consideration is pulse infrared thermography. A large number of synthetic thermographic measurements were generated using 2D axisymmetric transient thermal simulations. The representativeness of synthetic data was thoroughly investigated at various steps of the framework, and the image segmentation model was trained separately on experimental and synthetic datasets. The study results reveal that when carefully rendered, synthetic datasets represent the experimental data well. When evaluated on real-world experimental samples, the segmentation model pre-trained on synthetic datasets generalizes well to the experimental samples. Furthermore, another advantage of synthetic datasets is the ease of labelling a large amount of data. Finally, the robustness assessment of the model was done on two new datasets: one where the complete experimental setup was changed, and the other was an open-source infrared thermography dataset},

This study contributes to this course through the introduction of an alternative predictive modelling strategy for injection molding defects. Through multi-stage design of experiments, Computer Aided Engineering simulations, and intelligent algorithms, the study developed a warpage and shrinkage defects predictive model based on processing parameters. In the factorial design of experiment stage, the mains effect sizes, interaction effect sizes, and ANOVA were used for process parameter screening. Next, a Taguchi L25 design was used for the generation of predictive model training data. Fuzzy logic models were then developed to predict warpage and shrinkage defects based on given process parameters and the predictive capability of triangular and Gaussian membership functions was investigated. A pattern search algorithm was utilized to tune the developed predictive models. The resulting predictive model had root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.04, standard error of regression (S) of 9.6, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 98.7% for shrinkage prediction. The respective model metrics for warpage prediction were 0.005, 1.2, and 96.3%. The triangular membership function model had lower RMSE indicating a higher predictive accuracy whereas the Gaussian membership function model had lower S indicating a higher model reliability. Tuning of the predictive models using a pattern search algorithm reduced the RMSE and S and increased the models’ R2. The approach can be adopted by plastic processing industries to predict and control such (and related) defects for quality products and maximum productivity.},

However, a technical challenge lies in the lack of standard process maps as it currently relies on an expensive trial and error approach. In this study, five types of surrogate models for classification analysis (i.e., naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian process classification) were constructed and compared to efficiently unlock the relations between five process parameters (i.e., laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, spot diameter, and effective laser energy) and wick manufacturability. The models were trained using data from a total of 187 AM wick manufacturability experiments. Using four process parameter (PP) model (five PP model without effective laser energy), the Gaussian process classification (GPC) showed the maximum median prediction accuracy (PA) of 93%, while it further improved to 99.7% using support vector machine (SVM) and five process parameter model. Also, the median PAs of the SVM and GPC remains above 98.5% with only 60% of the total experimental data using five PP model. The sensitivity analysis showed that the hatch spacing was the most sensitive parameter for the wick manufacturability using four PP model, while the effective laser energy is the most sensitive one using five PP model.

The EKG has been applied in manufacturing industry to empower intelligence manufacturing. But there are limitations of generic EKG in addressing manufacturing issues. Because in the manufacturing industry, there is not only text-type knowledge but also signals, images, videos, etc. In particular, some of the relations between entities/events of the knowledge are in the form of formulas, functions, and even trained artificial intelligence models. This kind of knowledge is called Functional Knowledge in this paper. The generic EKG is suitable for representing text-type knowledge but not Functional Knowledge. Thus, the research aims to present a new kind of EKG that has the ability to represent various types of knowledge, especially Functional Knowledge. In this regard, an intelligent dynamic Industrial Event Knowledge Graph (IEKG) is proposed. Firstly, Functional Relation, Functional Triple, and a knowledge representation model based on property graphs for the schema layer of IEKG are proposed for representing Functional Knowledge. Secondly, a dynamic construction method of the instance layer of IEKG based on the event triggering mechanism is proposed, which enables the IEKG to be constructed dynamically with the production operation. Third, the constructed IEKG is applied in production monitoring using a novel graph similarity-based process stability evaluation method. Finally, a web application encapsulating our theory was developed and applied on a kneading machine in a prebaked carbon anode factory. The result shows that our proposed method has the ability to represent Functional Knowledge. Compared to the existing EKG, it has a better and broader ability of knowledge representation. The application of process stability evaluation demonstrates the potential of IEKG in addressing manufacturing issues.},

Most of the research focused on the improvement of nesting strategies (NS) and EO algorithms, while the relationship between NSs and evolutionary optimization stages is the neglected crucial point. In this paper, a fidelity-adaptive evolution optimization (FAEO) method is proposed to speed up the optimization process by using different nesting strategies at the appropriate optimization stages. In FAEO methods, two switching methods are designed to convert NSs. The neighbourhood-elite evaluation (NEE) and staged-archive (S-A) methods are developed to accelerate individual internal assessment. The experimental results and relevant analysis of the cases from ESICUP by the combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and skyline-derived NSs prove the effectiveness, rapidity, and industrial value of the FAEO algorithm compared with the benchmark algorithms.},

Manufacturing Service Composition (MSC) is an essential technique that supports the optimal construction of value-added services. Evolutionary computation approaches are frequently employed to resolve MSC issues and have achieved great accomplishments. These evolutionary solvers, however, require massive computational resources for objective evaluation and face cold-start problem. Recent advances in transfer learning field provide a new means for extracting knowledge across tasks to enhance the problem-solving efficiency. In light of above, this article is intended to devise a Multi-task Transfer Evolutionary Search (MTES) approach for MSC considering the occurrence of multiple user requests, with which each corresponds to a MSC task, optimization experiences from constructing distinct MSC tasks can be learned to promote the search of arrival tasks at hand jointly. The MTES can adapt the helper task selection and the intensity of knowledge transfer from a synergistic perspective, such that it can be suitable for many-task scenario. Numerical studies on different scales of MSC tasks demonstrate that, compared to the prevalent peers, our proposed MTES needs far less computational resources to achieve the convergence performance and the solution quality is higher, which verifies the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach for dealing with MSC problem.},

  abstract     = {The wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process is gaining popularity in industrial production due to its ability to manufacture large, customized, and complex shapes. However, because of the lack of quality assurance standards in this field, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are required to evaluate the quality of the produced parts. Radiography testing is a good candidate for that purpose, but the surface roughness of the product being tested can lead to difficulties in the interpretation of the obtained image, which could result in unseen defects. To overcome this challenge, we propose, in this study, a novel approach for improving defect detectability using 3D laser scanning and an appropriate mathematical formulation. We first tested this approach on a weld bead and then verified it on different healthy and defective WAAM parts. In all cases, the created defects were successfully detected. Besides, the effect of surface roughness was significantly reduced. A special attention should, however, be paid to the scattering noise in the radiographic image.},

  abstract     = {Visual-based defect detection is a crucial but challenging task in industrial quality control. Most mainstream methods rely on large amounts of existing or related domain data as auxiliary information. However, in actual industrial production, there are often multi-batch, low-volume manufacturing scenarios with rapidly changing task demands, making it difficult to obtain sufficient and diverse defect data. This paper proposes a parallel solution that uses a human–machine knowledge hybrid augmentation method to help the model extract unknown important features. Specifically, by incorporating experts&#39; knowledge of abnormality to create data with rich features, positions, sizes, and backgrounds, we can quickly accumulate an amount of data from scratch and provide it to the model as prior knowledge for few-data learning. The proposed method was evaluated on the magnetic tile dataset and achieved F1-scores of 60.73%, 70.82%, 77.09%, and 82.81% when using 2, 5, 10, and 15 training images, respectively. Compared to the traditional augmentation method&#39;s F1-score of 64.59%, the proposed method achieved an 18.22% increase in the best result, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in few-data industrial defect detection.},

The complexity of the process makes it inherently unstable, which can cause various defects, resulting in poor geometric accuracy and material properties. This demands for in-process monitoring and control mechanisms to industrialize the technology. In this work, process monitoring algorithms based on welding camera image analysis are presented. A neural network for semantic segmentation of the welding wire is used to monitor the working distance as well as the horizontal position of the wire during welding and classic image processing techniques are applied to capture spatter formation. Using these algorithms, the process stability is evaluated in real time and the analysis results enable the direction independent closed-loop-control of the manufacturing process. This significantly improves geometric fidelity as well as mechanical properties of the fabricated part and allows the automated production of parts with complex deposition paths including weld bead crossings, curvatures and overhang structures.},

  abstract     = {Modern technologies and the emergent Industry 4.0 paradigm have empowered the emergence of flexible production systems suitable to cope with custom product demands, typical in this era of competitive marketplaces. However, production flexibility claims periodic changes in the setup of production facilities. The level of flexibility of a production process increases as the reconfiguration capacity of its facilities increases. Nevertheless, doing that efficiently requires accurate coordination between productive resources, task planning, and decision-making systems aiming to maximize value for the client, minimizing non-added-value production tasks, and continuous process improvement. In a manufacturing system, material handling within manufacturing facilities is one of the major non-value-added tasks strongly affected by changes in plant floor layouts and demands for producing customized products. This work proposes a metaheuristic simulation-based optimization methodology to address the material handling problem in dynamic environments. Our proposed approach integrates optimization, discrete event simulation, and artificial intelligence methods. Our proposed optimization algorithm is mainly based on the ideas of the novel population-based optimization algorithm called Q-learning embedded Sine Cosine Algorithm, inspired by the Sine Cosine Algorithm. Unlike those, our proposed approach can deal with discrete optimization problems. It includes in its formulation a reinforcement learning embedded algorithm for the self-learning of the parameters of the metaheuristic optimization algorithm, and discrete event simulation is used for simulating the shop floor operations. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through an exhaustive analysis of simple to complex cases. In addition, a comparison is made with other comparable optimization methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Thermal error modeling (TEM) is essential for preserving machining accuracy and enhancing the reliability of electric spindle systems. However, the major challenges in TEM lie in the limited or unavailable labeled thermal error samples due to the difficulties in data acquisition, as well as the problem of large distribution discrepancy between training and testing data under variable working conditions. Recently, digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising tool in intelligent manufacturing. The DT model of the electric spindle can simulate system thermal behavior data that closely resembles real working conditions, providing a remarkable opportunity for TEM. Additionally, deep transfer learning (DTL) leverages existing knowledge to minimize data distribution discrepancies, bridging the gap between virtual and real data, and ultimately enhancing the generalization and adaptation ability of the model. Thus, this paper proposes a DT-assisted DTL method for TEM of electric spindles. Firstly, the DT model for the electric spindle is built by establishing a high-fidelity simulation model based on the physical system’s thermal behavior mechanism. Furthermore, temperature field information for all interested working conditions can be simulated from the constructed DT model. Subsequently, the distance-guided domain adversarial network (DGDAN) is developed, with data generated by the DT model constructed as the training data in the source domain, while partially collected data from the physical system is used as the target domain for training. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study is conducted using datasets from both the DT model and the physical system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully achieves TEM in scenarios where the thermal error data is limited or unavailable from the physical system, and the goodness of fit is higher than the state-of-the-art methods by 11.73%.},

  abstract     = {Modern manufacturing paradigms have incorporated Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) to implement data-driven methods for fault detection, failure prediction, and assessment of system health. The maintenance operation has similarly benefitted from these advancements, and predictive maintenance is now being used across the industry. Despite these developments, most of the approaches in maintenance rely on numerical data from sensors and field devices for any sort of analysis. Text data from Maintenance Work Orders (MWOs) contain some of the most crucial information pertaining to the functioning of systems and components, but are still regarded as ‘black holes’, i.e., they store valuable data without being used in decision-making. The analysis of this data can help save time and costs in maintenance. While Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been very successful in understanding and examining text data from non-technical sources, progress in the analysis of technical text data has been limited. Non-technical text data are usually structured and consist of standardized vocabularies allowing the use of out-of-the-box language processing methods in their analysis. On the other hand, records from MWOs are often semi-structured or unstructured; and consist of complicated terminologies, technical jargon, and industry-specific abbreviations. Deploying traditional NLP to such data can result in an imprecise and flawed analysis which can be very costly. Owing to these challenges, we propose a Technical Language Processing (TLP) framework for PHM. To illustrate its capabilities, we use text data from MWOs of aircraft to address two scenarios. First, we predict corrective actions for new maintenance problems by comparing them with existing problems using syntactic and semantic textual similarity matching and evaluate the results with cosine similarity scores. In the second scenario, we identify and extract the most dominant topics and salient terms from the data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using the results, we are able to successfully link maintenance problems to standardized maintenance codes used in the aviation industry.},

It is critical to manage the machining conditions to maintain the desired properties of the final product. Chip morphology and chip control are crucial factors to be monitored. In particular, the selection of an appropriate feed has one of the most significant effects. On the other hand, machine learning is an advanced approach that is continuously evolving and helping many industries. Moreover, mobile applications with learning models have been deployed in the field, recently. Taking these motivations into account, in this study, we propose a practical mobile application that includes an embedded learning model to provide chip classification based on chip morphology. For this purpose, a dataset of chips with different morphological properties is obtained and manually labeled according to ISO 3685 standards by using 20 different feeds on AISI 4140 material. Accordingly, TensorFlow Lite is used to train a learning model, and the model is embedded into a real-time Android mobile application. Eventually, the final software is evaluated through experiments conducted on the dataset and in the field, respectively. According to the evaluation results, it can be stated that the learning model is able to predict chip morphology with a test accuracy of 85.4%. Moreover, the findings obtained from the real-time mobile application satisfy the success rate by practical usage. As a result, it can be concluded that such attempts can be utilized in the turning process to adjust the relevant feed conditions.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal predictive learning is a deep learning method that generates future frames from historical frames in a self-supervised manner. Existing studies face the challenges in capturing long-term dependencies and producing accurate predictions over extended time horizons. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a nested attention module as a special attention mechanism to capture spatiotemporal correlations of input historical frames. Nested attention module decomposes temporal attention into inter-frame channel attention and spatiotemporal attention and uses a nested attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal dependencies, which improves the model’s performance and generalization ability. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting in models, a new regularization method is proposed which considers both the intra-frame spatial error and the inter-frame temporal evolution error of sequence frames, and enhances the robustness of the reinforcement learning model to dropout operations. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four baseline datasets, including moving MNIST handwritten digit dataset, human 3.6 million dataset, sea surface temperature dataset, and karlsruhe institute of technology and Toyota technological institute dataset. Extended experiments demonstrate the generalization and extensibility of nested attention module on real-world datasets. A dramatic 31.7% mean squared error/26.9% mean absolute error reduction is achieved when predicting 10 frames on moving MNIST. Our proposed model provides a new baseline for future research in spatiotemporal predictive learning tasks.},

  abstract     = {The automated defect inspection (ADI) of aluminum strip surfaces encounters several issues in the practical production process, such as the challenge of achieving precise defect boundary identification and the high demands for model volume and real-time inference. To solve these problems, the inference process of Input-Conv-BN-ReLU-Output in every layer of the high-precision segmentation model U2Net is fully analyzed and a novel union channel pruning (UCP) algorithm based on the U2Net is designed to significantly simplify the model structure. The absolute values of the convolution weights in the channel are first added up as the first indicator. Then the expectation of the truncated Gaussian distribution that processed by the batch normalization (BN) layer and ReLU activation layer is calculated as the second indicator because it makes reasonable use of the scale factor, shift factor, and interval information. The two indicators are multiplied as the final evaluation indicator, which realizes the comprehensive consideration of the Input-Conv-BN-ReLU-Output in U2Net. Additionally, we collect the surface images of aluminum strips from the online inspection platform and create a new dataset with seven common defects. Experimental findings obtained on the dataset demonstrate that the UCP performs better than other network slimming approaches, especially at high pruning ratios. The U2Net with 62.5% of channels pruned by the UCP method surpasses other cutting-edge and lightweight segmentation models in segmentation accuracy and speed, which may serve as a valuable theoretical guidance for the automated online defect segmentation of aluminum strips on embedded devices.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel RGB-based 6D object pose tracking method that leverages temporal information. Our approach mainly involves building a network to predict the pose residual between two consecutive image frames. Given industrial objects with weak textures and complex shapes, we incorporate a cross-domain attention fusion module during the feature fusion phase, enabling the capture of pixel-level correspondences between different feature representations. This module enhances robustness to illumination variations and occlusion challenges. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective pose regression module, referred to as the embedded refinement module, which considers the deviation of previous pose estimations. This module mitigates the cumulative pose estimation deviation due to large movements to some extent. We conduct comparative experiments on the YCB dataset, Fast-YCB dataset and a customized dataset specifically designed for the manipulation of industrial parts by a robotic arm.

By applying this, it is possible to automatically derive the optimal layout design considering limited resources and physical constraints.
