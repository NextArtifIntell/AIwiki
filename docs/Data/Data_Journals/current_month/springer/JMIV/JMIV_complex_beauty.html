  abstract     = {Estimating accurate high-dimensional transformations remains very challenging, especially in a clinical setting. In this paper, we introduce a multiscale parameterization of deformations to enhance registration and atlas estimation in the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping framework. Using the Haar wavelet transform, a multiscale representation of the initial velocity fields is computed to optimize transformations in a coarse-to-fine fashion. This additional layer of spatial regularization does not modify the underlying model of deformations. As such, it preserves the original kernel Hilbert space structure of the velocity fields, enabling the algorithm to perform efficient gradient descent. Numerical experiments on several datasets, including abnormal fetal brain images, show that compared to the original algorithm, the coarse-to-fine strategy reaches higher performance and yields template images that preserve important details while avoiding unrealistic features. This highly versatile strategy can easily be applied to other mathematical frameworks for almost no additional computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Concerning the perspective 3-point (P3P) problem, Grunert’s system of three quadratic equations has a repeated solution if and only if the cubic polynomial introduced by Finsterwalder has a repeated root. This polynomial is here shown to be obtainable from a particularly simple cubic polynomial with complex coefficients via a simple Möbius transformation. This provides surprising geometric insight into the P3P problem. In particular, (1) the discriminant of Finsterwalder’s polynomial can be written using the formula for the standard deltoid curve, and (2) this discriminant, when regarded as a function of camera position, vanishes on a surface that approaches a deltoid shape when the camera is moved infinitely far from the control points in a direction perpendicular to the control points plane (the “limit case&quot;). These two facts have been previously reported, but obscure reasoning was required to establish them. In contrast, the present article uses the newly discovered cubic polynomial to easily produce the first fact, which then provides a basis for better understanding the second fact. Also presented are quartic polynomials whose real roots are the P3P solution point coordinates. A detailed geometric description of the P3P solution points in the “limit case&quot; is also supplied.},

In this article, we focus on Euclidean equivariant PDE-G-CNNs where the feature maps are two-dimensional throughout. We call this variant of the framework a PDE-CNN. From a machine learning perspective, we list several practically desirable axioms and derive from these which PDEs should be used in a PDE-CNN, this being our main contribution. Our approach to geometric learning via PDEs is inspired by the axioms of scale-space theory, which we generalize by introducing semifield-valued signals. Our theory reveals new PDEs that can be used in PDE-CNNs and we experimentally examine what impact these have on the accuracy of PDE-CNNs. We also confirm for small networks that PDE-CNNs offer fewer parameters, increased accuracy, and better data efficiency when compared to CNNs.},

Motivated by the success of multiscale hierarchical decomposition methods (MHDM) in image processing, we adapt a variety of both classical and new multiplicative noise removing models to the MHDM form. On the basis of previous work, we further present a tight and a refined version of the corresponding multiplicative MHDM. We discuss existence and uniqueness of solutions for the proposed models and, additionally, provide convergence properties. Moreover, we present a discrepancy principle stopping criterion which prevents recovering excess noise in the multiscale reconstruction. Through comprehensive numerical experiments and comparisons, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the validity of all proposed models for denoising and deblurring images degraded by multiplicative noise. By construction, these multiplicative multiscale hierarchical decomposition methods have the added benefit of recovering many scales of an image, which can provide features of interest beyond image denoising.},

  abstract     = {Defining consistent calculus frameworks on discrete meshes is useful for processing the geometry of meshes or model numerical simulations and variational problems onto them. However, digital surfaces (boundary of voxels) cannot benefit directly from the classical mesh calculus frameworks, since their vertex and face geometry is too poor to capture the geometry of the underlying smooth Euclidean surface well enough. This paper proposes three new calculus frameworks dedicated to digital surfaces, which exploit a corrected normal field, in a manner similar to the recent digital calculus of Coeurjolly and Lachaud (IAPR second international conference on discrete geometry and mathematical morphology, Springer, Berlin 2022). First, we build a corrected interpolated calculus by defining inner products with position and normal interpolation in the Grassmannian. Second, we present a corrected finite element method which adapts the standard Finite Element Method with a corrected metric per element. Third, we present a corrected virtual refinement method adapting the method of Bunge et al. (Comput Graph Forum 39(2):303–313, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13931 ). Experiments show that these digital calculus frameworks seem to converge toward the continuous calculus, offer a valid alternative to classical mesh calculus, and induce effective tools for digital surface processing tasks. We then use these corrected Laplace–Beltrami operators in order to build a regularization method for digital surface, using geometric information given by discrete normal and curvature estimators.},

  abstract     = {The classical problem of discrete structure recognition is revisited in this paper. We focus on pieces of naive lines and, more generally, naive arithmetic hyperplanes, and present a new approach to recognising these discrete structures based on the Stern–Brocot tree. The algorithm for pieces of lines in dimension 2 proposes an alternative method to the state of the art, retaining linear complexity and incrementality for the segments. While most of the concepts can be generalised to planes in dimension 3 and hyperplanes in higher dimensions, certain points in the management of the descent in the Stern–Brocot tree merit further study. The proposed algorithm calculates separating chords characterising the membership of planes to cones generated by the branch of the Stern–Brocot tree. This generalisation shows the close link between arithmetic hyperplanes and the generalised Stern–Brocot tree and opens up interesting prospects for recognising pieces of arithmetic hyperplanes. Finally, we propose a geometric interpretation of separating chords and an interpretation of plane probing algorithms in the Stern–Brocot tree, showing both the links and the differences with our approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop the notion of a Morse sequence, offering an alternative approach to discrete Morse theory that is both simple and effective. A Morse sequence on a finite simplicial complex consists solely of two elementary operations: expansions (the inverse of collapses) and fillings (the inverse of perforations). Alternatively, a Morse sequence can be constructed using only collapses and perforations, providing a dual perspective. Such sequences serve as another representation of the gradient vector field of an arbitrary discrete Morse function. To each Morse sequence, we associate a reference map and an extension map. The reference map assigns a set of critical simplices to each simplex in the complex, while the extension map assigns a set of simplices to each critical simplex. By considering the boundary of each critical simplex, these maps yield a chain complex that corresponds exactly to the Morse complex. We demonstrate that, when restricted to homology, the extension map is the inverse of the reference map. Furthermore, these maps enable a direct derivation of the isomorphism theorem, which establishes the equivalence between the homology of a given object and that of its Morse complex. Finally, we introduce the notion of an extension complex, defined exclusively in terms of extension maps. We prove that this concept is equivalent to the classical flow complex.},

In [6], the authors define an embedding of the $$\textit{m}$$ -dimensional Kendall shape space into an $$\mathbb {R}^{\textit{N}}$$ space, from which kernel methods are introduced in the Kendall shape space. In this paper, we significantly simplify this result by achieving an embedding of the Kendall shape space into a Euclidean space $$\mathbb {R}^{\textit{n}}$$ of much lower dimension $$\textit{n}$$ than $$\textit{N}$$ , greatly simplifying calculations and computational costs of applications. Additionally, we characterize the image of the Kendall shape space in $$\mathbb {R}^{\textit{n}}$$ , allowing us to define a new extrinsic mean of shapes in the Kendall shape space.},

Traditional BPH construction algorithms are limited by their requirement to load the data entirely into memory, making them impractical for processing large images whose processing exceeds the capacity of the computer’s main memory. To overcome this limitation, an algebraic framework was introduced, enabling the out-of-core computation of BPH leveraging three key operations: select, join, and insert. In this publication, we present two distinct calculi based on these operations: one designed for general spatial partitions and another optimized for causal partitioning. The second calculus is specifically tailored to meet out-of-core constraints, ensuring efficient processing of large-scale data. We provide detailed algorithms, including pseudo-code and complexity analysis, and conduct experimental comparisons between the two approaches.},

Because of the high variability of data and the difficulty of properly annotating changes, unsupervised methods dominate the field. Arguably one of the most critical issues to make them practical is to reduce their false alarm rate. In this work, we develop a non-semantic, method-agnostic, weakly supervised a-contrario validation process, based on high-dimensional statistical modeling of deep features using a Gaussian mixture model, that can reduce the number of false alarms of any change detection algorithm. We also raise the insufficiency of the conventionally used pixel-wise evaluation, as it fails to precisely capture the performance needs of most real applications. For this reason, we complement pixel-wise metrics with component-wise metrics and evaluate the impact of our approach at both pixel and object levels, on six methods and several sequences from different datasets. Our experimental results reveal that the a-contrario theory can be applied to a statistical model of the background of a scene and largely reduce the number of false positives at both pixel and component levels.},
