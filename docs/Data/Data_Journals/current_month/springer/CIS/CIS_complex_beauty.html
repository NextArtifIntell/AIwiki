  abstract     = {Vehicle routing is a critical issue in the logistics and distribution industry. In practical applications, optimizing vehicle capacity allocation can significantly improve route optimization performance and service coverage. However, solving this problem remains challenging due to the complex constraints involved. Therefore, to address this real-world challenge, a novel intelligent optimization method, multi-objective capacity adjustment ant colony optimization algorithm (MCAACO), is proposed, which integrates advanced multi-objective optimization strategies, including capacity adjustment operators and crossover operators. Combined with pheromone updating and Pareto front-end optimization, the method effectively resolves the conflict between vehicle capacity constraints and multi-objective optimization. To further enhance the algorithm’s performance, dynamic pheromone updating mechanisms and elite individual retention strategies are proposed. Additionally, an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy is designed to balance global search and local exploitation capabilities. Through a series of experiments, it is demonstrated that compared to multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), and multi-objective sparrow search algorithm (MOSSA), the proposed MCAACO significantly reduces travel paths by an average of 3.05% and increases vehicle service coverage by an average of 3.2%, while satisfying vehicle capacity constraints. Experimental indicators demonstrate that the breakthrough algorithm significantly addresses the issues of high costs and low efficiency prevalent in the practical logistics distribution industry.},

  abstract     = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are widely used for transportation in flexible job shop (FJS) systems, and their transportation task scheduling has the same substantial impact on production efficiency as machine scheduling does. However, traditional FJS scheduling methods often prioritize job sequencing and machine selection while ignoring the impact of AGV transportation, resulting in suboptimal scheduling solutions and even difficulties in implementation. To address this issue, this paper formulates a cooperative scheduling model by introducing the AGV scheduling problem into the classical FJS scheduling problem, abbreviated as the FJS-AGV problem, with the objective of minimizing the makespan. With respect to the FJS-AGV problem, a heuristic-assisted deep Q-network (HA-DQN) algorithm is proposed, which leverages heuristic rules to enable the decision agent to perform multiple actions at each decision point, which includes determining the responses to the following questions: Which operation should be processed next? On which machine? By which AGV? This decision mechanism enables the agent to make more informed decisions, leading to improved performance and resource allocation in the FJS-AGV system. The practicability of the proposed FJS-AGV model and the efficiency of the HA-DQN algorithm in solving the FJS-AGV problem are verified through various international benchmarks. Specifically, when solving instances in a large benchmark, the HA-DQN algorithm yields a significant 12.63% reduction in makespan compared with that when traditional heuristics are employed.},

Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) have achieved great success in this task due to their powerful ability of modeling multivariate relationships. However, most existing methods employ shallow networks with only two layers, resulting in restricted node information transfer range and limited sensing field. In this paper, we propose a self-attention based graph transformation learning (AT-GTL) method to solve this problem. AT-GTL uses a global self-attention graph pooling (GATP) module to aggregate all node features to obtain global features. Then, a graph transformation learning pipeline is constructed based on neural transformation learning, and a triplet contrastive loss (TCL) is constructed to optimize the global feature extraction networks using potential features from multi-viewpoints. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively aggregate global graph features and detect anomalies, providing a new transformation learning solution for multivariate time series anomaly detection.},

The proposed multiobjective evolutionary network optimization with denoising strategy (MENO-D) demonstrated exceptional performance in various experiments. On a water quality prediction dataset, the MENO-D-trained softsensor model achieved the lowest prediction error under 10% and 20% noise interference.

  abstract     = {Imaging examinations are integral to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, the intricate nature of medical images frequently necessitates that physicians follow time-consuming and potentially fallible diagnostic procedures. In response to these challenges, deep learning-based image segmentation technology has emerged as a potent instrument for aiding physicians in navigating diagnostic complexities by extracting pivotal information from extensive sets of medical images. Nonetheless, the majority of existing models prioritize overall high accuracy, often overlooking the sensitivity to local salient features and the precision of segmentation boundaries. This oversight limits the full realization of the practical utility of deep learning models in clinical settings. This study introduces a novel pathological image segmentation method, termed TransRNetFuse, which incorporates stepwise feature aggregation and a residual fully convolutional network architecture. The objective of this method is to address the issues associated with the extraction of local key features and the accurate delineation of boundaries in medical image segmentation. The proposed model achieves enhanced overall performance by merging a fully convolutional network branch with a Transformer branch and utilizing residual blocks along with dense U-net skip connections. It prevents attentional dispersion by emphasizing local features, and further employs an automatic augmentation strategy to identify the optimal data augmentation scheme, which is particularly advantageous for small-sample datasets. Furthermore, this paper introduces an edge enhancement loss function to enhance the model&#39;s sensitivity to tumor boundaries. A dataset comprising 2164 pathological images, provided by Hunan Medical University General Hospital, was utilized for model training. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques, such as MedT, in terms of both accuracy and edge precision, thereby demonstrating its significant potential for application in the medical field.

This paper proposes a synthesis method for MZs, enabling the integration of multi-source information while considering both uncertainty and reliability. By leveraging a hidden probability model, we extend MZs into multi-dimensional Z+-numbers, enhancing their expressiveness in handling uncertainty. Furthermore, we define utility functions based on MZs and develop a multi-attribute group decision-making framework tailored for network defense. This approach offers a novel perspective for designing strategies against highly adaptive and covert cyberattacks. The proposed method is validated through a case study on the network security assessment of an intelligent logistics company. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making, highlighting the method’s advantages and broad potential in cyber defense. Beyond logistics, this integrated MZ-based decision framework provides an adaptable and intelligent tool for strengthening network security defenses.},

As a mature deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the double deep Q network has shown a significant optimization effect in intelligent traffic signal control research. In this paper, for the feature extraction defects of deep double Q network and the problem of underestimating the evaluation value of actions, we propose an Attention Mechanism Updated Weights Double Deep Q Network (AMUW–DDQN) based on the attention mechanism for the optimal control of traffic signals. The AMUW–DDQN method enhances the perceptual ability of the network by introducing the attention mechanism of Squeeze And Excitation Networks (SENet) to make the neural network pay attention to important state components automatically, and based on the idea that accurate representation of potentially optimal action values is better than the balanced representation of all the action values, it is considered that underestimated actions have a certain probability of being the optimal action and the loss function is weighted to optimize the action values. Simulation experiments were also conducted using the traffic flow data of the intersection of Fengze Street–Tian’an South Road, Fengze District, Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, China. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has the most significant final convergence effect for the same number of iterations, and has better performance in the evaluation indexes such as vehicle queue length and vehicle delay time.},

Although weakly supervised learning has reduced the need for manual annotations, many multiple instance learning (MIL) methods struggle to effectively capture crucial spatial relationships in histopathological images. Existing methods incorporating positional information often overlook nuanced spatial correlations or use positional encoding strategies that do not fully capture the unique spatial dynamics of pathology images. To address this issue, we propose a new framework named TMIL (Transformer-based Multiple Instance Learning Network with 2D positional encoding), which leverages multiple instance learning for weakly supervised classification of histopathological images. TMIL incorporates a 2D positional encoding module, based on the Transformer, to model positional information and explore correlations between instances. Furthermore, TMIL divides histopathological images into pseudo-bags and trains patch-level feature vectors with deep metric learning to enhance classification performance. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on a public colorectal adenoma dataset. The experimental results show that TMIL outperforms existing MIL methods, achieving an AUC of 97.28% and an ACC of 95.19%. These findings suggest that TMIL’s integration of deep metric learning and positional encoding offers a promising approach for improving the efficiency and accuracy of pathology image analysis in cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Few would argue that maximising the performance of the many flow networks (FNs) that operate for the benefit of our society and the economy is anything but essential. Through seeking to mitigate the risks posed by different asset failure modes, maintenance is critical to minimising disruptions and maximising resilience. Repairable flow network (RFN) optimisation and reliability centred maintenance (RCM) are both used to support asset related decisions in FNs but independently; meaning, attempts to maximise FN performance using RCM are likely to result in suboptimal outcomes. There is limited work bringing RFN optimisation and RCM together to support evaluating maintenance decisions in the context of holistic network level performance (measured in terms of profitability) and in a way that considers the complex structural and topological relationships that exist between process components, equipment components, and failure modes. Hence, this paper addresses this by developing the complex repairable flow network (CRFN) modelling framework with the goal of ensuring RFN optimisation integrates complex process and equipment (including failure modes) component topologies, such that it operates in alignment with the needs of RCM as part of maximising network flow in terms of gross profitability. This was done through the creation of a novel and transdisciplinary multi-layered network-based approach that integrates information from what were termed the facility, process, maintainable item, and failure mode levels. Furthermore, through running simulation experiments on an example CRFN, it is demonstrated that the CRFN modelling framework can be used to evaluate the impact different maintenance strategies have on maximising network flow in terms of gross profitability.},

  abstract     = {When addressing constrained multi-objective optimization problems, the presence of complex constraints often results in a non-connected feasible region, segmenting the Pareto front into multiple discrete segments. This fragmentation can significantly limit population diversity. To tackle this issue, we have designed two mechanisms aimed at preserving population diversity and have developed a constrained multi-objective co-evolutionary algorithm (DESCA) based on the framework of a two-population co-evolutionary algorithm. The proposed algorithm consists of two populations: a main population dedicated to exploring the constrained Pareto front and an auxiliary population tasked with exploring the unconstrained Pareto front. To sustain the diversity within both populations, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the genetic operator based on the observed states of the populations. Moreover, when the main population encounters stagnation, a regional mating mechanism is employed between the main population and the auxiliary population, accompanied by a relaxation of the constraints on the main population. Conversely, when the auxiliary population experiences stagnation, a diversity-first individual selection strategy is implemented; this strategy utilizes a regional distribution index to assess individual diversity and mitigates population stagnation by enhancing diversity. The performance of DESCA has been evaluated across 33 benchmark problems and 6 real-world problems. Experimental results demonstrate that DESCA exhibits strong competitiveness compared to seven other typical state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing aims to predict how learners will perform in future exercises on related concepts and to track changes in their knowledge state. Existing models have not fully considered the physical and mental fatigue that occurs in learners during prolonged learning tasks, which leads to reduced problem-solving ability and affects their learning efficiency and performance. This article proposes Attention-Centric Knowledge Tracing to address the above issues. This method combines the Grit theory to evaluate the learner’s fatigue state and explores the potential impact of learning tasks on the learner’s fatigue state through deep graph convolutional networks. In particular, this article employs a multilayer perceptual network with scaled dot-product attention to process information dynamically, focusing on the critical information the learner needs at a given moment and effectively incorporating it into the knowledge framework. This article compared the fourteen knowledge tracing models in the experiment to the two benchmark data sets. The results indicate that knowledge tracing in the center of attention outperforms the baseline model in predicting learners’ future responses.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the influence of factors such as the special optical characteristics of water bodies on the perceptual quality of generated images, this paper proposes the DifSG2-CCL model for reducing the special optical characteristics of water bodies and the DPL-SG2 model for introducing perceptual loss. Combining the ideas of cyclic consistency and style migration, this paper builds the Underwater Cycle Consistency Loss (U-CCL) module. The DifSG2-CCL model is based on the method of image reconstruction, which converts the underwater image into the style of the land image to reduce the influence of the water body factors. VGG16 is introduced as a perceptual loss into the DPL-SG2 to enhance the visual perception of the image by feature extraction with different layers and tonal weighting. Furthermore, in addition to the already disclosed SA dataset, a T dataset with a resolution of 256 × 256 in 9.366k sheets is provided in this paper. The experimental results show that DifSG2-CCL and DPL-SG2 can effectively enhance the perceptual quality of the images. The unique underwater image generation of DifSG2-CCL produces excellent results in qualitative analysis and reduces its FID value to 8.97. DPL-SG2 is more outstanding in the training of T dataset, and its FID value is reduced to 5.39. Therefore, the U-CCL and VGG16 can be applied as an innovative approach to enhance visual perception of underwater images. The experimental code with pre-trained models will be published shortly at https://github.com/yff0428/DPL-SG2/tree/main .},

  abstract     = {Decomposition is an effective and popular strategy used by evolutionary algorithms to solve multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). It can reduce the difficulty of directly solving MOPs, increase the diversity of the obtained solutions, and facilitate parallel computing. However, with the increase of the number of decision variables, the performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) often deteriorates sharply. The advantages of the decomposition strategy are not fully exploited when solving such large-scale MOPs (LSMOPs). To this end, this paper proposes a parallel MOEA based on two-space decomposition (TSD) to solve LSMOPs. The main idea of the algorithm is to decompose the objective space and decision space into multiple subspaces, each of which is expected to contain some complete Pareto-optimal solutions, and then use multiple populations to conduct parallel searches in these subspaces. Specifically, the objective space decomposition approach adopts the traditional reference vector-based method, whereas the decision space decomposition approach adopts the proposed method based on a diversity design subspace (DDS). The algorithm uses a message passing interface (MPI) to implement its parallel environment. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDS-based method. Compared with the state-of-the-art MOEAs in solving various benchmark and real-world problems, the proposed algorithm exhibits advantages in terms of general performance and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis (SA) is a vital research direction in natural language processing (NLP). Compared with the widely-concerned explicit sentiment analysis, implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) is more challenging and rarely studied due to the lack of sentiment words. However, existing implicit sentiment analysis methods are hard to identify implicit sentiment without the support of commonsense and contextual background. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-enhanced framework that integrates external knowledge graphs and contextual information for implicit sentiment analysis. We draw an analogy between the word in the target sentence and the knowledge graph entities and propose a retrieving and selecting method to automatically extract helpful knowledge graph entity embedding for implicit sentiment analysis. By introducing external knowledge from the knowledge graph, the proposed approach can extend semantic of implicit sentiment expressions. Then, a knowledge fusion module based on dynamic Coattention has been designed to integrate the extracted helpful knowledge with the context representation, effectively enriching the semantic representation of texts. The experiments on two implicit sentiment analysis datasets and two explicit sentiment analysis datasets prove that our model can achieve better performances in text sentiment analysis by fully utilizing external commonsense knowledge and context information.},

  abstract     = {Auditing is facilitated by audit knowledge graphs, while the biggest challenge in constructing an audit knowledge graph is entity alignment. Entity alignment involves linking entity pairs with the same real-world identity and aims to integrate heterogeneous knowledge across different knowledge graphs. However, most existing works do not effectively combine both attribute and relation representations into a unified framework for entity alignment, which is essential to link entities within an audit knowledge graph accurately. In this study, we propose a knowledge graph-based entity alignment approach with multi-attribute and weighted-relation fusion (KG-Marfia) for intelligent auditing. Our proposed KG-Marfia first extracts entity representations by addressing the imbalance of attributes and relations, and then designs a stacked graph convolutional network as an encoder to fuse attribute and relation information, learning unified representations for entities. In particular, we adopt an SVM-based classifier for the alignment task in intelligent auditing. Experiments conducted on two public datasets, as well as three audit datasets, demonstrate that our KG-Marfia outperforms state-of-the-art entity alignment methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) is the important part in decision-making process, which has been used in many industries. Coordinating differing opinions and ultimately reaching group consensus in a group decision-making process has become an important area of research. This paper uses probabilistic uncertain linguistic term sets (PULTSs) to express the uncertainty of evaluation information, and proposes a group consensus reaching method based on the opinion dynamics model which exhaustively considers how decision-makers’ (DMs) viewpoints can influence each other and evolve over time in MCGDM environments. First, we gathers the group’s preference information regarding the alternatives and their stubbornness to peer influence. Next, an influence matrix is determined based on the authority index of the DMs, and a probabilistic uncertain linguistic Friedkin–Johnsen model (PUL-FJ) is constructed. Then, a group consensus reaching method based on the PUL-Friedkin-Johnsen model is proposed to address the feedback mechanism in the consensus-reaching process (CRP). Finally, we proposes a novel approach for ranking. To better achieve group decision-making, we constructs an improved PUL similarity measure that based on the Wasserstein distance. Additionally, this paper proposes a new approach for expert weight, resulting in a comprehensive expert weight that balances individual expertise of the different criteria and group consensus. In the end, an example is provided, and the method’s feasibility is validated through sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Path planning poses a complex optimization challenge essential for the safe operation and successful mission execution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Developing objectives, constraints, and decision-making processes for three-dimensional path planning involving multiple UAVs presents substantial challenges within the multi-objective optimization community. Traditional modeling approaches primarily aim to minimize path length and collision risks, often overlooking the need for a quantitative assessment of communication quality among UAVs. This neglect causes an inadequate representation of their true cooperative capabilities. In addition, there is difficulty in achieving an optimal balance between convergence, diversity, and feasibility. Therefore, this study introduces a bi-objective, three-dimensional path planning model specifically designed for UAVs. This model features an objective function that quantitatively evaluates inter-UAV communication quality throughout their flights. To solve this problem, this study proposes the dual-population regularity evolution algorithm (DPREA), which incorporates an auto-switching regularity evolutionary reproduction operator known as autoRE. It conducts extensive experiments across six testing suites and three path-planning simulation cases to validate the effectiveness of DPREA. The simulation results showed that its performance in addressing constrained multi-objective problems is significantly superior or at least comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms in most instances.},
