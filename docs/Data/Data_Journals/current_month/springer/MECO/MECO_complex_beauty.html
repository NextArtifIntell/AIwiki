  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in feature extraction and pattern recognition in areas like image classification and speech processing. However, their application in the financial sector has been limited due to the complexity, high dimensionality, and temporal nature of financial data, as well as the need for model interpretability. This study, based on CNN technology, proposes a Reordering-Enhanced Grad-CAM algorithm to improve model interpretability and reliability, offering transparent and dependable tools for financial decision-making. The innovation of this study lies in two key aspects: firstly, it replaces the traditional manual variable selection approach with automatic feature extraction and fusion using CNNs, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in handling large-scale financial data. Secondly, we propose a novel reordering-based iterative algorithm that adapts Grad-CAM, originally designed for image classification, to multi-source financial time series data, treating sliding window data segments as pseudo-images to improve interpretability and identify critical features. Using data from Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares (1990–2020), the Reordering-Enhanced Grad-CAM technique generated heatmaps that identified key predictive indicators, leading to improved model performance. Robustness analysis demonstrated that over 70% of important variables were consistently identified, with some models reaching up to 100%, confirming the reliability and stability of our method in financial distress prediction.},

  abstract     = {The development of multimodal technologies has enabled the simultaneous measurement of various cellular modalities, such as chromatin accessibility (ATAC), gene expression (GEX), and surface protein abundance in single cells. However, the lack of multimodal datasets requires the development of robust algorithms that can translate data between different modalities. In this study, we present AIM, a framework for accurate and interpretive multimodal translation, specifically designed for the conversion of ATAC data into GEX profiles. AIM introduces a novel two-tier modeling architecture. The upper tier captures the global relationships between ATAC and GEX, generating an initial estimate of gene expression. The lower tier performs a finer-grained analysis by modeling inter-chromosomal interactions to refine the generated GEX representation. This modular structure enhances both the accuracy and adaptability of AIM. Additionally, an integrated attention mechanism provides interpretability by highlighting critical chromatin regions influencing specific gene expressions. Our experimental results demonstrate that AIM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a per-chromosome RMSE of 0.2206, outperforming existing approaches (0.2232). Furthermore, the attention maps generated by AIM offer a pathway analysis capability, uncovering biologically significant gene-gene interactions such as ARHGAP24-ARAP2 and SYK-PAX5. These findings validate AIM’s effectiveness not only as a data translation tool but also as a platform for deriving mechanistic insights into gene regulatory dynamics.},

  abstract     = {As an effective evolutionary computation algorithm, genetic programming (GP) can be designed as effective classifiers due to its flexible representation method. However, the classification performance of GP classifiers can be degraded due to imbalanced data and weak generalization ability. Precision-recall curve (PRC) has been proven to be an effective evaluation metric for dealing with imbalanced data. However, PRC may result in classifiers with the same PRC value being completely different classifiers. Moreover, controlling the complexity of GP individuals can improve their generalization ability. Therefore, in this paper, multi-objective GP (MOGP) is used to optimize three objectives including recall, precision and model complexity to reduce the impact of imbalanced data and improve the generalization of GP individuals. MOGP-based ensemble classifier construction methods can improve the generalization ability of classification models. However, this strategy needs to address the issues of how to improve the diversity of GP solutions and select optimal solutions from Pareto fronts. Therefore, in this paper, a bagging-based ensemble classifier construction method is proposed to improve the generalization of GP classifiers, which uses non-repeated sampling to generate multiple training subsets and runs MOGP multiple times on these training subsets to construct ensembles. Experiments on ten datasets show that our MOGP-based classifier construction method can achieve better classification performance than single-objective GP classifier construction methods, and our bagging-based ensemble classifier construction methods can further improve the classification performance compared to only using MOGP. Comparisons with six state-of-the-art GP classifier construction methods and six traditional machine learning algorithms show that our proposed approach can achieve significantly better classification performance in most cases.},

Service migration optimization is a complex problem posing significant challenges to conventional optimization methods. To tackle this problem, we develop a multifactorial memetic algorithm with adaptive auxiliary tasks or MFMA-AAT for short. MFMA-AAT solves the target service migration optimization problem and an adaptively selected auxiliary task simultaneously, where the auxiliary task is a simplified version of the target problem to guide the search towards promising regions faster via knowledge transfer. Multiple auxiliary tasks are pre-constructed based on the distribution of the mobile users and the one with the best improvement at each generation is selected for knowledge transfer. A community detection-based memetic operator is also introduced to accelerate the local convergence of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on test problems demonstrate that MFMA-AAT is more efficient than traditional service migration approaches and other state-of-the-art multifactorial evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating energy consumption into optimization has attracted increasing attention in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the integration of green, flexible, and dynamic manufacturing in literature remains underexplored. To this end, we focus on a dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (dFJSP) relevant to aerospace structural components. The following challenging issues are considered, such as processing route flexibility, limited machine and tool resources, transportation time, setup time, new job arrivals, machine breakdowns, and various machine processing speeds. To address this complex problem, a dual-level multi-objective algorithm based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (hereafter called DLNSGAII) is developed. The first level incorporates a dynamic diffusion-based strategy (D-DBS), which aims to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. This is achieved by quickly identifying high-quality solutions and discarding inferior ones while also ensuring ample computational resources allocated for exploration to avoid convergence on local optima. At the second level, a static convergence-based search strategy (S-CBS) is conducted to allocate resources according to the potential of solutions to achieve faster convergence. Additionally, to tackle the disruptions, two sets of rescheduling mechanisms have been designed: one includes five strategies for integrating new job arrivals, and another encompasses two strategies for responding to machine breakdowns. Furthermore, to enhance the search capabilities toward different objectives, two critical-path-based neighborhood structures have been incorporated. Utilizing hypervolume (HV) and inverted generational distance (IGD) as evaluation metrics, a comparative analysis of algorithmic performance was conducted. Among the 35 experiments, DLNSGAII exhibited superiority in 88.57% and 63% of the total experiments based on the HV and IGD metrics, respectively, emphasizing its advantages in terms of convergence and generalizability.},

However, the often-overlooked machine deterioration and maintenance during production result in a gap between scheduling plans and their practical applications. This study develops a model for green flexible job shop scheduling that considers machine deterioration and maintenance (GFJSP-DM) and proposes an enhanced two-stage memetic algorithm (ETMA) for its resolution. In the exploration stage, a heuristic hybrid initialization strategy is employed to generate diverse, high-quality individuals; in addition, a potential solution selection strategy aids the model-driven variable neighborhood local search to conduct a more detailed and effective exploration of the objective space. During the optimization stage, the algorithm presents a right-shift energy-saving strategy, designed based on inverse decoding, to evaluate four scenarios of delayed processing, further reducing the total energy consumption of the scheduling plans. Finally, extensive experimental results on test instances demonstrate that ETMA can effectively solve the GFJSP-DM problem.},
