  abstract     = {Indoor global localization is a critical aspect of autonomous robotic navigation. The increasing demand for service consumer-grade robots that require self-localization calls for research on methods that work with easy setup and low-cost sensors. In this paper, we propose a monocular camera-based localization of a motorized wheeled robot using a 2D floor plan as a reference map. The innovation of our method lies in using depth maps estimated from monocular images to compute the free space around the robot to be used as a measurement model in a particle filter strategy. The estimated free space density is compared to the free space density extracted from particles in the 2D floor plan. Due to the inherent imperfections of estimated depth maps, we also propose a new particle weighting approach to account for uncertainties in the depth estimation from the monocular camera. Experiments performed using real-world scenario sequences of images comparing the proposed method with RGB-D camera-based approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, even for imperfect depth maps obtained with the monocular depth estimation model.},

This study addresses critical gaps in UAV methods, including insufficient integration of human factors, operator variability, and the lack of systematic error analysis. To overcome these challenges, a novel approach combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with three core human factors models: the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop, the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), and the SHELL model. An online survey was conducted across diverse UAV operator groups to prioritize critical factors within each model. Additionally, real-time monitoring of heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and respiratory rate (RR) was conducted during UAV operations at various automation levels with different experience levels. Visualization through boxplots and percentage change matrices provided insights into operator stress and workload across automation levels. Integrating AHP findings and physiological data revealed significant differences in operator prioritization, highlighting the need for tailored AI-UAV strategies.

  abstract     = {A biomimetic robotic fish tailored for environmental monitoring and hydrographic exploration is examined in this study. Traditional fish robots, driven by tail oscillations, often grapple with constrained maneuverability in a single plane. This article focuses on mitigating these limitations through an exploration of the dynamic behavior of a bioinspired soft robotic fish. Unlike prior designs that employed similar actuators for the robot&#39;s tail, which either lacked the ability for out-of-plane motion or relied on other propulsion systems, the single propulsion design proposed in our model enables movement along three-dimensional trajectories, leading to improved efficiency and maneuverability due to tail oscillation dynamics. The proposed design integrates strategically positioned nozzles for out-of-plane movements, alongside parallel fluid channels on the tail&#39;s neutral plate. Actuation is achieved by manipulating the internal fluid pressure within these channels. To precisely model tail deflection, we introduce a novel method utilizing Euler–Bernoulli beam theory considering nonlinear characteristics arising from internal fluid stress. For instance, following the proposed approximate analytical method, we optimize the fluidic actuator, considering that the soft tail deformation increases by 65% as the channel shape transitions from a semicircular to a square cross-section. The comprehensive comparison with analytical nonlinear method, finite element method, and experimental-driven analytical method extends our approach as an effective tool in terms of accuracy and computation time, demonstrating the effectiveness of validation processes. This study unveils a simplified and robust fish robot design, outperforming traditional mechanisms in efficacy. Despite its simplicity, the proposed design delivers comparable performance, presenting an effective alternative for achieving requisite functionality in fish robots.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative and autonomous robots are increasingly important in meeting the demands of a faster and more cost-effective market. To ensure production efficiency and safety, robots must swiftly respond to the presence of human operators or other dynamic obstacles, avoiding potential collisions by quickly planning alternative paths. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based methods have shown great potential in path planning due to their rapid response capabilities. However, existing DRL-based planners lack a safety verification system to evaluate the feasibility of actions generated by neural models, and they cannot guarantee 100% collision-free paths. This paper presents an enhanced DRL-based path planning system incorporating a robust safety verification mechanism. This system predicts potential collisions and generates alternative collision-free paths as necessary. We analyzed the essential elements of trajectory planning using the DRL method and proposed improvements to accelerate planning speed. The results demonstrate that our planner consistently generates paths for typical reaching tasks with an average planning time of 12.1 ms, a notable improvement over traditional algorithms. Moreover, the paths produced by our method are nearly optimal, akin to those generated by Optimization-based algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Achieving precise landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) onto moving platforms, such as Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), is challenging, particularly in GPS-denied environments with dynamic disturbances. Conventional methods often rely on high-level waypoint navigation, extensive manual tuning, and expensive sensors. In this work, we propose an adaptive Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller optimization using a Neural Network-Particle Swarm Optimization (NN-PSO) algorithm. The algorithm dynamically tunes the PID controller, significantly reducing manual tuning effort, while relying solely on a low-cost camera and altitude sensor. The NN-PSO algorithm allows the UAV to land with an average error of 5 cm on static platforms and 10 cm on moving boats, based on multiple test flights. Our method also increases the maximum landing speed to 80.9% of the UAV’s top flight speed, a considerable improvement over existing systems. Our approach not only optimizes landing precision but also introduces techniques for ensuring soft landings, reducing oscillations, and preventing target misses. These enhancements make the method robust across varying flight altitudes and ASV speeds. Furthermore, this approach is applicable to a variety of GPS-denied scenarios, including rescue missions, package deliveries, and workspace inspections, without requiring costly equipment or extensive parameter tuning. Field experiments confirm the precision and stability of the proposed system, validating its performance in real-world conditions. [Video]},

  abstract     = {Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) promises to address the challenges of cooperation and competition among multiple agents, often involving safety-critical scenarios. However, realizing safe MARL remains a domain of limited progress. Current works extend single-agent safe learning approaches, employing shielding or backup policies to ensure safety satisfaction. Nevertheless, these approaches require good cooperation among multiple agents, and weakly distributed approaches with centralized shielding become infeasible when agents encounter complex situations such as non-cooperative agents and coordination failures. In this paper, we integrate the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory and present a Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework for Safe MARL. Our framework enables the learning of safety policies without the need for system model or shielding layer pre-training. Additionally, we enhance adaptability to varying levels of cooperation through a conservative approximation estimation of the value function. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating its ability to ensure safety while successfully achieving target tasks under cooperative conditions. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robustness in the face of non-cooperative behaviors induced by complex disturbance factors.},

  abstract     = {The performance of visual SLAM systems, in terms of both robustness and accuracy, can be affected by the presence of dynamic objects in dynamic environments. The utilization of learning-based dynamic SLAM algorithms introduces additional challenges, such as increased power consumption and computing requirements, particularly on mobile platforms. Millimeter wave radar has the capability to directly detect and measure the relative velocity between objects and the radar system. Therefore, this paper presents a novel SLAM system that aims to integrate millimeter wave radar point clouds into visual SLAM in a dynamic environment. First, a real-time dynamic cluster extraction method was developed using Doppler information obtained from 4D radar. It effectively distinguishes between static background points and dynamic points by employing the RANSAC algorithm. The dynamic radar points are subsequently grouped together to create dynamic clusters. Then, the clusters are projected onto the image and expand to produce dynamic masks, taking into account the distribution characteristics. Finally, dynamic masks are employed to eliminate dynamic keypoints during the camera pose estimation, allowing for the estimation to be based solely on static keypoints. Experiments conducted in various daily dynamic scenarios have demonstrated the robustness of RDynaSLAM in operating effectively within dynamic environments. In comparison to ORBSLAM3, RDynaSLAM exhibits a notable reduction in the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Absolute Pose Error (APE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE) in high dynamic environments. The method proposed in this paper has the capability to operate in real-time, without the need for GPU utilization.},

Furthermore, we compared the performance of our proposed method against conventional audio features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Gamma Tone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCCs), and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a remarkable accuracy of more than 97.7% for detection and 93.6% for classification, outperforming traditional audio features, which provide less than 80% accuracy for classification. This classification accuracy is crucial for designing a suitable system to manage drones. Additionally, we highlight the crucial advantage and efficiency of our proposed method for an unknown drone, which is particularly valuable in practical applications where the drone type is not known in advance.

In order to address the different action ranges of input signals in asymmetric dead-zone and saturation models, an adaptive backstepping control method related to asymmetric parameters is designed. A state-dependent upper bound of uncertainty is proposed instead of a constant upper bound. This avoids the problem of state constraints caused by the boundness of uncertainty before obtaining closed-loop characteristics. Certain positive results are emerged in this paper where an innovative adaptive control methodology is demonstrated to cope with system uncertainty. The proposed controller does not require a priori knowledge on the bound of them. By means of the Lyapunov stability theory, the close-loop system is proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded, the system states converge to a domain containing the origin, and the output tracks the reference signal commendably. Simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid aerial underwater vehicles (HAUVs) can operate in water and air and are qualified for complex missions on the air-water interfaces. The unique working conditions put forward higher requirements for the propulsion systems of the vehicles. Present HAUVs’ propulsion systems mostly use propellers, but normal aerial propellers work inefficiently underwater, constraining the underwater applications of HAUVs. Besides, in-depth research of the thrusters, especially during the water-crossing process, is limited. These are two major factors that affect the further development of HAUVs. This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility of the ducted fan propulsion system and design a ducted HAUV with better underwater working capacity. Ducted fans have promising applications on HAUVs for higher underwater efficiency, but the outer ducts can lead to significant thrust loss during the water-crossing process. A novel experimental platform is firstly developed with the capability of collecting dynamic data of the thruster during water- air transition. The new water-crossing strategy and overall design of the HAUV are proposed based on the test results. The ducted HAUV is supposed to accelerate underwater and rush out with a certain speed to overcome thrust loss. A centroid adjustment mechanism has also been designed to realize the underwater motion switch for better efficiency. A prototype named “Nezha-D” is fabricated, and outfield tests are conducted to verify the feasibility of the new design.},

Refueling on slow-moving Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) can significantly enhance UAVs’ operational endurance. This paper explores the computationally complex problem of cooperative UAV-UGV routing for vast area surveillance, considering speed and fuel constraints. It presents a sequential multi-agent planning framework aimed at achieving feasible and optimally satisfactory solutions. By considering the UAV fuel limit and utilizing a minimum set cover algorithm, we determine UGV refueling stops. This, in turn, facilitates UGV route planning as the first step. Through a task allocation technique and energy-constrained vehicle routing problem modeling with time windows (E-VRPTW), we then achieve the UAV route in the second step of the framework. The effectiveness of our multi-agent strategy is demonstrated through the implementation on 30 different task scenarios across three different scales. This work provides significant insight into the collaborative advantages of UAV-UGV systems and introduces heuristic approaches to bypass computational challenges and swiftly reach high-quality solutions.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative manipulators face challenges related to an inadequate distribution of external loads and a decrease in Dynamic Load Carrying Capacity (DLCC). Understanding the impact of optimal load distribution on power consumption, load carrying capacity, and gripper error is crucial. This paper presents the Intelligent Saturation Power Limit Load Distribution Algorithm (ISPLLDA), a novel method that achieves optimal external load distribution. ISPLLDA dynamically distributes the external load among manipulators based on torque-bearing capacity and actuator position. Additionally, nonlinearity in system dynamics introduces uncertainties, leading to incorrect DLCC evaluation, increased error, and higher actuator power consumption. To address this, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) accurately determines actuator saturation limits in the presence of uncertainty, enabling correct estimation of system dynamics and external disturbances. ISPLLDA ensures near-simultaneous saturation of all manipulators&#39; actuators, maximizing their capacity utilization. The proposed method is validated through simulations and experimental tests on cooperative manipulators. Results demonstrate a 17% increase in load-carrying capacity, as well as more than 35% improvement in error and torque indexes compared to the Lagrange multipliers method.},

  abstract     = {Ground transportation in dense urban environments has been facing challenges for many years (e.g., congestion and resilience) and the problem of congestion in urban environments will become more significant with the growth of populations and urbanization. In the past few years, the industry and the scientific communities have invested resources towards creating new ideas to improve urban transportation performance, such as the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept. Therefore, emergencies are considered a pivotal aspect to be managed appropriately to ensure safe UAM operations. Although normal operations represent a challenge nowadays (e.g., performance and social acceptance), emergencies are even more challenging due to the safety-critical risks. Thereupon, the main goal of this research is to propose the Landing Trajectory Planner for Emergencies in UAM Operations (LTPE), using Parallel Metaheuristics and considering autonomous vehicles’ presence. This trajectory planning method aims to design landing trajectories for multiple Electrical Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles in normal conditions and in emergencies. LTPE considers different eVTOL configurations in piloting systems (i.e., piloted vehicles, remotely piloted vehicles, and fully autonomous vehicles) as well as different vehicle priorities. Three landing modes are used for vehicles in emergency conditions: (i) land at the originally designed skyport; (ii) land at the nearest skyport; and (iii) land on the ground) and all metaheuristics include an early stopping feature. The experiments showed that LTPE can propose safe and efficient solutions for several scenarios with a short response time.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of performing aggressive manoeuvres by using multirotor vehicles that include passing through any specific point within the full state space of the vehicle. To this end, the design of optimal trajectories considers the dynamical model of the vehicles by numerically integrating it backwards in time, in the manifold where the dynamics evolve, and dividing the manoeuvres into three distinct phases to accommodate any combination of initial, desired, and final states. In the first phase, the vehicles fly from an initial to a launch configuration to achieve the necessary momenta to reach the desired one in the second phase. To ensure the feasibility of executing the second phase, the relation between snap and body torques is exploited by commanding the vehicles to track geodesic curves on SO(3) during the backwards integration. The vehicles are then driven to a final configuration in the third phase. Most existing solutions to execute aggressive and precise manoeuvres with these rotorcraft focus either on the attitude control problem, leaving the position in open-loop, or use different controllers for different sections of the manoeuvre. In this work, a single tracking controller is considered to validate the proposed trajectory planning strategy in a realistic simulation environment, which involves the PX4 firmware, and in a controlled experimental setup. The results demonstrate that accurate tracking of the designed trajectories enables the vehicles to perform 360-degree loops at great speed and manoeuvres that facilitate the exchange of a parcel between two multirotor vehicles during flight.},

For estimating external force, a new estimation method for joint angular velocity/acceleration is proposed. Furthermore, filter parameters are selected theoretically based on the leg control model, which achieves the optimal solution of the parameters. A control compensation strategy of the low-velocity zone of the motor is also implemented for optimizing the estimation of contact force. In contrast to the classic generalized momentum method, the proposed method allows high bandwidth estimation.

  abstract     = {To intercept a maneuvering target with a predetermined impact angle, a computational intelligence guidance law was proposed in this paper. Based on the theory of two-player zero-sum differential games, this problem is resolved efficiently by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation. The Nash equilibrium solution of HJI equation can be solved with a policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Instead of using the offline PI algorithm, an online PI algorithm is introduced, in which the disturbance and control policies can be updated simultaneously. It can be proved that the online PI algorithm is a replacement for Newton’s iterative algorithm, the convergence of which is ensured by Kantorovich’s theorem. In the scenario of missiles intercepting targets, an adaptive critic structure based on a neural network (NN) is proposed to implement the online PI algorithm. Only one critic NN approximator is used in the PI algorithm to calculate a value function and the approximate Nash equilibrium solution. It is not necessary to acquire the exact internal dynamics information of nonlinear systems on the basis of online data sampling. The effectiveness of the computational intelligence guidance law is proven by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {The advent of mass customization has precipitated a need within the industry for the implementation of collaborative robots, which facilitate the integration of human cognitive capabilities with the speed and repeatability of robots. This coupling, however, engenders a closer collaboration between the partners, thereby necessitating collective synergy to achieve optimal scheduling while circumventing musculoskeletal disorders. It is imperative to study and analyze the behavior of humans and robots in interaction, as the current paradigm strives to achieve an optimal interaction between the two partners with the objective of ensuring productivity, safety, cognitive ergonomics and preventing musculoskeletal disorders. However, human behavior is variable and can, on occasion, give rise to anomalies in the interaction. Consequently, it is imperative that the robot partner exhibits precise behavior, whether proactive or reactive. This paper puts forth a unified perspective on robot behavior when confronted with human abnormal behavior during interaction on the factory floor. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis employs the PRISMA methodology to examine the literature on human and robot behavior in human–robot interaction in an industrial context, with a particular focus on robot behavior when confronted with human abnormal behavior during interaction. A systematic search of nearly 2,609 papers yielded 133 for inclusion in this systematic review. In light of the findings presented in this review, it can be concluded that the selection of robot actions based on human behavior represents a novel area of research that requires further investigation, particularly with regard to proactive online behavioral approaches. Indeed, there is a vast array of robot behavior modalities in response to typical human behavior (e.g., command input). However, there is currently no prescribed robot reaction based on atypical human behavior (e.g., misplacement in the factory floor, repetition of tasks, etc.). This lack of definition complicates the deployment of such technology in the smart factory. Consequently, it is essential to define new decision strategies based, for instance, on artificial intelligence approaches.},

This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators. Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch’s t-test at a significance level of $$\alpha =0.05$$ , indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.},

Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm.

  abstract     = {In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made promising progress in several areas, such as control tasks and video games, by using simple, low-dimensional data. However, it struggles when it needs to process more complex, high-dimensional inputs like raw pixel images, offering results that are not as good as those that use information from laser sensors, as many robotics applications demand. This paper introduces a new technique called Contrastive Unsupervised Prioritized Representations in Reinforcement Learning (CUPRL) for mobile robotics. This innovative approach combines RL and Contrastive Learning to effectively handle high-dimensional observations, an area not fully explored. This is crucial for navigating complex environments, especially for hybrid robots, such as the Hybrid Unmanned Aerial-Underwater Vehicles (HUAUVs) that experience strong changes in light when moving between air and water. Our approach excels in taking important information from depth maps and RGB images during training, aiming to improve the ability of RL agents to navigate without a map in the context of HUAUVs. This field has much to be explored. Our tests in a robot simulator show that CUPRL, which uses learning from both RGB and depth images, performs better than current methods that rely only on pixel data. This is especially true for 3D navigation without maps, where we use only RGB images during tests. This proves that CUPRL could be useful for making decisions in HUAUVs. We believe our work not only offers improved solutions for navigation but also encourages further research into the use of high-dimensional data in RL, presenting a more efficient and adaptable method in complex environments compared to earlier strategies.},

Under-canopy navigation presents unique challenges, such as the need for a navigation system that can traverse diverse crop types, navigate despite sensory obstructions, and manage sensory noise effectively. Aiming to solve this problem in a scalable manner, we present a novel navigation method that uses a self-supervised neural network tailored for row-following in under-canopy plantations for mobile robots. Our method, termed CROW (Crop-ROW navigation), integrates perception, waypoint generator, and control components, and is capable of handling variations in luminosity, topology, types of plantations, and plant growth stages. By using a Deep Learning-based approach to interpret LiDAR scans, we convert the detected rows of crops into lines, establishing waypoints for the controller based on fundamental geometric principles. To address the computational complexity inherent in standard Model Predictive Controller solvers, we employ a Constrained Iterative Linear Quadratic approach. Our system has been validated in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating successful navigation through 115-meter corn rows with little to no intervention, i.e., requiring only $$3 \pm 3$$ interventions per row experiment.},

  abstract     = {Model-based stationing refers to the process of registering a set of measurements to a model. Specifically, in the surveying context, this refers to the process of determining the station, i.e., the position and orientation, of a total station given a user-provided building floor plan and a series of polar measurements. Traditional methods compute the station using a set of known control points. We propose an automatic workflow which uses a novel registration method that does not require any known control points in order to find the station with high accuracy. Our registration algorithm relies on angle and distance measurements only; therefore, it is not limited to modern image-assisted total stations. In addition, the proposed workflow comprises a modeling phase to deal with model inaccuracies and produces reliable and accurate results. Quantitative and qualitative tests on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate the performance and robustness of our automatic workflow and registration method.},

  abstract     = {Robots following humans is an efficient and practical feature, particularly in the context of service robotics. However, the majority of existing research has focused on the robot following the human from behind, with relatively little attention given to the robot operating in front of the human. This following-in-front approach, where the robot remains within the user’s field of view, is more reassuring and facilitates further human-robot interaction. Unlike traditional following methods, frontal following requires awareness of the user’s orientation and intentions. New challenges will arise in developing a tracker that can accurately estimate a user’s pose based on a knee height 2D LiDAR, especially when the legs frequently occlude each other. There is also a need to ensure the safety of the user while addressing how the robot can keep up with the user in situations where it falls behind. Our contribution lies in proposing a novel 2D LiDAR-based frontal human following method that accommodates various motion patterns of the target user. Specifically, inspired by human walking gait, we develop an accurate and robust human pose tracker that takes into account leg occlusion and the data association problem. We build a large workspace velocity field that enables a holonomic mobile robot to follow and come gradually and safely in front of the user regardless of their relative position. We evaluate the performance of our approach through a rich set of experimental scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving reliable frontal human following. Our studies suggest this approach has potential applications in warehouses, industrial factories or for visually impaired persons.},

  abstract     = {Practical deployments of exoskeletons can often be limited by cost, limiting access to their usage by those that would benefit from them. Minimising cost whilst not harming effectiveness is therefore desirable for exoskeleton development. For Control Systems governing assistive and rehabilitative exoskeletons that react to the wearer’s movements, there will inevitably be some delay between when their wearer intends to move and when the exoskeleton can assist with this movement. This can lead to situations where a user may be limited by their own assistive exoskeleton, reducing their ability to move freely. A potential solution to this is to provide a proactive method of control, where the most likely path of the wearer’s movement is predicted ahead of the wearer making the motion themselves. This can be used to give the user assistance immediately as they are walking, as well as potentially pre-emptively adjust their gait if they suffer from predictable gait deficiencies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Data Collection, Implementation, and Effectiveness of an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network dynamically predicting future movement based off of prior movement. These methods were developed to use off the shelf, Low-Cost Microcontrollers as to minimise their Financial, Weight, and Power Impact on an overall Low-Cost exoskeleton design, as well as to evaluate how effective such an implementation would be when compared to running such a Neural Network on a more powerful processor. The created model was capable of achieving similar accuracies to far more powerful models on High-Powered Laptops.},

  abstract     = {During the past few years, there has been a rise in novel fully actuated multirotor UAV configurations, each customised to perform a different task. These configurations must be optimised to extract their full potential for the different use cases. The main issue with existing optimisation methods is the computational cost required to produce a design when the optimisation includes both continuous and discrete variables, such as off-the-shelf components. We propose a hybrid optimisation method using continuous surrogate methods with localised parameter sweep. The continuous stage aims at finding the optimal value for the continuous design variables and reduces the search space for the discrete design variables. Empirical models for the off-the-shelf components are used to reduce the size of the continuous stage of the optimisation. The localised search method consists of a parameter sweep of the discrete design variables within a certain threshold of the optimal parameters from the first stage. Three case studies confirm the method’s capabilities with different configurations and optimisation setups, comparing optimality, success rate and computational cost. The optimal design from the hybrid method is consistent with the baseline methods used for comparison within each case study, with a minimum success rate of 30% while reducing cost by 98%. Compared to specialised discrete methods, the improvement in computational cost is inconsistent; however, it achieves a reduction of 99.3% with certain design requirements. A comparison to another hybrid method was also performed, with the proposed method maintaining its cost, optimality and success rate better than the SQP-DSS method when increasing method complexity.},

  abstract     = {Speed control of DC motors is essential for automated vehicles and four-wheel differential drive (4WD) cars, which are distinct by their high level of maneuverability. The PID controller is one of the most popular techniques for controlling speed, but tuning its parameters is challenging. This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm, the Moth-Flame Particle Swarm Optimization (MFPSO), which combines moth-flame optimization (MFO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address the slow convergence of MFO and the premature convergence of PSO. The MFPSO is deployed for real-time interactive tuning of the PID controller to control the speed of DC motors in a 4WD car. Additionally, a novel practical procedure is proposed to build a robust four-wheel differential drive and maintain the synchronization of the four DC motors. Simulation results and statistical analysis demonstrate the superior performance of the MFPSO compared with the PSO, MFO, and other hybrid variants (HMFPSO and HyMFPSO), with MFPSO ranking first in the Friedman test on CEC2020/2021 and engineering optimization benchmark problems. Practical results and the transient response analysis of the speed control revealed that MFPSO significantly outperformed the traditional Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) method, MFO, PSO, HMFPSO, and HyMFPSO algorithms. Specifically, the MFPSO algorithm reduced settling time by 34.83%, 21.20%, 20.75%, 22.97%, and 31.59%, and overshoot by 86.11%, 64.99%, 71.02%, 74.37%, and 60.58% compared to the ZN, MFO, PSO, HMFPSO, and HyMFPSO algorithms, respectively.

The proposed methodology employs a hybrid $$A^*$$ algorithm for non-holonomic car-like robots and a conventional $$A^*$$ algorithm for holonomic robots. Following this, a body conflict detection strategy is utilized to construct the conflict tree, bridging the initial path planning with the resolution of conflicts among agents. Moreover, we present two variants of HCBS: the Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (EHCBS) and the Depth-First Conflict-Based Search (DFHCBS). We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms—HCBS, EHCBS, and DFHCBS—against a standard prioritized planning algorithm, focusing on success rates and computational efficiency in environments with varying numbers of agents and obstacles. The empirical results demonstrate that EHCBS exhibits superior computational efficiency in small, dense environments, while DFHCBS performs well in larger-scale environments. This highlights the adaptability of our proposed approaches in various settings, proving the computational advantage of EHCBS and DFHCBS over traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in lower limb exoskeleton control have predominantly focused on enhancing walking capabilities across diverse terrains, such as level ground, stairs, and ramps. However, achieving seamless transitions between these terrains remains a significant challenge due to the unpredictability of the environment, which hampers adaptive control. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Interactive Learning (HIL) control method based on gait phase and locomotion pattern recognition. The method comprises two layers: high-level learning and low-level control. The high-level learning is based on gait phase and locomotion pattern recognition, utilizing the Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) to piecewise learn the desired joint torque curves. The low-level control utilizes the learned DMP to output torque based on the gait phase and locomotion pattern, while reinforcement learning is employed to dynamically adjust the control parameters of DMP in real-time with the goal of minimizing human-exoskeleton interaction forces. The experiments collected gait data of lower limb movement from active exoskeletons. The results show that our method significantly reduces human-exoskeleton interaction forces across diverse terrains. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, 15 healthy subjects were tested with the lower limb exoskeleton of these 3 generations. The experimental results show that the proposed HIL control method gives a valuable tool for smooth transitions among different terrains, reduces the reliance on accurate dynamic models and the average oxygen consumption decreased by about 12%, underscoring its potential to improve exoskeleton-assisted mobility.},

This paper systematically reviews robot technologies, explores their applications, and provides systematic information for technology development, selection, and implementation for robots in dementia care. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, articles from January 1990 to May 2023 were retrieved from seven databases and 38 eligible articles were identified. Nineteen SARs were identified and reviewed, encompassing physical features, sensing capabilities, perception, user modeling, and interaction technologies. The robot personality framework, which classified SARs as animal-like, human-like, and artificial-being, was employed to compare technologies, applications, and clinical outcomes. In addition, the experimental methodologies and study quality of existing studies were compared and discussed. This study found that technologies shape the robot’s personality and contribute to its applications. Future studies could be based on their application purpose, which could guide the selection, development, and implementation of robot technologies, thereby promoting SAR applications in dementia care. In addition, studies with large sample sizes, rigorous study designs, and detailed intervention descriptions are recommended, which could enhance study quality and promote robot technologies and applications in dementia care.},

  abstract     = {To improve the vertical plane motion performance of an underwater vehicle with bow and stern elevators under actuator saturation and external disturbance conditions, a new control method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, for simplifying the analysis of the coupled kinetics equation of the underwater vehicle, virtual control variables are introduced to decompose the kinetics equation into two cascaded components. Then, a framework consisting of control law and control allocation is presented according to the cascaded components. In the aspect of control law, a double closed-loop control scheme is designed. The outer loop realizes the depth control by adjusting the expected heave velocity and pitch of the underwater vehicle with an S-plane regulator and a subsection function. Meanwhile, an Augmented Linear Quadratic Regulator (ALQR) is employed in the inner loop to control the heave velocity and pitch without steady-state error. Considering the physical constraints of elevators, a pitching-priority idea is adopted in the design of the control allocation to prioritize the pitch control requirement of the underwater vehicle. Finally, based on the framework, disturbances are estimated and compensated to enhance the anti-interference performance, as well as, auxiliary functions are constructed for reducing the adverse effect caused by saturation. Simulation results show that the new control method performs perfectly under various conditions, it is also conducive to the navigation safety of the underwater vehicle because of its superior pitch control capability.},

In this paper, a novel RGB-D SLAM system termed Inpainting SLAM is proposed in the ORB-SLAM2 framework. Our Inpainting SLAM defines two new modules: one is the dynamic objects detection module, which combines segmentation and depth information to segment dynamic objects. Additionally, a new method is also proposed to determine whether movable objects are classified as dynamic. The other is an image inpainting module to restore static regions that are occluded by dynamic objects, with a new rectified approach introduced to determine the inpainting regions that can enhance the performance of the SLAM system. With these two modules, the accuracy and robustness of the SLAM system in dynamic scenes are expected to be improved. Our method is tested on the public TUM dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability. The improvements on ORB-SLAM2 in RTE, RRE, and ATE are 97.45%, 99.88%, and 97.90%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Mobile robots are becoming increasingly popular in a wide array of applications: industrial, item delivery, search and rescue, space, social, and entertainment. A two-wheeled self-balancing mobile robot is a statically unstable non-linear system with strong coupling dynamics. Common practices in the development of control systems for such robots are either to linearise the region of application to be used with linear controllers or to use complex nonlinear controllers such as fuzzy logic, sliding mode, and neural networks. However, self-balancing robots are still restricted by the travelling distance needed to regain an upright stance, the length of settling time, high overshoot and lack of resilience to external disturbance. In this paper, we are proposing a novel genetic algorithm-based switching control to evolve more effective control parameters and increase autonomy. Differently from previous work a genetic algorithm has been used to select the parameters in a sliding mode control and a switching-algorithm-based controller of a two-wheeled self-balancing mobile robot. The performance of the proposed controllers is assessed in simulations using the CoppeliaSim environment. The tests used dynamic criteria (distance travelled, maximum angular deviation), control criteria (settling time, % overshoot). The results showed that the genetic algorithm-based control has better performance in the 55 degree recovery, impulse response and variable inclination tests and that switching algorithm-based control shows better performance in step response tests. The results produced by the evolutionary algorithm are often able to perform better than their analytic counterparts. This shows the potential of meta-heuristic algorithms to obtain solutions for optimization problems encountered by statically unstable non-linear systems in unstructured and fast-changing environments.},

Additionally, this research presents the development of an adaptive autonomous exploration policy that dynamically adjusts the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) based on the exploration percentage. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in autonomous exploration efficiency compared to well-known traditional RL and classical single-robot exploration policies, validating the effectiveness of the suggested novel autonomous exploration strategies.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent and autonomous robots (and vehicles) largely adopt computer vision systems to help in localization, navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks. By integrating different deep learning techniques, such as Object Detection and Image Semantic Segmentation, these systems achieve high accuracy in the domain they were trained on. Nonetheless, robustly operating in different domains still poses a major challenge to vision-based perception. In this sense, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has recently gained momentum due to its importance to real-world applications. Specifically, it leverages the prompt availability of unlabeled data to design auxiliary sources of supervision to guide the knowledge transfer between domains. The advantages of such an approach are two-fold: avoiding going through exhaustive labeling processes, and enhancing adaptation performance. In this scenario, exploring temporal correlations in unlabeled video data stands as an interesting alternative, which has not yet been explored to its full potential. In this work, we propose a Self-supervised learning framework that employs Temporal Consistency from unlabeled video sequences as a pretext task for improving UDA for Semantic Segmentation (UDASS). A simple yet effective strategy, it has shown promising results in a real-to-real adaptation setting. Our results and discussions are expected to benefit both new and experienced researchers on the subject.},

  abstract     = {Human–robot collaboration is crucial in various industries, making accurate prediction of human arm movements essential for seamless interaction. This paper presents a significant advancement in collaborative robotics by developing a hybrid model that enhances the accuracy and interpretability of human motion predictions. By integrating a Physics-Infused Model with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach effectively captures intricate temporal dependencies while incorporating physical constraints, leading to more robust and realistic predictions. The hybrid model was successfully implemented on an ABB IRB 120 robot, demonstrating its practical applicability in real-world scenarios. Our results show that this model outperforms conventional methods, particularly in predicting human arm positions during collaborative tasks. The key contribution of this work lies in the integration of deep learning with physics-based principles, setting a new benchmark for predictive accuracy in human–robot collaboration. This research not only enhances the performance of collaborative robots but also opens the door for similar hybrid models to be applied in other fields where accurate motion prediction is critical.},

The paper evaluates the performance of these controllers in different scenarios, analyzing parameters such as settling time, steady-state error, and overshoot. In addition, we investigate different hardware implementations of the proposed controllers using SoC FPGAs, tailored for small mobile robot platforms, offering high computational performance and low power consumption. To train the neural controllers, four bio-inspired optimization algorithms were used, and hypothesis tests were conducted to select the best neural controller. A Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation was conducted in an AMD-Xilinx SoC FPGA Zynq 7020 to attain the best compromise between the controllers’ performance, numerical precision, hardware resources consumption, and power dissipation. The findings underscored the effectiveness of both GMDH and Perceptron controllers in stabilizing the robot amidst disturbances and adeptly navigating obstacle-following and avoidance tasks across various unknown scenarios. However, the Perceptron controller exhibits several advantages in terms of hardware resources and power consumption.},

  abstract     = {Path planning is crucial for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) navigating in complex marine environments, which are often affected by multiple threat factors. Traditional path planning methods often fail to account for these factors, suffer from local optimal solutions, and lack adequate exploration and exploitation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a target attraction rule-based adaptive particle swarm optimization (TARAPSO) algorithm, driven by threat assessment. Firstly, a 3D model of the complex marine environment is established, incorporating multiple threat factors. Secondly, a Bayesian network (BN)-based threat assessment model is developed to perform probabilistic inference on the states of potential threats encountered by the UUV. Based on the results of this assessment, a cost function incorporating the threat degree index is designed to evaluate the impact of various threat factors on the UUV’s path. Finally, the TARAPSO algorithm is introduced and applied to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of path planning, incorporating the threat assessment-driven cost function. Simulation results show that the TARAPSO algorithm, when combined with the BN-based threat assessment strategy, demonstrates superior efficiency in evaluating multiple threat factors, generates competitive paths with shorter lengths, and effectively ensures safe navigation of the UUV.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel method for identifying the mechanical parameters of flexible-joint robot axes using sinusoidal position tracking control. Accurate knowledge of mechanical parameters, such as inertia, coupling stiffness, and friction components, is important for designing effective controllers in robotic systems. These parameters are determined from integral values derived from the torque, speed, and position measurements of both the motor and load sides, leveraging the 90 $$^{\circ }$$ phase relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration terms. A robust sinusoidal position controller was developed, and the speed and position measurements of both the motor and load sides were utilized to implement the proposed method. When compared with parameters identified using standard methods, the proposed method shows an absolute percentage error ranging from 3.55% to 14.6% for the inertias and coupling stiffness, and 10.76% to 19% for the friction coefficients. The straightforward implementation and effectiveness of this method make it suitable for applications in industrial robotic arms, where precise control is essential for enhancing performance and operational efficiency.},
