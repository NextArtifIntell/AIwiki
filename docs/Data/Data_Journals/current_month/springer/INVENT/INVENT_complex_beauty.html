  abstract     = {Determinacy axioms are mathematical principles which assert that various infinite games are determined. In this article, we prove three general meta-theorems on the logical strength of determinacy axioms. These allow us to reduce a metamathematical analysis of the principle of $\Gamma $ -determinacy over a weak base theory to an analysis of a principle $\Gamma &#39;$ -determinacy, where $\Gamma &#39;$ is a strictly smaller complexity class than $\Gamma $ . The meta-theorems are proved in the weak theory ${\mathsf{RCA_{0}}}$ . However, they are formulated in a general way and also have applications in the context of ${\mathsf{ZFC}}$ , eventually leading to an optimal generalization of Martin’s Borel determinacy theorem and optimal strengthenings of the transfer theorems of Martin-Harrington, Kechris-Woodin, and Neeman. As the main application of the meta-theorems, we carry out all the reverse-mathematical analyses of theories of determinacy below $T = \boldsymbol{\Pi }^{1}_{1}{-}{\mathsf{CA_{0}}}+ \Pi ^{1}_{4}{-}{ \mathsf{CA_{0}}}$ which are missing from the literature. More precisely, let $\Gamma \subset \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$ be called a Wadge class if $\Gamma $ is closed under continuous preimages. For each Wadge class $\Gamma $ such that the consistency of $\Gamma $ -Determinacy is provable in $T$ , we reduce the principle of $\Gamma $ -Determinacy to a combination of Comprehension, Monotone Induction, and $\beta $ -Reflection axioms. It follows from our results that these classes $\Gamma $ are precisely those which satisfy $$ o(\Gamma ) &lt; \omega _{1}^{\omega _{1}^{2}} \text{ and $T\vdash $``$\Gamma $ is a Wadge class.&#39;&#39;} $$ Our work extends and generalizes results of Friedman, Hachtman, Heinatsch, Martin, MedSalem, Montalbán, Möllerfeld, Nemoto, Shore, Steel, Tanaka, Welch, and others, and concludes the project of metamathematical analysis of determinacy principles (cf. e.g., Montalbán’s “Open Questions in Reverse Mathematics”, Bull. Symb. Log. 16:431–454, 2011), as far as subsystems of $T$ are concerned.},

This generalises a result of Faltings from smooth projective curves to any higher dimension, and further to the rigid analytic setup. The strategy is new, and is based on the study of rigid analytic moduli spaces of pro-étale invertible sheaves on spectral varieties.},

  abstract     = {Let $A=(a_{1},\ldots , a_{n})$ be a vector of integers which sum to $k(2g-2+n)$ . The double ramification cycle $\mathsf{DR}_{g,A}\in \mathsf{CH}^{g}(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ on the moduli space of curves is the virtual class of an Abel-Jacobi locus of pointed curves $(C,x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})$ satisfying $$ \mathcal{O}_{C}\Big(\sum _{i=1}^{n} a_{i} x_{i}\Big) \, \simeq \, \big(\omega ^{\mathsf{log}}_{C}\big)^{k}\, . $$ The Abel-Jacobi construction requires log blow-ups of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ to resolve the indeterminacies of the Abel-Jacobi map. Holmes (J. Inst. Math. Jussieu 2019) has shown that $\mathsf{DR}_{g,A}$ admits a canonical lift $\mathsf{logDR}_{g,A} \in \mathsf{logCH}^{g}(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ to the logarithmic Chow ring, which is the limit of the intersection theories of all such blow-ups. The main result of the paper is an explicit formula for $\mathsf{logDR}_{g,A}$ which lifts Pixton’s formula for $\mathsf{DR}_{g,A}$ . The central idea is to study the universal Jacobian over the moduli space of curves (following Caporaso (Am. Math. Soc. 7(3):589–660 1994), Kass-Pagani (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 372:4851–4887 2019), and Abreu-Pacini (Adv. Math. 378:107520 2021)) for certain stability conditions. Using the criterion of Holmes-Schwarz (Algebr. Geom. 9(5):574–605 2022), the universal double ramification theory of Bae-Holmes-Pandharipande-Schmitt-Schwarz (Acta Math. 230(2):205–319 2023) applied to the universal line bundle determines the logarithmic double ramification cycle. The resulting formula, written in the language of piecewise polynomials, depends upon the stability condition (and admits a wall-crossing study). Several examples of logarithmic and higher double ramification cycles are computed.},

  abstract     = {We give an alternative proof of the Schoen–Simon–Yau curvature estimates and associated Bernstein-type theorems (Schoen et al. in Acta Math. 134:275–288, 1975), and extend the original result by including the case of 6-dimensional (stable minimal) immersions. The key step is an ε-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^{2}$ norm of the second fundamental form. Further, we obtain a graph description, in the Lipschitz multi-valued sense, for any stable minimal immersion of dimension $n\geq 2$ , that may have a singular set $\Sigma $ of locally finite $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}$ -measure, and that is weakly close to a hyperplane. (In fact, if the $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}$ -measure of the singular set vanishes, the conclusion is strengthened to a union of smooth graphs.) This follows directly from an ε-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^{2}$ tilt-excess (verified when the hypersurface is weakly close to a hyperplane). Specialising the multi-valued decomposition to the case of embeddings, we recover the Schoen–Simon theorem (Schoen and Simon 34:741–797, 1981). In both ε-regularity theorems the relevant quantity (respectively, length of the second fundamental form and tilt function) solves a non-linear PDE on the immersed minimal hypersurface. The proof is carried out intrinsically (without linearising the PDE) by implementing an iteration method à la De Giorgi (from the linear De Giorgi–Nash–Moser theory). Stability implies estimates (intrinsic weak Caccioppoli inequalities) that make the iteration effective despite the non-linear framework. (In both ε-regularity theorems the method gives explicit constants that quantify the required smallness.)},
