  abstract     = {The validity of instruments plays a crucial role in addressing endogenous treatment effects and instruments that violate the exclusion restriction are invalid. This paper concerns the overidentifying restrictions test for evaluating the validity of instruments in the high-dimensional instrumental variable model. We confront the challenge of high dimensionality by introducing a new testing procedure based on U-statistic. Our procedure allows the number of instruments and covariates to be in exponential order of the sample size. Under some mild conditions, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistic under the null and local alternative hypotheses. The effectiveness of the proposed method is clearly supported by simulations and its application to a real dataset on trade and economic growth.},

  abstract     = {We examine the asymptotic properties of two multiple imputation (MI) estimators, given in the study of Lee et al. (Computational Statistics, 38, 899–934, 2023) for the parameters of logistic regression with both sets of discrete or categorical covariates that are missing at random separately or simultaneously. The proposed estimated asymptotic variances of the two MI estimators address a limitation observed with Rubin’s estimated variances, which lead to underestimate the variances of the two MI estimators (Rubin, 1987, Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, New York:Wiley). Simulation results demonstrate that our two proposed MI methods outperform the complete-case, semiparametric inverse probability weighting, random forest MI using chained equations, and stochastic approximation of expectation-maximization methods. To illustrate the methodology’s practical application, we provide a real data example from a survey conducted at the Feng Chia night market in Taichung City, Taiwan.},

  abstract     = {In multiple hypotheses testing it has become widely popular to make inference on the true discovery proportion (TDP) of a set $$\mathscr {M}$$ of null hypotheses. This approach is useful for several application fields, such as neuroimaging and genomics. Several procedures to compute simultaneous lower confidence bounds for the TDP have been suggested in prior literature. Simultaneity allows for post-hoc selection of $$\mathscr {M}$$ . If sets of interest are specified a priori, it is possible to gain power by removing the simultaneity requirement. We present an approach to compute lower confidence bounds for the TDP if the set of null hypotheses is defined a priori. The proposed method determines the bounds using the exact distribution of the number of rejections based on a step-up multiple testing procedure under independence assumptions. We assess robustness properties of our procedure and apply it to real data from the field of functional magnetic resonance imaging.},
