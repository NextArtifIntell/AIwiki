  abstract     = {We present a rigidity decision problem of constrained cubic grids in any given bracing pattern. The cubic grid bar and joint frameworks are not rigid. Additional constraints are required for rigidity. These constraints can be pinned down joints and additional bracing elements. Scaffoldings are not rigid cubic grid structures whose specific joints are pinned down. Inserting cable, strut, or rod bracing elements makes the framework rigid. Our model, which provides a linearly complex algorithm, has practical implications in testing the strong connectedness of a corresponding directed graph, contributing to the field of rigidity in structural engineering and motions of cable controlled pinned down cubic mechanisms.},

We establish improved convergence rates under different assumptions on the objective function, the feasible set, and the localization of the limit point of the sequence generated by the method. Notably, we demonstrate that the method can achieve linear convergence rates in terms of a merit function whenever the objectives are strongly convex and the limit point is in the relative interior of the feasible set, or when the feasible set is strongly convex and it does not contain an unconstrained weak Pareto point. Moreover, improved sublinear convergence rates can also be obtained in other scenarios where the feasible set is uniformly convex. Additionally, we explore enhanced convergence rates with respect to an optimality measure. Finally, we provide some simple examples to illustrate the convergence rates and the set of assumptions.},

Then, a TSRO model for the scheduling optimization of electricity system considering the optimal power flow (OPF) is proposed, in order to explore the effectiveness of the extended C&amp;CG algorithm in handling the general optimization problem while considering the feasibility.

In the present contribution, we introduce a new general class of T-FDEs to be solved. Their solution is addressed by the use of unique polynomials of the generalized shifted Legendre functions. For this purpose, we evaluate the association of new fractional and ordinary operational matrices using the Lagrange multipliers algorithm. The analysis of the convergence is done and the existence of a unique solution for the T-FDEs is proved. Three problems are considered to test the proposed methodology.

  abstract     = {Usually, bilevel optimization problems need to be transformed into single-level ones in order to derive optimality conditions and solution algorithms. Among the available approaches, the replacement of the lower-level problem by means of duality relations became popular quite recently. We revisit three realizations of this idea which are based on the lower-level Lagrange, Wolfe, and Mond–Weir dual problem. The resulting single-level surrogate problems are equivalent to the original bilevel optimization problem from the viewpoint of global minimizers under mild assumptions. However, all these reformulations suffer from the appearance of so-called implicit variables, i.e., surrogate variables which do not enter the objective function but appear in the feasible set for modeling purposes. Treating implicit variables as explicit ones has been shown to be problematic when locally optimal solutions, stationary points, and applicable constraint qualifications are compared to the original problem. Indeed, we illustrate that the same difficulties have to be faced when using these duality-based reformulations. Furthermore, we show that the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification is likely to be violated at each feasible point of these reformulations, contrasting assertions in some recently published papers.},

Both continuous and approximation theories are illustrated by specific canonical hyperbolic-like equations with boundary control, where the abstract assumptions are actually sharp regularity properties of the hyperbolic dynamics under discussion. Assumptions are divided in two groups. A first group of dynamical assumptions (actually dynamic properties) imply some preliminary critical properties of the control problem, including the definition of the would-be Riccati operator, in terms of the original data. However, in order to guarantee that such an operator is moreover the unique solution (within a specific class) of the corresponding Differential/Integral Riccati Equation, additional smoothing assumptions on the operators defining the performance index are required. The ultimate goal is to show that the the discrete finite dimensional Riccati based feedback operator, when inserted into the original PDE dynamics, provides near optimal performance.},

We provide upper bounds on the distance between the solutions to the original constrained problem and the penalty reformulations, guaranteeing the convergence of the proposed approach. We consider a static method that uses a fixed smoothness parameter for the penalty function as well as a dynamic nested method with a novel way for updating the smoothness parameter of the penalty function and the step-size. In both cases, we apply accelerated stochastic gradient methods and study the expected incremental/stochastic gradient iteration complexity to produce a solution within an expected distance of $$\epsilon $$ to the optimal solution of the original problem. We show that this complexity is proportional to $$m\sqrt{\frac{m}{\mu \epsilon }}$$ , where m is the number of constraints and $$\mu $$ is the strong convexity parameter of the objective function, which improves upon existing results when m is not too large. We also show how to query an approximate dual solution after stochastically solving the penalty reformulations, leading to results on the convergence of the duality gap. Moreover, the nested structure of the algorithm and upper bounds on the distance to the optimal solutions allows one to safely eliminate constraints that are inactive at an optimal solution throughout the algorithm, which leads to improved complexity results. Finally, we present computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm.},

With the discrete Fourier transform, the novel CRM framework demonstrates distinctive advantages through its advantageous algebraic characteristics, which not only establish its theoretical uniqueness but also enable effective transformation of quaternion tensor optimization problems into the complex domain for efficient solution. The proposed CRM features a block-diagonal structure, enabling efficient large-scale computations and enhancing its suitability for high-dimensional problems. To evaluate its advantages in video inpainting, two CRM-based quaternion tensor completion methods are introduced.

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the study of optimality conditions at infinity in nonsmooth minimax programming problems and their applications. By means of the limiting subdifferential and the normal cone at infinity, we derive necessary and sufficient optimality conditions of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker type for nonsmooth minimax programming problems with constraints. The obtained results are applied to nonsmooth vector optimization problems and robust minimax optimization ones.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop the Galerkin-like method to address first-order integro-differential inclusions. Under compactness or monotonicity conditions, we obtain new results for the existence of solutions for this class of problems, which generalize existing results in the literature and provide new insights for differential inclusions with an unbounded right-hand side. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by presenting new existence results for nonconvex state-dependent Volterra sweeping processes, where the right-hand side is unbounded, and the classical theory of differential inclusions is not applicable. This is the first result of its kind. The paper concludes with an application to the existence of an optimal control problem governed by nonconvex state-dependent Volterra sweeping processes in finite dimensions.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to develop a unified theory of horizon and recession asymptotic notions for sets, functions, and multifunctions. This unified approach allows to exploit both the algebraic and topological features of these objects. We study the notion of regular set defined as a set for which its horizon and recession cones coincide. This notion plays an important role in the theory. Regular functions and multifunctions are defined and studied as well. By using the unified approach, we obtain properties, formulas, calculus rules, and relationships for horizon and recession notions. Finally, we study the horizon and recession mappings of various important functions and multifunctions from variational analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the nearest doubly stochastic matrix problem, which encompasses many important real-world applications. Theoretically, we show that the problem under consideration can be equivalently reformulated as the system of nonsmooth monotone equations, the mapping of which is Lipschitz continuous. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result, showing that the underlying mapping owns the Lipschitz continuity and monotonicity. Moreover, the scale of the system is significantly smaller than that of the KKT optimality conditions for the original problem. Based on a scaling memoryless DFP formula, a Jacobian-free method with a modified Armijo line search is proposed for solving such a system. By the aid of the Lipschitz continuity and monotonicity of the underlying mapping, the global convergence and iteration complexity for the proposed method are established. Importantly, we illustrate for the first time that the Armijo line search mentioned above is superior to the original one in terms of iteration complexity. This also opens the door to improve the iteration complexity of Jacobian-free methods by designing an appropriate line search. Furthermore, the local linear rate of convergence established in this paper is new compared with existing Jacobian-free methods for solving nonsmooth monotone equations. Finally, numerical results illustrating the practical behavior of the presented method are reported.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate optimal vaccination strategies in SIR models with Erlang-distributed infectious period (the Erlang distribution is a gamma distribution with integer shape parameter). We consider the problem of minimizing the epidemic burden under either limited vaccination resources or linear costs of vaccination. By applying the Pontryagin’s minimum principle, we prove that both the optimal control problems admit only bang–bang solutions with at most one switch, the one-switch control being the case of reactive vaccination. We show that different assumptions on the infectious period distribution may lead to qualitatively and quantitatively different shapes of the optimal control. The main results are the following. We prove that in the absence of control the epidemic burden in SIR models is the same irrespectively of the infectious period distribution. However, when the vaccination resources are limiting, the optimal control problem leads to solutions where the epidemic burden is larger (and the time needed to complete vaccination campaigns is longer) in models with Erlang-distributed infectious periods with respect to exponential ones.},
