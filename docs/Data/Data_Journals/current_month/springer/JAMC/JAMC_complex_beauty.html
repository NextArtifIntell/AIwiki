  abstract     = {This study introduces a rigorous mathematical analysis utilizing a fractional integro-differential equation model to depict the intricate dynamics of plasma dilution and provide a comprehensive understanding of its implications in various biomedical and clinical contexts. The integro-differential equation governing plasma dilution is formulated by employing Caputo fractional operators and it is addressed and examined using analytical and numerical techniques, Laplace transform which gives an accurate results for the proposed equation and the composite trapezoidal rule with finite difference method as a numerical approach to validate the proposed model, offering a practical tool for predicting plasma dilution under divers. We also discussed the existence and the uniqueness of solutions. Whereas this model has effectively been utilized with real data obtained from a previous human investigation of thyroid surgery, the graphical illustrations are being presented to clarify the results obtained during two time periods, the infusion and postinfusion periods, the two periods are considered a sequential events the infusion phase transpired within the initial 30 min of the surgical procedure following this, the postinfusion phase extended from 30 min to a limited time.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of synchronizing fuzzy reaction–diffusion neural networks (FRDNNs) with time-varying transmission delays using aperiodic semi-intermittent hybrid controls and explores its application within the realm of image encryption. The main challenge in analyzing the dynamics of FRDNNs included diffusion terms with uncertainty, and the inclusion of fuzzy logic operations further increases the system’s complexity. We propose a new concept called the average control width (ACW) for aperiodic semi-intermittent control (ASIC) systems; it is used in conjunction with the idea of average dwell time (ADT) for switched systems. A sufficient flexible condition for master–slave synchronization of neural networks using average-width semi-intermittent hybrid control assures ADT and ACW conditions. By utilizing these concepts, the proposed synchronization method can overcome the challenges posed by the diffusion terms and fuzzy logic operations in FRDNNs with time-varying transmission delays. Finally, the paper presents a theoretical framework for synchronizing FRDNNs with time-varying transmission delays using semi-intermittent hybrid control via LMI and suitable Lyapunov functional, validated through simulations. The proposed synchronization method is also applied to develop a novel chaos-based elliptic curve cryptography algorithm for medical image encryption.},

Then, the spectral based collocation method by using the Pell functions is employed to approximate the derived system of linearized equations in terms of unknown coefficients.

One such method is to determine the degree-based topological indices of a graph using its M-polynomial. Among the class of degree-based topological indices, the Sombor indices are one of the most investigated indices in recent times. In this article, the M-polynomial-based derivation formulas are derived to compute the different Sombor-type indices, namely the Sombor index, modified Sombor index, first and second Banhatti–Sombor indices, and their reduced form of the Sombor indices. Furthermore, our proposed derivation formulas are applied to compute the Sombor-type indices of the jagged-rectangle benzenoid system $$B_{m,n}$$ .

Therefore, the parameters for assessing network vulnerability have received considerable attention. In general, we use connectivity and diagnosability to reflect the vulnerability of the network. At present, the connectivity and diagnosability of most networks have been determined. In this paper, we mainly analyze Cayley graphs $$EC_m$$ , which are generated by disjoint paths with length 2. We explain that connectivity and super connectivity of $$EC_m$$ are uniformly 2m, the 1-extra and 3-component connectivity of $$EC_m$$ are uniformly $$4m-2$$ . In addition, we also analyze the local diagnosability of $$EC_m$$ under the PMC and $$\hbox {MM}^*$$ models is 2m.},

While formulating the model, we have taken into account the saturated incidence function with three controls, namely, treatment control, vaccination control, and media awareness. To make the model more robust, we have updated the model using Caputo fractional-order differential equation. We have determined the existence and uniqueness of the solution along with all possible equilibrium points. We have also obtained the basic reproduction number and the criteria of asymptotic local and global stability, taking the basic reproduction number as the threshold parameter. Finally, to control the disease, we have performed the optimization using a metaheuristic search and optimization technique, genetic algorithm (GA).},

  abstract     = {In rough set theory, we distinguish confirmed and possible data, extracted through subsets utilizing lower and upper approximations, respectively. Earlier studies have presented several rough approximation models, drawing inspiration from neighborhood systems, aimed at enhancing accuracy degree and satisfying the axioms of standard approximation space, introduced by Pawlak. In this article, we first introduce novel rough neighborhoods so-called overlapping containment rough neighborhoods, denoted by $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods, using inclusion relations between $$\mathcal {D}_r$$ -neighborhoods and $$\mathcal {D}_l$$ -neighborhoods, as well as $$\mathcal {D}_{\langle r\rangle }$$ -neighborhoods and $$\mathcal {D}_{\langle l\rangle }$$ -neighborhoods, all defined under an arbitrary relation. We explore their main characterizations and reveal the relationships between them under specific types of binary relations, such as symmetric, transitive, and partial order relations. As a unique contribution, we successfully derive an indicator inspired by $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods for $$k\in \{r,l,i\}$$ to determine whether a relation is symmetric. Additionally, we describe the behavior of $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods as they navigate between two generalized approximation spaces, where the relations are reflexive and transitive, and one is a subset of the other. Then, we exploit $$\widetilde{\textrm{C}}_k$$ -neighborhoods to present fresh rough set models. We examine their main properties and demonstrate that they keep most characterizations of Pawlak’s paradigm while reducing the uncertainty in the data compared to some previous studies, also, we show that they satisfy the monstrosity property under quasi-order relations. To elucidate the superiority and accuracy of the present approach, we apply it to analyze the information systems related to the authorship of articles and books by selected authors and conduct a comparative analysis with several preceding approaches. Finally, a summary of the obtained results and relationships and suggestion for some forthcoming work are offered.},

  abstract     = {In 2010, Vukičević and Gašperov proposed a group of 148 discrete Adriatic indices which have represented good predictive characteristics on the testing sets conducted by the International Academy of Mathematical Chemistry (IAMC). One of such indices was the misbalance Hadeg ( $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ ) index which showed good ability in predicting the enthalpy of vaporization and standard enthalpy of vaporization for octane isomers. For a simple graph G with the edge set $$E_G$$ , the $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ index is expressed by $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}(G)=\sum _{\alpha \beta \in E_G} \Big |\Big (\frac{1}{2}\Big )^{d^{G}_{\alpha }}-\Big (\frac{1}{2}\Big )^{d^{G}_{\beta }}\Big |$$ , where $$d^{G}_{\beta }$$ stands for the degree of the vertex $$\beta $$ in G. Despite passing almost 14 years since the introduction of the $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ index, it has been relatively less investigated and left into oblivion. A main purpose of this research is to attract the attention of the mathematical chemistry community towards this molecular structure descriptor by studying some of its basic mathematical properties over trees, molecular trees, unicyclic graphs, bicyclic graphs and, in general, over c-cyclic graphs. More specifically, we give the minimum values of the $$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{H}$$ index over trees, unicyclic graphs and bicyclic graphs of a given number of vertices and with a fixed maximum degree and characterize the corresponding minimal graphs. The special case when the class of considered trees is restricted to the class of molecular trees and the general case when the class of considered unicyclic and bicyclic graphs is extended to the class of c-cyclic graphs are also examined.},

Due to the presence of turning point at $$r=0,$$ the problem exhibit boundary layer at $$r=-1$$ and $$r=1.$$ To tackle this type of problem, a thorough study is required to obtain a priori estimations on the solution and its derivatives of the considered problem.

The primary objective of this study is to derive adequate conditions for dissipativity by constructing suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) that incorporates triple integral terms, thereby providing a rigorous mathematical framework for analysis. To achieve this, a generalized delay-dependent reciprocal convex inequality is employed, which enables us to effectively calculate the derivative of the LKFs and derive a linear matrix polynomial. Our findings extend the conventional dissipativity criteria to include passivity, which is articulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). This enhancement significantly simplifies the computational process and allows for practical implementation using standard numerical software. Further, Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms existing findings.},

However, there appeared three incorrect EIEs for the same IFOS in existing papers due to misunderstandings about the segmented calculation for the fractional calculus of piecewise function. Hence, we re-study the EIEs of two impulsive Riemann–Liouville fractional order systems (IRFOSs) in this paper. For one IRFOS, we find the linear additivity of the impulsive effects by two limit properties, and construct the EIE for the IRFOS of one impulse by fractional order property of piecewise function, which derive the EIE’s structure of the IRFOS. Next, we apply the EIE’s structure of the IRFOS and a limit property to obtain the IRFOS’s EIE with an arbitrary constant and confirm the nonuniqueness of the IRFOS’s solution. And then, we combine the EIE of the IRFOS and the relation of two IRFOSs to deduce the EIE of the other IRFOS. Finally, we offer two numerical examples to show the computation of the EIEs and the nonuniqueness of the solutions for two IRFOSs.},

The stability of three equilibria of the model is proved by analyzing the distribution of characteristic roots. When two delays change at the same time, the stable region of the equilibrium on delays plane and the existence of Hopf bifurcation are obtained by the method of stability switching curves. Furthermore, we calculate the normal form of Hopf bifurcation to obtain the direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of bifurcation periodic solutions.

  abstract     = {Numerous real life models in applied sciences and engineering commonly deal with nonlinear equations that have to be solved using reliable numerical methods. The computational science research is continuously growing, which is a marked by either introduction of new iteration algorithms or improvement of the existing ones. Nevertheless, these numerical methods may have high computational cost, but they do have a faster rate of convergence. Hence, the aim of this paper is create new two-step fourth order iteration algorithms for finding simple roots of nonlinear equations. To achieve this goal we have taken Steffensen’s method in the first sub-step and a general quadratic interpolation polynomial in the second sub-step of a two-step iterative scheme. The main theorem demonstrates the fourth-order convergence of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme is derivative free and achieves optimal fourth order convergence by using only three function evaluations per iteration satisfying the conjecture of Kung and Traub. To validate the theoretical results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods, we explore some nonlinear models in medical sciences such as the law of blood flow, blood rheology, fluid permeability in biogels, and thermal regulation of the human body. The numerical results of the proposed scheme are presented in terms of number of iterations, errors in consecutive iterations, computational convergence order (CCO) and CPU time (sec). Several researchers have investigated basins of attraction on simple polynomials of the form $$z^n-1$$ in the complex plan. However, we have studied the fractal behavior of different methods on real world problems stated above in terms of basins of attraction for comparison of their convergence regions. The proposed scheme generate the basins of attraction in less time with wider regions of convergence in comparison with the existing methods of similar kind. Dynamical analysis of the proposed derivative free scheme illustrate its superiority in comparison with some existing optimal fourth order methods involving derivatives.},

  abstract     = {The Zika virus, a notorious flavivirus, infiltrates human populations via infected Aedes mosquitoes or sexual transmission, often resulting in devastating birth defects like microcephaly. Our study delves into Zika’s transmission dynamics, revealing the role of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and the impact of asymptomatic carriers. Central factors such as mosquito mortality rates and transmission dynamics steer Zika’s trajectory. Meticulous simulations show Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes effectively reducing new cases. Navigating through scenarios of pregnancy delays, we seamlessly integrate them into our mathematical tapestry, enhancing our understanding of Zika’s dynamics. While postponing conception holds promise in mitigating microcephaly, its impact on overall transmission remains marginal, a sobering reality amidst progress. Embracing a unified approach, combining Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and personal protective measures, we forge a formidable defense against Zika’s onslaught. As the specters of microcephaly and Zika recede, our quest for solutions offers a glimmer of hope in the battle against this formidable adversary.},

The dynamical behaviors of the proposed model is analyzed theoretically and numerically. It is found that multiple endemic equilibria occur under certain conditions, suggesting that decreasing the basic reproduction number $$\mathcal {R}_0$$ is insufficient for disease eradication and improving the efficiency of vaccination and treatment can have a significant impact on disease progression. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to quantify how changes in concerned parameters impact $$\mathcal {R}_0$$ , and the proposed model is applied to the pandemic wave of COVID-19. Finally, optimal control problem with time-varying vaccination and treatment is studied and cost-effectiveness analysis is examined under different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Humans have been affected by various epidemic diseases, mostly are airborne and exhibit high transmission rates. Given these nature properties, quarantine measures are essential to control the spread of the diseases effectively. Motivated by this fact, and due to the successful use of mathematical modeling, we investigate a SIR model with quarantine and vaccination compartments. This model uses a system of fractional differential equations (SIQVR-based) with specific parameters to track the dynamics of model variables. We examine the well-posedness and boundedness results via standard tools. An effective threshold parameter $$\mathcal {R}_0$$ is determined using a generation matrix and equilibrium points of the model are obtained. To effectively manage the transmission of infection within the outlined model, we employ the strategy of optimal control. This approach involves implementing control measures and interventions guided by mathematical optimization techniques to minimize the spread of disease. These control strategies may encompass vaccination campaigns, quarantine protocols, social distancing measures and other preventive actions. Further, to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed model and the applied optimal control strategy, we conduct a series of numerical simulations. Computational results involve running the model under different scenarios, considering a range of parameters and meticulously analyzing the resulting outcomes.},

We also show that the theoretical order of the technique is consistent with the numerical convergence rates.

Moreover, the nonlinear terms are treated by semi-implicit method, and the coupling of velocity and pressure is decoupled by a Gauge–Uzawa method. Thus, the schemes achieve decoupling of velocity, magnetic field and pressure. Most importantly, the proposed schemes do not need to deal with the artificial boundary conditions on pressure and do not need to give an initial value of pressure. Then, the unconditional stability of the two schemes is demonstrated. Furthermore, through rigorous error analysis, we provide optimal convergence orders for all unknowns.

  abstract     = {This article aims to define four new kinds of rough set models based on cardinality neighborhoods and two ideals. The significance of these methods lies in their foundation on ideals, which serve as topological tools. Furthermore, the use of two ideals offers two perspectives instead of just one, thereby reducing the boundary region and increasing the accuracy, which is the primary objective of rough set theory. The concepts of lower and upper approximations based on ideals are presented for the four types. Additionally, we establish essential properties and results for these approximations and construct counterexamples to demonstrate how some of Pawlak’s properties have dissipated in the proposed models. The relationships between the current and previous approximations are discussed, and algorithms to classify whether a subset is exact or rough are introduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate how one combination of ideals is applied to address rough paradigms from a topological perspective. Practically, we apply the proposed paradigms to dengue disease management and elucidate two key points: first, our models are distinguished compared to previous ones by retaining most properties of the original approximation operators proposed by Pawlak; and second, we identify which of the proposed models is better at increasing the accuracy of subsets. In conclusion, we debate the advantages of the suggested models and the motivations behind each type, while also highlighting some of their shortcomings.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design and analyse a high-order numerical algorithm based on the improvised quintic B-spline collocation method for solving the fourth-order fractional diffusion equation. The time-fractional derivative is approximated by Caputo’s time derivative. The space derivative is approximated by the collocation method based on improvised quintic B-spline functions. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is unconditionally stable. Through rigorous convergence analysis, the method is shown $$(2-\beta )$$ order convergent in time and almost sixth-order convergent in space direction. It is also shown that the theoretical rate of convergence is the same as that acquired experimentally. To confirm the theoretical results and to test the efficiency and robustness, the method is tested on three problems. The main contribution of the developed algorithm is that the order of convergence and numerical results obtained are better than the existing methods, like the sextic B-spline collocation method (Roul and Goura in Appl Math Comput 366:124727, 2020), the quintic B-spline method (Siddiqi and Arshed in Int J Comput Math 92(7):1496–1518, 2015), and the quintic spline method (Tariq and Akram in Numer Methods Part Differ Equ 33(2):445–466, 2017). It has been proved that the order of convergence of the proposed method is six, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the other spline collocation methods.},

  abstract     = {Two improved subgradient extragradient algorithms are proposed for solving nonmonotone variational inequalities under the nonempty assumption of the solution set of the dual variational inequalities. First, when the mapping is Lipschitz continuous, we propose an improved subgradient extragradient algorithm with self-adaptive step-size (ISEGS for short). In ISEGS, the next iteration point is obtained by projecting sequentially the current iteration point onto two different half-spaces, and only one projection onto the feasible set is required in the process of constructing the half-spaces per iteration. The self-adaptive technique allows us to determine the step-size without using the Lipschitz constant. Second, we extend our algorithm into the case where the mapping is merely continuous. The Armijo line search approach is used to handle the non-Lipschitz continuity of the mapping. The global convergence of both algorithms is established without monotonicity assumption of the mapping. The computational complexity of the two proposed algorithms is analyzed. Some numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of the new algorithms.},

We thoroughly examine the desirable properties and special cases of these new aggregation operators. Subsequently, we devise a multiple-criteria group decision-making method based on the p,q-ROFGDWA and p,q-ROFGDWG operators. Also an example regarding the selection of infectious medical waste treatment technology in Lahore, Pakistan is provided to exemplify the practicality and effectiveness of the developed model. The obtained results are then compared with other relevant methods, highlighting the efficacy and authenticity of the propound approach. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed to verify the suggested method’s stability.

The present nonlinear models are reduced to nonlinear ordinary differential equations (NLODEs) by the traveling wave transform and the proposed solution by the NVTEM is used to evaluate the solutions of mLE and mRLWE. This analytical method is not applied before to these equations and novel wave solutions are acquired in the form of rational, exponential, hyperbolic, and Jacobi elliptic types. The solitary solutions of the equations under consideration make them essential models in shallow water dynamics, in liquids and gas bubbles, in magneto-hydrodynamics, and in plasma. This fact has become a motivation for this research.},

Once the predictor solution is obtained, the higher order Adams–Moulton method is used as the corrector. Moreover, to make much higher order technique, a multiple correction technique is introduced by repeatedly correcting the results induced from the predictor.
