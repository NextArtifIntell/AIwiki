  abstract     = {Uridine (rU) and 2′-deoxyuridine (dU) are common DNA lesions. dU is repaired through a base excision repair (BER) pathway initiated by uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), while rU is typically removed from DNA via ribonucleotide excision repair, mediated by RNase H2. In this study, we report that rU is also repaired through the UDG-mediated BER pathway. We found that UDG catalyzes the removal of uracil from rU embedded in DNA, but exhibits no activity toward rU in RNA. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses revealed that the 2′–OH group of rU is effectively accommodated by UDG and directly participates in catalyzing the hydrolysis of the N -glycosidic bond. The abasic site product generated upon removal of uracil from rU by UDG is further processed by downstream BER enzymes to restore undamaged DNA. Our findings suggest that UDG-initiated BER constitutes a previously unrecognized pathway for the repair of rU-specific ribonucleotides. Additionally, we developed a method for selectively quantifying rU content in DNA. Using this method, we determined that rU repair by UDG is not a major pathway in human cells. This discovery expands our understanding of the diverse biological functions of UDG, and inspires further investigation to determine the role of its rU-removal in cells.},

The present work shows syntheses, structures, and applications of amorphous graphene and GO analogues alternative to the ideal ones. The simultaneous multiple reactions of two conjugated monomers provide amorphous conjugated polymer networks containing low-crystalline graphitic domains and their stacking. The stacked amorphous graphene and GO are exfoliated into thin nanosheets including few-layers and monolayers. Moreover, in situ syntheses of the amorphous GO analogues are applied to obtain a reinforced plastic with high mechanical strength.

Cochliodone A exerts antimalarial and antimycobacterial activities in addition to being cytotoxic against KB, BC1, and NCI-H187 human cancer cell lines. The potential of cochliodone A and its analogues as effective therapeutics against cancer, tuberculosis, and malaria, together with its complex dimeric chemical structure, are reasons enough for continued investigation. Here, sequence analyses of the open reading frames found in the previously identified cochliodone A biosynthetic gene cluster, together with a series of gene-knockout experiments, heterologous in vivo production of pathway intermediates in Aspergillus nidulans and in vitro assays of key enzymes allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway and detailed mechanisms leading to the production of cochliodones. In addition, we identified that the elimination of the dimerizing multicopper oxidase CcdJ from the ccd pathway led to pathway crosstalk between the ccd pathway and an unrelated benzaldehyde-producing biosynthetic pathway formation to generate new secondary metabolites. Most interestingly, however, through the in vitro study, we established that the sequential actions of an acetyltransferase, an acetate lyase, and an enoyl reductase achieve a full reduction of the unsaturated backbone of the polyketide (PKs) product generated by the nonreducing polyketide synthase (PKS) CcdL. This alternative mode of reducing a polyketomethylene chain could be engineered further to develop a facile chemoenzymatic modification of the polyketide backbone saturation level postpolyketide synthesis in trans .},

  abstract     = {Inorganic semiconductors are composed of heavy elements whose vibrational motions are well described by classical mechanics. Heavy elements, such as Pb and I, support charge carriers in metal halide perovskites. Nevertheless, the soft structure and strong coupling between the organic and inorganic components create conditions in which nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can play important roles. By combining ab initio, ring-polymer, and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics approaches with time-domain density functional theory, we demonstrate how NQEs influence structural and electronic properties and electron-vibrational dynamics in hybrid organic–inorganic (MAPbI 3 ) and all-inorganic (CsPbI 3 ) perovskites. Quantum zero-point fluctuations enhance structural disorder, reduce the band gap, and accelerate elastic electron-vibrational scattering responsible for coherence loss. NQEs have opposite influences on intraband carrier relaxation and interband recombination. These inelastic scattering events are governed by the product of the overlap-like electron–phonon matrix element and atomic velocity. NQEs reduce the overlap and increases the velocity. The intraband carrier relaxation involves many states. Reduction of overlap between some states is offset by other pathways, while an increased velocity makes intraband relaxation faster. Electron–hole overlap in band-edge states plays a key role in the recombination, and its reduction by NQEs-enhanced disorder makes the recombination slower. This phenomenon is seen with both MAPbI 3 and CsPbI 3 and is much more pronounced when a light organic component is present. This study offers a detailed understanding of the role of NQEs in the carrier relaxation processes of perovskites, offering important theoretical insights into hot carriers and carrier recombination that govern the performance of solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.},

Büchner reaction is a unique type of expansive skeletal editing that transforms benzenoids into functionalized cycloheptatrienes. However, due to challenges in compatibility and selectivity, achieving seamless integration of this reaction with dearomative cycloaddition within a unified system remains undeveloped. Here, we demonstrated an energy-transfer-induced intermolecular dearomative skeletal editing reaction of benzenoids with a range of electronically diverse alkynes. This protocol employed N -acylimines as diradical precursors to efficiently construct various structurally diverse polycyclic frameworks in high chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselectivities that have been previously inaccessible. The challenges related to general reactivity and selectivity issues were circumvented through the smooth merging of photoinduced skeletal editing with dearomative cycloaddition. Experimental and computational studies were performed to support the diradical mechanism and interpret the origins of the observed chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselectivities.},

  abstract     = {We describe an in situ -polymerized conformal thin layer coating of narrow band gap carbon-rich carbon nitride (NBG-CRCN) on titania nanorod arrays to design a binary semiconductor heterojunction photocatalyst. The in situ polymerization creates a strong interaction between the TiO 2 nanorod substrate and the carbon nitride film, which prevents leaching of CRCN in liquid electrolytes. A unique aspect of our work is developing an easy and inexpensive technique for the heteroepitaxial growth of mechanically and photochemically stable carbon nitride thin films with intimate contact at the CN:TNR heterojunction interface. This method aids in overcoming one of the main problems with carbon nitride (CN), namely, the inability to produce an evenly distributed CN coating on a substrate. The synthesized NBG-CRCN@TNR extends the visible light absorption to 700 nm (E g = 1.7 eV) and red-shifts the photoluminescence (PL) emission peak to 580 nm. The peak shifts and broadening in the Raman spectra of the NBG-CRCN@TNR hybrid compared to those in TNR confirm an unusually strong interaction between TiO 2 and NBG-CRCN. An easy and inexpensive technique to heteroepitaxially grow CRCN (002) on rutile TiO 2 (110) is confirmed by advanced characterization. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) suggest the heteroepitaxial growth of (002) CRCN on rutile TiO 2 (110). Under AM1.5G solar illumination, the NBG-CRCN@TNR hybrid shows superior performance in photoelectrochemical water splitting, generating a photocurrent density as high as 4.3 mA cm –2 in 1 M KOH under 0.6 V external bias, rising to 8.4 mA cm –2 in the presence of a hole scavenger (methanol). An impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 26.51 μmol h –1 with 88.12% Faradaic efficiency is recorded. Establishing a high-quality interface between g-C 3 N 4 and titania permits effective charge carrier separation, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous-S batteries (ASBs) are emerging as promising energy storage technologies due to their high safety, low cost, and high theoretical energy density. However, the present understanding of sulfur evolution in water relies on experience derived from conventional organic electrolyte-based sulfur batteries (OSBs). The gap between ASB and OSB has impeded progress in advancing the rational design of sulfur catalysts in the aqueous phase. Herein, we reveal the unique interaction between H 2 O and S species, which is fundamentally distinguishable from the organic counterparts. A series of spectroscopy analyses discloses that elemental sulfur is initially reduced to polysulfides (mainly S 4 2– ), which subsequently react with H 2 O to generate HS – , involving both polysulfide conversion and the Volmer step of water dissociation. Combined electrochemical and computational analysis further proposes an aqueous-S catalyst selection metric based on simultaneous polysulfide adsorption and Volmer-step catalysis. As a proof of concept, we have successfully prioritized the Mo 2 C-catalyzed ASBs with a superior rate capability of 1040 mAh g –1 than the Fe 3 C (693 mAh g –1 ) and pure C (510 mAh g –1 ) at a high current density of 5 A g –1 .

Leveraging the real-time, label-free detection capability of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, a molecularly responsive hydrogel film is introduced to enhance small molecule sensitivity. This advanced biosensing platform utilizes split-aptamer-cross-linked hydrogels (aptagels) engineered using 8-arm poly(ethylene glycol) macromers, capable of directly and reversibly detecting vancomycin. Investigation through SPR and optical waveguide mode, along with quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring, reveals that the reversible formation of analyte-induced ternary molecular complexes leads to aptagel contraction and significant refractive index changes. Optimization of aptamer cross-link distribution and complementarity of split-aptamer pairs maximizes conformational changes of the aptagel, demonstrating a detection limit of 160–250 nM for vancomycin (6–9 fold improvement over monolayer counterpart) with a broad linear sensing range up to 1 mM. The aptagel maintains stability over 24 h in blood serum and 5 weeks in diluted blood plasma (mimicking interstitial fluid). This structurally responsive aptagel platform with superior stability and sensitivity offers promising avenues for continuous in vivo monitoring of small molecules.},

  abstract     = {Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a pivotal role in cell signaling through their activation via dimerization. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the temporal dynamics of RTK activity and downstream signals, such as ERK, in determining the cell fate. To better understand these dynamics, it is essential to develop methods capable of controlling the RTK activity with high temporal resolution. However, techniques for precisely modulating the activity of endogenous RTKs without requiring genetic modification remain insufficiently established. In this study, we developed a DNA aptamer agonist, Met-azo-aptamer, which enables reversible optical control of the activity of the c-Met receptor, a member of the RTK family. This was achieved by incorporating azobenzene, a photoisomerizable molecule, into a DNA aptamer that binds to c-Met. This design allows light-induced switching between the active and inactive structures of the aptamer. When the aptamer was applied to HeLa cells and exposed to ultraviolet or blue light, phosphorylation signals within the cells were activated in response to the light patterns. Furthermore, by variation of the light patterns, the Met-azo-aptamer successfully controlled the timing, amplitude, and duration of downstream ERK activation. The Met-azo-aptamer developed in this study offers a high-resolution method for investigating the relationship between RTK activation patterns and cell function or fate.},

Herein, by assigning the activity and selectivity requirements to two independent single-atom sites, we deliberately engineered a Co–Zn DAC for promising H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis, from which the Co sites provided the activity response for oxygen reduction, and the Zn sites regulated the reaction selectivity toward the 2e – pathway. Through multidimensional in situ characterizations, a potential-dependent switching function of the Zn sites was revealed, which made the increase in H 2 O 2 production at various reaction stages controllable. As a result, efficient H 2 O 2 selectivity switching from 11.1% in the single Co atom catalyst to 94.8% in the Co–Zn DAC was realized, with a prominent turnover frequency of 2.7 s –1 among the reported H 2 O 2 -producing catalysts. Notably, a similar effect was also observed in M–Zn DACs (M = Pt, Ru, or Ni), which demonstrated the universal switcher role of the Zn sites. The real-time catalytic site behavior insights gained through this integrated experimental and theoretical study are envisioned to be valuable not only for the ORR but also for other energy catalysis reactions involving activity–selectivity trade-off issues.},

  abstract     = {Imide-based chlorinating reagents are mild and easy to use yet can lack the reactivity of charged chlorenium-ion donors. Here, we present a simple strategy for increasing the reactivity of these neutral chlorinating species by encapsulation inside a cationic coordination cage. Using this approach, we demonstrate that two different-sized Pd 2 L 4 cages can catalyze chlorolactonization and chlorocycloetherification reactions of acid and alcohol functionalized α and β-substituted styrene substrates with either 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DCDMH) or N -chlorosuccinimide (NCS) as the chlorenium sources. A kinetic study shows that the cages are proficient catalysts with a significant acceleration up to 10 5 . However, an unexpected dichotomy is revealed wherein the smaller cage, which is best preorganized to bind and nominally provide maximum activation of the imide reagent, shows an order of magnitude less acceleration than the larger cage that has apparently mismatched host–guest chemistry. When the scope of reactions is further extended to the chlorination of simple, unfunctionalized α-methylstyrene, the same pattern of cage reactivity is observed, suggesting that differences are not explained by coencapsulation. Computational studies indicate that the trend in reactivity is caused by the transition state being less fixed in the larger cage, allowing it to find optimal binding and thereby generate stronger interactions. This investigation highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cage reactivity to design new noncovalent catalysts for a greater range of transformations.},

  abstract     = {InP-based quantum dots (QDs) represent the major commercial success of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). A combination of the robust, mostly covalent, structure and nontoxic nature of the constituent elements makes them a QD material of choice for display and LED technologies. Despite successful commercial realization, InP NCs still lack synthetic versatility and robustness, seen, for instance, as a continued quest to substitute a commonly used pyrophoric and expensive tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine precursor. Herein, we propose solid-state, nonpyrophoric, and synthetically readily accessible acylphosphines as convenient phosphorus precursors for the synthesis of InP NCs. When combined with suitable anionic nucleophiles, such as arylthiolates, both tris(acyl)phosphines and indium complexes of bis(acyl)phosphines act as efficient sources of the P 3– anion, as corroborated by NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction studies. This type of reactivity is utilized in colloidal synthesis of uniform InP QDs with well-defined excitonic features in their optical absorption spectra, spanning 460–600 nm. The conversion kinetics and therefore the final NC size are controlled by the nature of acyl substituents and by the use of either indium or zinc long-chain carboxylates as ligands. The proposed acylpnictide route is anticipated to foster the development of other metal phosphide and metal arsenide NCs.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient and practical N -dealkylation reactions stands as a longstanding objective in synthetic chemistry. Inspired by the oxidative N -dealkylation reactions mediated by heme and nonheme metalloenzymes, we disclose a biomimetic oxidative N -dealkylation catalysis that utilizes a nonheme manganese complex bearing anthryl-appended aminopyridine ligand and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) as the terminal oxidant. A variety of Weinreb amides and cyclic aliphatic amines are efficiently transformed into valuable methyl hydroxamates and ω-amino acids through oxidative C–N bond cleavage. Mechanistic studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that a manganese(IV)-oxo aminopyridine cation radical species, which is formed via the bromoacetic acid-assisted heterolytic O–O bond cleavage of a presumed manganese(III)-hydroperoxo aminopyridine species and the subsequent intramolecular electron transfer (ET) from the anthryl group of the aminopyridine ligand to the manganese center, is the active intermediate that initiates the oxidative N -dealkylation reactions; this process is reminiscent to the heterolytic O–O bond cleavage of iron(III)-hydroperoxo porphyrin intermediates (Cpd 0) to form iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin π-cation radicals (Cpd I) that are responsible for diverse selective oxidation reactions. Moreover, it is revealed that the oxidative activation of the C–H bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom proceeds via a hydride transfer (HT) mechanism, which involves a concerted asynchronous proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), followed by an ET process. Thus, this study reports the first instance of catalytic oxidative N -dealkylation of a variety of tertiary amides, such as Weinreb amides and cyclic aliphatic amines, mediated by a Cpd I-like nonheme manganese(IV)-oxo aminopyridine cation radical species via an initial HT pathway.},

  abstract     = {Formycin A and pyrazofurin are two naturally occurring pyrazole-derived C -nucleosides with antibacterial and antiviral activities. While earlier studies have established the chemistry of C -glycosidic bond formation as well as the subsequent steps in the biosynthesis of formycin A and pyrazofurin, how the pyrazole ring itself is constructed remains elusive. While N–N bond formation in the pyrazole ring was previously reported to involve coupling of N 6 -hydroxylated l -lysine and l -glutamic acid catalyzed by the hydrazine synthetase PyfG, herein PyfG and its homologue ForJ are shown instead to recognize d -glutamate instead of l -glutamate. The hydrazine product of ForJ/PyfG catalysis then releases α-hydrazino d -glutamic acid upon processing by the NAD-dependent oxidoreductase ForL. Furthermore, N -acylation of α-hydrazino d -glutamate with an amino acid catalyzed by the ATP-grasp ligase ForM/PyfJ is indispensable for recognition by the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase ForR/PyfK to perform dehydrogenation of the Cα–N bond and thereby form a hydrazone intermediate. This work not only demonstrates that d -glutamic acid is the correct substrate for hydrazine biosynthesis but also reveals a cryptic N -acylation step in the assembly of the pyrazole core. These results thus provide significant insights into the biosynthesis of pyrazole rings that are rarely seen in natural products.},

Photocatalytic generation of a difluoroacetyl radical followed by carbon–carbon bond formation results in a prochiral carbon-centered radical that engages with the chiral catalyst. A trialkylamine reductant is proposed to turn over the catalyst in this net-reductive transformation. Notably, incorporating an ( S )-β-methyl-substituted cysteine as the N -terminal residue improved selectivity relative to that of the native N -terminal cysteine (Cys) residue, and X-ray crystallographic analysis supports the conformational underpinning of this effect. A range of enantioenriched γ-substituted amides were synthesized in up to a 96:4 enantiomeric ratio, demonstrating the broad functional group tolerance of this method.

  abstract     = {Increasing the connectivity of structural units presents a potentially valuable approach to improve hydrolytic stability in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). We herein leverage this strategy by synthesizing the first tritopic benzotriazolate MOF, Zn 5 (OAc) 4 (TBTT) 2 (H 3 TBTT = 2,4,6-tris(1 H -benzo[ d ][1,2,3]triazol-5-yl)-1,3,5-triazine), which exhibits open metal sites, high connectivity, high porosity, and significant water uptake capacity. The MOF adopts a previously unknown topology with (3,6,6)-connectivity, which is supported by single-crystal electron diffraction and elemental analysis. The framework undergoes postsynthetic metal and anion exchange with NiCl 2 , which increases the accessible pore volume and the net hydrophilicity of the framework. With this exchange, the apparent BET surface area increases from 1994 to 3034 m 2 /g, and the water uptake step shifts from 56 to 33% relative humidity (RH). The high gravimetric capacity of the Ni-rich MOF, 0.98 g/g, translates to a working capacity of 0.64 g/g during a pressure swing cycle between 20 and 40% RH at 25 °C. Combining this performance with a less than 2% loss in working capacity over 100 cycles, the new material rivals the best MOF water sorbents to date.},

However, some have argued that the droplet generation methods provided energy to the reactions, and the different interfaces that the droplets contact also played important roles; therefore, it is the droplet activation or the environment, not the intrinsic properties, that is responsible for the observed chemistry. In this study, we used adiabatic expansion and dry ice in water to generate homogeneous, contactless, supercooled, and unactivated microdroplets. A large variety of reactions were successfully tested. We opine that it is the intrinsic properties, and not droplet activation, that are responsible for microdroplet chemistry.},

This study investigates the phase transition of marcasite-type orthorhombic Ba 0.9 M 0.1 NCN carbodiimides, where a transformation to a CsCl-type tetragonal phase was observed at room temperature under hydrostatic pressure of 0.8 GPa (M = Ca) and 0.3 GPa (M = Sr). This transition, accompanied by an increase in the metal coordination under from 6 to 8, occurs at pressures significantly lower than those required for the high-pressure phase transitions of rock-salt-type metal halides and marcasite-type metal diantimonides. Remarkably, partial phase transitions were also induced by hand milling, a process that applies localized shear forces, distinct from the particle-crushing effects of high-energy ball milling. The transition mechanism, analyzed via variable-cell nudged elastic band (VCNEB) calculations, revealed that while the linear NCN 2– anions remain stable, the shear-sliding of Ba 2+ cations and the rotation of NCN 2– anions are critical to the structural transformation. These findings underscore the potential of hand milling to effectively induce phase transitions in compounds containing linear molecular anions, offering new strategies for predicting and controlling such transitions in similar materials.},

Recently, the role of dynamic restructuring of Pd regions at and near the nanoparticle surface in response to modulating gas (H 2 and O 2 ) concentrations was highlighted for controlling the surface Pd oxide stoichiometry. Here, we investigate the mechanism of formation and decomposition of Pd hydride (PdH x ) at and near the bimetallic nanoparticle surfaces, a key species for controlling the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pd catalysts in many hydrogenation reactions. We employ modulation excitation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ME-XAS) to directly observe the time scale of PdH x formation and decomposition on the surface of Pd–Au nanoparticles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide additional insights into the stability and energetics of PdH x formation under varying H fractions and Pd substructures. Our results reveal a complex interplay between Pd ensemble size, surface structure, and hydrogen environment in determining the kinetics and thermodynamics of PdH x formation. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying surface PdH x formation and decomposition, the rational design of dynamic catalysts with controlled Pd hydride stoichiometries can become possible.},

  abstract     = {Carboxylate diradical intermediates, with α-carbon and carboxylic oxygen acting as reactive radical centers, represent a highly attractive and long-sought species in reaction design and synthesis. However, capturing these intermediates for diradical coupling reactions poses a formidable challenge due to their inherent instability and spontaneous decarboxylation. Here, we addressed this challenge by temporarily masking the carboxylate oxygen radical reactivity via a photocleavable dynamic oxygen–iodine bond. This approach effectively prevents unwanted decarboxylation and enables the controlled utilization of the carboxylate oxygen radical in forming new bonds. Carboxylates and alkenes/heteroarenes, among the most readily available raw materials, can now seamlessly couple via radical pathways to form γ-butyrolactones, which are common motifs found in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. Ionic reaction pathways via traditional intermediates of carboxylates are ruled out based on experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy overcomes the substrate limitations of traditional methods, significantly expanding the range of applicable alkenes/heteroarenes. Our method allows transforming carboxylates and alkenes via new reaction modes to diverse products and offers new insights into developing di- and multiradical equivalents for unprecedented reactions and synthetic designs.},

The lanthanum complex 1 La is the first benzene tetra-anion complex of the largest rare-earth element. Aromaticity in the 10π-electron benzene ligands is confirmed through crystallographic studies of all compounds and nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations on 1 Y and 1 La . Analysis of the bonding in 1 Y and 1 La using density functional theory revealed strong covalency in the metal-benzene interactions, with very similar contributions from the metal 4d/5d orbitals, respectively, and the benzene π* orbitals. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on 1 Sm , 1 Gd , and 1 Dy are also consistent with the presence of a benzene tetra-anion ligand. The origins of the appreciable exchange coupling constant of J exch = −3.35 cm –1 (−2 J formalism) in 1 Gd are established through a computational study of the interacting magnetic orbitals. The dynamic magnetic properties of 1 Dy are also described. The clear absence of SMM behavior in the dysprosium complex is explained using multireference calculations and an ab initio ligand-field theory description of the 4f orbitals, which clearly show that the benzene tetra-anion ligand provides a dominant equatorial contribution.},

  abstract     = {Flexible organic crystals represent a novel class of smart materials that open many opportunities for optical applications. While it has been established that elastic or plastic deformation of slender molecular crystals can be commonly induced by external intervention, crystals that grow in bent or curled shapes naturally are rarely reported. This study introduces an extraordinarily flexible organic crystalline fibrous material, ( Z )-3-(2,3-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)acrylonitrile (DPA), that crystallizes both as straight and curled crystals. Crystals of DPA are easily obtained from solution either as long fibers or as crystals that are curled to various extent, and sometimes even closed into a loop. The straight crystalline fibers can be bent mechanically by applying force or photochemically by exposure to ultraviolet light. The straight and curled crystals are both polar and capable of highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) with respective intensities of 2.03 ± 0.15 and 1.52 ± 0.12 times (equivalent strain ≈ 1%) that of urea. Curling during crystal growth provides direct access to curved SHG-active flexible organic optical waveguiding elements, such as crystalline optical ring resonators, thereby circumventing the necessity for manual crystal bending, which is usually not readily scalable. This work highlights the unconventional properties and capabilities that fibrous molecular crystalline materials bring to the global materials space and their potential applications as shape-conforming, nonlinear organic materials.},

  abstract     = {Cereblon E3 ligase modulatory drugs (CELMoDs) can be used to target proteins and mark them for proteasomal degradation by recruiting them to cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor of the CRL4 CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Modifications to the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of distal functionality on CELMoDs have been shown to have large effects on degradation activity and selectivity; however, methods allowing the rapid and selective introduction of enantioenriched moieties are rare. Herein, we report that classical CRBN-binding glutarimide cores can be successfully derivatized to aryl diazoacetates. These diazo derivatives, when in the presence of a dirhodium catalyst, successfully undergo high-yielding and highly enantioselective C–H functionalization of hydrocarbons and cyclopropanation of styrene. These products can be used to create not only molecular glue degrader-like compounds but also intermediates that can be elaborated into effective bifunctional ligand-directed degraders. Our findings highlight both the effectiveness of dirhodium catalysis in a drug discovery context and a new method for preparing diverse and stereoenriched glutarimide-containing compounds.},

  abstract     = {Systems that change properties upon exposure to chemical stimuli offer the interesting prospect of (partially) mimicking the functions of living systems. Over the past decade, numerous supramolecular systems whose chemical composition and properties are regulated by the dissipation of chemical fuels have been reported. These systems are typically based on the transient transformation of a “dormant” species into an active, self-assembling supramolecular monomer. The process is powered by fuel consumption and terminates upon fuel depletion, restoring the initial dormant state. Previously reported out-of-equilibrium supramolecular polymerizations relied on the activation of the dormant species by adding or removing small structural units to enable supramolecular polymerization. Here, we present an approach that combines the reversibility of dynamic covalent chemistry and supramolecular chemistry to trigger transient supramolecular polymerizations by “recycling” the components of a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL). Treatment of an equilibrated DCL of aliphatic imines and aromatic amines with an activated carboxylic acid (ACA) generates a dissipative dynamic combinatorial library of aromatic imines and protonated aliphatic amines. The transient acidic conditions enable the creation of a supramolecular polymer held together by interactions between the protonated aliphatic amines and the crown ether moieties embedded in the scaffold of the aromatic imines. Thus, fuel dissipation reshuffles the chemical connectivity and enables the temporary transformation of a purely covalent (polymeric) system into a supramolecular polymer. We demonstrate the strategy using two different covalent dormant feedstocks consisting of a diimine macrocycle involving a calix[4]arene scaffold and a distribution of imine (cyclo)oligomers derived from an isophthalaldehyde skeleton.},

In this study, we provide a synthetic route to an NHC-stabilized boryl radical cation as a salt of the weakly coordinating [Al(OR F ) 4 ] − ( R F = C(CF 3 ) 3 ) anion. The synthetic procedure was extended to dicationic diboron derivatives of Schlenk’s and Thiele’s hydrocarbons with meta - and para -phenylene coupling units between the spin centers. While most known isolable boron biradicals have a singlet ground-state with a thermally accessible triplet state, the boron version of Schlenk’s hydrocarbon occupies a ground-state triplet spin-state, as shown by combined electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory studies. Furthermore, initial reactivity studies of the dications with elemental sulfur and diphenyldiselenide are presented.},

The class-I photolyases have been well characterized through a direct electron-transfer (ET) tunneling mechanism with high repair quantum yield, but such a mechanism seemingly does not apply to all of the members in the diversified photolyase family. Here, using femtosecond spectroscopy, we show our systematic characterization of CPD repair by the class-II photolyases from Methanosarcina mazei and Drosophila melanogaster and reveal their complete photocycles with determination of reaction times of all ten elementary steps, including seven electron-transfer processes. We found that the initial electron injection bifurcates along two parallel routes, direct tunneling and two-step hopping. Unlike the class-I photolyases, the direct tunneling process here is significantly slower, occurring in several nanoseconds. This slow tunneling route leads to shifting of the branching yield toward the intrinsic two-step hopping pathway through the adenine intermediate. Throughout the photolyase family, the enzymes have adopted a unified bifurcating electron-transfer strategy as a universal repair mechanism through evolution.},

  abstract     = {Graphene nanoribbons (NRs) constitute a versatile platform for developing novel materials, where their structure governs their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties while also shaping their excited-state dynamics. Here, we investigate a set of three twisted N-doped molecular NRs of increasing length, obtained by linearly fusing perylene diimide to pyrene and pyrazino- or thiadiazolo-quinoxaline residues. By employing various temperature-dependent time-resolved spectroscopy techniques, we reveal how the flexible twisted NR geometry promotes the formation of a mixed electronic state with varying contributions from locally excited and charge-transfer (CT) states. The fate of this mixed state is highly sensitive to the molecular geometry, length, and solvent polarity. For the shortest NR, intersystem crossing dominates the deactivation pathway, efficiently generating triplets in low-polarity solvents. In contrast, for the extended NRs, intramolecular singlet fission (SF) takes place within a single nanoribbon. This is enabled by enhanced superexchange coupling due to a pronounced push–pull nature and the existence of multiple localized π-electron states caused by heteroatom doping, thereby circumventing the need for dimeric interactions typically associated with conventional SF systems. In higher-polarity environments, evidence of a (diabatic) CT state emerges. These findings underscore the intricate relationship between geometry, energy levels, and excited-state dynamics in twisted N-doped NRs.},

However, the development of ideal adsorbents with simultaneous high C 2 H 2 adsorption and selectivity remains a great challenge due to their very small molecular sizes and physical properties. Herein, we report a lithium(I)-chelation strategy for pore space partition (PSP) in a microporous MOF (Li + @NOTT-101-(COOH) 2 ) to achieve simultaneous high C 2 H 2 uptake and selectivity. The chelation model of Li + ions within the framework was visually identified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The immobilized Li + ions were found to have two functions: (1) partitioning large pore cages into smaller ones while maintaining high surface area and (2) providing specific binding sites to selectively take up C 2 H 2 over CO 2 . The resulting Li + @NOTT-101-(COOH) 2 exhibits a rare combination of a simultaneous high C 2 H 2 capture capacity (205 cm 3 g –1 ) and C 2 H 2 /CO 2 selectivity (13) at ambient conditions, far surpassing that of NOTT-101-(COOH) 2 (148 cm 3 g –1 and 3.8, respectively) and most top-tier materials reported. Theoretical calculations and gas-loaded SCXRD studies reveal that the chelated Li + ions combined with the segmented small cages can selectively bind with a large amount of C 2 H 2 through the unique π-complexation, accounting for the improved C 2 H 2 uptake and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its excellent separation capacity for actual C 2 H 2 /CO 2 mixtures, providing one of the highest C 2 H 2 productivities of 118.9 L kg –1 (&gt;99.5% purity) in a single adsorption–desorption cycle.},

Emerging evidence has indicated that oxidative stress and reduced norepinephrine are key pathological features of depression. Herein, we constructed a smart organic small-molecule fluorescence-based therapeutic system (Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 ) for the diagnosis and treatment of depression targeted at restoring redox homeostasis and efficiently upregulating norepinephrine in the brain. Utilizing Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 , we could evaluate the depressive phenotype via the fluorescence monitoring of the redox state in mouse brains. By reducing hydrogen peroxide and continuously increasing norepinephrine, Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 elicited a synergistic antidepressant action. Furthermore, we identified that Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 can promote the expression of genes such as Grin2a, Drd1, and Fxyd2 related to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway, upregulate glutathione and cysteine to alleviate oxidative stress, and boost neuronal activity by enhancing dopaminergic synapses, ultimately achieving an effective antidepressant response. Taken together, this work provides a new strategy for the evaluation of depression and appropriate treatments and identifies the mechanisms underlying antioxidant and norepinephrine disorders in the brain as potential targets for the development of novel diagnostics and treatments for depression.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogenase enzymes catalyze the reduction of N 2 to NH 3 at a complex Fe-M (M = Mo, Fe, or V) cofactor (FeMco), which displays eight metal centers and sulfide and carbide bridges with a MFe 7 S 8 C composition. The role of the unusual μ 6 -carbide ligand and its effects on the metal centers remain unclear. Here, we describe the transfer of a carbide ligand to a MoFe 3 S 3 cluster supported by a bisphenoxide ligand from a previously reported terminal Mo carbide complex to yield a pentametallic cluster of MoS 3 Fe 3 CMo composition, which also displays a bridging CO that resembles the lo-CO form of nitrogenase. This cluster has an S = 1/2 spin state amenable to studies by pulse EPR spectroscopy, revealing a significantly larger carbide 13 C hyperfine interaction ( a iso ( 13 C) = 12.5 MHz) than any observed for various states of FeMoco studied by EPR thus far (| a iso ( 13 C)| = 0.89 to 2.7 MHz). This report provides a strategy for the synthesis of carbide-containing iron–sulfur clusters relevant to nitrogenase cluster modeling, as well as benchmarking information for the metal–carbon interactions by EPR methods.},

  abstract     = {Cathelicidin-BF (CatBF) is a LL-37 homologous antimicrobial peptide (AMP) isolated from Bungarus fasciatus with an exceptional portfolio of antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, and anticancer activities. Contrary to many AMPs, it showed a good pharmacological profile with a half-life of at least 1 h in serum and efficacy against bacterial infections in mice. To evaluate its potential against resistant nosocomial infections, we assessed its activity against 81 clinically relevant resistant bacterial isolates. CatBF exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 0.5 μM against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Escherichia coli . Its wide-ranging activity, unaffected by resistance mechanisms or Gram phenotype, prompted us to investigate its molecular mode of action. NMR spectroscopy, paramagnetic probes, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to define its structure, penetration depth, and orientation in various membrane models, including micelles, bicelles, oriented bilayers, and vesicles. We found that CatBF’s potent activity relies on its strong charge, allowing membrane neutralization at low peptide/lipid ratios and selective recruitment of charged phospholipids. At higher concentrations, a change in peptide orientation reveals membrane invagination and the formation of transient pores possibly leading to bacterial death. Our findings highlight the potential of CatBF as a model for developing resistance-independent agents to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections.},

  abstract     = {The mycobacterial cell envelope plays both infectious and protective roles. Understanding its structure is crucial for unlocking the molecular basis underlying these functions. Studying glycans, the primary components of the cell envelope, is challenging due to their limited native functional handles for chemoselective modification. New labeling methods exploit biorthogonal chemistry, using small molecule mimics that intercept cellular metabolism or late-stage glycan biosynthesis. However, these strategies can have practical limitations, including probe delivery and effectiveness. An ideal small molecule probe should be easily deployed and exploit the critical enzyme–substrate relationships of natural substrates. To this end, we developed a “probegenic” strategy to label mycobacteria. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit substrate mimicry, as the relevant functionality is revealed by a target enzyme. Specifically, we synthesized an azide-substituted trans- β-lactone probe (AzLac), which adopts a substrate-like structure upon covalent enzyme labeling. This probe is incorporated by mycolyltransferases into a core mycobacterial cell envelope glycan, including in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Unlike other probes of the cell envelope, AzLac facilitates selective covalent labeling of the inner leaflet of the mycomembrane. Using Corynebacterium glutamicum mycolyltransferase deletion strains, we implicated Cmt2 as the primary mycolyltransferase target. We leveraged the ability to modify the cell envelope by demonstrating that AzLac could be used to attach a DNA barcode to mycobacteria, which would help track infection dynamics. Thus, we expect AzLac will be a valuable means of monitoring and tracking the mycobacterial cell envelope. Moreover, we anticipate masking and revealing recognition motifs in probes can be applied to diverse cellular targets.},

  abstract     = {The application of NMR to large RNAs has been limited by the inability to perform heteronuclear correlation experiments essential for resolving overlapping 1 H NMR signals, determining interproton distance restraints and interhelical orientations for structure calculations, and evaluating conformational dynamics. Approaches exploiting 1 H– 13 C correlations that are routinely applied to proteins and small RNAs of ∼60 nucleotides or fewer are impractical for larger RNAs due to rapid dipolar relaxation of protons by their attached carbons. Here we report a 2 H-enhanced, 1 H– 15 N correlation approach that enables atom-specific NMR characterization of much larger RNAs. Purine H8 transverse relaxation rates are reduced ∼20-fold with ribose perdeuteration, enabling efficient magnetization transfer via two-bond 1 H– 15 N couplings. We focus on H8–N9 correlation spectra which benefit from favorable N9 chemical shift anisotropy. Chemical shift assignment is enabled by retention of protons at the C1′ position, which allow measurement of two-bond H1′–N9 and through-space H1′–H8 correlations with only a minor effect on H8 relaxation. The approach is demonstrated for the 232 nucleotide HIV-1 Rev response element, where chemical shift assignments, 15 N-edited nuclear Overhauser effects, and 1 H– 15 N residual dipolar couplings are readily obtained from sensitive, high-resolution spectra. Heteronuclear correlated NMR methods that have been essential for the study of proteins can now be extended to RNAs of at least 78 kDa.},

Among complex superconductors, those containing distinct superconducting layers are quite rare. In this work, based on the block-layer model together with formation energy calculations, we have designed and successfully synthesized a quinary intermetallic compound, Th 2 Mo 2 Ir 2 Si 4 C. The new material crystallizes in an intergrowth structure with an alternate stacking of superconducting ThMo 2 Si 2 C and ThIr 2 Si 2 block layers along the crystallographic c axis. The interblock-layer interaction is dominated by the Si–Ir bonding, which results in a relatively shorter interlayer distance and a stronger coupling between [Mo 2 Si 2 C] and fluorite-type [Si 2 Ir 2 ] layers. Enhanced superconductivity, with a superconducting transition temperature of T c = 3.4 K and a zero-temperature upper critical field of H c2 (0) = 9.5 kOe, is revealed by measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The strategy of the block-layer design demonstrated here can be extended to other intergrowth systems with various functional motifs.},

The QUAO analysis clearly identifies a three-center interaction responsible for either hydrogen or chalcogen bonds: in the former, the σ-bond connecting the donor and hydrogen atom participating in the hydrogen bond interacts with the lone pair on the nucleophile acceptor via the hydrogen atom, while in the latter this same σ-bond interacts with the nucleophile lone pair via the donor chalcogen. The number of minimum energy structures increase dramatically from one for (H 2 O) 2 , three for (H 2 S) 2 , four for (H 2 Se) 2 , and finally six for (H 2 Te) 2 . The emergence of the chalcogen-bonded arrangements appears for (H 2 S) 2 with their subsequent energetic stabilization over the hydrogen-bonded minima manifesting in (H 2 Se) 2 and (H 2 Te) 2 . In particular, one of the (H 2 S) 2 , two of the (H 2 Se) 2 , and three of the (H 2 Te) 2 dimers are chalcogen bonded. Induction plays a small but important role in stabilizing hydrogen over chalcogen-bonded structures, while dispersion is more important for chalcogen bonds.},

Less frequently, molecular catalysts are employed to better control the reactivity toward desired products, yet the development of robust semiconductor/molecule interfaces has proven challenging. Here, we demonstrate that a 2–3 nm thermal oxide layer on Si exhibits stability in aqueous solution, high photovoltage, and a photocurrent density of ∼10 mA/cm 2 for the solar-driven photoelectrochemical reduction of a homogeneous molecular catalyst, producing syngas with an ∼2:1 H 2 to CO ratio. Because of a low defect density, the oxide interface forms an electron inversion layer with metal-like electron density at cathodic potentials. This inversion layer facilitates electron transfer to redox-active molecules via tunneling even if the molecule’s reduction potential is beyond the semiconductor’s conduction band edge. Using an electrolyte solution composed of a homogeneous cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst in a water/organic solvent mixture, stable photoelectrochemistry was observed under 1-sun illumination, exhibiting an ∼30% Faradaic efficiency for CO that was similar to a glassy carbon electrode under comparable conditions. The results demonstrate that an ultrathin thermal oxide interface is a robust platform for development of aqueous-stable, molecule-driven photoelectrocatalysis.},

Simple Se and ethyl modifications on methylene blue (MB) endow EBSe with a remarkable phototoxicity enhancement (&gt;2500 folds) and an excellent phototoxicity index (PI &gt; 32,000) to 4T1 cells under hypoxia. EBSe exhibits self-adaptive photodynamic processes that generate enhanced type I/II ROS under normoxia and elevate carbon radical production under hypoxia. Interestingly, EBSe shows much higher cell uptake and undergoes photoinduced lysosomal-to-nucleus translocation, which activates ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and oncosis. The synergism of three nonapoptotic pathways potentiates antitumor immune responses in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice.

While many of the Mtb divisome proteins have been identified, their structures and interactions remain largely unknown. Previous studies of CrgA using oriented-sample solid-state NMR have defined the tilt and rotation of the TM helices, but the cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains and even the oligomeric state were uncharacterized. Here, by combining oriented-sample and magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectra, we solved the full-length structure of CrgA. The structure features a dimer with a TM domain sandwiched between a cytoplasmic β-sheet and a periplasmic β-sheet. The β-sheets stabilize dimerization, which in turn increases CrgA’s ability to participate in multiple protein interactions. Within the membrane, CrgA binds FtsQ, CwsA, PbpA, FtsI, and MmPL3 via its TM helices; in the cytoplasm, Lys23 and Lys25 project outward from the β-sheet to interact with acidic residues of FtsQ and FtsZ. The structural determination of CrgA thus provides significant insights into its roles in recruiting other divisome proteins and stabilizing their complexes for Mtb cell wall synthesis and polar growth.},

However, thermal quenching significantly reduces radioluminescence efficiency, particularly for those phosphorescent scintillators with promising radiation-induced triplet exciton utilization, ultimately limiting their applications in high-temperature scenarios. Herein, we develop ultrahigh-temperature scintillators based on organic ionic host–guest phosphorescence systems with unprecedented thermal-stable emissions up to 673 K. The guest phosphor features spin-vibronic coupling-assisted intersystem crossing, effectively transforming phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence for overcoming thermal inactivation of triplet excitons. Meanwhile, the rigid ionic host and guest with robust electrostatic interactions minimize both the intrinsic and extrinsic nonradiations of excitons, the so-called dual-confined nonradiation. These two mechanisms work synergistically, contributing to the highly efficient triplet exciton-based luminescence with a room-temperature phosphorescence efficiency of 38.7% and ultrahigh-temperature-resistant dual emissions. Such an innovative ionic host–guest scintillator achieves an impressively low X-ray detection limit of 71.5 nGy s –1 and remarkably bright photoluminescence (efficiency of 80.4% at 483 K), enabling ultrahigh-temperature X-ray imaging.},

  abstract     = {Memory effect in ion transport (IT) at the solid–solution interface is uniquely attractive in that the conductance depends on or “memorizes” the previous states. Hysteretic and rectified transport properties offer exciting potential to developing advanced iontronics and neuromorphic functions, improving the efficiency of energy conversion and electrochemical processes, and overcoming the selectivity-throughput bottleneck in the enrichment of low abundant species for environment- and energy-friendly separations, among others. Herein, memory effects are discovered in the rectified electrokinetic IT through anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes containing densely packed highly ordered nanochannels (10 10 per cm 2 ). Characteristic memristor responses of pinched current–potential loops are resolved in voltammetric experiments and successfully reproduced through finite element simulation. Excitatory and inhibitory conductance states are shown to arise from the enrichment and depletion of mobile charge carriers. Structurewise, the transport symmetry is broken by the barrier oxide layer (BOL) on the one end of the cylindrical nanochannels across the AAO membranes. Charge selectivity is attributed to the gradient(s) of the space charge density across the BOL characterized by depth profiling via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The space charge gradient(s) overcomes the fundamental limitation of widely exploited surface charge effects to enable intense rectification and hysteresis prevailing at very high ionic concentrations up to 1–2 M. A new strategy is developed for controlling the preferential IT direction and selectivity via counterion intercalation and extraction/exchange.

  abstract     = {Quaternary stereocenters play a crucial role in shaping both the molecular topology of small molecules and the outcome of stereoselective transformations. While considerable progress has been achieved in constructing highly substituted carbon centers with varied substitution patterns, the stereoselective synthesis of quaternary carbon centers remains a significant challenge. Here we report a protocol for the precise manipulation of quaternary stereocenters through epimerization. The critical design element of our ketone α-epimerization process was developing a photoactive imine, which circumvents the numerous deleterious pathways of carbonyl photochemistry. Excitation of this imine with visible light in the presence of a photocatalyst enables reversible C–C bond cleavage and reformation to vary the stereochemistry of the quaternary center. This approach allows us to override intrinsic stereochemical outcomes of C–C bond construction, therefore providing novel tactics for retrosynthetic planning. The broad utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the topological alteration of various classes of carbocyclic scaffolds bearing diverse functional groups.},

  abstract     = {Bulk Li + -conducting lithium superionic conductors are susceptible to disruption by grain boundaries and interparticle porosity, necessitating high densification and consequently limiting the gravimetric energy density of solid-state batteries. Here, we discovered a new class of surface-conducting lithium superionic conductors achieved through surface chemisorption. After bonding with ligands, surface atoms of inert substrates become binding sites for lithium salt dissociation and hopping sites for fast surface Li + diffusion, transforming inert materials into surface-conducting Li + conductors. Using two-dimensional TiO 2 nanosheets as a proof of concept, we show that ethylene glycolate-chemisorbed TiO 2 significantly enhances lithium salt dissociation and promotes fast Li + hopping between surface oxygen atoms, achieving a high surface ion mobility of 3.61 × 10 –7 cm 2 ·V –1 ·s –1 ─an improvement of 600% over the bulk Li + mobility of Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 solid oxide electrolytes. Benefiting from surface Li + conduction, an ultralight oxide aerogel solid-state electrolyte was developed with an unprecedented low density of 0.29 g·cm –3 , which is only 25% of that of liquid electrolytes and 5.7% of garnet-type solid electrolytes. A LiFePO 4 -based solid-state battery utilizing this new electrolyte exhibits a significantly high energy density of ∼295 Wh·kg –1 , achieving 160% of that of a Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 -based solid-state battery even with the same electrolyte thickness. Furthermore, this guideline for designing surface-conducting superionic conductors is generalizable and can be extended to diverse cations and substrates, promising lightweight, highly conductive solid-state electrolytes with broad implications beyond solid-state batteries.},

Here, we introduce a new series of donor–chiral bridge–acceptor (D−χ–A) molecules that demonstrate significant MFEs on fluorescence intensity and lifetime in solution at room temperature─critical for quantum sensing. By precisely tuning the donor site through torsional locking, distance extension, and planarization, we achieved remarkable control over key quantum properties, including field-response range and line width. In the most responsive systems, emission lifetimes increased by over 200%, and the total emission intensity was modulated by up to 30%. This level of tunability shows the power of synthetic spin chemistry. The rational design principle of optically addressable SCRP-based molecular systems, presented in this work, represents a major leap toward functional synthetic molecular qubits, advancing the field of molecular quantum technologies.},

Building such structures with biocompatible peptides offers a potential for prescribed structural addressability and enhanced ETp capability with implications for targeted neural tissue engineering. However, creating ordered π–π tunnels in peptide nanostructures composed entirely of natural amino acids presents challenges resulting from the flexible side chains and the free movement of aromatic residues, causing unpredictable orientation. In this study, a novel peptide nanostructure was constructed through rational design and high-throughput screening leveraging hierarchical β-sheets to achieve molecular programmability. Precise regulation of key residues at the aromatic–hydrophilic junctions within the peptide chain facilitated the transition from single interaction forces (hydrophobic or hydrogen bonding) to synergistic forces, enabling the formation of supramolecular clamps during the lateral stacking of β-sheets. The clamps compel the torsion-angle alternation between aromatic residues and the β-plane, increasing the stacking order of aromatic rings and reducing the π–π distance in the optimized RT peptide system. The RT system promotes the formation of an orderly delocalized electron tunnel, achieving dry-state molecular conductivity composed entirely of natural amino acids. Besides ETp, the RT system also provides neural-targeting capability, flexibility, and mechanical strength, allowing it to support axon elongation and neural restoration, serving as an advanced neuro-electronic interface.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the discovery of unconventional polyhydrides under high pressure, including notable instances like CaH 6 , YH 9 , and LaH 10 , with superconducting critical temperature ( T c ) above 200 K, has ignited considerable interest in the quest for high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-based materials. Recent studies have suggested the highly probable existence of hydrogen vacancies in these high- T c superconducting hydrides, although there is no conclusive evidence. In this study, taking niobium (Nb) hydride as a model, we showcase the observation of nonstoichiometric face-centered cubic ( fcc ) NbH 4-δ (δ∼0.23–0.51) at pressures ranging from 113 to 175 GPa, employing in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments in conjunction with first-principles calculations. Remarkably, our further analyses indicate that the hydrogen vacancies, along with the resulting configurational entropy, play crucial roles in stabilizing this nonstoichiometric fcc NbH 4-δ . Electrical transport measurements confirmed the superconductivity, as evidenced by zero resistance as well as suppression of T c with applying magnetic fields, with a T c reaching up to 34 K. Our current results not only confirm the presence of hydrogen vacancies in high- T c hydrides, but also provide key insights into the understanding of hydrogen-vacancy-induced stability for nonstoichiometric hydrides under high pressure.},

  abstract     = {Ti-catalyzed alkyne diamination and alkyne hydrohydrazination proceed through a common N -aminoazatitanacyclobutene intermediate. These reactions have historically existed as processes catalyzed by distinct molecular Ti compounds, with several reports for hydrohydrazination and only a single example for diamination. Here, we demonstrate that a diamidoamine Ti catalyst, (NNN)Ti(═NN R 2 ) ( 1, (NNN)H 2 = N -methyl- N ’, N ″-bis(trimethylsilyl)diethylenetriamine; R = alkyl, aryl), is capable of catalyzing both diamination and hydrohydrazination, where the selectivity is dictated by simple changes to the reaction conditions. This approach capitalizes on the fact that there are entropic differences at the selectivity branch point between diamination (unimolecular) and hydrohydrazination (bimolecular). This discovery leads to an expanded substrate scope for alkyne diamination and provides an understanding of how structure–activity relationships can impact the relative rates (selectivity) of diamination and hydrohydrazination. These structure–activity relationships, anchored on 15 N NMR descriptors, were then used to design a novel, highly active, and selective diamination catalyst, (NNN SiMe2Ph )Ti(═NN R 2 ) ( 1f ), which contains bulkier flanking amide ligands. More broadly, these results suggest that this strategy may be applied more generally to Ti hydrohydrazination catalysts to uncover new catalysts capable of alkyne diamination with 1,1-disubstituted hydrazines.},

  abstract     = {Li–O 2 batteries have aroused considerable interest due to high theoretical energy density; however, the singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generated in both discharge and charge processes induces severe parasitic reactions and leads to their low round-trip efficiency and poor rechargeability. Herein, a universal heavy atom-induced quenching mechanism is proposed to suppress 1 O 2 and related side reactions. Br in tris(4-bromophenyl)amine (TBPA) induces strong heavy atom-induced spin–orbit coupling (SOC), enhancing the interaction between the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum of the electron. It enables TBPA to capture electrophilic 1 O 2 to form a singlet complex and then effectively drives the spin-forbidden spin-flip process to form a triplet complex. This accelerates the conversion of 1 O 2 to ground-state 3 O 2 through a heavy atom-induced intersystem crossing mechanism, and it efficiently eliminates its attack on organic solvents and carbon cathodes. These endow the Li–O 2 battery with reduced overvoltages and prolonged lifespan for over 350 cycles when coupled with a RuO 2 catalyst. This work highlights the heavy atom-induced SOC to quench 1 O 2 in oxygen evolution reaction-related devices.},

  abstract     = {For water splitting, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying reaction intermediates and pathways is crucial for optimizing catalyst design. Among the most well-known active photoanodes for the oxygen evolution half-reaction are TiO 2 -based materials. A hole polaron, which consists of a metal-oxide distortion around trapped holes, has been suggested as a local reactive oxygen configuration. While first-principles calculations identify new electronic states in the middle of the band gap and the influence of trapped hole dynamics on transport, an assignment of hole polaron configurations to a measured spectrum has been challenging due to broad optical transitions in the visible regime. Here, we compare the excited-state absorption (ESA) for two titanium oxide materials with a similar electronic structure but differing crystal structure. The ESA maximum for ultrafast time scales (&lt;1 ps) is isolated by a principal component analysis and shifts from 3.1 eV in rutile TiO 2 (100) to 2.2 eV in perovskite SrTiO 3 . Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations predict the energies of the midgap states for stable hole polarons and their corresponding spectra. The shift in the ESA is rationalized by the transition optical dipole originating from both edge and deeper states in the valence band being bright for certain configurations of hole polarons in rutile TiO 2 (100) (terminal O •– ) versus STO (lateral Ti 2 O •– ). The spectral assignment of a shifting ESA between two titanium oxide materials informs the assignment of hole polaron configurations for oxygen evolution catalysis and, more generally, photodriven processes.},

The amount of hydrogen loaded into the palladium can be controlled electrochemically to form a well-defined and static PdH x ratio for studying chemical hydrogenation. These static PdH x ratios are otherwise difficult to achieve. We show a preference for homolytic hydrogen transfer pathways at lower current densities and heterolytic hydrogen transfer pathways at higher current densities.

The interaction between adsorbed catalyst vibrations and the QD electron intraband absorption can influence the photophysical properties of both the QD and the catalysts and potentially their photocatalysis. In CdSe QDs functionalized by the CO 2 reduction catalyst, Re(CO) 3 (4,4’-bipyridine-COOH)Cl, we observe that the transient Fano resonance signal resulting from coupling of the catalyst CO stretching mode and the QD conduction band electron mid-IR intraband absorption appears on an ultrafast time scale and decays with the electron population, irrespective of the occurrence of photoreduced catalysts. The Fano asymmetry factor increases with an increase in the adsorbed catalyst number and a decrease in QD sizes. The latter can be attributed to an enhanced charge transfer interaction between the more strongly quantum-confined QD conduction band and catalyst LUMO levels. These results provide a more in-depth understanding of interactions in excited QD-catalyst hybrid photocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {The protonation of CO is recognized as the rate-determining step in the generation of C1 products during the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on Cu surfaces. However, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source remain elusive. While density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the GGA level have been widely used, they struggle to accurately describe adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. Here, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed surface water acts as the proton source for *CO reduction to *COH over a broad potential range via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation and consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H 2 O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potentials within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO 2 RR modeling. These insights illustrate a pronounced divergence between RPA and DFT-GGA results. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on proton transfer in CO 2 RR and establish a framework for future theoretical studies on electrochemical processes.},

Although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been established as a powerful analytical technique for interface chemistry, the necessity for ultrahigh vacuum remains a significant obstacle to directly detecting dynamic interfacial evolution, particularly in aqueous environments. Here, we employ tender-energy ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) to bridge the gap between ultrahigh vacuum and near-atmospheric pressure, enabling an in-depth investigation of the molecule-crowded aqueous interface evolution in a Zn metal anode. The results demonstrate that the persistent presence of additive molecules effectively inhibits direct contact between reactive Zn and H 2 O, while also facilitating uniform Zn deposition. In situ optical microscopy observations and synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction further verified the uniform and dense Zn deposition, attributed to lateral growth induced by the (002) crystal facet evolution. As proof of its effectiveness, batteries incorporating the Zn//Zn, Zn//Cu, and full cell with the additive demonstrate significantly improved stability and reversibility.

  abstract     = {Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) play an important role in gene therapy, yet the optimal preparation of these biotherapeutics remains challenging, with often incomplete incorporation of genome cargo, negatively affecting therapeutic use. Genome packaging has traditionally been difficult to investigate. Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) has gained prominence, as it provides the ability to mass analyze and resolve empty and filled rAAVs, enabling the quantitative determination of empty-to-filled rAAV ratios. Such measurements require a high mass resolving power and depend on the unbiased detectability of the distinct rAAV particles. The mass resolving power in the Orbitrap mass analyzers scales with transient recording times. Therefore, we extended the capability of recording ions from 1 or 2 to 24 s. When we record these 24 s transients to analyze rAAVs, we not only observe a substantial improvement in accuracy and mass resolution but also find that this can lead to erroneous artifacts in the empty-to-filled ratios. Artifacts originate from the distinct behavior between orbiting ions from either empty or filled particles, mainly due to differences in desolvation and charge losses. Ions from empty rAAVs appear much more susceptible to charge losses, which negatively affect their tracing, artificially decreasing the empty-to-filled ratios. Further elucidating the causes of this undesirable ion behavior, we provide the means to minimize charge losses, thus regaining accurate AAV quantification at an increased charge precision and mass-resolving power. As the Orbitrap-based CDMS has become a method of choice to determine this important quality control attribute, our findings are important to avoid reporting incorrect empty-to-filled ratios.},

Using online mass spectrometry, we directly detected the dioxygen splitting products O 3 – and H 2 O·O 3 – in microdroplets. The high electric field at the air–water interface, along with microlightning between oppositely charged water microdroplets, induces an electrical discharge responsible for the O–O bond cleavage, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Isotope labeling experiments further reveal that various ROS, i.e., ·OH, CO 3 – , and HCO 4 – , can be generated through the reaction of dioxygen splitting products with water or CO 2 .

  abstract     = {Enzyme engineering and discovery are crucial for a sustainable future bioeconomy. Harvesting new biocatalysts from large libraries through directed evolution or functional metagenomics requires accessible, rapid assays. Ultrahigh-throughput screening formats often require optical readouts, leading to the use of model substrates that may misreport target activity and necessitate bespoke synthesis. This is a particular challenge when screening glycosyl hydrolases, which leverage molecular recognition beyond the target glycosidic bond, so that complex chemical synthesis would have to be deployed to build a fluoro- or chromogenic substrate. In contrast, coupled assays represent a modular “plug-and-play” system: any enzyme–substrate pairing can be investigated, provided the reaction can produce a common intermediate which links the catalytic reaction to a detection cascade readout. Here, we establish a detection cascade producing a fluorescent readout in response to NAD(P)H via glutathione reductase and a subsequent thiol-mediated uncaging reaction, with a low nanomolar detection limit in plates. Further scaling down to microfluidic droplet screening is possible: the fluorophore is leakage-free and we report 3 orders of magnitude-improved sensitivity compared to absorbance-based systems, with a resolution of 361,000 product molecules per droplet. Our approach enables the use of nonfluorogenic substrates in droplet-based enrichments, with applicability in screening for glycosyl hydrolases and imine reductases (IREDs). To demonstrate the assay’s readiness for combinatorial experiments, one round of directed evolution was performed to select a glycosidase processing a natural substrate, beechwood xylan, with improved kinetic parameters from a pool of &gt;10 6 mutagenized sequences.},

Here we develop and validate the Holdup Multiplex, a versatile assay with a mass spectrometry (MS) readout for profiling the affinities of a protein for large pools of peptides. The method can precisely quantify, in one single run, thousands of affinity constants over several orders of magnitude. The throughput, dynamic range, and sensitivity can be pushed to the performance limit of the MS readout. We applied the Holdup Multiplex to quantify in a few sample runs the affinities of the 14–3–3s, phosphoreader proteins highly abundant in humans, for 1000 different phosphopeptides. The seven human 14–3–3 isoforms were found to display similar specificities but staggered affinities, with 14–3–3γ being always the best binder and 14–3–3ε and σ being the weakest. Hundreds of new 14–3–3 binding sites were identified. We also identified dozens of 14–3–3 binding sites, some intervening in key signaling pathways, that were either stabilized or destabilized by the phytotoxin Fusicoccin-A. The results were corroborated by X-ray crystallography. Finally, we demonstrated the transferability of the Holdup Multiplex by quantifying the interactions of a PDZ domain for 5400 PBM peptides at once.

In this study, we determined the X-ray structures of β3GalT5 in complex with the stable donor analogue UDP-2-fluorogalactose or the native donor substrate UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and several glycan acceptors at different reaction steps. Based on the structures obtained from our experiments, β3GalT5 catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-Gal to a broad spectrum of glycan acceptors with an S N 2-like mechanism; however, in the absence of a glycan acceptor, UDP-Gal is slowly converted to UDP and two other products, one is galactose through an S N 2-like mechanism with water as an acceptor and the other is an oxocarbenium-like product, presumably through an S N 1-like mechanisms.

To improve the efficiency, we explored the two human galactosyltransferase (β3GalT5) isozymes in cancer cells for this reaction and found that isozyme 1 (β3GalT5–1) is more active than isozyme 2 (β3GalT5–2). We then identified a common soluble domain of the two β3GalT5 isozymes as a candidate and evaluated the activity and substrate specificity of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated glycoforms. The glycoforms expressed in Sf9 cells were selected, and a site-specific alanine scan was performed to identify S66A β3GalT5 variant with 10-fold more efficiency than LgtD for the synthesis of globo-series glycans.

While the substitution of an alkyl electrophile by a nitrogen nucleophile is a seemingly straightforward approach to generating a carbon–nitrogen bond, in practice classical substitution pathways have very substantial limitations in the case of unactivated secondary and tertiary alkyl electrophiles. Recent reports that transition metals can catalyze certain substitution reactions of such electrophiles are therefore of considerable significance; however, virtually no methods have been developed wherein absolute stereochemistry is controlled together with carbon–nitrogen bond formation. Herein, we address this dual challenge of reactivity and enantioselectivity, describing a photoinduced, copper-catalyzed enantioconvergent synthesis of β-aminoalcohol derivatives via the coupling of anilines with racemic, unactivated β-haloethers. We apply this method to a catalytic asymmetric synthesis of metolachlor, and we report an array of mechanistic studies that are consistent with the reaction pathway that we propose.},

  abstract     = {Near-infrared (NIR) light-driven photoreactions are advantageous over visible light-driven ones because NIR photons have lower energy and fewer side reactions, deeper penetration in reaction media, and high abundance in the solar spectrum. However, currently available covalent organic frameworks (COFs) absorb in the UV–vis region and catalyze photoreactions under blue or white light irradiation. Herein, we report a linker-to-linker charge transfer process in a viologen-linked porphyrin COF (Vio-COF), leading to a novel type of hyperporphyrin effect and extending the absorption into the NIR region with an absorption edge at 998 nm. Under NIR irradiation, photoinduced charge separation in Vio-COF generates a viologen radical that efficiently reduces oxygen to form superoxide radicals for catalytic oxidative coupling reactions. The proximity of porphyrin and viologen units within the framework significantly enhances the catalytic performance of Vio-COF, outperforming its homogeneous counterparts in aerobic oxidative amidation and amine coupling reactions. Vio-COF was readily recycled and used in six oxidative coupling reactions.},

Guided by reticular chemistry, we deconstructed type III irregular hexagonal tiling into a combination of D 2 h + D 2 h monomers and achieved the first successful synthesis of 2D COFs featuring such tiling with hit topology. By tuning the crystal growth conditions, we obtained a set of reticular isomers, COF-hit and COF-bex, with distinct reticular structures. Powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were employed to precisely characterize their topology structures. COF-hit demonstrates outstanding water absorption capabilities under high humidity conditions.

ZIF-L_exf exhibits a high reactivity toward hydrolytic degradation of extremely toxic G-type nerve agents, Soman (GD), and simulant diisopropylfluorophosphate (DIFP). The reactivity of the crystal surface of ZIF-L_exf toward P–F bond breakdown gives rise to framework structural degradation, releasing nucleophilic mImH molecules that reactivate organophosphate-inhibited acetylcholinesterase within 10 min. This detoxification process can be taken as a proof of concept for reversing organophosphorous poisoning.

Despite its advantage in visible-light response and stability, the pristine bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) alone is not capable of achieving overall water splitting due to its conduction band energy level being insufficient for the proton reduction reaction, further limited by the severe charge recombination. Here, we demonstrate the three-dimensionally ordered macroporous BiVO 4 with a carefully enlarged bandgap of 2.58 eV and a conduction band energy of −0.49 eV versus normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0. On loading Rh/Cr 2 O 3 as a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst, the stochiometric evolution of hydrogen and oxygen in a recyclable manner is accomplished under visible light with an apparent quantum yield of 0.47% at 400 nm. Further study by Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals an intensified internal electric field with a downward band bending from the interconnection part to the internal wall of the periodic porous structure upon loading the cocatalysts. Our findings transform BiVO 4 from a typical water oxidation photocatalyst into a new paradigm for single-component photocatalysts for overall water splitting.},

Here, we demonstrate the regioselective Ullmann polymerization of nonsymmetrical 2,8-dibromoquinoline (DBQ) on an Au(111) surface. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory calculations, and kinetic modeling, we reveal the regioselectivity and its evolution with surface temperature at the molecular level. At 348–368 K, DBQ monomers primarily form covalent dimers through energetically favored head-to-head (HtH) coupling. As the temperature increases to 390–473 K, oligomers and long polymer chains are formed, with less favored head-to-tail (HtT) linkages emerging and eventually dominating over HtH linkages. Such regioselectivity evolution from HtH to HtT is suggested to be related to a sequential monomer addition mode and a shift in the distribution of reactive sites at the end and tail of the polymer chains during polymerization. This result provides molecular-level mechanistic insights into the regiochemistry of surface-catalyzed polymerization.},

Herein, a strategy of lone-pair-mediated multiple through-space interactions (TSIs) is proposed to availably induce RTP. By incorporating heteroatoms to facilitate through-space n–n and n−π interactions, the lone pairs are delocalized throughout the structure, resulting in the dense splitting of the excited-state energy levels. Thus, more matched energy levels with a small energy gap between singlet and triplet states (Δ E ST ) emerge, resulting in multiple intersystem crossing (ISC) transition channels that assist triplet excitons generation. The strong TSIs also effectively rigidify the molecular structures and thus stabilize triplet excitons for radiation. Furthermore, the manipulation of TSI intensity allows efficiency enhancement, persistent time prolongation, and tolerance to high temperatures of RTP. This work not only explores the fundamental principle of the RTP mechanism from a new view but also provides a universal strategy for ISC promotion and triple excitons stabilization.},

Herein, we report a novel atroposelective synthesis of diaxially chiral pyridoindolones featuring both six–five and six–six C–N axes through cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric C–H annulation. This approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency, yielding a diverse array of chiral pyridoindolones with excellent yields and atroposelectivities (60 examples, up to &gt;99% yield, &gt;99% ee, and &gt;20:1 dr). Mechanistic studies revealed that the stereochemistry of both C–N axes were generated and fixed simultaneously during the C–H cyclometalation step, along with an unexpected asymmetric amplification effect. The practicality of this protocol is further underscored by successful gram-scale syntheses and various transformations, including the formation of a chiral phosphine ligand. Notably, exceptional photoluminescence quantum yields ( Φ F up to 0.99) and positive solvatochromism were observed, coupled with significant chiroptical properties, underscoring the potential applications of these compounds in organic fluorescent materials.},

We demonstrate that the fully methylated structure and Si–O bonds within TMMS can effectively elevate the dehydrogenation energy barrier, migrating the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte.

  abstract     = {The ammonia electrooxidation reaction (AOR) has attracted significant attention for both wastewater treatment and energy storage applications. However, AOR pathways generating oxygenated products such as nitrite or nitrate remain unresolved. Attenuated total reflection–surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR–SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) have been combined to determine the potential-dependent intermediates, active catalytic sites, and AOR pathways on Ni electrodes under alkaline conditions. The OH/O vacancy sites on NiOOH, revealed by XPS, are found by DFT calculations to be the active sites for the AOR, catalyzing the complete (eight-electron) oxidation of ammonia into nitrate. The formation of isolated OH/O vacancies on NiOOH is thermodynamically more favorable than that of paired vacancies in the potential range conducive to NiOOH formation and the AOR, with an increasing formation barrier at higher potentials. This synergistic ATR–SEIRAS and DFT study reveals that the selectivity of nitrite and nitrate production is potential-dependent, with nitrite and hydrazine formation initiated at moderate anodic potentials, whereas larger potentials promote conversion of nitrite into nitrate species. The release of adsorbed nitrite and nitrate, which is crucial for liberating catalytic sites for the continuous AOR, is spectroscopically and computationally shown to be facilitated at relatively low potentials. Comprehending AOR mechanisms on Ni-based catalysts as achieved in this study can pave the way for future research on catalyst design and optimization of AOR performance.},

While machine learning has shown promise, only one deep learning-based method has been proposed so far, which relies heavily on neutron diffraction data for training, limiting its general applicability. In this work, we present an innovative strategy─SSW-NN (stochastic surface walking with neural network)─a robust, non-neutron diffraction-dependent technique that accurately predicts hydrogen positions. Validated against neutron diffraction data for copper hydride clusters, SSW-NN proved effective for clusters where only X-ray diffraction data or DFT predictions are available. It offers superior accuracy, efficiency, and versatility across different metal hydrides, including silver and alloy hydride systems, currently without any neutron diffraction references. This approach not only establishes a new research paradigm for metal hydride clusters but also provides a universal solution for hydrogen localization in other research fields constrained by neutron sources.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) are essential mediators of tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, yet their secretion dynamics and cargo composition in response to therapies remain poorly understood. Here, we present STAMP, s pecific click- t agging driven by a ptamer for tEV labeled with a m etabolic timestam p , which exploits the unique kinetics and thermodynamics of aptamer to significantly enhance the local concentration of clickable probes on tEVs for their covalent attachment to the timestamp, resulting in the selective microfluidic isolation of nascent tEVs following stimulation. In a PD-L1 antibody-treated model, we demonstrated the feasibility of STAMP and revealed a robust positive correlation between the nascent EpCAM + EV levels and tumor volume. Proteome profiling of isolated nascent tEVs identified previously unknown upregulated vesicle proteins following immunotherapy, including key regulators of immune activation and suppression, suggesting that tumors orchestrate an intricate dual adaptive response through tEV secretion modulation to simultaneously elicit therapeutic sensitivity and resistance. Notably, among the upregulated proteins, we identified HSP70, whose enhanced presentation on tEVs promotes antitumor immunity and inhibits tumor growth. Thus, STAMP provides an effective gateway for studying EV dynamics with cell-origin accuracy and for identifying potential therapeutic targets based on EV transitions.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence indicates that lipid droplets (LDs) play important roles in lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and cell stress management. Notably, dysregulation of LDs is tightly linked to numerous diseases, including lipodystrophies, cancer, obesity, atherosclerosis, and others. The pivotal physiological roles of LDs have led to an exploration of research in recent years. The functions of LDs are inherently connected to the composition of their proteome. Current methods for profiling LD proteins mostly utilize LD fractionation, including those based on proximity-based labeling techniques. Global profiling of the LD proteome in live cells without the isolation of LDs is still challenging. Herein, we disclose two small-molecule chemical probes, termed LDF and LDPL . Both LDF / LDPL are small in size and could freely and specifically migrate within the lipid context of LDs. Consequently, they were successfully used for live-cell fluorescence imaging of LDs and from animal tissues. We further showed that LDPL was capable of large-scale profiling of the LD proteome without the need of LD isolation. By using LDPL , 1584 high-confidence proteins, most of which could be annotated to prominent LD functions, were next identified. Importantly, further validation studies by using representative “hit” proteins revealed that CHMP6 and PRDX4 could act as the lipophagy receptor and lipolysis suppressor, respectively. Our results thus confirmed for the first time that LDPL is a powerful chemical tool for in situ profiling of LD proteomes. With the ability to provide a deeper understanding of LD proteomics from the native cellular environments, our newly developed strategy may be used in future to decipher the dynamics and molecular mechanism of LDs in various diseases.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectrics with switchable spontaneous polarization have gained enormous attention for a century. However, the structural phase transitions of conventional ferroelectrics have been mainly limited to the ones with crystallographic point group changes accompanied by the breaking of spatial symmetry elements. Moreover, although chiral and photoswitchable ferroelectrics have both been of great interest in recent years, heteroatomic chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics have never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we designed a pair of sulfur-chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics ( R s and S s ) -N -(3-bromo-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-methylpropane-2-sulfinamide (1- R s and 1- S s ). Notably, they undergo a structural phase transition from the chiral polar C 2 to P 2 1 space group of point group 2 at around 142 K, accompanied by the symmetry operation breaking from 2-fold rotation and screw rotation in C 2 to only 2-fold screw rotation in P 2 1 . Such a structural phase transition with the same point group, while different space groups with the breaking of symmetry operations, is significantly distinct from the structural phase transition with different point groups and space groups in conventional ferroelectrics. Furthermore,1- R s exhibits the highest piezoelectric d 33 value of 10 pC/N among organic photoswitchable ferroelectrics and shows optical control of ferroelectric polarization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of sulfur-chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics showing phase transitions with only the space group change. This work enriches the family of chiral ferroelectrics and provides great inspiration for the exploitation of heteroatomic chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics.},

Herein, the circularly polarized piezoluminescence behaviors of six novel chiral perovskites, ( S / R -3-XPEA) 2 PbBr 4 (PEA = phenethylamine; X = F, Cl, Br), were systematically investigated. Upon compression, ( S / R -3-ClPEA) 2 PbBr 4 exhibits significant piezofluorochromic behaviors, transforming from yellow CPL to ultrahigh-color-purity deep-blue CPL. At 2.5 GPa, the deep-blue CPL intensity increases by an order of magnitude and its luminescence asymmetry factors ( g lum ) are amplified from the initial ±0.03 to ±0.1. ( S / R -3-BrPEA) 2 PbBr 4 presents a similar piezochromic response, realizing deep-blue CPL at 1.7 GPa, while ( S / R -3-FPEA) 2 PbBr 4 retains a yellow CPL under high pressure. High-pressure structural characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that pressure-enhanced halogen bonds reduce the penetration depth of S / R -3-BrPEA + and S / R -3-ClPEA + into the [PbBr 6 ] 4– frameworks, significantly suppressing electron–phonon coupling and increasing magnetic transition dipole moment in ( S / R -3-BrPEA) 2 PbBr 4 and ( S / R -3-ClPEA) 2 PbBr 4 , which are responsible for the ultrahigh-purity deep-blue CPL and chirality amplification, respectively.},

Herein, we describe an enzyme-mediated strategy for the oxidative dimerization of thioamides enabled by enzymatic halide recycling by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase enzymes. This approach allows for intermolecular biocatalytic bond formation using a catalytic quantity of halide salt and hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant. The established method is applied to a diverse range of thioamides to generate the corresponding 1,2,4-thiadiazoles in moderate to high yields with excellent chemoselectivity. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through two distinct enzyme-mediated sulfur halogenation events that are critical for heterocycle formation. Molecular docking experiments provide insight into reactivity differences between biocatalysts used in this study. Finally, the developed biocatalytic oxidative dimerization is applied to a preparative scale chemoenzymatic synthesis of the anticancer agent penicilliumthiamine B. These studies demonstrate that enzymatic halide recycling is a promising platform for intermolecular bond formation.},

The motors directionally rotate via information ratchet mechanisms, in which the hydration of a carbodiimide (fuel) to form urea (waste) is catalyzed through the chemomechanical cycle of a motor unit, resulting in directional rotation about a biaryl C–N bond. The head-to-tail arrangement of the motor units produces coaxial contra-rotation of the end groups while the central phenyl ring of the axis remains dynamically unbiased. The electron-rich nature of the phenyl stator contributes to rotary catalysis by the dual-motor (and therefore motor rotation itself) being ∼7× faster than the parent 1-phenylpyrrole-2,2-dicarboxylic acid single-motor when operated under identical conditions, and 90× faster than the single-motor operated using the originally reported reaction conditions. Under batch-fueled operation (i.e., all of the fuel present at the start of motor operation), the dual-motor rotates at an initial rate of 0.43 rotations per minute (rpm). Chemostating the fuel concentration by syringe pump addition produced sustained repetitive contra-rotation at a rate of 0.24 rpm for a period of 100 min. The demonstration of chemically fueled continuous contra-rotation on a time scale of 2–4 min per rotation significantly advances the chemistry and mechanics of artificial catalysis-driven molecular machinery.},

Mechanistic investigations revealed that the exceptional catalytic performance arises from synergistic interaction between Pt nanoparticles and WO x species. Low-valent WO x enhances Pt dispersion, while Pt stabilizes WO x as low-polymerized polytungstates. The moderate acidity of PtW 1.5 /MCM-48 ensures controlled desorption of p -TA, preventing overhydrogenation to PX. The catalyst demonstrated robust performance with real-world PET waste. Life cycle assessment and technical and economic evaluation further highlight its practical feasibility. This study establishes a sustainable pathway for PET chemical upcycling and provides a framework for designing advanced catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, addressing critical challenges in circular chemistry and plastic waste management.},

SteviX4 induces ferroptotic cell death in susceptible cell lines, and target identification experiments reveal SteviX4 acts as an inhibitor of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a critical protein that protects cancer cells against ferroptosis. In its induction of cell death, SteviX4 displays enhanced cell line selectivity relative to most known GPX4 inhibitors. SteviX4 was used to reveal dependency on GPX4 as a vulnerability of certain cancer cell lines, not tied to any one type of cancer, suggesting GPX4 inhibition as a cancer type-agnostic anticancer strategy.

From a mixture of perfluoroarene and the corresponding perfluoroalkane (i.e., perfluoronaphthalene and perfluorodecalin), a Pt(II)-linked capsule exclusively binds the arenes in water at room temperature, via effective D-A-A-D π-stacking interactions. The size-selective binding toward perfluoroarenes (i.e., perfluoronaphthalene and perfluorobenzene) is improved by using the analogous N-doped capsule from 85% to quantitative selectivity. Furthermore, unlike the Pt(II)-capsule, an isostructural Pd(II)-linked capsule displays the unusual length/shape-selective binding of linear/cyclic perfluoroalkanes (i.e., perfluoroheptane and perfluorodecalin) under similar conditions. Recognition of substituted hydrogen atoms on perfluorobiphenyl can also be accomplished using the Pt(II)-capsule.

Mucus is composed of polymeric networks of mucin proteins, which are heavily modified post-translationally. The full compendium of enzymes responsible for these modifications and their roles in health and disease remain incompletely understood. Herein, we determine the biochemical function of NXPE1 , a gene implicated in ulcerative colitis (UC), and demonstrate that it encodes an acetyltransferase that modifies mucin glycans. Specifically, NXPE1 utilizes acetyl-CoA to regioselectively modify the mucus sialic acid, 5- N -acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), at the 9-OH group to generate 9- O -acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac 2 ). We further demonstrate that colonic organoids derived from donors harboring the missense variant NXPE1 G353R, which is protective against UC, exhibit severely impaired acetylation of Neu5Ac on mucins. Together, our findings support a model in which NXPE1 masks the alcohols of mucus sialoglycans via acetylation, which is important for modulating mucus barrier properties that limit interactions with commensal microbes.},

Thus, NPs are produced in a stereocontrolled manner except for the cases where nonenzymatic reactions are involved in the biosynthesis. This is why stereoisomers, especially enantiomers, are rarely found among metabolites from natural sources. During the biosynthetic study of auranthine, a fungal NP containing a nitrile group, we discovered that the (−)-isomer of auranthine ( 1 ) is produced by Aspergillus lentulus strains isolated in Japan, while a previously unreported (+)-enantiomer 2 is produced by those isolated elsewhere. The biosynthetic genes for both isomers were determined by transcriptomic, gene deletion, and heterologous expression experiments, revealing that two different nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) NitA and NitC were involved in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 , respectively. Both NitA and NitC are bimodular NRPSs, as is the case for the asperlicin-synthesizing enzyme AspA. All incorporate two molecules of anthranilic acid and one molecule of amino acid to form the peptide core. However, only NitC contains an epimerization domain, suggesting that is how the enantiomeric pair is biosynthesized by NitA and NitC. Furthermore, biosynthesis of the nitrile-bearing l -γ-cyanohomoalanine that is incorporated into 1 and 2 was found to be catalyzed by an argininosuccinate synthetase-like NitB using l -glutamine as a substrate. This study reports not only the unique mechanism of nitrile-containing amino acid biosynthesis but also the intriguing production of an enantiomeric pair of secondary metabolites by different strains of the same fungal species (250/250).},

  abstract     = {The ferryl heme forms of Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI have novel UV/vis absorption spectra that are distinct from those of the three forms of ferryl heme typically found in biological systems: compound I, compound II, and compound ES. In this work, the ferryl heme form of IsdG was characterized because it is an analogue for the immediate product of enzyme-catalyzed heme hydroxylation. The ferryl heme form of IsdG generated following the addition of meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to the ferric heme form of IsdG has a half-life of 4.0 ± 0.2 min, which is more than 100 times longer than the half-life for the ferryl heme form of human heme oxygenase (hHO). Magnetic circular dichroism characterization of the IsdG species yielded spectral data and zero-field splitting parameters consistent with either a compound II- or compound ES-like ferryl heme. Further characterization of isotopically enriched samples with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the presence of a protein-based organic radical, as would be expected for compound ES. Finally, multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and time-dependent density functional theory strongly suggest that the ferryl heme form of IsdG has a ruffled porphyrin ligand and an oxo ligand. Thus, the ferryl heme form of IsdG is assigned to a compound ES-like species with a Trp67-based radical. Electron transfer from Trp67 to porphyrin will stabilize the immediate product of heme hydroxylation and provide a thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Furthermore, the ability to transfer an electron between Trp67 and the substrate may explain the differential reactivity of meso-hydroxyheme in IsdG and hHO.},

  abstract     = {The scientific community has been actively researching artificial photosynthesis to promote ecologically sustainable living and address environmental issues. However, designing photocatalysts with active sites that are effective for both CO 2 reduction and water oxidation remains a significant challenge. Thus, we present the development of a donor–acceptor covalent organic framework (D–A COF), that integrates two distinct metal coordination environments through structure–activity relationships. Either cobalt or nickel ion is anchored on the D–A COF backbone to create N-metal–nitrogen and N-metal–sulfur coordination configurations, serving as bifunctional reduction and oxidation active sites, respectively. Remarkably, the as-synthesized Co-Btt-Bpy COF generated CO at a rate of 9,800 μmol g –1 h –1 and O 2 at 242 μmol g –1 h –1 under visible light irradiation. The CO generation rate was 127 times higher than that of pristine D–A COF. More importantly, Co-Btt-Bpy COF facilitates artificial photosynthesis with a CO release rate of 7.4 μmol g –1 h –1 . The outstanding photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the dispersed single-atom sites and Btt-Bpy COF, as well as the rapid migration of photogenerated electrons. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectra and theoretical calculations indicated that introducing Co sites effectively lowered the reaction energy barriers for the crucial intermediates *COOH and *OH. This work provides state-of-the-art designs of photocatalysts at the molecular level and in-depth insights for efficient artificial photosynthesis.},

Existing artificial interneurons cannot encode information upon different neurotransmitters, and the activation threshold and frequency responsivity do not align with those of biological counterparts, leading to limited success in constructing a signal-harmonizing hybrid neural pathway for neuroprosthetics, neurorehabilitation, and other neuroelectronic applications. Herein, we develop a bipolar-chemosynapse interneuron to encode the spike frequency in a highly bionic paradigm. Bipolar synapses dynamically respond to excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and translate time-series chemical signals into the spike sequence, achieving the lowest activation threshold (6.25 μM) and the highest frequency responsivity (0.55 Hz μM –1 ) to date, close to the biological counterpart. A signal-harmonizing hybrid sensorimotor pathway mediated by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is constructed for the first time, which encodes upstream mechanical stimuli, modulates the downstream leg swing frequency of a mouse, and balances neural activity accordingly.},

This methodology features high efficiency (up to 98% yield), high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee), and broad scope of nucleophiles, including oxygen nucleophiles (alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids) and carbon nucleophiles (silyl enol ethers). Theoretical and experimental mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction pathway encompasses an asymmetric cycloisomerization, which gives rise to a dirhodium carbene containing a donor–acceptor (D-A) cyclopropane moiety, followed by a ring-opening process and stereoselective nucleophilic attack by external nucleophiles on the cyclopropyl ring. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of the terminal group capped on the alkynyl group of substrates in achieving good efficiency.},

We hypothesized that replacing the oxygen atom in the glycosidic linkage with sulfur atoms would stabilize the labile linkage against glycosidases, resulting in improved pharmacokinetics. In this study, we focused on the macrophage-activating factor (MAF) carrying O -linked N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and creating a miniature glycopeptide associated with MAF. A partial structure of MAF with a chemical mutation at three amino acid residues was designed in which threonine was replaced with cysteine (Cys), leading to a thioglycosidically linked GalNAc and a conformationally stable cyclic peptide due to the disulfide bond. GalNAc-Cys was used in solid-phase peptide synthesis, and the desired cyclic glycopeptide was synthesized. In the synthesis of GalNAc-Cys, glycosylation reactions were carried out based on the hard and soft acids and bases concept, where glycosyl trichloroacetimidate and fluoride were successfully used to couple with the thiol group in Cys. GalNAc-Cys was also evaluated as a substrate of α-GalNAc-ase and was shown to resist hydrolysis, supporting our concept. The synthesized cyclic miniature MAF induced LPS-assisted IL-12 production and resisted against α-GalNAc-ase.},

Energy dissipation resulting from mechanical bond motion is essential for improving toughness, yet effective strategies to optimize this process remain underexplored. Here, by designing mechanical bond models with controllable mobility, we establish a fortification strategy for the two key factors governing energy dissipation, host–guest recognition and sliding friction, thereby enabling mechanical property enhancement of mechanically interlocked materials. Specifically, the [2]rotaxanes in MIN- 1 and MIN- 2 exhibit identical axle structures, with MIN- 1 incorporating a small benzo-21-crown-7 ring and MIN- 2 incorporating a large benzo-24-crown-8 ring. Strain rate-dependent cyclic tensile tests reveal that the energy required to drive mechanical bond motion in MIN- 1 and MIN- 2 is 510 and 260 kJ/m 3 , respectively, indicating that the small wheel size enhances host–guest recognition. Furthermore, the apparent activation energy for the sliding motion of the mechanical bonds in MIN- 1 (11.0 kJ/mol) is higher than that in MIN- 2 (6.70 kJ/mol), suggesting increased sliding friction in MIN- 1 . Due to these two aspects, MIN- 1 exhibits superior energy dissipation performance (damping capacity = 92%) compared to MIN- 2 (78%), translating to a higher toughness (7.50 vs 5.70 MJ/m 3 ).},

  abstract     = {Research on room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been rapidly developed in recent years. However, it is still challenging to realize long-wavelength RTP (&gt;580 nm). In this article, a new strategy is proposed to achieve the red-shifted RTP through constructing dual-ligand MOFs. Different from the single-ligand MOF, which lacks intermolecular interaction, the dual-ligand MOF can build up a stable donor–acceptor (D-A) relationship between two suitable simple ligands. Therefore, the induced charge transfer (CT) process from the donor units to the acceptor units in the framework can decrease the energy gap between the frontier orbitals, reducing the excited state energy levels. Moreover, by modulating the electron density and conjugation of the acceptor ligand, the energy of the triplet states of MOFs can be further reduced. As a result, the RTP centered at 588 nm is successfully achieved in a dual-ligand MOF. Also, we clearly describe the electron transporting path among the ground, 1 CT, and 3 CT states, revealing the emitting mechanism of the long-wavelength RTP. This work not only extends the D–A structure from the molecular level to the periodic structure of MOFs but also solves the problem of achieving long-wavelength RTP in MOFs from a new perspective.},

  abstract     = {The efficient removal of CO 2 from exhaust streams and even directly from air is necessary to forestall climate change, lending urgency to the search for new materials that can rapidly capture CO 2 at high capacity. The recent discovery that diamine-appended metal–organic frameworks can exhibit cooperative CO 2 uptake via the formation of ammonium carbamate chains begs the question of whether simple organic polyamine molecules could be designed to achieve a similar switch-like behavior with even higher separation capacities. Here, we present a solid molecular triamine, 1,3,5-tris(aminomethyl)benzene (TriH), that rapidly captures large quantities of CO 2 upon exposure to humid air to form the porous, crystalline, ammonium carbamate network solid TriH(CO 2 ) 1.5 · x H 2 O (TriHCO 2 ). The phase transition behavior of TriH converting to TriHCO 2 was studied through powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and additional spectroscopic techniques further verified the formation of ammonium carbamate species upon exposing TriH to humid air. Detailed breakthrough analyses conducted under varying temperatures, relative humidities, and flow rates reveal record CO 2 absorption capacities as high as 8.9 mmol/g. Computational analyses reveal an activation barrier associated with TriH absorbing CO 2 under dry conditions that is lowered under humid conditions through hydrogen bonding with a water molecule in the transition state associated with N–C bond formation. These results highlight the prospect of tunable molecular polyamines as a new class of candidate absorbents for high-capacity CO 2 capture.},

  abstract     = {While nucleic-acid-based cancer vaccines hold therapeutic potential, their limited immunogenicity remains a challenge due in part to the low efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery caused by lysosomal entrapment. In this work, we found that plasmids encoding both an antigen and a STING agonist protein adjuvant can self-assemble into coordination nanofibers, triggered by manganese ions. We developed a strategy to construct a DNA vaccine, termed MnO 2 -OVA-CDA-mem, formed by the coencapsulation of manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ), an antigen-expressing plasmid (encoding ovalbumin, OVA), and an adjuvant enzyme-expressing plasmid (encoding STING agonist, CDA) within dendritic cell (DC) membranes. Upon uptake into acidic lysosomes, Mn 2+ released from MnO 2 triggered the nucleic acids to undergo a morphological change from nanospheres (∼180 nm diameter) to nanofibers (∼1 μm length), resulting in an increase in mechanical strength by about 9-fold and consequently lysosomal membrane disruption. The antigen OVA and adjuvants Mn 2+ and CDA in the cytoplasm triggered strong DC activation and antigen-specific CD8 + T cell metalloimmune responses, significantly inhibiting the growth of B16-OVA tumors and inducing long-term immune memory. Altogether, MnO 2 -OVA-CDA-mem holds potential as a platform for nucleic acid antigen and adjuvant delivery using an in situ self-assembly strategy in a metal-driven, stimulus-responsive, and programmable manner for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Direct electrochemical ethylene-to-ethylene glycol (C 2 H 4 -to-EG) conversion can potentially reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and the emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) compared with the traditional thermo-catalytic approach. Palladium (Pd) prepared by electrodeposition is represented as a promising electrocatalyst; however, it exhibits low Ethylene glycol (EG) current density (&lt;4 mA cm –2 ), Faradaic efficiency (&lt;60%), and productivity (&lt;10 μmol h –1 ), hindering practical applications. Herein, we report a nanodendrite palladium catalyst supported on a large-area gas diffusion electrode. This catalyst gives high EG current density (12 mA cm –2 ) and productivity (227 μmol h –1 ) but low Faradaic efficiency (65%). With further Cl – ions modification, Faradaic efficiency increased to a record-high value of 92%, and EG current density (18 mA cm –2 ) and productivity (∼340 μmol h –1 ) were also promoted. Experimental data suggest that the strong electron-withdrawing feature of Cl – reduces the oxidation ability of in situ generated Pd–OH species, inhibiting EG overoxidation to glycol aldehyde. Meanwhile, Cl – alters EG adsorption configuration─from parallel and dual-site coordination to vertical and single-site coordination─over the Pd surface, thus preventing C–C bond cleavage of EG to CO 2 . In addition, Cl – adsorption facilitates the generation of Pd–OH active species to improve catalytic activity. This work demonstrates the great potential of surface ion modification for improving activity and selectivity in direct electrochemical C 2 H 4 -to-EG conversion, which may have implications for diverse value-added chemicals electrosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {The many emerging applications of nanoparticles in diverse fields in chemistry and biology require the characterization of interactions between nanoparticles and surrounding biomolecules such as proteins. Nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation of proteins, which is highly sensitive to interactions with nanoparticles, contains rich information about protein mobility and binding kinetics. The interactions of globular proteins with silica nanoparticles differ markedly from those with liposome nanoparticles, although both are driven by electrostatic forces. For unmodified silica nanoparticles, their interactions with an internally rigid protein like ubiquitin uniformly increase the backbone amide 15 N transverse R 2 relaxation for most residues. In contrast, for ubiquitin-POPG liposome interactions, their characteristic transverse R 2 profiles indicate that ubiquitin undergoes diffusive rotational motions on the liposome surface. Here, we show that coating silica nanoparticles with sulfobetaine siloxane zwitterionic molecules profoundly alters their interactions with proteins in a manner that closely resembles the mode of interaction observed with liposomes. 15 N- R 2 relaxation reveals that ubiquitin and the Ras-binding domain of B-Raf both exhibit axial reorientational motions about an axis perpendicular to the nanoparticle surface in the bound state, where the interactions involve predominantly positively charged surface regions. These findings point toward a global dynamics mechanism of proteins when interacting with organic or inorganic nanoparticles with densely charged soft surfaces. This information may help tailor the coatings of nanoparticles to adopt specific modes of interaction with proteins that can be used to control their function in vivo and in vitro.},

Among them, highly strained spirocyclobutanes with multiple chiral center-containing four-membered rings have attracted significant attention, but their viable and efficient synthesis poses a great challenge. By virtue of cage-confined asymmetric photocatalysis, we successfully construct spirocycle and bispirocycle compounds containing multiple quaternary and tertiary chiral carbon centers in cyclobutane rings through cross [2 + 2] photocycloaddition with visible-light-induced and mild reactions. The mechanistic studies unveil that the chiral open pockets of a cage photoreactor facilitate dynamic bimolecular recognition to render preferential heteromolecular cross-cycloaddition with enhanced reactivity, unconventional enantioselectivity, and good substrate tolerance, providing a promising direction for enzyme-mimetic catalyst design for challenging asymmetric photochemical transformations.},

This study aims to determine how the optoelectronic properties of a model perovskite, cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr 3 ), change with length and thickness in one dimension (1D). By examining the photophysics of CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs), nanowires (NWs), and nanorods (NRs), we observe the influence of confinement, exciton diffusion, and trapping on their optical properties. Our findings reveal that exciton diffusion to trap states limits the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 1D CsPbBr 3 in the weakly confined regime (8–14 nm) and explains their long-lived exciton dynamics, while enhanced radiative rates contribute to achieving near-unity PLQY in the strongly confined regime (&lt;7 nm). Consequently, blue-emitting, 2.4 nm-thick CsPbBr 3 NRs were 3.6X more emissive than the conventional CsPbBr 3 QDs. This study underscores how structural optimization can improve the optoelectronic performance of CsPbBr 3 and provides insight into the complex interplay of radiative and nonradiative processes in 1D ionic semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and their detrimental effect on the environment, there is a push to develop a renewable way to produce H 2 , a fuel source that has nonharmful byproducts, unlike traditional methods of energy production. Alkaline water electrolysis has seen increasing focus as a viable way to produce H 2 , but efficient and stable electrocatalysts are required to facilitate this process. Here, a heterogenized Co(II) phenanthroline-based complex for the production of H 2 from alkaline water is disclosed. Activity was improved by considering the role of axial Co ligation and the reaction environment created by the polymer binder in the catalyst inks by using variable ratios of Nafion and poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP). A ratio of 1:1 Nafion:P4VP was found to have the highest stability, and Co nanoparticle formation was not observed when P4VP was included as part of the binder mixture. The activity and stability enhancement could not be replicated by the addition of molecular pyridine or the use of poly-2-vinylpyridine, which is sterically prevented from coordinating to Co. The increased electrochemical performance caused by the inclusion of Nafion as part of the polymer binder is attributed to a role in mass transfer to and from the Co active site during catalysis, complementing the stabilizing effect of P4VP on the molecular active site.},

Here, we elucidate how lipid-siRNA organization within LNPs can modulate their intracellular delivery dynamics. We use cryo-electron microscopy and photochemical assays to reveal that increased siRNA loading can reduce helper lipids’ distribution to the LNP surface, while siRNA consistently localizes near the surface. These alterations in lipid-siRNA organization affect LNP membrane fluidity, enhancing LNP fusion with cellular membranes and promoting cytosolic siRNA delivery, primarily via macropinocytosis. Using photosensitive lipids and live cell imaging, we demonstrate that lipid-siRNA organization regulates LNP responsiveness to external stimuli, significantly affecting siRNA endosomal escape efficiency upon light activation. We further confirm this observation using convex lens-induced confinement microscopy and single-particle imaging. Overall, our findings provide critical insights into how lipid-siRNA organization shapes LNP intracellular dynamics, offering rational design principles for optimizing LNP-based RNA therapeutics.},

Two major factors capable of amplifying the relative effect are spin–orbit coupling and ferroelectricity. Herein, we chose four compounds as examples to study the contribution of spin–orbit coupling and ferroelectricity to spin-electric coupling. The relative orientation-dependent Hamiltonian terms were determined via electric-field modulated continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance. The origins of the spin-electric coupling effect in the four compounds are discussed and determined according to the characteristics of the experimental spectra. Meanwhile, the results demonstrated that strong spin–orbit coupling is crucial for producing significant spin-electric coupling and that the effect can be amplified by about 2 orders of magnitude by ferroelectricity. This work can guide the rational screen and design of materials with applicable spin-electric coupling strength, which may provoke techniques including low-power spintronics and precise manipulation of the quantum behavior of spins.},

Extensive evidence from isotope labeling experiments, crystal structures of SydA and its variant, quantum chemical calculations, and mutagenesis experiments reveal a plausible mechanism for the formation of 6 involving an unusual 1,7-hydride shift, which may be a key branchpoint for monocyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic products. Structure-based engineering resulted in SydA variants that promote different reaction pathways, leading to the production of bicyclic α-cuprenene and (+)-β-chamigrene and tricyclic 7- epi -β-cedrene and β-microbiotene.

However, the creation of uniform and well-defined PAH nanostructures by self-assembly still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report that highly uniform hexagonal rods can be obtained from triphenylene (TP)-derived monomers by synchronized polymerization and self-assembly (SPSA). These rods have a single-domain columnar liquid crystalline structure in which columns formed from stacked TPs are along the long axis of the rods. The length/diameter ratios of the rods can be tuned over a wide range. Key factors to achieve SPSA of PAHs were analyzed, and the formation mechanism was clarified. In particular, it is observed that successful SPSA occurs below an upper critical temperature, which could be attributed to insufficient microphase separation between the side chains and the main chains and should be a general principle for SPSA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the columnar stacking of TP units significantly promotes the intersystem crossing of the singlet excited state to the triplet excited state, resulting in simultaneous fluorescence and phosphorescence emission at room temperature. This work may be extended to a wide range of PAHs to regulate their self-assembly and light emission properties.},

  abstract     = {The assembly of molecules or nanoparticles (NPs) into superlattice metamaterials endows them with remarkable optical, electrical, and magnetic properties, enabling applications in sensing, catalysis, and optical displays. However, traditional methods face challenges, such as complex procedures, long processing times, limited assembly areas, and poor reproducibility. The root cause of these challenges lies mainly in the complex and difficult-to-control interactions between assembly units such as ligands and NPs. In this study, a novel ultralow-interfacial-energy microenvironment between the water and oil phase is proposed for a rapid and large-scale superlattice assembly of NPs. The formation of the independently formed interfacial “third-phase” microenvironment hinges on two crucial factors. First, there is high immiscibility between densely packed perfluorodecanethiol ligands and a biphasic solvent system. Second, the coalescence events are accelerated at elevated temperatures. This microenvironment plays a dual role. Thermodynamically, it mitigates interparticle sintering and promotes the rapid establishment of supersaturation conditions that are conducive to the homogeneous nucleation of superlattices. Kinetically, it accelerates the coalescence process of “superlattice domains” through van der Waals interactions between neighboring NPs. This strategy reduces assembly time to under 80 min for forming superlattice monolayer films over areas up to 11 cm 2 . Furthermore, the method is versatile, applicable to mono- and double-layer superlattices with subnanometer- to micrometer-scale materials. This work represents a breakthrough in traditional superlattice construction concepts. It offers new perspectives for ultrafast and large-scale superlattice assembly and broadens the application prospects of superlattice films of NPs in burgeoning fields such as biosensing and flexible displays.},

  abstract     = {Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs) of the EosFP family are commonly used in ensemble pulse-chase and single-molecule localization or tracking approaches. However, these fluorescent proteins exhibit highly complex photophysical behaviors. In the green-form, recent NMR experiments revealed that mEos4b and other PCFP variants exist in two different conformational states at thermal equilibrium, which limits their effective photoconversion efficiency. Here, we investigate the conformational heterogeneity of mEos4b in the photoconverted red-form, employing a combination of solution NMR, UV–vis spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging. Only a single red population of mEos4b is observed at thermal equilibrium. However, a second population emerges under illumination with 405 or 488 nm light, which slowly decays in the dark or can be swiftly reverted under 561 nm light. This second population manifests itself through a pH-dependent positive photoswitching mechanism that adds to the already characterized negative photoswitching assigned to cis – trans isomerization of the chromophore. Our data indicate that positive photoswitching, instead, results from the light-induced formation of a second fluorescent state with a cis configuration of the chromophore that exhibits a substantially increased p K a . Such a mechanism, suggested to result from rewiring of the H-bonding network around the first amino acid of the chromophore, adds to the panoply of switching scenarios observed in fluorescent proteins. It bears consequences for the spectroscopic characterization of PCFPs, reduces their apparent brightness and generates short-lived off-times perturbing single-molecule localization microscopy applications.},

This study presents a Ga-ZnO 1– x nanosheets photocatalyst with a (100) preferred orientation, featuring abundant refined frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) sites, excellent light absorption, and efficient charge transport properties. Under visible light irradiation, this catalyst activates methanol to generate a methyl carbene (methylene) intermediate, which subsequently reacts with another methanol molecule to produce ethanol. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that FLP sites, composed of oxygen vacancies and Ga, respectively activate C–H and C–O bonds while efficiently capturing photogenerated electrons and holes, making the most significant contribution to the formation of carbene intermediates. This research not only offers an eco-friendly route for methanol-to-ethanol conversion but also establishes a safer and more efficient method for methyl carbene production under mild conditions.},

  abstract     = {The electrocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid is a process that often requires high voltage, leading to increased energy consumption, side reactions (oxygen evolution reaction (OER)), and catalyst degradation. Herein, our study introduces a novel approach. We demonstrate that a PtZn-ZnO x catalyst featuring a PtZn intermetallic structure with abundant PtZn-ZnO x interfaces on the surface allows for the electrocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid with an impressive selectivity of 99.5% at a low potential of 0.725 V (vs a reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which is 0.6 V lower than most reported studies. This high selectivity is a testament to the efficiency of our catalyst, as it significantly reduces the occurrence of side reactions, leading to a more efficient and sustainable process. The experimental and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the adsorption of Ph–CH 2 OH and Ph–CHO and the generation of electrophilic OH* were promoted due to the unsaturated coordination of the Zn atom in the PtZn-ZnO x interfaces. Furthermore, the potential-determining step of coupling OH* with Ph–CHO was promoted due to the low energy barrier at the PtZn-ZnO x interface, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. This study outlines a novel approach to designing highly efficient electrocatalysts for high-efficiency alcohol valorization at low voltages.},

  abstract     = {Trichothecenes are a widespread family of sesquiterpenoid toxins that can pose significant risks to food and feed safety as well as environmental health. A defining feature of all trichothecenes is their central tricyclic 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT) motif. Although the formation of the EPT central skeleton has long been presumed to be a spontaneous process, the nonenzymatic cyclization reaction forming the tetrahydropyran ring in EPT requires acid catalysis; otherwise, it occurs too slowly to sustain efficient trichothecene biosynthesis under physiological conditions. Here, we resolved this decades-old problem by identifying the missing enzymes for EPT biosynthesis. We demonstrate that the C11 hydroxyl group of universal trichothecene precursors, isotrichodiol and isotrichotriol, must be acetylated by a strictly conserved O -acetyltransferase Tri3 to furnish a better leaving group. These acetylated intermediates preferentially undergo spontaneous allylic rearrangement with water to give shunt products, trichodiol and trichotriol. Therefore, a novel cyclase, Tri14, which was previously annotated as a hypothetical protein, is required to overcome the kinetically unfavored oxide bridge closure and meanwhile suppress the spontaneous formation of any shunt products.},

  abstract     = {Triterpenoids and steroids are structurally complex polycyclic natural products with potent biological functions, for example, as hormones. In all eukaryotes, the carbon skeletons of these compounds are generated by oxidosqualene cyclases, which carry out a polycyclization cascade to generate four or five rings with up to nine stereogenic centers in a targeted manner. The tight stereochemical control of this cascade reaction severely limits the stereochemical space accessible by known oxidosqualene cyclases. Considering that naturally occurring hormone stereoisomers have markedly different biological activities, finding ways to produce stereoisomers of triterpenes would be highly desirable to open new avenues for developing triterpenoid and steroid drugs. Here, we present a plant kingdom-wide sequence mining approach based on sequence similarity networks to search for noncanonical oxidosqualene cyclases that might produce triterpene stereoisomers. From 1,891 oxidosqualene cyclase sequences representing the diversity of green plants, six candidates were selected for functional evaluation by heterologous production in Nicotiana benthamiana . Of these six candidates, three produced rare or previously inaccessible triterpene stereoisomers, namely, (3 S ,13 S )-malabarica-17,21-diene-3β,14-diol, 19- epi -lupeol, and a previously unknown hopanoid stereoisomer that we call protostahopenol. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed key residues important for catalytic activity. The sequence similarity network mining strategy employed here will facilitate the targeted discovery of enzymes with unusual activity in higher organisms, which are not amenable to common genome mining approaches. More importantly, our work expands the accessible stereochemical space of triterpenes and represents the first step to the development of new triterpenoid-derived drugs.},

  abstract     = {An accelerated development of durable and affordable sustainable energy technologies is often hindered by a limited understanding of how nonprecious materials within these systems degrade. In acidic proton exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers, metallic cobalt (Co) is considered an unstable component that is often combined with precious metals or other stabilizers. To understand the mechanisms behind Co instability, we employ an experimental platform that quantifies dissolution with on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and product formation with electrochemical mass spectrometry during electrochemical testing, along with ex situ characterization. Under varied conditions (electrocatalysis, time, gas-type saturation, and ion concentration), windows of Co stability are observed that are different than predicted with classical chemical thermodynamics, suggesting new stabilization and degradation mechanisms than previously understood. Notably, Co is active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with prolonged stability that is ∼300 mV greater than thermodynamically projected. Additionally, in an oxygenated environment, Co concurrently performs the HER and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) yet undergoes different morphology changes and dissolution mechanisms. Interestingly, at open-circuit voltage, there is a 22× decrease in dissolution in an oxygen-free environment, proposing a route to decrease Co losses during device shutdown protocols. Lastly, under more extreme operating conditions, Co becomes stable after a substantial amount of dissolution, suggesting that high concentrations of Co 2+ ions in the microenvironment induce the formation of a stable CoHO 2 surface. Altogether, these results can be leveraged to improve the design and development of more robust and cost-effective sustainable energy technologies, as well as promote strategic strategies for prolonged material utilization.},

Mechanistic insights from in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and complementary synthetic experiments reveal two distinct reaction pathways: the direct oxidation of a hemiaminal intermediate and a novel route involving the formation of methylisocyanide, which subsequently hydrates to yield methylformamide. The presence of methylisocyanide was confirmed through mass spectrometry analysis following a successful Ugi multicomponent reaction, demonstrating the ability to safely utilize reactive intermediates within an electrochemical framework.

Contrary to established selectivity trends found for C–H activation by transition metal complexes, strained cycloalkanes, including cyclopentane, cycloheptane, and cyclooctane, undergo C–H addition much more readily than n -alkanes, which in turn are much more reactive than cyclohexane. Aromatic C–H bonds also undergo H/D exchange much less rapidly than those of the strained cycloalkanes, but much more favorably than cyclohexane. The order of reactivity toward dehydrogenation correlates qualitatively with the reaction thermodynamics, but the magnitude is much greater than can be explained by thermodynamics. Accordingly, the cycloalkenes corresponding to the strained cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenation much more readily than cyclohexene, despite the less favorable thermodynamics of such hydrogenations. Computational (DFT) studies allow rationalization of the origin of reactivity and the unusual selectivity. Specifically, the initial C–H addition is strongly assisted by β-agostic interactions, which are particularly favorable for the strained cycloalkanes. Subsequent to α-C–H addition, the H atom of the β-agostic C–H bond is transferred directly to the hydride ligand of ( iPr PCP)IrH + to give a dihydrogen ligand. The overall processes, C–H addition and β-H-transfer to hydride, are calculated to generally have minima on the IRC surface although not necessarily on the enthalpy or free energy surfaces; these minima are extremely shallow such that the 1,2-dehydrogenations are effectively concerted although asynchronous.},

Here, we explore the potential of stabilizing active Ru sites in Ru x (Ir,Fe,Co,Ni) 1– x multicomponent alloy by investigating its phase formation behavior, OER performance, and OER-induced surface reconstruction. The alloy exhibited a multiphase structure composed of major face-centered cubic (fcc) and minor hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases at near equimolar concentration. Machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) coupled with replica-exchange molecular dynamics was utilized to describe the atomic scale mixing behavior of the Ru x (Ir,Fe,Co,Ni) 1– x catalysts and other RuIr-based alloys. The model supports our experimental findings of the well-mixed bulk fcc phase and provides an indication of the minor hcp phase formation. The optimized Ru 0.20 (Ir,Fe,Co,Ni) 0.80 catalyst exhibited improved OER activity with an average overpotential of ∼237 mV measured at 10 mA cm –2 and enhanced stability with a low activity degradation rate of ∼1.1 mV h –1 in 24 h of operation. The acidic OER conditions induced the formation of a thin RuIr-rich oxide shell layer with a trace amount of 3d metals, where Ru was found to be relatively stabilized near the surface of the evolved nanoparticles. The machine learning-accelerated high throughput simulation protocol was further employed to screen other potential RuIr-containing quinary alloys based on expected phase stability.

Recent vibrational spectroscopic studies of electrochemical CO 2 or CO reduction reaction (CO (2) RR) characterized an interesting formation of stochastic CO (CO stochastic ) intermediate with negligible energy losses under certain circumstances. Yet, the precise formation conditions and mechanisms remain unclear, hindering the correct understanding of related spectroscopic results and utilization of these effects to develop the CO (2) RR and other electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, we combine in situ attenuated total reflection infrared absorption (ATR-IR) and Raman spectroscopies to systematically study the origins and generation mechanisms of these CO stochastic . We reveal for the first time that the CO stochastic originates from plasmonic excitation of Cu by laser excitation and exists only in in situ Raman but not in ATR-IR measurements utilizing the exact same catalysts and electrochemical cell. Both the illumination wavelength and the fluence are important for the formation of CO stochastic . Furthermore, the surface speciation of the catalyst, i.e., the copresence of mixed metallic Cu 0 and Cu + states, is discovered to be crucial for the formation of CO stochastic . These results demonstrate that mechanistic studies of the CO (2) RR and other electrocatalytic reactions utilizing in situ Raman spectroscopy must carefully control the excitation fluence to avoid signals due to plasmonic excitations of the catalysts other than the electrochemical processes. Meanwhile, plasmon-enhanced electrochemistry, although still impractical for promoting CO 2 RR under ordinary illumination, may inspire new strategies for designing light-driven electrochemical reactions at extremely low overpotentials.},

  abstract     = {Raman-based theranostics has demonstrated great potential for sensitive real-time imaging and treatment. However, these advanced materials, primarily depending on the SERS technique, encounter clinical concerns regarding substrate biosafety. Herein, we molecularly engineered a de novo substrate-free SICTERS small molecule, namely BTT–TPA (bis-thienyl-substituted benzotriazole selenadiazole derivative structures), possessing both ultrasensitive Raman signals and excellent photothermal effects based on self-stacking. The mechanistic studies confirm that BTT maintains the planar structure with polycyclic distorted vibrations required for SICTERS. TPA enhances the donor–acceptor interaction, yielding a Raman sensitivity of BTT higher than previously reported SICTERS molecules; it also acts as a molecular rotor, increasing the photothermal conversion efficiency to 67.44%, which is superior to most of the existing SERS-based photothermal materials. In the tumor model of mouse orthotopic colon cancer, BTT–TPA NPs demonstrate a great Raman imaging-guided photothermal therapy effect in eliminating primary and metastatic tumors, remarkably decreasing the recurrence rate. This work puts forward substrate-free SICTERS small molecules toward Raman-based theranostic applications in vivo .},

  abstract     = {Commodity plastics such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) have become integral to society. However, the potentially long-lasting ecological impacts of these plastics have spurred researchers to search for more sustainable solutions. One such solution is to develop a method for designing plastics with tunable and improved properties, thus decreasing the amount of material needed for various applications. In this work, we report a machine learning approach that maps the relationship between polymer molecular weight distributions (MWDs) and the physical properties (tensile and rheological) of HDPE. Using this approach, we design and generate HDPE materials with user-specified properties and valorize degraded postconsumer polyethylene waste. Implementation and development of this approach will facilitate the design of next-generation commodity materials and enable more efficient polymer recycling, thereby lowering the overall impact of HDPE on the environment.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor devices often rely on high-purity materials and interfaces achieved through vapor- and vacuum-based fabrication methods, which can enable precise compositional control down to single atomic layers. Compared to groups IV and III–V semiconductors, hybrid perovskites (HPs) are an emergent class of semiconductor materials with remarkable solution processability and compositional variability that have facilitated rapid experimentation to achieve new properties and progress toward efficient devices, particularly for solar cells. Surprisingly, vapor deposition techniques for HPs are substantially less developed, despite the complementary benefits that have secured vapor methods as workhorse tools for semiconductor fabrication. For instance, metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) emerged in the late 1960s as a vital tool to enable production of compound semiconductor and heterojunction devices, giving rise to tremendously important technologies such as solid-state lighting and diode lasers, yet there is no analogous MOCVD process for HPs. Here, using a custom-built two-zone reactor, we report the first MOCVD process for the direct vapor deposition of thick and continuous films of methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX 3 ; X = Br, I) from distinct organolead, halide, and amine vapor sources. Mechanistic investigation via kinetic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a multistep reaction mechanism that should be generalizable to a broad set of HP materials. We anticipate that the continued development of generic HP MOCVD processes will unlock compositional, crystallographic, and morphological control complementary to solution methods, enabling the rational design of material properties and pursuit of new applications.},

We found that FAPbI 3 exhibits 10× higher solubility in 30% 2ME in GBL than in 2ME alone and 40% higher solubility than in GBL alone at 90 °C. This enhanced solubility is attributed to the disruption of the hydrogen bonding network within 2ME, allowing its hydroxyl and ether groups to interact more freely with the solute. Leveraging this phenomenon, we grew phase-stable α-FAPbI 3 thin single crystals under ambient air conditions with no doping. Compared to conventional cesium-doped FAPbI 3 , the undoped FAPbI 3 single-crystal films exhibited lower defect densities and enhanced charge retention and transfer while also avoiding phase segregation linked to cesium incorporation. Solar cells fabricated with these ambient-air-grown single-crystal films achieved an efficiency of 21.56% (17.72% for cesium-doped FAPbI 3 ), retaining 90% of performance after six months of storage. These findings advance our understanding of perovskite solubility in solvent blends and offer an efficient pathway for producing stable, high-efficiency FAPbI 3 single-crystal solar cells through ambient air fabrication, overcoming the limitations of doping.},

  abstract     = {Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the pivotal catabolic enzyme responsible for signal termination in the endocannabinoid system. Inhibition of MAGL offers unique advantages over the direct activation of cannabinoid receptors in treating cancer, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory diseases. Although specific fluorescent molecular imaging probes are commonly used for the real-time analysis of the localization and distribution of drug targets in cells, they are almost invariably composed of a linker connecting the pharmacophore with a large fluorophore. In this study, we have developed miniaturized fluorescent probes targeting MAGL by incorporating a highly fluorescent boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moiety into the inhibitor structure that interacts with the MAGL active site. These miniaturized fluorescent probes exhibit favorable drug-like properties such as high solubility and permeability, picomolar potency for MAGL across various species, and high cell selectivity and specificity. A range of translational investigations were conducted, including cell-free fluorescence polarization assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and confocal fluorescence microscopy of live cancer cells, live primary neurons, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids. Furthermore, the application of red-shifted analogs or 18 F positron emission labeling illustrated the significant versatility and adaptability of the fluorescent ligands in various experimental contexts.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the role of phosphorylation in the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of tau, the underlying driving forces, and the potential implications of this separation on protein conformation and subsequent protein aggregation were investigated. We compared in vivo-produced phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and nonphosphorylated tau under different coacervation conditions without adding crowding agents. Our findings revealed that spontaneous phase separation occurs exclusively in p-tau, triggered by a temperature shift from 4 °C to room temperature, and is driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The p-tau self-acervation is reversible with temperature changes. Native mass spectrometry detects only two to nine phosphate groups per p-tau molecule, highlighting the impact of phosphorylation on tau’s structural flexibility. Cross-linking mass spectrometry showed fewer long-range contacts in p-tau, suggesting a looser conformation induced by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-induced LLPS and RNA-induced LLPS occurred at different timeframes. However, neither tau nor p-tau formed fibrils without the addition of dextran sulfate or RNA as inducers. Using human kidney epithelial cells expressing the tau R domain fused with fluorescent proteins as reporter cells, we observed aggregates in the nuclear envelope (NE) only in the cells treated with LLPS-state p-tau, which correlates with NE occurrences reported in Alzheimer’s disease brain sections. These findings provide deeper insights into the impact of phosphorylation on tau aggregation through an intermediate condensation phase, offering novel perspectives on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.},

Previous research has shown that structural factors, in particular, site disorder between the sulfide and halide anions, can impact the ionic conductivity of lithium argyrodites. One current hypothesis for this correlation between anion site disorder and ionic transport is a connection to the lithium-ion substructure. However, as there is limited research surrounding the anion disordering process itself, this relationship has yet to be fully understood. This research explores the impact of the composition and synthesis on the anion disordering process through the Li 6+ x P 1– x Si x S 5 Br ( x = 0 to 0.4 in 0.1 steps) series of substitutions quenched from different annealing temperatures. Ex situ and in situ diffraction studies show that the anion site disorder within the compounds increases upon Si introduction only for samples quenched from higher annealing temperatures but remains relatively constant at lower annealing temperatures. Based on in situ diffraction measurements, we further monitor the effects of anion mobility at elevated temperatures allowing inference of slower anion disordering kinetics with changing compositional content. We complement the experimental work using nudged-elastic band calculations showing the overall preference of anions for their specific sites and the possibility of anion mobility. This work provides insight into the argyrodites and shows that the anion disordering can be monitored and that the composition has strong influences on the disordering process.},

Drawing inspiration from the metal catalyzed oxidation (MCO) processes of arginine, we introduce a chemical methodology aimed at generating glutamate-5-semialdehyde from arginine residues within peptides and proteins. This innovative chemical approach capitalizes on the inherent weak nucleophilicity and oxidative properties of arginine. We also demonstrate the application of this strategy to selectively introduce both natural and unnatural post-translational modifications (PTMs) in a targeted manner. Our chemical approach offers a rapid, robust, and highly selective technique, facilitating chemoproteomic profiling of arginine sites prone to forming glutamate-5-semialdehyde PTM within the human proteome. Additionally, this methodology serves as a versatile platform for uncovering microenvironments that are susceptible to undergoing arginine carbonylation PTM, enabling the understanding of the effect of oxidative stress on arginine in proteins and the impact of these PTMs on cellular processes.},

  abstract     = {The activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a complex multibody multievent process involving agonist binding, receptor activation, G protein coupling, and subsequent G protein activation. The order and energetics of these events, though crucial for the rational design of selective GPCR drugs, are challenging to characterize and remain largely underexplored. Here, we employed molecular dynamics simulations and our recently developed traveling salesman-based automated path searching (TAPS) algorithm to efficiently locate the minimum free-energy paths for the coupling events of the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) with its endogenous ligand CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and Gi protein. We show that, after overcoming three low energy barriers (3.24–6.89 kcal/mol), Gi alone can precouple with CXCR4 even without CXCL12, consistent with previous reports on the existence of the apo CXCR4-Gi complex and our NanoBiT experiments. The highest barrier of 6.89 kcal/mol in this process corresponds to the packing of the proline–isoleucine–phenylalanine (PIF) motif of CXCR4. Interestingly, without Gi, CXCL12 alone cannot activate CXCR4 (high barrier of 18.89 kcal/mol). Instead, it can enhance Gi coupling by circumventing the energy barrier of PIF packing. Shedding new light on the activation mechanism of CXCR4, these results present TAPS as a promising tool for uncovering complete activation pathways of GPCRs and the corresponding agonist design.},

Here, Chevrel phase Mo 6 S 8 with high conductivity and insertable frameworks is proposed for the first time as a cost-efficient candidate with prominent performance and, more importantly, as a new platform to unravel cation effects on nitroarene electroreduction. Nanosized Mo 6 S 8 derived from polymer-confined sulfidation affords a high yield (∼95%) and Faradaic efficiency (∼99%) for reducing 4-nitrostyrene to 4-aminostyrene at −0.45 V (vs RHE) in 0.1 M LiClO 4 , outperforming a series of counterparts of metal sulfides and even noble metals. The combination of experimental and theoretical analyses identifies an intercalation-correlated cation effect, expanding the current knowledge limited to the outer Helmholtz plane of electrodes. In situ Li + intercalation into Mo 6 S 8 cavities during electrolysis ameliorates the electronic configurations and thereby promotes the adsorption of the nitro group on low-coordinated Mo sites for hydrogenation via a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the efficient electrosynthesis of aniline derivatives with conserved reducing groups from a wide range of substrates highlights the promise of Mo 6 S 8 for electrochemical refinery.},

Takemoto’s tert -amine/thiourea catalyst, an archetype in these endeavors, has encouraged many to design new multifunctional alternatives. However, the discovery of efficient catalysts in a library of thousands of candidates containing the desired functionalities in their structures remains a great challenge both synthetically and computationally. We, toward these ends, developed a computational protocol (CIPOC─Computational Identification of POtential (Organo)Catalysts), which discovered a chiral 2-aminoDMAP/urea catalyst among 1600 multifunctional catalyst candidates enabling conjugate addition of malonates to trans -β-nitroalkenes rapidly (in a few hours) with exquisite selectivities and yields, producing superior results than that of Takemoto’s. The unique activity of this chiral 2-aminoDMAP/urea is attributed to the dual function of the 2-aminoDMAP unit (double H-bonding and π-stacking interactions) in addition to the exceptional performance of the urea unit compared to thiourea, as a result of a lower energetic penalty required to distort the catalyst to its active conformation to provide optimal catalytic interactions.},

Theoretically, compounds featuring smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps gain stronger ambiphilicity and higher reactivity. In this work, we fundamentally demonstrate that Me 3 Sb holds the smallest HOMO–LUMO gap among trimethylpnictines, indicating its outstanding ambiphilicity. Correspondingly, the superior reactivity of Me 3 Sb toward deoxygenation of electron-deficient nitroarenes has been unambiguously revealed through control experiments. Furthermore, unprecedented Sb III /Sb V O cycling between trialkylstibines and their oxides has been established for the catalytic transformation of nitroarenes into azoxyarenes/azoarenes. This study opens a new chapter for organoantimony derivatives in the fields of ambiphilic reactivity and redox catalysis.},

Coronoid synthesis has long been considered difficult due to the cyclization of nanographene. It becomes an immense challenge to synthesize open-shell coronoids since radicals appear only when the macrocycle size exceeds a critical value. Here we present an open-shell coronoid with six radicals achieved through an on-surface synthesis. This spin coronoid displays a collective spin state arising from both the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction and the next-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction of six unpaired π electrons along the conjugation pathways. The characterization of the spin excitation from the ground state to the excited state was carried out by using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. Additionally, we show that the spin coronoid can be utilized as a nanoscale platform to achieve short antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains through tip manipulation. Our findings present a design strategy for creating coronoids with polyradicals, which could provide inspiration for fabrication of open-shell coronoid or cyclic spintronic systems.},

  abstract     = {Melanins play important roles in nature, particularly in coloration and photoprotection, where interaction with light is essential. Biomimetic melanins represent an advantageous alternative to natural melanin for technological applications, sharing the same unique biocompatibility, as well as optoelectronic properties. Allomelanin, derived from 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene, has been reported to exhibit even better photoprotective and antioxidant properties than the most studied example of biomimetic melanin, polydopamine. However, the interaction of allomelanin with light remains largely unexplored. Here we report the excited state dynamics of allomelanin in a wide range of time windows from femtoseconds to microseconds to minutes, using different experimental techniques, i.e., ultrafast transient absorption, nanosecond transient absorption, X-band electron paramagnetic resonance and radical quenching assays. We find that the photophysics of allomelanin starkly differs from that of the widely studied polydopamine, with broadband excitonically coupled states funneling the absorbed energy to a lower energy species in less than 1 ps. Independent of the excitation wavelength, a long-lived (&gt;450 μs) photoproduct is populated in ≈24 ps. Quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the photoproduct primarily exhibits the character of localized 1,8-naphthoquinone radical anions. This light-driven increase in the anionic semiquinone-like radical concentration enhances the antioxidant activity of allomelanin. These results suggest that the two mechanisms considered at the basis of photoprotection, light-extinction and antioxidant action, are indeed synergistic in allomelanin and not independent, paving the way for new applications of allomelanin in nanomedicine, photocatalysis, energy conversion and environmental remediation.},

However, the deconjugative isomerization of cyclic enones is underdeveloped and often associated with impractical reaction conditions, limited substrate scopes, and a lack of mechanistic clarity. Herein, we report an operationally simple photochemical isomerization of cyclic enones using near-UV (372 nm) irradiation with catalytic amounts of Brønsted acid (HCl). This platform enables exocyclic deconjugative isomerization of a diverse array of enones including α-isophorone (a key intermediate in a variety of industrial processes), terpenoids and steroids.

While heterostructures combining plasmonic two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) and semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold significant potential, the mechanisms governing plasmon-induced carrier dynamics at these interfaces remain elusive. Here, we uncover a distinctive secondary excitation phenomenon and an ultrafast charge/energy transfer process in heterostructure films composed of macro-scale Ti 3 C 2 T x and MoS 2 films. Using Rayleigh–Bénard convection and Marangoni effect-induced self-assembly, we fabricate large-scale (square centimeters) Ti 3 C 2 T x and MoS 2 films composed of edge-connected monolayer nanoflakes. These films are flexibly stacked in a controlled sequence to form macroscopic heterostructures, enabling the investigation and manipulation of excited-state dynamics using transient absorption and optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy. In the Ti 3 C 2 T x -MoS 2 heterostructure, we observe a secondary excitation in MoS 2 driven by the surface plasmon resonance of Ti 3 C 2 T x . This phenomenon, with a characteristic rise time constant of ∼70 ps, is likely facilitated by acoustic phonon recycling across the interface. Further interfacial thermal transport engineering─achieved by tailoring the sequence and combination of interfaces in trilayer heterostructures─allows extending the characteristic time to ∼175 ps. Furthermore, we identify a sub-150 fs ultrafast charge/energy transfer process from Ti 3 C 2 T x to MoS 2 . The transfer efficiency is strongly dependent on the excitation photon energy, resulting in amplified photoconductivity in MoS 2 by up to ∼180% under 3.10 eV excitation. These insights are crucial for developing plasmonic MXene-based heterostructures, paving the way for advancements in photochemical and optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Despite the significant potential of photocatalysis as a robust synthetic tool, the high reactivity of radicals often presents challenges in achieving optimal chemoselectivity. In this study, we demonstrate that this inherent limitation can be strategically harnessed for asymmetric photoredox catalysis. By utilizing a chiral catalyst to facilitate kinetic resolution between the two enantiomers of racemic radical intermediates, one enantiomer selectively undergoes the desired transformation, while noncatalytic side reactions deplete the other enantiomer. Consequently, an attractive asymmetric photoredox three-component Minisci-type reaction involving bromides, racemic homoallylic tertiary alcohols or amines, and azaarenes has been developed. This approach enables efficient assembly of tertiary alcohols and amines onto the nonadjacent β-position of an azaarene-functionalized tertiary carbon stereogenic center with high levels of enantio- and diastereoselectivity. Therefore, this method not only allows for direct utilization of readily available racemic feedstocks that are challenging to convert into prochiral radicals via redox processes but also provides an efficient strategy for synthesizing complex molecules with multiple stereocenters.},

Here, using GDE-type flow electrolyzers, we report that the selectivity of total C 2+ products on Cu is independent of alkali cation identity (Li + , Na + , K + , and Cs + ) in the absence of the CO transport limitation. Notably, a high concentration of strongly hydrated cation (such as Li + ) inhibits the total C 2+ formation in CO reduction, whereas total C 2+ selectivity is retained upon increasing concentrations of weakly hydrated cation (such as K + ). Further investigations reveal that the CO coverage at a low cation concentration is almost independent of the cation identity, but the CO coverage at highly concentrated cations strongly relies on the alkali cation identity.},

The macromechanical analysis of this layered crystal shows shearing behavior, which is quantified using nanoindentation experiments.

This unprecedented mode of affinity-precipitation was exploited here to design the COL-induced RNA G4 precipitation and sequencing (CoRP-seq) protocol, which allows for the assessment of the prevalence of RNA G4s in the transcriptome of human cells in a straightforward manner. CoRP-seq shines by its ultraspecificity, simplicity, and practical convenience, which thus advances G4 mapping further and addresses unmet needs in the field of G4omics.},

  abstract     = {Fluorescence thermometry has emerged as a significant area of research in the field of remote temperature sensing with high accuracy. However, the development of noninvasive and reliable small organic fluorescence thermometers (FTs) remains challenging. In this study, we developed a high-sensitivity, high-resolution small organic ratiometric FT with a solvatochromic dye and analyzed its temperature response mechanism. π-Extended fluorene-based D−π–A-type small solvatochromic dyes ( FπAc , FπF , and FπVC ) were synthesized and characterized. A significant solvatochromic shift of &gt;200 nm was observed between n -hexane and tetrahydrofuran (THF) for both FπF and FπVC , with emission in THF reaching the red region (701 nm, 828 nm). This substantial solvatochromic shift was accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield and is attributable to accelerated internal conversion. The fluorescence spectra of FπF in THF and FπVC in diethyl ether exhibited blue shifts and increased fluorescence intensities with a decrease in polarity at increased temperatures. Our observations revealed an absolute sensitivity of 21%/°C and a relative sensitivity of 3.0%/°C at the maximum. These results represent the highest sensitivity and resolution reported for single fluorophore small organic ratiometric FTs dispersed in solution. The positive temperature coefficient of the fluorescence intensity was attributed to control of the nonradiative decay pathway by solvatochromism. The temperature responsiveness of FπF could be detected in living HeLa cells by ratiometric confocal microscopy. Using the proposed strategy to develop FTs, we plan to build a library of FTs that will cover various environments of interest in both simple and complex systems.},

How to achieve large magnetic anisotropies in the Ln 3+ complexes coordinated with open-chain ligands is still a challenge. In this study, we started from the open-chain 4PS-PyMTA ligand and assessed the magnetic anisotropy using installed Ln 3+ coordinating pendants by increasing size and rigidity. This approach yielded Ln 3+ complexes with increasing magnetic anisotropies. The magnetic anisotropy and conformational dynamics of these open-chain 4PS-PyMTA-based Ln 3+ complexes were evaluated by NMR spectroscopy. The impact of the coordination arms on the magnetic anisotropy was further characterized by the ligand field parameters derived from europium luminescence spectra. These data show that the design strategy yielded an efficient way to enhance the conformational rigidity of the Ln 3+ chelating moiety and the ligand field strength, which underpins magnetic anisotropy. The magnitudes of pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings obtained with these 4PS-PyMTA-derived tags installed on a protein rival those obtained previously with synthetically less accessible cyclen-based Ln 3+ tags. Our work provides a practical strategy to open-chain Ln 3+ complexes with large magnetic anisotropies and straightforward synthetic protocols.},

Herein, we report a photocatalytic protocol for formal S N Ar of electron-rich 4-halophenols with azole nucleophiles under mild, redox-neutral conditions. The transformation proceeds via a two-stage mechanism consisting of initial halophenol oligomerization to produce a key oligo(phenylene oxide) intermediate and its subsequent breakdown through S N Ar with the azole enabled by photoredox-catalyzed arene umpolung. Reaction monitoring, stoichiometric control experiments, and luminescence quenching data implicate phenoxyl radicals and Brønsted acid-activated oligo(phenylene oxide) radicals as the reactive species in the oligomerization and the S N Ar stages, respectively. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated across 17 (pseudo)halophenols bearing a variety of leaving groups (F, Cl, Br, OMs, and OTs) and 22 azole examples.},

PFS- b -PTDMA unimers were added in the seeded growth step. The corona-forming block PTDMA–POEGMA is amphiphilic and sensitive to polarity changes of the solvents. We sought solvents in which the upper critical solution temperature (UCST, T UCST ) of POEGMA was slightly above room temperature (RT). Examples included 1-decanol and 1-decanol/decane mixtures. Seeded growth proceeded normally in solvents above the UCST of POEGMA. When the solution temperature was lowered below T UCST , or when the triblock comicelles or scarf-like micelles were transferred to a solvent (e.g., 1-decanol) below its T UCST , the center blocks associated to form star-like supermicelles. The addition of small amounts of THF to the medium to increase the solvency for POEGMA led to dissociation of the supermicelles. Transfer of the triblock comicelles to 1-pentanol at RT, below the UCST of PTDMA, also led to controlled secondary association to form supermicelles with a different morphology. Seeded growth with PFS 25 - b -PDMAEMA 184 unimers led to supermicelles in which the poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) corona chains could serve as carriers for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These AuNP@supermicelle complexes could serve as recoverable catalysts, for example to catalyze the condensation polymerization of bis(dimethylsilyl)benzene and pentanediol.

Herein, we report a pair of highly site-selective, regiodivergent carbocyclization reactions of dienallenes and trienallenes, enabling the efficient synthesis of cis -1,4-disubstituted cyclohexenes and trans -1,2-disubstituted cyclobutenes from a common precursor with high diastereoselectivity. Remarkably, simple achiral organophosphoric acids and amines are identified as powerful ligands for controlling these palladium-catalyzed regiodivergent carbocyclizations. This approach represents the first example of site-selective regiodivergent carbocyclization, providing a practical method for the stereospecific synthesis of thermodynamically disfavored cis -1,4-disubstituted cyclohexenes and fully substituted trans -1,2-cyclobutenes. Additionally, the methodology developed offers general insights into the development of metal-catalyzed site-selective, regiodivergent carbocyclizations of diene and polyene precursors, mimicking natural carbocyclization processes.},

The introduction of transannular strain and loss of degrees of freedom in forming macrocycles often result in poor reaction kinetics and thermodynamics (i.e., thermodynamically disfavored at equilibrium). To address these challenges, we herein report a strategy for the synthesis of medium-to-large sized rings, which leverages strain-release and metal templating through a palladium-mediated C–C cleavage/cross-coupling. By means of DOSY NMR techniques, we identified an undesired competing β-hydrogen elimination pathway, which was substrate dependent. Using a streamlined synthesis of the requisite precursors, our method enables the rapid generation of complex medium-to-large sized rings in a modular fashion through a C(sp 2 )–C(sp 3 ) macrocyclization. The transformation enabled the short total synthesis of various resorcylic acid lactone (RAL) natural products and unnatural analogues of late-stage intermediates. A mechanistic proposal for the macrocyclization is supported by computational studies of the reaction using density functional theory.},

Challenges in the field include how to achieve real-time monitoring of the chirality and energy transfer dynamics simultaneously, as well as how to distinguish whether these processes take place in the ground or excited state. Herein, we achieve the first attempt at real-time observation of the concerted ultrafast dynamics between the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and the generation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the excited state in near-infrared CPL supramolecular nanofibers (SNFs) by using femtosecond time-resolved circularly polarized luminescence (fs-TRCPL) spectroscopy. Our findings reveal a cooperative interplay between FRET and CPL emission, unfolding over time scales from several to hundreds of picoseconds. Notably, we identify that the pivotal mechanism leading to a 0.045 g lum value in SNFs is the difference in the FRET rates between left- and right-handed circularly polarized emission channels, which is a reason beyond the well-known relationship of the electronic and magnetic dipoles. Our results not only shed light on the understanding of the chirality transfer mechanism in the excited states but also pave the road for the development of novel CPL materials in the future.},

However, the controllable synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) polymetallic alloy nanomaterials remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a new and general low-temperature method to prepare a library of binary to septenary polymetallic alloy nanotubes, and this method can be used to synthesize 18 kinds of polymetallic alloy nanotube (NT), including eight kinds of high-entropy alloy (HEA) NT. A representative Cu 30 Ni 26 Co 19 Ru 14 Ir 11 HEA NT demonstrates efficient and stable catalytic performance for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Cu 30 Ni 26 Co 19 Ru 14 Ir 11 HEA NT exhibits an overpotential of only 121 mV for the HER and 272 mV for the OER, respectively, when measured at a current density of 100 mA cm –2 . In addition, the two-electrode system comprising the Cu 30 Ni 26 Co 19 Ru 14 Ir 11 HEA NT exhibits an impressive efficiency of 100 mA cm –2 during overall water splitting, requiring only a potential of 1.67 V. The high catalytic activity of the Cu 30 Ni 26 Co 19 Ru 14 Ir 11 HEA NT is attributed to the downward shift of the d -band center. In the HER, the downward shift of the d -band center can reduce the binding energy with *H, which is beneficial for the desorption process of hydrogen. In the OER, the downward shift can also reduce the reaction energy barrier associated with the rate-determining step from *O to *OOH. This work seeks to offer a new and general method for synthesizing polymetallic alloy nanotubes with controllable structures and compositions under mild conditions.},

Herein, we propose for the first time a noncovalent aggregate confinement strategy for synthesizing H–G MOF composites with different guest stacking modes. And [perylene 2 ] n (α-Pe) and [perylene] n (β-Pe) were selected as guests and confined into a novel Ca-based MOF {[Ca(TBAPy)(DMA) 2 ]·3DMA·[N(CH 3 ) 2 ]·H 2 O} n (Ca-MOF-pts). The NLO results showed that compared to β-Pe@Ca-MOF-pts, the saturable absorption (SA) and self-defocusing properties of α-Pe@Ca-MOF-pts were increased by 2.71-fold and 3.82-fold, respectively. Interestingly, α/β-Pe@Ca-MOF-pts can be transformed into α/β-Pe@Ca-MOF-flu (Ca-MOF-flu = {[Ca 1.5 (TBAPy)(H 2 O) 2 ]·DMA·[N(CH 3 ) 2 ]·2H 2 O} n ) through self-adaptive topological evolution, and the corresponding NLO absorption signal change from SA to reverse saturable absorption (RSA). As expected, compared to β-Pe@Ca-MOF-flu, the RSA and self-defocusing properties of α-Pe@Ca-MOF-flu are improved by 2.94-fold and 4.07-fold, respectively, demonstrating the importance of guest stacking modes. Theoretical calculation and transient absorption spectra indicated the enhancement of NLO performance was attributed to the large π–π overlap of α-Pe, which promoted the electron delocalization/transfer and optimized the cross-sectional of the ground state and excited state. This study provides a new strategy for developing H–G MOF composites with excellent NLO properties.},

  abstract     = {Making polyesters with conventional vinyl monomers is one of the most economical ways to develop sustainable polymeric materials. For polar vinyls, while their transformation into lactones has been studied extensively, there exists no further access to synthesizing polyesters, presumably due to the nonstrained and nonpolymerizable nature of the obtained lactones. Herein, we report the first facile synthesis of polyesters that originated from one of the most critical classes of polar vinyls-acrylates. Specifically, a series of modular six-membered lactones were rationally designed and synthesized from methyl acrylate together with malonic esters containing diverse functional groups and formaldehyde. The monomers underwent ring-opening polymerization (ROP) to yield the first acrylate-derived polyesters, which further constitute a unique polymer platform with a large scope of potential functionalities and performances as well as easy chemical circularity under mild conditions. Notably, the obtained polyesters are a rare example featuring tunable functionalities on the side ester groups whose impact on certain material properties (e.g., glass transition temperature) is similar to that of polyacrylates, implying potential replacement between polyesters and polyacrylates. In addition, by presenting the special geminal disubstitutions originally from the monomers’ γ-position for the first time, polyesters also exhibited unprecedentedly enhanced thermal and recycling properties: Variation of the geminal disubstitutions offers a unique access to large-span modulation from completely amorphous to high-level crystalline materials, and the melting temperature of the polymer with high crystallinity was drastically increased by 84 °C compared with the reported monosubstituted counterpart. At the same time, compared with polyesters synthesized from other six-membered lactones whose chemical recycling required harsh conditions (&gt;150 °C and high vacuum), the gem-disubstituted polyesters in this work can undergo complete chemical recycling to monomers under much milder conditions (80 °C and ambient pressure). This study informs the design of future high-performance polyesters derived from polar vinyls.},

  abstract     = {Atomic defects, e.g., vacancies, substitutions, and dopants, play crucial roles in determining the functionalities of two-dimensional (2D) materials, including spin glass, single-photon emitters, and energy storage and conversion, due to the introduction of abnormal charge states and noncentrosymmetric distortion. In particular, anti-substitutions are regarded as promising topological defect types, in which substitution occurs at opposite charge sites, fundamentally modifying the atomic and electronic structures of pristine lattices. However, the fabrication of large-scale anti-substitutions remains challenging due to high formation energies and complex reaction paths. Here, we propose an approach for synthesizing atomically dispersed Pt anti-substitutions in defective 1T′-MoTe 2 using the electrochemical exfoliation-assisted leaching–redeposition (EELR) method. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging reveals that Pt atoms substitute Te sites, forming unconventional Mo–Pt bonds. A rich variety of Pt anti-substitution configurations and Pt anti-substitutions coupling with Te vacancies have been fabricated by controlled electrochemical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that Pt atoms preferentially occupy the Te vacancy sites coupled with neighboring Te vacancies, stabilizing the anti-substitution configurations. The coupled Pt–Te defect complexes exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction, with an overpotential of only 12.9 mV because the paired defect complexes cause charge redistribution and regulate the d-band center of the active sites as suggested by DFT. These findings introduce an effective approach for engineering atomically dispersed anti-substitutions in 2D materials, presenting new opportunities for the precise design of atomic features with targeted functionalities in catalytic and other advanced applications.},

Interpretation was supported by impulsive stimulated Raman experiments and time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. The Ir–Ir stretching frequency doubled on going from ground to the lowest singlet excited state 1 dσ*pσ, from 53 to 126 cm –1 , demonstrating Ir–Ir bond formation. Spectral evolution during the first 4 ps after excitation showed extremely large-amplitude coherent oscillations of stimulated emission as well as FSRS signal intensities, which occurred with the excited-state Ir–Ir stretching frequency combined with frequencies of several deformation vibrations and the first Ir–Ir overtone. Corresponding vibrations were observed in FSRS directly but most of them vanished in the first 3 ps, indicating that they belonged to transiently populated hot vibrational states. Fourier transforms of intensity oscillations plotted against FSRS frequencies produced two-dimensional (2D-FSRS) maps with diagonal and off-diagonal features due to Franck–Condon-excited and anharmonically coupled vibrations, some of which acquired Raman intensity through coupling with the Ir–Ir stretch. We concluded that optical excitation impulsively shortens the Ir–Ir distance and increases its stretching force constant, assisted by a simultaneously excited network of coupled deformation modes. The electronically/vibrationally excited system then relaxes through periodic strengthening and weakening of the Ir–Ir interaction and changing conformations of the TMB ligand framework, forming a metal–metal bonded 1 dσ*pσ state after 4–5 ps.},

  abstract     = {Cytotoxic CD8 + T cells are one of the most powerful effectors in the antitumor immune response. However, their insufficient tumor infiltration severely limits the clinical success of immunotherapy in solid tumors. In this work, by using amphiphilic aptamer-incorporated DNA tetrahedra (aptTDN) as the intercellular nanolinker, we developed a monocyte-hitchhiked T-cell delivery strategy to actively promote the intratumoral infiltration of effector CD8 + T cells. Our results demonstrated that membrane-anchoring of aptTDN enabled the specific and stable ligation of T cells with Ly6c + monocytes, without compromising the migratory behavior of monocytes and the antitumor activity of T cells. By leveraging the intrinsic tumor-homing capability of monocytes, the ligated T cells efficiently accumulated within tumor-associated vasculature and then deeply infiltrated the tumor bed. Additionally, the enhanced intratumoral presence of adoptively transferred effector CD8 + T cells facilitated the establishment of an immunosupportive microenvironment, that further recruited endogenous T cells and ultimately bolstered antitumor immunity. Moreover, our monocyte-hitchhiked T-cell tumor infiltration system could significantly improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Collectively, by utilizing chemically synthetic nanolinkers to modulate cellular interactions and develop a delivery system of therapeutic cells, our work presents a new paradigm for the advancement of immunotherapy against solid tumors.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need for next-generation cathodes composed of widely available and industrially scalable elements. Here, we introduce a Li-rich cathode based on the known material Li 2 FeS 2 , composed of low-cost elements (Al, Fe, S) that are globally mined and refined at an industrial scale. The substitution of redox-inactive Al 3+ for Fe 2+ achieves remarkably high degrees of anion redox, which, in turn, yields high gravimetric capacity (≈450 mAh·g –1 ) and energy density (≳1000 Wh·kg –1 ). We show that Al 3+ enables high degrees of delithiation by stabilizing the delithiated state, suppressing phase transformations that would otherwise prevent deep delithiation and extensive anion redox. This mechanistic insight offers new possibilities for developing scalable, next-generation Li-ion battery cathodes to meet pressing societal needs.},

  abstract     = {The ability to arrange brightly fluorescent nanoscale materials into well-defined patterns is critically important in advanced optoelectronic structures. Traditional methods for doing so generally involve depositing different color quantum dot “inks,” irradiating reactive (e.g., cross-linkable) ligands at their surface, and then lifting off the unexposed sections in a developer solvent. Here, we outline a fundamentally different approach for directly patterning the emission color of nanocomposite thin films utilizing mask-based lithographic techniques and laser scanning methods. In this system, a polymer film containing cesium lead halide nanocrystals (NCs) is embedded with an organohalide─termed a “photohalide generator”─which undergoes a light-triggered, perovskite-catalyzed reduction and release of halide anion for uptake by the NC lattice, markedly shifting its band gap. In this manner, a blue emitting (CsPbBr 1.5 Cl 1.5 ) film becomes green and/or red in the exposed areas of a photomask, replicating the mask features as a multichromatic array (e.g., green, red, etc. colors against a blue background). The resolution limits of this materials system were probed using laser scanning tools capable of writing intricate patterns with feature sizes approaching a single micron─more than an order of magnitude smaller than the most comparable methods based on inkjet printing. Lastly, these methods are extended to a combined shape and color patterning process for making free-standing filamentous structures with striped and alternating fluorescence emission along their length.},

  abstract     = {[FeFe] hydrogenases are a diverse class of H 2 -activating enzymes with a wide range of utilities in nature. As H 2 is a promising renewable energy carrier, exploration of the increasingly realized functional diversity of [FeFe] hydrogenases is instrumental for understanding how these remarkable enzymes can benefit society and inspire new technologies. In this work, we uncover the properties of a highly unusual natural chimera composed of a [FeFe] hydrogenase and rubrerythrin as a single polypeptide. The unique combination of [FeFe] hydrogenase with rubrerythrin, an enzyme that functions in H 2 O 2 detoxification, raises the question of whether catalytic reactions, such as H 2 oxidation and H 2 O 2 reduction, are functionally linked. Herein, we express and purify a representative chimera from Clostridium perfringens (termed Cper HydR) and apply various electrochemical and spectroscopic approaches to determine its activity and confirm the presence of each of the proposed metallocofactors. The cumulative data demonstrate that the enzyme contains a surprising array of metallocofactors: the catalytic site of [FeFe] hydrogenase termed the H-cluster, two [4Fe-4S] clusters, two rubredoxin Fe(Cys) 4 centers, and a hemerythrin-like diiron site. The absence of an H 2 -evolution current in protein film voltammetry highlights an exceptional bias of this enzyme toward H 2 oxidation to the greatest extent that has been observed for a [FeFe] hydrogenase. Here, we demonstrate that Cper HydR uses H 2 , catalytically split by the hydrogenase domain, to reduce H 2 O 2 by the diiron site. Structural modeling suggests a homodimeric nature of the protein. Overall, this study demonstrates that Cper HydR is an H 2 -dependent H 2 O 2 reductase. Equipped with this information, we discuss the possible role of this enzyme as a part of the oxygen-stress response system, proposing that Cper HydR constitutes a new pathway for H 2 O 2 mitigation.},

Here, we show that careful selection of the ligand scaffold allows the isolation and characterization of a kinetically stable but highly reactive Lu II complex. This divalent lanthanide species enables direct H 2 splitting at room temperature, an unknown reactivity in lanthanide chemistry, which has been fully corroborated by DFT calculations. In addition, the Lu II complex readily binds N 2 , leading to an end-on coordinated diazenido (N 2 ) 2– lanthanide complex. The latter can be hydrogenated under very smooth conditions (ca. 1.2 bar H 2 , ambient temperature) to form a unique Lu III –NH 2 complex. Direct N 2 hydrogenation and cleavage are thus accessible using low-valent molecular rare-earth metal complexes.},

Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design.

Large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that multivalent hydrogen bonds control the assembly pathway of the coacervates and boost their stability. Systematic point mutations reveal that various multivalent molecular interactions can synergistically tune the properties of complex coacervates. Such peptide coacervates show high drug encapsulation efficacy and trypsin-triggered release, presenting great potential for oral drug delivery applications.

  abstract     = {Hexagonal perovskite derivatives such as Ba 7 Nb 4 MoO 20 and Ba 3 NbMoO 8.5 have recently been reported to exhibit high oxide ion conductivity and have potential applications in next-generation solid oxide fuel cells. In contrast, Ba 3 V 2 O 8 and Sr 3 V 2 O 8 that crystallize with the structurally related palmierite structure show oxide ion conductivities orders of magnitude lower. Here we use design principles to enhance the oxide ion conductivity in palmierites. By replacing V 5+ with two cations that are known to display flexible coordination (Mo 6+ and Ti 4+ ) and manipulating the ratio of Mo 6+ :Ti 4+ to insert interstitial oxygen, a high oxide ion conductivity of 3.96 × 10 –3 S cm –1 at 600 °C is observed in Ba 3 Ti 0.9 Mo 1.1 O 8.1 , two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported in palmierites. The oxide ion conductivity of Ba 3 Ti 0.9 Mo 1.1 O 8.1 is also higher than that previously reported for both Ba 7 Nb 4 MoO 20 and Ba 3 NbMoO 8.5 at 600 °C. Introducing interstitial oxygen into the [BaO 2+ x ] layer results in a change in the oxide ion transport from a cog-wheel type motion to an interstitialcy mechanism, demonstrating that palmierites are flexible to doping strategies via the introduction of either vacancies or oxide ion interstitials.},

  abstract     = {The chiral-polar photovoltaic effect (CPPE), widely present in chiral hybrid perovskites, has brought an unprecedented opportunity for self-powered circularly polarized light (CPL) detection. However, on account of spatial limitations of the crystal structure, currently reported CPPE primarily focuses on low-dimensional hybrid perovskites, which have a low CPL photoresponse restricted by lower carrier transport efficiency compared to three-dimensional perovskites. For the first time, we reported chiral-polar photovoltage-driven efficient self-powered CPL detection in three-dimensional chiral-polar perovskites, MHyPbBr 3 (MHy = Methylhydrazinium). Coupled with significant spontaneous polarization (17.1 μC cm –2 ) and superior semiconductor properties, MHyPbBr 3 exhibits a large mobility-lifetime product (1.9 × 10 –2 cm 2 V –1 ) and stable bulk photovoltage (3.9 V). Furthermore, the devices indicate significant chiral-polar photovoltage for self-powered CPL detection with a robust angle anisotropy factor of 0.39. More importantly, benefiting from excellent carrier transport performance, high responsivity and detectivity values of up to 39.2 mA W –1 and 5.8 × 10 12 Jones, respectively, are presented at zero bias, which fall around the highest values of hybrid perovskites. This work will contribute to the research of novel chiral-polar three-dimensional hybrid perovskite semiconductors and promote their application in efficient self-powered CPL detection.},

  abstract     = {In-cell experiments on proteins have revealed that the cellular environment can exert a considerable influence on protein mechanism and structure. Here, we introduce in-cell infrared difference spectroscopy (ICIRD) as a method to study soluble receptors in living human embryonic kidney cells by applying the attenuated total reflection approach. We demonstrate on the sensory domains of plant cryptochrome and aureochrome1a, a light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) protein, that experiments can be performed using stable and transient transfection. Cells were cultivated and transfected on an internal reflection element directly inside the spectrometer, while their viability and growth were monitored in situ by infrared spectroscopy. Using ICIRD, we then resolved the photoreactions of oxidized flavin to the flavin neutral radical in cryptochrome and to the flavin–cysteine adduct in LOV inside eukaryotic cells, to our knowledge for the first time, and thus confirmed their photochemical mechanisms in living human cells. However, we observed for LOV a significant upshift in signals of the carbonyl stretching modes of oxidized flavin and cysteine adduct compared to in vitro measurements, which could not be rationalized by effects of molecular crowding, dehydration, or temperature. Accordingly, we identified a strong impact of the eukaryotic cellular environment on the hydrogen bonding network and structure of flavin in LOV, which needs to be considered in physiology and optogenetic applications. In conclusion, we introduce ICIRD as a noninvasive, label-free approach to study soluble photoactivatable receptors in mammalian cells and provide insight into the in-cell mechanisms of two photoreceptors.},

However, deliberate control of the excited/ground states and meticulous manipulation of the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) pathway constitute a significant challenge in liquids and dense solids. Here, we present the integration of a hydronaphthoquinone fluorophore into a crystalline, porous, phototautomeric dynamic 3D covalent organic framework (COF) to show guest-induced fluorescence turn-on, emission redshift enhancement, and shortened lifetimes for ratiometric fluorescence humidity sensing. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies provide mechanistic insights into the conformational dynamics, charge transfer coupled with local excitation, and ground-state uphill regulation for the multiple tautomers. We illustrate the sensitive, rapid, steady, and self-calibrated ratiometric fluorescence sensing for a wide range of humidity benefiting from the architectural and chemical robustness and crystallinity of such a phototautomeric 3D COF. These findings provide molecular insights into the design of functional porous materials that integrate host–guest mutual recognition and photoelectronic response for multiplex molecular sensing for environmental monitoring and biomedical diagnostics applications.},

The double closed-ring isomer of a diarylethene fused dimer has fixed π-conjugation in a rigid planar framework so that this compound has been long-desired. However, with respect to the photocyclization of a diarylethene dimer with strong electronic interaction, the second-step cyclization is known to be suppressed due to fast energy transfer into the closed-ring isomer generated in the first-step photocyclization. In this work, instead of photoisomerization, oxidative isomerization was applied for the second-step cyclization, where the oxidized state spontaneously underwent thermal cyclization by radical coupling at room temperature. The resulting double closed-ring isomer showed NIR absorption, owing to a widely extended π-conjugation throughout the entire molecule. The double closed-ring isomer underwent a ring-opening reaction forming the closed-open-ring isomer when exposed to NIR light despite having a very low quantum yield of approximately 10 –8 . As a result, the fused dimer exhibits reversible stepwise switching induced by photo- and redox stimuli in the UV–vis–NIR region.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles offer unique catalytic properties due to their complex surface coordination and widely tunable electronic structures. Conventional synthesis methods typically involve extreme thermal shock (∼1700 °C) to achieve metal coreduction and mixing. While wet-chemical approaches hold potential for controlling nanoparticle properties, they are hindered by disparities in metal reduction kinetics and a diminished influence of configurational entropy on metal mixing at low temperatures, leading to phase segregation and limited compositional tunability. In this work, we introduce a novel wet-chemical hydrothermal method that enables the synthesis of HEA nanoparticles with enhanced compositional homogeneity and precise property control at low temperatures (∼170 °C). This method utilizes in situ generation of active hydrogen (H • ) via organic dehydrogenation on nuclei/seed surfaces, creating localized off-equilibrium environments within the near-equilibrium wet-chemical system. These conditions mitigate the thermodynamic and kinetic limitations, enabling synchronized metal reduction, precise compositional tunability over a broad range, and improved alloy uniformity. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the enhanced electrocatalytic methanol oxidation performance of PtCuNiCoFe HEA nanoparticles through surface composition design. This approach offers a robust platform for synthesizing HEA nanoparticles with tailored properties, expanding their catalytic applications.},

  abstract     = {While redox polymer-mediated catalysis at silicon photoelectrodes has been studied since the 1980s, there have been few detailed studies of these materials in photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction. Here, we develop silicon photoelectrodes functionalized with a viologen-based polymer that mediates the formation of catalytic gold nanoparticles. The presence of gold was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the nanoparticles were imaged with high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). We probed the CO 2 reduction process during bulk photoelectrolysis to find modest, yet consistent CO faradaic efficiencies across a range of applied potentials. Operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to measure the Fermi levels of both the viologen polymer and the Au catalyst sites. The operando measurement of the Fermi levels of all three components of the photocathode provides a unified picture of the electron transfer process in the semiconductor-redox polymer–catalyst system. The redox polymer serves as the electron transfer mediator between the Si substrate and Au sites. In addition, the Au Fermi level equilibrates with the Fermi level of the viologen polymer, which in turn fixes the quasi-Fermi level of Au catalysts at the p-Si/redox polymer interface. This suggests a potential future direction of using redox polymers with tunable potentials to modulate the potential of metal cocatalysts and thus control the reaction selectivity.},

  abstract     = {The complex charge storage mechanisms in aqueous MnO 2 -based supercapacitors have posed significant challenges to a comprehensive understanding of their chemical behavior. In this study, we employed Au-core@MnO 2 -shell nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, alongside electrochemical analysis and X-ray absorption, to systematically investigate the competitive charge storage chemistry of protons and cations within the inner and outer layers of δ-MnO 2 under alkaline conditions. Our findings reveal that δ-MnO 2 operates through a dual mechanism: the intercalation and deintercalation of metal cations dominate charge storage in the inner layer, while surface chemisorption of protons governs the outer layer. Notably, cation insertion induces an irreversible phase transition from MnO 2 to Mn 2 O 3 , whereas the surface redox process involves a reversible transformation among MnO 2 , MnOOH, and Mn(OH) 2 . Additionally, spectral evidence, supported by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, elucidates the structural changes of interfacial water associated with proton-mediated charge storage in the outer layer. Electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that surface charge storage, primarily mediated by a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism, is the dominant contributor to the overall capacitance. This work not only advances the molecular-level understanding of electrochemical processes in MnO 2 -based supercapacitors but also highlights the potential for optimizing surface proton-coupled electron transfer mechanisms to enhance capacitive performance.},

Here, we developed a Fenton-promoted luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging method to achieve the spatial mapping of multiple enzymatic activities within a single tissue section. This method quantitatively visualizes individual enzymatic activity by combining the enzymatic conversion of substrates with the chemical confinement of the locally produced hydrogen peroxide. To achieve high-resolution spatial imaging by limiting the diffusion (∼500 μm) of hydrogen peroxide, iron oxide nanoparticles were coated on the tissue surface to initiate the Fenton process, locally converting hydrogen peroxide into short-lived hydroxyl radicals with a nanometer-scale diffusion range. The Fenton-promoted ECL emission is confined at the enzymatic conversion sites, offering unprecedented spatial visualization of four tumor-associated oxidases within a single tissue section. Colocalization revealed a synergistic effect between lysyl oxidase and quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase on post-translational modifications of tumor extracellular matrix proteins, along with a previously undiscovered interaction with amiloride-sensitive amine oxidase, which could not be distinguished based on expressions or single enzymatic activity alone. This approach offers a novel activity-based protein profiling tool at the tissue level, providing new data for future enzynomic research and multimodal imaging.},

However, their long-term catalytic stabilities greatly limit their practical applications. This work investigates the dynamic evolution of two model Cu–N–C SACs with different Cu–N coordinations, namely the Cu 1 /N pyri -C and Cu 1 /N pyrr -C, in electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR), based on a collection of in situ characterizations including in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, quasi-in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and in situ ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings reveal that the Cu nanoparticle formation rate over Cu 1 /N pyrr -C is more than 6 times higher than that over Cu 1 /N pyri -C during the electrochemical CORR. Quasi-in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ UV–vis spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that hydrogen radicals can be in situ produced during electrochemical CORR, which will attack the Cu–N bonds in the Cu–N–C SACs, causing leaching of Cu 2+ followed by subsequent reduction to form Cu nanoparticles. Kinetic calculations show that Cu 1 /N pyri -C displays a better catalytic stability than Cu 1 /N pyrr -C resulting from the stronger Cu–N pyri bonds. This study deepens the understanding of the deactivation mechanism of SACs in electrochemical reactions and provides guidance for the design of next-generation SACs with enhanced durability.},

Here, we introduce carboxyl-functionalized gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) as an alternative to polymers for investigating CaCO 3 crystallization via the transient “Au NCs-induced liquid precursor” phase, similar to “polymer-induced liquid precursor”. Exploiting the ultrasmall size, high density, and stable spontaneous fluorescence properties of Au NCs, this approach enables direct in situ observation of liquid precursor formation and dynamic association/dissociation using light microscopy. Results show that Au NCs are incorporated into the liquid precursor and the quantity of liquid precursor exhibits a nearly linear increase over time until the depletion of free Ca 2+ ions in solution due to crystallization of calcite. Subsequently, the dissolution of the liquid precursor provides ions for further crystal growth. The occlusion and 3D spatial distribution of Au NCs within CaCO 3 throughout the crystallization process can also be visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating preferential adsorption on specific lattice planes of CaCO 3 . This study substantially enhances our comprehension of the differential growth rates of various crystallographic faces and the spatial distribution of Au NCs within the crystals.},

Direct epitaxial growth of Cu 2– x S seeds occurs with an activation energy of 96 kJ/mol, while cation exchange to convert the growing seed to CuGaS 2 requires overcoming a 202 kJ/mol energy barrier. Understanding how each reaction rate evolves over time provides insights into the tapering mechanism and a means of predicting when the onset of tapering occurs. The predicted onset is then exploited to synthesize nanorods with a minimized tapering. Our findings provide the basis for developing precise control over the composition and morphology of nanocrystals synthesized through a combination of cation exchange and solution epitaxy.},

  abstract     = {Quantum mechanical vibrational coherence transfer processes play important roles in energy relaxation, charge transfer, and reaction dynamics in chemical and biological systems but are difficult to directly measure using traditional condensed-phase nonlinear spectroscopies. Recently, we developed a new experimental capability to obtain two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of molecular systems in the gas phase that enables the direct measurement of coherence pathways. Herein, we report ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy of the peptide glutathione (GSH) isolated and cryogenically cooled in the gas phase. Six vibrational modes were simultaneously excited within the amide I and II region. The spectral dynamics of both diagonal and off-diagonal cross peak features exhibit long-lived oscillatory behavior consistent with the presence of coherent vibrational dynamics. The oscillatory signatures deviate significantly from the expected quantum beating pathways predicted from standard nonlinear response theories. These deviations indicate the presence of additional nonlinear pathways, including coherence transfer processes. Quantum chemistry calculations indicate large anharmonic couplings between the excited vibrational modes in GSH and, critically, strong coupling between the excited modes and numerous low-frequency modes that act as a bath to mediate coherence transfer. The data provide important new benchmarks for modeling coherence transfer dynamics and system–bath interactions in open quantum systems free from solvent effects.},

However, slow location of the low-energy regions on the potential energy surface (PES) is still a key bottleneck for the overall search efficiency. Here, we develop a low-energy region explorer (LoreX) to rapidly locate low-energy regions on the PES. This achievement stems from graph-deep-learning-based PES slicing, which classifies structures into different prototypes to divide and conquer the PES. The accuracy and efficiency of LoreX are validated on 27 typical compounds, showing that it correctly locates low-energy regions with only 100 selected samples. The powerful capability of LoreX is demonstrated in solving two challenging problems: discovering new boron allotropes and identifying the puzzling crystal structures of the ordered vacancy compound CuIn 5 Se 8 . This study establishes a new method for rapid PES exploration and offers a highly efficient and generally applicable approach to accelerating CSP.},

  abstract     = {Proton NMR is a ubiquitous and valuable probe of hydrogen bonds. Conversely, 127 I NMR of strong halogen bond (XB) donors is hopeless due to quadrupolar coupling constants ( C Q ) on the order of GHz. We report here an innovative implementation of Zeeman-perturbed nuclear quadrupole resonance (Zp-NQR) spectroscopy, employing adjustable magnetic fields on the order of mT, which renders possible the acquisition and analysis of spectra of 127 I and 79 Br nuclei subject to quadrupolar couplings of up to 2.3 GHz in solid powders. This approach is demonstrated on three series of halogen-bonded cocrystals based on so-called “iconic” strong XB donors p -diiodotetrafluorobenzene, sym -trifluorotriiodobenzene, and p -dibromotetrafluorobenzene (27 compounds). Analysis of the spectra using a diagonalization of the Zeeman-quadrupolar Hamiltonian provides C Q values and quadrupolar asymmetry parameters, thereby overcoming various limitations encountered in pure NMR and pure NQR. Inspection of the data reveals strong correlations with geometrical and structural features of the halogen bond, including its length. Dispersion-corrected zeroth-order regular approximation relativistic DFT computations of the interaction energies of the XB donor are strongly correlated with experimental and computed values of C Q ( 127 I) and C Q ( 79 Br). It is concluded that the electric field gradient at the XB donor site is a useful metric for quantifying XB strength in solids. The XB interaction energies range from ∼5 to 10 kcal mol –1 for the systems studied herein. The Zp-NQR approach is amenable to widespread application to diverse problems in the chemical and materials sciences related to energy materials, crystal engineering, and many systems comprising strongly quadrupolar isotopes.},

In addition to depositing homogeneous and conformal nanometer-thin ZnO, TiO 2 , and IrO 2 (multi)layers inside SiO 2 -stabilized crystals, we establish a method to directly coat bare DNA crystals with ALD layers while maintaining the crystal integrity, enabled by critical point drying and low ALD process temperatures. As a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrate electrocatalytic water oxidation using ALD IrO 2 -coated DNA origami crystals, resulting in improved performance relative to that of planar films. Overall, our coating strategy establishes a tool set for designing custom-made 3D nanomaterials with precisely defined topologies and material compositions, combining the unique advantages of DNA origami and atomically controlled deposition of functional inorganic materials.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical H 2 production from water favors low-voltage molecular oxidation to replace the oxygen evolution reaction as an energy-saving and value-added approach. However, there exists a mismatch between the high demand for H 2 and slow anodic reactions, restricting practical applications of such hybrid systems. Here, we propose a bipolar H 2 production approach, with anodic H 2 generation from the N–N oxidatively coupled dehydrogenation (OCD) of 3,5-diamino-1 H -1,2,4-triazole (DAT), in addition to the cathodic H 2 generation. The system requires relatively low oxidation potentials of 0.872 and 1.108 V vs RHE to reach 10 and 500 mA cm –2 , respectively. The bipolar H 2 production in an H-type electrolyzer requires only 0.946 and 1.129 V to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm –2 , respectively, with the electricity consumption (1.3 kWh per m 3 H 2 ) reduced by 68%, compared with conventional water splitting. Moreover, the process is highly appealing due to the absence of traditional hazardous synthetic conditions of azo compounds at the anode and crossover/mixing of H 2 /O 2 in the electrolyzer. A flow-type electrolyzer operates stably at 500 mA cm –2 for 300 h. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Pt single atom and nanoparticle (Pt 1,n ) optimize the adsorption of the S active sites for H 2 production over the Pt 1,n @VS 2 cathodic catalysts. At the anode, the stepwise dehydrogenation of −NH 2 in DAT and then oxidative coupling of −N–N– predominantly form azo compounds while generating H 2 . The present report paves a new way for atom-economical bipolar H 2 production from N–N oxidative coupling of aminotriazole and green electrosynthesis of value-added azo chemicals.},

Here, we show that Escherichia coli cells can initiate the polymerization of various acrylamide, acrylic, and methacrylic monomers through an atom transfer radical reaction triggered by the activity of naturally occurring biomolecules within the bacterial cells. Intracellular radical polymerizations were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography of polymers extracted from the cells, and fluorescence labeling of the polymer directly inside the cells. The effect of polymerization on cell behavior and the response of the cells to polymerization was investigated through fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry techniques, as well as metabolic and membrane integrity assays. The polymer synthesis and resulting products are cell-compatible, as indicated by the high viability of the polymerized cells. In cellulo synthesis of synthetic polymers containing fluorescent dyes was also achieved. These results not only enhance our understanding of the untapped potential of bacterial cells as living catalysts for polymer production but also reveal intracellular polymerization based on atom transfer radical polymerization initiators as a bioorthogonal tool for cell engineering and synthetic biology.},

Traditionally, shape control has been achieved through empirical methods, highlighting the need for a more refined theoretical framework. A comprehensive model should account for the kinetic factors at distinct stages of the shape formation process to identify the key determinants of nanocrystal morphology. By modulating kinetics at terraces, ledges, and kinks, we reveal that the primary factors are the adatom nucleation energies and the geometry of growth islands. Transient sites dominate the growth process, leading to kinetically trapped, metastable shapes. We illustrate these concepts with face-centered cubic nanocrystals, demonstrating diverse shape evolutions, including surface roughening and the preservation of crystal symmetry in cubes, octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and their truncated variants. This study reveals the mechanisms driving the formation of cubic nanocrystal shapes and offers guidance for their precise synthesis.},

This approach enables the isolation of sequences with improved affinity without the biases and limitations of traditional mutagenesis methods like doped SELEX and error-prone PCR. As a demonstration, we applied Motif-SELEX to a DNA-based morphine aptamer and a 2′ fluoro- and methoxy-RNA-based apixaban aptamer, discovering new, better-performing sequences with differing random domain lengths from their parents and up to 10-fold improvements in affinity. These new sequences would be inaccessible to traditional post-SELEX methods. Critically, our analysis of Motif-SELEX pools also enabled us to identify sequence and structural elements crucial for target binding and to predict secondary and tertiary structures for a given aptamer family─even when those structures involve noncanonical nucleotide interactions. We believe that Motif-SELEX offers an effective and generalizable solution for optimizing the structure and binding properties of functional nucleic acid molecules for diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) has limited treatment options, as the restrictive blood–brain barrier (BBB) prevents most therapeutics from accumulating at sufficient levels in the brain. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) offers a method for administering therapeutics directly into brain tumor tissue, but free drugs can be cleared rapidly and may be toxic to off-target cells. Drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) are a promising platform to prolong the residence time and improve cellular targeting of therapeutics. We designed drug-conjugated NPs comprising a liposomal core modified with a layer-by-layer (LbL) polymer coating to promote tumor penetration, retention, and tumor-selective cellular association. Covalent conjugation of the potent microtubule inhibitor monomethyl auristatin-F (MMAF) to lipid headgroups resulted in striking potency against a range of patient-derived GBM cell lines compared to free MMAF and outperformed an EGFR-targeted antibody–drug conjugate of MMAF under clinical investigation. In vivo , a single CED infusion of LbL-functionalized MMAF NPs in orthotopic GBM-bearing mice displayed improved distribution and retention of both the NPs and the MMAF payload within the tumor. The LbL coating promotes selective uptake by GBM cells and prolongs drug retention, overcoming limitations of rapid clearance associated with traditional CED approaches. This treatment inhibited tumor progression and significantly extended survival compared to free MMAF, MMAF-conjugated liposomes, and an EGFR-MMAF antibody–drug conjugate. This NP platform offers a promising strategy for enhancing local GBM therapy by improving drug exposure within tumors while minimizing systemic toxicity.},

  abstract     = {The metathetical modification of biomolecules in aqueous environments holds great promise for advances at the interface of chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, rapid degradation of the metathesis catalysts necessitates their use in large stoichiometric excess, resulting in undesired side-reactions promoted by the ruthenium products. Although water is now known to play a central role in catalyst decomposition, the elusive nature of the intermediates has hampered insight into the pathways involved. We describe the detailed speciation in water of AquaMet ( AM ), the dominant ruthenium catalyst used for aqueous metathesis, and implications for catalysis. Potentiometric and spectroscopic speciation studies reveal that only trace AM is present under the pH-neutral, salt-free conditions routinely employed in synthetic applications of aqueous metathesis. Instead, metathesis-inactive hydroxide species dominate. Even at pH 3, Ru–H 2 O complexes dominate in 0.01 M NaCl (aq) , and the water ligands are readily deprotonated as the pH is increased. Raising NaCl (aq) concentrations to 1 M suppresses deprotonation events below pH 8, stabilizing AM as the dominant solution species at neutral pH, and significantly expanding the metathesis-compatible regime. Hitherto unrecognized catalyst solubility issues are also revealed, pointing toward avenues for advance. More broadly, the capacity to directly link catalyst environment to structure and performance opens new opportunities for olefin metathesis in complex, water-rich settings.},

  abstract     = {Gene-targeted therapies are revolutionizing cancer treatment due to their high specificity and low toxicity. Among these, ribozymes hold promise as independent gene therapy agents capable of directly cleaving target mRNAs. The pistol ribozyme, discovered in 2015, stands out for its compact structure and robust cleavage activity, making it a promising candidate for RNA silencing under physiological conditions. However, its clinical application is limited by nuclease susceptibility and biological barrier penetration. To overcome these obstacles, this study presents an innovative gene-regulation strategy incorporating engineered pistol ribozymes into a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanocarrier. This catalytic SNA nanocarrier, built on a DNA core–shell framework, combines the ribozyme with doxorubicin (Dox) to form the ApRz-CS/Dox nanoplatform. The design of ApRz-CS/Dox features a homopolymerized DNA core and a reticular DNA shell, enhancing stability. Tumor-targeting aptamers are arranged on its surface, directing it specifically to cancer cells. Within the target cells, the ribozyme is released in response to overexpressed miR-21, facilitating the cleavage of polo-like kinase 1 mRNA. This integrated approach effectively combines gene therapy with the chemotherapeutic effects of Dox, addressing the challenges associated with the delivery of newly developed nucleic acid drugs and offering a promising strategy for enhanced cancer treatment.},

  abstract     = {Rylenes, known for their excellent photochemical properties, hold great promise in OLEDs, solar cells, and bioimaging applications. However, the solution-phase synthesis of long rylene molecules is often hindered by poor solubility and low stability. In this work, we present an efficient synthetic strategy for a series of CN-terminated rylenes via base-mediated intramolecular Michael addition and oxidative cyclodehydrogenation (Scholl reaction). The synthesized rylenes feature a cyclopentadiene ring at both bay positions of each perylene subunit and electron-deficient CN groups at the peri-termini. These structural modifications render the rylenes stable, aggregation-free, and highly soluble. Bulky aryl groups attached to the cyclopentadiene rings not only improve solubility but also block intermolecular π-aggregation, as revealed by XRD analysis. Additionally, the electron-withdrawing CN groups stabilize the π-conjugated system. The extended π-conjugation reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap, enhancing absorption and inducing a significant bathochromic shift into the NIR I and II regions.},

However, the study of all-metallic aromatic clusters remains in its early stages, with σ-aromatic clusters mostly limited to small sizes (≤12) that often require external stabilization. In this work, we report the first Ge/Sn-based trimer, [Co 3 @Ge 6 Sn 18 ] 5– , which can be rationalized as the fusion of three [Co – @Ge 3 Sn 6 4– ] units via a Ge 3 face. Theoretical studies have revealed that two σ-electrons are delocalized across the entire trimer, with the spherical aromaticity of each [Co@Ge 3 Sn 6 ] unit and the global σ-aromaticity of [Co 3 @Ge 6 Sn 18 ] 5– further supported by its electron delocalization and magnetic behavior. As a result, this trimer can be viewed as a giant σ-aromatic counterpart to triatomic H 3 + and Li 3 + . Our findings suggest the potential for synthesizing cluster-of-cluster analogs of discrete all-metallic aromatic species, such as Al 4 2– , and further enhance our understanding of chemical bonding.},

  abstract     = {The stability of the electrode–electrolyte interface is a critical factor influencing the electrochemical performance of Li-metal batteries. However, on the delithiated Ni-rich cathode surface, the strong catalytic effects of transition metals with coordination deficiency significantly aggravate the parasitic reactions with Li-metal-compatible ether-based electrolytes, thereby reducing the cycling stability of high-voltage Ni-rich batteries. Here, we propose an sp 2 -induction mechanism to address coordination deficiency through the coupling of interfacial orbitals between molecules and the cathode surface. Sp 2 -hybrid high-fluorinated olefins, characterized by unsaturated bonds, exhibit highly delocalized electronic properties (electron delocalization index &gt;0.95 au) and elevated anodic stability (ionization potential &gt;10 eV). These characters ensure robust and stable interactions with the Ni-rich cathode, facilitating the formation of induced orbitals. These low-energy orbitals accommodate Ni 3 d electrons, effectively mitigating the interfacial coordination deficiency and inhibiting surface side reactions. Among the sp 2 -hybrid high-fluorinated olefins, (perfluorobutyl)ethylene (PFBE) is identified as an optimal inducing molecule due to its strongest interaction and excellent coordination complementarity on the cathode surface. The PFBE-based electrolyte significantly alleviates the degradation of cathode surface structure and demonstrates remarkable cyclic stability, achieving 80% capacity retention over 320 cycles for a 4.4 V Li||LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (30 μm Li, high load 3.7 mAh cm –2 NMC811) full cell, compared to 175 cycles with a PFBE-absent electrolyte. This work elucidates the sp 2 -induction mechanism for passivating the high-catalytic cathode interface, paving the way for durable, high-energy aggressive Li-metal batteries.},

To this extent, degradable, thermoresponsive polyesters were developed through the ring-opening copolymerization of maleic anhydride and an oligo(ethylene glycol)-functionalized epoxide. The resulting polymers possess a lower critical solution temperature such that they are soluble in aqueous solutions at low temperatures (4–7 °C) but assemble into particles above room temperature (25 °C). The particle size and morphology were tunable through the selection of polymer initiator, forming nanoparticle (ca. 162 nm) and microparticle (ca. 1.85 μm) assemblies using macromolecular polyethylene glycol and small molecule propargyl alcohol initiators, respectively. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) was used over a range of temperatures to develop molecular weight calibrations using certified poly(ethylene glycol) standards. DOSY was able to monitor the dynamic self-assembly behavior of the thermoresponsive polymers in aqueous solutions, and through distinct diffusion constant shifts, quantify the aggregation number of particle intermediates within the nano- and microparticles.},

In this work, we develop an alternative electrochemical reductive amination reaction that can proceed in neutral aqueous electrolyte with nitrite as the nitrogenous reactant and via an oxime intermediate. We develop a selection criterion for nitrite reduction electrocatalysts suited for oxime electrosynthesis and, in doing so, find Pd to be a highly efficient catalyst for this reaction, reaching an oxime Faradaic efficiency of 82% at −0.21 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode. The aliphatic or aromatic structure of the carbonyl reactant impacts the efficacy of the catalyst, with aromatic substrates leading to suppressed oxime formation and detrimental reduction of the carbonyl to the alcohol. We developed a Pb/PbO electrocatalyst that selectively performs oxime reduction in the neutral aqueous electrolyte. With acetone as a model substrate, we demonstrate an efficient one-pot, two-step electrochemical reaction for the conversion of acetone to isopropyl amine with 85% yield and 50% global Faradaic efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Electrode–electrolyte interphases are critical determinants of the reversibility and longevity of lithium (Li)-metal batteries (LMBs). However, upon cycling, the inherently delicate interphases, formed from electrolyte decomposition, become vulnerable to chemomechanical degradation and corrosion, resulting in rapid capacity loss and thus short battery life. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the complex interplay between the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of interphases on Li-metal anodes, providing insights into interphase design to address these challenges. Direct measurements of ion-transport kinetics across various electrolyte chemistries reveal that interphases with high Li-ion mobility are essential for achieving dense Li deposits. Conversely, sluggish ion transport generates high-surface-area Li deposits that induce Li random stripping and the accumulation of isolated Li deposits. Surprisingly, interphases that support long cycle life do not necessarily require the formation of dense Li deposits but must avoid possible electrochemical/chemical reactions between the Li-metal deposits and electrolytes’ components. By that, in some specific electrolyte systems, isolated Li deposits can recover and electrically rejoin the active Li anodes’ mass. These findings challenge conventional understanding and establish new principles for designing durable LMBs, demonstrating that even with commercial carbonate-based electrolytes, LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 ||Cu cells can achieve high reversibility.},

  abstract     = {The nitric oxide electroreduction reaction (NORR) has received considerable attention due to its importance in electrochemical denitrification of nitrogen oxides in groundwater and industrial waste gases and electrochemical ammonia synthesis. However, the detailed mechanism and the factors that affect product selectivity are far less understood. Employing coupled differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and attenuated total reflection–surface-enhanced infrared absorption (ATR–SEIRA) spectroscopy, adsorbed species and volatile solution products, during the adsorption of NO and NORR on Pt in both alkaline and acidic media, have been simultaneously studied, enabling us to correlate the potential-dependent product selectivity with the surface ad-species. NO ad,M , NO ad,B , NO ad,L , and NO 2,ad were identified using SEIRA spectroscopy as surface ad-species, with their potential-dependent intensities having a strong correlation with the product selectivity. N 2 O is the only reduction product at potentials beyond the hydrogen region and is attributed to the reduction of weakly adsorbed NO. In contrast, the formation of NH 3 and NH 2 OH occurs only in the hydrogen region and is ascribed to the reaction between strongly adsorbed NO and adsorbed H. N 2 is a minor product, and is formed through further reduction of N 2 O by adsorbed H. The formation of N 2 is significantly suppressed in acidic media due to the fast kinetics of NO reduction to NH 3 /NH 2 OH, and thus lowering of NO coverage in the hydrogen region. To achieve the selective reduction of NO to NH 3 /NH 2 OH, the potential should remain at 0.1–0.2 V (vs RHE) in both acidic and alkaline media while a slow NO supply, and acidic media are preferred over alkaline media due to the faster kinetics. These new spectroscopic results and insights about the NORR could advance the design of more effective NORR catalysts and help develop optimal conditions for selective ammonia synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Carbohydrates, essential biological building blocks, exhibit functional mechanisms tied to their intricate stereochemistry. Subtle stereochemical differences, such as those between the anomers maltose and cellobiose, lead to distinct properties due to their differing glycosidic bonds; the former is digestible by humans, while the latter is not. This underscores the importance of precise structural determination of individual carbohydrate molecules for deeper functional insights. However, their structural complexity and conformational flexibility, combined with the high spatial resolution needed, have hindered direct imaging of carbohydrate stereochemistry. Here, we employ noncontact atomic force microscopy integrated with a data-efficient, multifidelity structure search approach accelerated by machine learning integration to determine the precise 3D atomic coordinates of two carbohydrate anomers on Au(111). We observe that the stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond regulates on-surface chiral selection in carbohydrate self-assemblies. The reconstructed models, validated against experimental data, provide reliable atomic-scale structural evidence, uncovering the origin of the on-surface chirality from carbohydrate anomerism. Our study confirms that nc-AFM is a reliable technique for real-space discrimination of carbohydrate stereochemistry at the single-molecule level, providing a pathway for bottom-up investigations into the structure–property relationships of carbohydrates in biological research and materials science.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic proximity labeling has emerged as a valuable technique for studying interactions between biomolecules in a cellular context, providing precise spatiotemporal control over protein labeling. One significant advantage of these methods is their modularity, allowing the use of a single photocatalyst with different reactive probes to expand interactome coverage and capture diverse protein interactions. Despite these advances, fewer methods have been developed using red-light excitation, limiting the use of photoproximity labeling in more complex media such as tissues and animal models. Herein, we develop a platform for proximity labeling under red-light excitation, utilizing a single catalyst and two distinct probe types. We first design a carbene based labeling system that utilizes sulfonium diazo probes. This system is successfully applied on A549 cells to capture the interactome of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using a Cetuximab-Chlorin e6 conjugate. Benchmarking against established techniques indicates that this approach performs comparably to leading carbene-based proximity labeling methods. Next, we leverage the strong singlet oxygen generation (SOG) ability of Chlorin e6 to establish an alternative labeling system using aniline and hydrazide probes. EGFR directed chemoproteomics experiments reveal significant overlap with the carbene system, with the carbene approach capturing a subset of interactions identified by the SOG system. Finally, we deploy our approach for the characterization of EGFR in resected human glioblastoma (GBM) tissue samples removed from distinct locations in the same tumor, representing the tumor’s infiltrating edge and its viable center, identifying several GBM specific interacting proteins that may serve as a launch point for future therapeutic campaigns.},

However, a broader application is currently limited by the partial separation of peptides and low-throughput, mainly due to the nonuniform peptide signals detected by nanopores. Narrowing the peptide signal distribution is crucial for improving the nanopore’s sensing ability but remains a bottleneck. Here, we demonstrate that capturing peptides with electrophoretic force against electroosmotic flow can provoke more uniform blockades in α-hemolysin nanopores. By using buffers with 2 M KCl at pH 3.8, we obtain the most uniform peptide signals, which may be correlated to the shape, linearization, and actual dwelling position of peptides. Five peptides with acetylation and phosphorylation, including isomeric peptides, can be readily separated from each other. The citrullination replacement of arginine and the β-hydroxybutyrylation modification in another peptide sequence are also discriminated in a mixture. A series of peptides with different compositions induced uniform peptide blockades when they were analyzed with our method.

Simultaneously, CMCHS molecules enter into Zn 2+ solvation structures and H 2 O molecules are removed, limiting the activity of solvated H 2 O molecules. Therefore, the dendrite growth and water activity are significantly suppressed, resulting in the excellent electrochemical performance of Zn anodes. An average Coulombic efficiency of 99.58% is achieved, which is much superior to the case in the conventional ZnSO 4 electrolyte. To illustrate the feasibility of the CMCHS-contained electrolyte, Zn||V 2 O 5 full batteries were assembled and exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is essential for combustion, astrochemistry, and carbon-based nanomaterial synthesis. This study presents theory-guided experiments on radical–radical combination reactions of propargyl ( • C 3 H 3 ). The addition of • C 3 H 3 to three cyclopenta-fused PAH radicals─1-indenyl ( • 1-C 9 H 7 ), acenaphthenyl ( • C 12 H 9 ), and 4 H -cyclopenta[ def ]phenanthrenyl ( • C 15 H 9 )─revealed that the reaction between the dominant propyne-3-yl resonance configuration of • C 3 H 3 and the three radicals consistently produces PAHs with all hexagonal rings, while the reaction between the less dominant allene-1-yl resonance configuration of • C 3 H 3 and the three radicals selectively preserves the cyclopenta ring and forms a new hexagonal ring. Elusive intermediates and isomeric products were observed and identified by combining molecular beam-sampling synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The complementary results suggest a high selectivity of the allene-1-yl addition pathway, which is thermodynamically controlled. The findings presented here are based on a combination of experimental capabilities, and they provide new mechanisms and insights into the selective formation of bowl-shaped PAHs, serving as templates for fullerene and nanotube structures. The high selectivity of the allene-1-yl pathway provides a rational synthetic strategy for cyclopenta-fused PAHs, bearing barrierless and facile radical–radical reaction pathways in various environments, including high-temperature combustion, circumstellar envelopes, and cold molecular clouds.},

  abstract     = {The separation of acetylene (C 2 H 2 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is critical in the chemical industry, driven by the increasing demand for high-purity C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 4 . While metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer an energy-efficient approach for adsorptive gas separation, achieving sub-angstrom precision in pore size adjustment remains challenging. In this work, we leverage two synergistic mechanisms in a double-interpenetrated framework: (1) global structural flexibility, arising from dynamic displacement of subnetworks to tailor pore dimensions, and (2) local flexibility, enabled by counterion and ligand rotation, to modulate the aperture binding affinity for precise molecular discrimination. A series of isostructural MOFs, NUS-33-CF 3 SO 3 and NUS-34-BF 4 , were designed to enable one-step purification of C 2 H 4 and concurrent recovery of C 2 H 2 from ternary gas mixtures. Within pores of optimal dimensions, the synergistic interplay between counterion-mediated host–guest interactions and local framework adaptability enables precise and simultaneous regulation of static and kinetic gas adsorption properties. Notably, NUS-34-BF 4 achieves a dynamic C 2 H 4 productivity of 2.62 mmol/g and a C 2 H 2 uptake of 1.26 mmol/g. This study highlights the pivotal yet underexplored role of counterions as dynamic gatekeepers, offering a tunable strategy to engineer pore environments in flexible MOFs for advanced gas separations.},

While amine-based CILs have been successful in reducing the work function of metal electrodes, they can also promote the decomposition of acceptor materials, compromising the stability of OSCs. To address this challenge and further improve device performance, we have innovatively designed and synthesized amide-functionalized perylene diimide (PDI)-Leu-am as a dopant-free CIL molecule. Notably, PDI-Leu-am effectively mitigates acceptor decomposition, significantly improving the photostability and thermal stability of OSCs. Moreover, it demonstrates dual-modification capabilities at the active layer/cathode interface, facilitating electron extraction from the active layer while lowering the electrode’s work function. Encouragingly, this dual modification mechanism effectively refined the Ohmic contact, leading to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 20%. This breakthrough opens up promising avenues for the practical deployment of OSCs and lays a robust foundation for the development of high-performance, enduring, and cost-efficient interface materials.},

  abstract     = {Helical assembly has been demonstrated to efficiently facilitate the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances, but the synthesis of micro- and nanohelices from rigid achiral π-conjugated compounds remains challenging due to the absence of bilayer structures or complementary hydrogen-bonding interactions. Here, we develop an alloying strategy for the realization of helical microstructures from achiral anthracene/anthracene derivatives with x -/ x -axis modification or anthracene/tetracene derivatives with x -/ y -axis modification via solution coassembly. Interestingly, two anthracene derivatives bearing asymmetric phenyl/phenylethynyl groups and symmetric phenylethynyl groups can assemble into spiral microribbons with a fractal branching pattern. Using such an alloying strategy, color-tailorable ternary spiral microtubules/microribbons referring to high-efficiency energy transfer processes are achievable. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the Von Mises stress produced by symmetry differences of two components induces symmetry breaking of alloy structures associated with twisting. Additionally, the contents of the guest and H 2 O also play a vital role in the formation of intricate helical microstructures. Single binary and ternary spiral microribbons present considerable CPL properties with a dissymmetric factor (′ g lum ′) of more than 0.01. The present work provides new insights into the formation of helical microcrystals with complex topologies and new optoelectronic functions.},

  abstract     = {Organic polymers generally feature 1-dimensional chains or 2-dimensional rings in their backbones since synthetic challenges limit the availability of 3-dimensional monomers. Inorganic cages are less strained and more accessible, offering an alternative route to explore this parameter space. However, only two families─carboranes and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS)─have been well-studied, revealing materials with valuable mechanical and thermal properties. Further exploration of this frontier requires the development of new inorganic cages that are accessible, stable, and polymerizable. Here we report that an easily assembled, bench-stable PN cage, P(NMeNMe) 3 P, undergoes Staudinger polycondensation with organic diazides to yield robust, solution-processable, and film-forming linear poly(trihydrazino-diphosphine diazide)s─PHPDs─as a new family of hybrid organic–inorganic polymers. Their solubility can be controlled by diazide choice and backbone architecture, which we rationally modify to access alternating or multiblock copolymers. We also show how a tetraphosphorus cage, P 4 (NMe) 6 , can be used to cross-link PHPDs. The T g values for PHPDs are comparable to those of rigid π-conjugated polymers (&gt;150 °C), and, despite a high nitrogen content (up to 32%) and three N–N σ-bonds per repeat unit, they show decomposition temperatures &gt;200 °C with char yields up to 60%. These data support hypotheses of high stability arising from the presence of 3-dimensional backbone units. We further show that PHPDs may be leveraged for halogen-free flame retardancy. Collectively, the results debut new low-carbon polymers with an unusual backbone topology, reveal the design rules for controlling their microstructures and properties, and lay the foundation for future applied studies.},

Here we describe a method to perform solid-state NMR spectroscopy on in situ strained tissue samples under magic-angle spinning to achieve high-resolution NMR spectra while maintaining the tissue’s native hydration state. The changes observed in the NMR spectra are interpreted using quantum mechanics molecular mechanics (QM/MM) chemical shift calculations on strained collagen triple-helix structures and consideration of changes in the distribution of molecular orientations between strained and relaxed mechanical states.

We demonstrate that discrete colloidal nanocrystals can be nucleated and grown in a molten salt with control over their size and composition. Additionally, we found that reaction temperatures above 400 °C are crucial for annealing structural defects in GaAs nanocrystals. We also highlight the utility of the as-synthesized GaP nanocrystals by showing that GaP can be solution-processed into high-refractive-index coatings and patterned by direct optical lithography with micron resolution.

  abstract     = {Membrane lipid oxidation is a universal process that occurs in situations of oxidative stress and is encountered in numerous physiological and pathological situations. Oxidized truncated phospholipids make up a large part of the oxidation products and alter the membrane properties in a way that can lead to cell death. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood nor is it clear whether environmental factors, such as pH, can modulate these effects. Using model membranes, we investigate how individual lipid aldehydes and carboxylic acids with truncated acyl chains alter the membrane structure. Our data shows that lipid aldehydes and carboxylic acids have different permeabilization efficiencies towards molecules of varying charge and size and that ΔC9 truncated lipids are usually more efficient in permeabilizing membranes than ΔC5. In terms of physical mechanisms, the ΔC9 truncated lipid carboxylic acid induces permeabilization and membrane curvature in a pH-dependent fashion. This is explained by ionization-dependent exposure of the carboxyl group to the water–bilayer interface, which increases the intrinsic molecular curvature of the oxidized lipid. Conversely, ΔC9 truncated lipid aldehydes and nonionized carboxyls do not induce curved structures but are more efficient in increasing permeability toward larger molecules. We further show that truncated lipids can escape the bilayer and accumulate at interfaces, implying that they might act on neighboring cells. This study indicates that oxidized phospholipids with truncated acyl chains disrupt membrane structure, depending on their specific molecular structure and the pH of the environment, opening a possible route for the design of lipid nanoparticles with pH-dependent drug release.},

  abstract     = {The decomposition of LiPF 6 in nonaqueous battery electrolytes is a well-studied, deleterious process that leads to hydrofluoric acid (HF) driven transition metal dissolution at the positive electrode and gas production (H 2 ) at the anode, often attributed to the inherent moisture sensitivity of the hexafluorophosphate anion. In this work, we use in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to demonstrate that the rate of PF 6 – hydrolysis significantly decreases in Na and K systems, where the Lewis acidity of the cation dictates the rate of decomposition according to Li + &gt; Na + &gt; K + . Despite the remarkable stability of Na and K electrolytes, we show that they are still susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of protons, which can catalyze the breakdown of PF 6 – , indicating that these chemistries are not immune from decomposition when paired with solvent/cathode combinations that generate H + at high voltage. Quantitative in situ multinuclear and multidimensional NMR of decomposed electrolytes shows that after long-term degradation, these systems contain HF, HPO 2 F 2 , and H 2 PO 3 F as well as a variety of defluorinated byproducts, such as organophosphates and phosphonates, that are structurally similar to herbicides/insecticides and may pose health and environmental risks. Taken together, these results have important implications for Na- and K-ion batteries where hazardous and harmful byproducts like HF, soluble transition metals, organophosphates, and phosphonates can be greatly reduced through cell design. Our results also suggest that next-generation chemistries present a pathway to safer batteries that contain lower quantities of flammable gases, like H 2 , if properly engineered.},

Analyses of these data provide Δ, the energy spacing between the two lowest electronic energy levels in compound I. This spacing is typically determined by the zero-field splitting of the ferryl moiety, D , and the exchange coupling, J , between the iron(IV)oxo unit and the ligand-based radical. However, the systems examined are antiferromagnetically coupled with | J / D | &gt; 1. As a result, Δ ∼ (3/2) J , and measurements of Δ provide J (to within ∼5%). These measurements reveal that the sign and magnitude of J track with the reactivity of compound I toward C–H bonds. Efforts to analyze these and other data highlight the inadequacy of the standard ligand field model that is often used to explain the electronic properties of compound I. Additional analyses combining our data with state energies from a previous theoretical investigation support predictions of a low-lying quintet state within the iron(IV)oxo unit. We discuss these findings in light of computational studies that suggest that access to excited states, particularly those of a high-spin nature, can promote metal-oxo mediated C–H bond cleavage.},

  abstract     = {Depression is one of the most common mental disorders. The inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase and the resulting serotonin decrease are the key factors in depression pathology. Herein, we report for the first time that Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles exhibit tryptophan hydroxylase-like activity and successfully verify their ability to restore serotonin synthesis in the brain for the treatment of depression. To achieve better biocompatibility and brain delivery, the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were functionalized with chitosan (CS) (Fe 3 O 4 @CS), enabling their delivery from the nose to the brain. Fe 3 O 4 @CS catalyzes the transformation of tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan with the participation of high levels of endogenous ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide in stressed neurons, thus compensating for the deactivated tryptophan hydroxylase in the brain. In vivo Fe 3 O 4 @CS treatment results in the recovery of 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin levels and improvement of neuronal signal transduction ability in a depression mouse model, thus ameliorating depressive-like behaviors. The presented strategy of restoring serotonin synthesis in situ based on a tryptophan hydroxylase-like nanozyme provides a more accurate and efficient approach for the treatment of depression.},

  abstract     = {Most photocatalysis research focuses on understanding the photogenerated charge transfer processes within the solid catalysts themselves. However, these studies often overlook the impact of the reaction environment on photogenerated charge separation and reactions. To address this gap, our study employed a sequential imaging methodology that integrates surface photovoltage microscopy (SPVM), in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to track the transfer of photogenerated charges from the space charge region to the reactants at the nanoscale on individual BiVO 4 particles. It identifies the key role that surface charges at the photocatalyst–electrolyte interface play in photogenerated charge transfer. Specifically, we demonstrated that the surface charge generates an additional driving force, which adjusts the interface electric field and reverses the photovoltage of {010} facet from 90 to −25 mV in a neutral electrolyte. This competitive or even larger driving force compels the photogenerated electrons, which are confined within the bulk, to migrate to the surface, ultimately leading to the redistribution of photogenerated charges. Furthermore, our findings uncovered that the difference between the solution pH and the isoelectric point of the facet serves as the origin of the interfacial electric field. Overall, our sequential imaging research fills an important gap in understanding the driving and influencing factors of charge transfer across the solid–liquid interface for photocatalytic reactions in solution. It provides significant insights into clarifying the bottleneck issue of charge separation in photocatalytic reactions.},

Such an interpenetration was unveiled by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis with a resolution of 0.95 Å. A “face-to-face” packing of tetrahedral shaped building blocks in adjacent frames was observed, locking the slide and twisting the molecular motion. The structure rigidity and permanent porosity were further assessed by in situ small-angle X-ray scattering measured along gas adsorption and desorption processes. The distribution of gases was studied across the entire isotherm, outlining the anisotropy of the pores within COF-308. Such anisotropy, ideally suited for gas storage and separation, was endowed by this new interpenetration mode, where the “face-to-face” packing of building blocks was found to be the critical control.},

These high aspect ratio nanowires readily form percolated network when blended in resins, which could bring new opportunities for Zn-based anticorrosion coatings.

Though high selectivity and activity of products have been achieved recently, all are reported in neutral or alkaline electrolytes. Although these electrolyte media give high selectivity and activity, they face the major challenge of low CO 2 utilization because of carbonate formation, which lowers the overall efficiency of the process. Conducting the eCO 2 RR in acidic media can help overcome the issue of carbonate formation and hence can increase the CO 2 utilization efficiency. However, there are many challenges associated with acidic eCO 2 RR. Two major concerns are the highly competitive hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media and salt precipitation issues. This Perspective focuses on the fundamentals of acidic eCO 2 RR, recent catalyst development strategies, and relevant problems that need to be addressed in the future. In the end, we provide a future outlook that will give an idea about the problems to focus on in the future in the field of acidic eCO 2 RR.},

  abstract     = {A synthetic method’s substrate tolerance and generality are often showcased in a “substrate scope” table. However, substrate selection exhibits a frequently discussed publication bias: unsuccessful experiments or low-yielding results are rarely reported. In this work, we explore more deeply the relationship between such a publication bias and chemical reactivity beyond the simple analysis of yield distributions using a novel neural network training strategy, substrate scope contrastive learning . By treating reported substrates as positive samples and nonreported substrates as negative samples, our contrastive learning strategy teaches a model to group molecules within a numerical embedding space, based on historical trends in published substrate scope tables. Training on 20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content Collection TM , spanning thousands of publications from 2010 to 2015, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings exhibit a correlation with physical organic reactivity descriptors through both intuitive visualizations and quantitative regression analyses. Additionally, these embeddings are applicable to various reaction modeling tasks like yield prediction and regioselectivity prediction, underscoring the potential to use historical reaction data as a pretraining task. This work not only presents a chemistry-specific machine learning training strategy to learn from literature data in a new way but also represents a unique approach to uncover trends in chemical reactivity reflected by trends in substrate selection in publications.},

Herein, we developed a chiral cross-linked COF film to obtain uniform and dense chiral COF films (chirCOFilm) possessing highly sensitive CPL probing for enantiomers. The axial chiral cross-linkers ( R -/ S -BBNA) are initially introduced into the channels of a COF film (COFilm/ R -BBNA or COFilm/ S -BBNA) by the vapor-assisted epitaxial method. Then, olefin groups in R -/ S -BBNA and COF layers undergo a chiral cross-linking reaction under UV irradiation, forming a chirCOFilm. The obtained chirCOFilms have strong chirality with mirror images, fluorescence discoloration, and intense CPL properties. A multitude of rich chiral photopatterns and chirCOFilm/PDMS flexible films are prepared taking advantage of the photochromic properties of the chirCOFilms during UV illumination, showing the potential application of advanced anticounterfeiting. More importantly, the chirCOFilms realize highly sensitive CPL probing of phenethylamine enantiomers at 5% concentration, which can hardly be achieved from their corresponding fluorescence probing. This study not only provides a new strategy for preparing chiral COF films using chiral cross-linking reaction but also opens a new avenue for achieving highly sensitive probing of enantiomers though CPL.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalyzed reduction of CO 2 and NO 3 – to synthesize urea is a highly desirable, but challenging reaction. The bottleneck of this reaction is the C–N coupling of CO 2 and NO 3 – reduction intermediates. In particular, the uncertainty of CO 2 multielectron reduction intermediates severely affects the selectivity and activity of C–N coupling processes involving multiple electron and proton transfers. Here, we present a novel tandem catalyst with two compatible single-atom active sites of Au and Cu on red phosphorus (RP-AuCu) that efficiently converts CO 2 and NO 3 – to urea. Experimental and theoretical prediction results confirmed that the active center of Au on red phosphorus promotes electron transfer between CO 2 molecules and red phosphorus, thereby regulating CO 2 activation intermediates to produce electrophilic *COOH. In addition, the active center of Cu on red phosphorus can enhance the electrophilic attack of *COOH species on *NH 2 , thus promoting the selective formation of C–N bonds. Consequently, RP-AuCu exhibited a urea yield of 22.9 mmol g cat. –1 h –1 and a Faraday efficiency of 88.5% (−0.6 V RHE ), representing one of the highest levels of electrocatalytic urea synthesis. This work deepens the understanding of the C–N coupling mechanism and provides an interesting catalyst design approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C–N compounds.},

Liquid biopsy shows promise for noninvasive diagnosis of early gastric cancer; however, it remains a challenge to achieve accurate diagnosis due to the lack of highly sensitive and specific biomarkers. Herein, we propose a protocol combining metabolomics profiling from plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) and machine learning to identify the metabolomics discrepancies of early gastric cancer individuals from other populations. Efficient metabolomics profiling is achieved by efficient, high-purity, and damage-free plasma EVs separation using elaborately designed nanotrap-structured microparticles (NanoFisher) by taking advantage of stereoscopic interaction and affinity interaction. Significant metabolomics discrepancies are obtained from 150 early gastric cancer (50), benign gastric disease (50), and non-disease control (50) plasma samples. Machine learning enables ideal distinction between early gastric cancer and non-disease control samples with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.000, achieves an AUC of 0.875–0.975 for differentiating early gastric cancer from benign gastric diseases, and demonstrates an overall accuracy of 92% in directly classifying these three categories. The plasma EV metabolomics profiling enabled by NanoFisher materials, integrated with machine learning, holds considerable promise for broad clinical acceptance, enhancing gastric cancer screening outcomes.},

Our findings reveal a nonlinear relationship between sulfur solubility and both lithium salt concentration and the ratio of different solvents in composite solutions. Importantly, significant differences in sulfur solubility are discovered with changes in the solvation structure regulated by the type of salt anion. Quantitative evaluation of nonlinear sulfur solubility is illustrated to be breaking the threshold value of the interaction energy between the solute and solvent molecules. Based on these findings, simultaneous regulation of sulfur and lithium polysulfide concentrations in ether electrolytes can be achieved by controlling the concentration and type of salts. As a result, a liquid–liquid–solid reaction pathway is supported for lithium–sulfur batteries with a finite amount of electrolyte in the coin cell, and the pouch cell shows an energy density of 554 Wh kg –1 , ranking at the top level of the reported system.},

Although the cosolvent electrolyte effectively inhibits zinc dendrites and mitigates unexpected side reactions, it brings inevitable kinetics losses. Here, we systematically investigate and compare the interactions between Zn 2+ and various oxygen-coordinated cosolvents under pure aqueous environments and the interactions between Zn 2+ and OTf – under mixed solvent environments containing different oxygen-coordinated cosolvents. And the differences in the effect of different oxygen-coordinated cosolvents on the solvation structure of Zn 2+ and the kinetics of ion migration are quantitatively analyzed and summarized. On this basis, we propose a new kinetics compensation mechanism in cosolvent electrolyte strategy that can compensate the kinetics losses due to the introduction of cosolvents by weakening the anion–cation pair interaction and increasing the Zn 2+ transfer number. Theory and experiments both demonstrate that this strategy can achieve kinetics compensation of aqueous zinc batteries while improving the electrochemical performance. This work provides a comprehensive and deep understanding of designing cosolvent electrolytes with superior electrochemical performance. More importantly, the proposed strategy can be applied to other cosolvents with similar properties and other aqueous battery systems.},

Here, we introduce a novel electrolyte design strategy that synergizes anion–cation chemistry using a halogen-based IL and elucidates the underlying mechanism. The strongly and preferentially adsorbed halogen anions guide the formation of a water-poor electrical double layer (EDL) by imidazole-based cations, resulting in the formation of a halide-rich inorganic interphase. This synergistic interaction significantly mitigates Zn anode corrosion at the anode–electrolyte interface, while the halide-rich interphase promotes dense Zn deposition. Consequently, the battery exhibits superior performance, including high reversibility (99.74%) and an ultralong cycle life (20,000 cycles). This synergistic anion–cation chemistry strategy combines the traditional single solid electrolyte interphase and the classic EDL mechanism, substantially enhancing the electrochemical performance of ZMBs.},

Although concave-shaped calixarenes have been established as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of cage compounds, there are no reports on cages constructed from chiral calix[4]arene derivatives. Herein, we present a straightforward and effective method for gram-scale synthesis of a new member of chiral calix[4]arene macrocycle enantiomers, namely, phenol[4]arene (PC[4]A). As a proof of concept, we functionalized these enantiomers into tetraformylphenol[4]arene (PC[4]ACHO) derivatives via the Duff reaction to construct chiral porous organic cages (CPOCs) using polyamine synthons. Specifically, we employ two fluorescent amine synthons, bis(4-aminophenyl)phenylamine and tris(4-aminophenyl)amine, to assemble with PC[4]ACHO enantiomers, resulting in [2 + 4] lantern-shaped and [6 + 8] truncated octahedral CPOCs, respectively. These structures have been unambiguously characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Notably, the [6 + 8] truncated CPOCs exhibit internal diameters of approximately 3.1 nm, a cavity volume of around 5300 Å 3 , and high specific surface areas of up to 1300 m 2 g –1 after desolvation, making them among the largest CPOCs reported. Additionally, investigations into their chiral sensing performance demonstrate that these PC[4]A-based CPOCs enable the enantioselective recognition of amino acids and their derivatives. This work strongly suggests that PC[4]A can serve as an excellent building block for the rational design of chiral materials with practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Ionic transport critically dictates the performance of the batteries. Here, we proposed an anion anchoring strategy for enhancing Na + transport kinetics that was based on introducing a separator with a positive surface potential. Besides, we developed a nuclear magnetic resonance-assisted Hittorf approach to address the limitation of the traditional Bruce–Vincent approach itself in order to accurately quantify the migration dynamics of anions on the time scale. Results indicate that this strategy effectively anchors free anions and increases the proportion of solvent-separated ion pairs in the bulk, reduces the cation transfer energy barrier at the anode, and mitigates parasitic reactions at the cathode. The symmetric Na||Na cells efficiently operate over 1600 h, and the Na||Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 cells show stable cycling performance under limited Na excess and lean electrolyte conditions. The assembled HC||Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 pouch cells achieve an energy density of up to 225.7 W h kg –1 . Our strategy offers a new option for high-energy and long-cycle sodium-ion batteries.},

Transition-metal catalysis has been widely used in peptide and protein derivatization but mostly under homogeneous conditions. Herein, we present a first-in-class heterogeneous catalytic approach for the site-selective functionalization of histidine-containing peptides with aryl and alkenyl moieties bearing fluorescent and affinity tags, lipids, and conjugation handles. This heterogeneous derivatization strategy employs a copper(II) hexacyanometallate to catalyze the Chan–Lam reaction with boronic acids at either the backbone or the histidine imidazole, thus providing novel results that differ from those previously reported for the homogeneous Cu(OAc) 2 -mediated coupling procedure. A correlation was established between the structural and electronic properties of the copper(II) hexacyanometalate with its ability to catalyze this oxidative cross-coupling. This report expands the toolbox for late-stage peptide derivatization and labeling by unlocking the reactivity of the histidine side chain rather than merely acting as a directing group, thus boosting applications of heterogeneous catalysis in drug discovery and development.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous colloids with a high concentration of nanoparticles and free of steric stabilizers are prospective soft materials, the engineering of which is still challenging. Herein, we prepared superparamagnetic colloids with very large, up to 1350 g/L concentration of 11 nm nanoparticles via Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ coprecipitation, water washing, purification using cation-exchange resin, and stabilization with a monolayer of citrate anions (ζ potential of diluted dispersions about −35 mV). XRD, XPS, Mössbauer, and FTIR spectra elucidated the defective reverse spinel structure of magnetite/maghemite (Fe 3 O 4 /γ-Fe 2 O 3 ) with a reduced content of Fe 2+ cations. The viscosity increases with nanoparticle concentration and depends also on the nature of citrate salt, being one order of magnitude lower for lithium than sodium and potassium as counter-cation. SAXS/USAXS curves show power-law behavior in the scattering vector range between 0.1 and 0.002 nm –1 , suggesting that particles interact forming fractal clusters, which are looser for Na + - and denser for Li + -citrate stabilizers (fractal dimensions of 1.9 and 2.4, respectively). In parallel, ATR-FTIR found increasing proportions of symmetric O–H stretching vibrations of ice-like interfacial water in the concentrated colloids. We hypothesize that the clusters arise due to the attraction of like-charge particles possibly involving the water shells and hydration of counter-cations; overlapping the clusters and transition to continuous non-Newtonian phases is seen at viscosity vs concentration plots at 700–900 g/L. The results shed new light on the structure of very concentrated nanocolloids and pave the way for their manufacturing and tailoring.},

  abstract     = {Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs the essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical, and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal–organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing, small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs), which incorporate neutral monomers from the solution and crystallized ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multistage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal–organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.},

A promising therapeutic strategy targets the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), which regulates immune responses. This study investigates the ingestion of piezoelectric particles that adhere to the stomach lining, specifically targeting TRPV1 receptors. In a mouse model of sepsis, these particles, when activated by low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, generate mild electrical pulses. These pulses stimulate vagal afferent fibers, transmitting signals to the brain and modulating the neural-immune network via the CAIP. Consequently, this leads to a reduction in systemic inflammation, mitigating weight loss, alleviating multiple tissue injuries, and preventing death by modulating immune cells in the spleen. This approach addresses the critical need for noninvasive sepsis therapies, potentially improving patient outcomes. Utilizing portable ultrasound equipment with minimal thermal effects, this technique offers a safe and convenient treatment option, even for home use.},

We designed macromolecules containing phthalimide ( E 1/2 = −1.8 V vs Ag/AgNO 3 ) and tetrachlorophthalimide ( E 1/2 = −1.3 V vs Ag/AgNO 3 ) (meth)acrylates that have significantly different reduction potentials such that they are separately redox-addressable. The polymer-centered radicals generated by decarboxylation can either undergo (1) hydrogen atom transfer to form olefinic repeat units or (2) β-scission to deconstruct the polymer backbone. Our results reveal selective electrochemical control over postpolymerization modifications, which enables sequential transformations that tune the glass transition temperature of electrochemically generated copolymers over a range of −54 to 125 °C. This method was also shown to maintain its selectivity in a polymer blend and provided access to copolymers (poly(styrene- co -propylene- co -ethylene)) that would be challenging to prepare in other ways. These results demonstrate the potential of macromolecular electrolysis for selective material functionalization and degradation. This approach expands the toolbox for postpolymerization modification and targeted polymer degradation with applications in macromolecular information processing, spatiotemporal patterning, and producing materials with complex architectures that are driven by external stimuli.},

  abstract     = {Gouy–Chapman theory predicts that salt screening and modulating the interfacial charge density should strongly influence the apparent dissociation constant, K d,app , between Cu 2+ and negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). Specifically, K d,app would be expected to increase (weaken binding) by a factor of 40 when 100 mM NaCl is introduced into the solution because of electrostatic screening between the membrane and Cu 2+ cations. Surprisingly, however, fluorescence quenching measurements demonstrate that K d,app increases by less than a factor of 2 when increasing the salt concentration in the presence of standard buffers, such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris). Moreover, increasing the negative surface charge density by a factor of 4 would be predicted to decrease (strengthen binding) K d,app by 3 orders of magnitude. Instead, K d,app increases slightly when 15 mol % phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a negatively charged lipid, is introduced into SLBs already containing 5 mol % PS. Such findings indicate that electrostatic double layer theory is not a useful approach for predicting the binding behavior of transition metal cations to negatively charged interfaces. The problem lies with the fact that standard buffers, such as Tris, form a wide variety of coordination complexes in bulk solution with transition metal cations like Cu 2+ . Typically, dozens of complexes are present simultaneously at any given pH value and the net charge on them ranges from positive to neutral to negative. Such variations in charge on the complexes result in electrostatic screening and interfacial potential effects that are substantially diminished or nonexistent. These results should generally apply to the binding behavior of first row transition metal ions, when the cations predominantly reside in complexes rather than as free ions. This includes in vivo conditions, where the concentration of free transition metal ions is often very low.},

As a mAb conjugate, this agent shows high tumor specificity in a longitudinal imaging study in a murine model. To enable independent tracking of mAb uptake and lysosomal uptake and retention, a two-color ratiometric imaging strategy was employed using an “always-ON” heptamethine cyanine dye (λ ex = 785 nm) and the pH-responsive Benz-NorCy7 (λ ex = 890 nm). To assess proteolytic catabolism, we append a cleavable carbamate to Benz-NorCy7 to create turn-ON probes.

  abstract     = {The mechanism of the charge and energy flow at the metal–molecule interface has attracted much attention, especially with the recent rise of plasmonic nanomaterials for light-to-chemical conversion. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the irreplaceable effects of energetic electrons on accelerating chemical reactions, detangling the direct electron transfer (DET) from indirect electron transfer (IET) and understanding their roles are still challenging. Here, by combining electrochemical dark field scattering spectroscopy, the photoelectrochemical method, and density functional theory calculation, we provided the evidence of DET during chemical reactions, alongside decoupling the contributions of DET and IET, and then established the relationship between chemical reactivity and DET efficiency. Moreover, we discovered that DET is selective for different reactions, e.g., enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction much more than the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work offers the possibility to optimize reaction selectivity via DET and advances mechanistic insights into plasmonic charge transfer.},
