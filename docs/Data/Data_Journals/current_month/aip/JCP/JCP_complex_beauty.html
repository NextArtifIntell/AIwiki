  abstract = {Mnemonic networks are cyclic catalytic networks of monomeric enzymes that exhibit kinetic cooperativity as departures of the mean velocity from the hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten-like response. In addition, such networks admit a hysteretic response when conformational fluctuations are slow compared to the catalytic rate. Here, we show how these fluctuation-driven effects emerge from the underlying stochasticity in the network. We use the chemical master equation to study the stochastic kinetics of mnemonic networks, which, in their minimal form, include a pair of conformers and triangular reaction pathways. We introduce statistical measures that are conditional on the turnovers to comprehensively analyze molecular fluctuations in the transient and stationary states of these networks. In the transient state, temporal correlations between enzyme turnovers lead to an inequivalence between number and temporal fluctuations, yielding a hysteretic response of the mean velocity to substrates. The transient relaxes to a stationary state with independent and identically distributed turnovers and equality between number and temporal fluctuations. This state is a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) when the Kolmogorov loop criterion is not satisfied, leading to the emergence of kinetic cooperativity. The symmetry of the number correlation functions allows us to distinguish between the absence of cooperativity in equilibrium and the accidental vanishing of cooperativity in a NESS. We conclude that memory and hysteresis are transient effects while kinetic cooperativity emerges as the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic irreversibility of the NESS in a network with cyclic reaction pathways.},

We used the helical rise and helical twist, as well as a newly defined helical diameter, to characterize the stretching and twisting of dsRNA. The results indicate that dsRNA unwinds when stretched, accompanied by a linear increase in helical rise and helical diameter. Then, we utilized the normal modes, which are linear combinations of helical modes, to elucidate the underlying mechanism of dsRNA unwinding from an energetic perspective. On the other hand, we employed a stiffness matrix based on a rigid base pair model to examine the base-pair dependence of twist elasticity for dsRNA, as well as stretch elasticities with respect to the helical rise and helical diameter. The results show that the force induces variations in the local elasticities and their couplings of dsRNA, which are closely related to the distributions of base pairs. The mean stretch and twist elasticities can be considered as constants within the measurement uncertainties; however, their couplings demonstrate a slight linear dependency on applied force.},

  abstract = {Dimerization and subsequent aggregation of polymers and biopolymers often occur under nonequilibrium conditions. When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed, or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here, we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory, where the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d 0 . Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization, and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d 0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, d c , the polymer collapse precedes dimerization , and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competitions, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration R G ( t ) of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a center-to-center of mass distance parameter R MM , and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q ( t ) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking the contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using the dynamical disorder model.},

  abstract = {Buoyancy-driven convection currents arise from temperature gradients in thermal frontal polymerization (FP) when the spatially localized polymerization reaction travels perpendicularly to the gravity field. We propose a theoretical study of the system dynamics under adiabatic conditions. The polymer and the reactant mixture are considered to be in the same liquid phase, but the viscosity can increase with the degree of polymerization. We find that the reaction zone propagates as a hot spot-like pattern with a broken symmetry in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Furthermore, the system can reach an asymptotic dynamics characterized by a front with a steady shape that propagates at constant speed with a steady vortex surrounding it. As the strength of the vortex is increased, either by decreasing the reactants’ viscosity or by increasing the layer’s thickness, we observe a transition between (i) a passive regime predicted by pure reaction–diffusion and hydrodynamic models and (ii) an active chemo-hydrodynamic regime where such models separately break down. In the active regime (ii), the front speed decreases as convection intensifies. By means of a scaling analysis, we explain how hydrodynamic currents might lower the velocity of a polymerization wave. As the viscosity of the polymer is enlarged, the flow is shifted ahead of the reaction zone and becomes more symmetrical with respect to the middle of the system, as recently observed in solid–liquid FP experiments [Y.

This new structure has been derived using an ab initio density functional theory methodology and focusing on the agreement between the experimental and theoretical x-ray diffraction patterns. An extensive study has been performed to analyze the possible conformations that the polymeric strand can adopt in its crystalline form, leading to 60 initial crystalline structures. Due to thermal motion, which cannot be easily tackled with the ab initio methodology, and small inaccuracies, which are intrinsic to this calculation method, the theoretical unit cell dimensions can slightly differ from those obtained in the crystallization experiments. Thus, a structural refinement method has been employed to overcome these discrepancies and procure a crystalline structure whose x-ray diffraction pattern is consistent with the experimental one. For the proposed crystalline structure of PBF, both the powder diffraction pattern and the fiber diffraction diagram show a remarkable agreement with those available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.},

Distinct dry GB and TJ energies and GB widths are considered in contrast to the earlier phase-field studies, which assumed identical properties for the dry GBs and TJs and are far from reality. The strong effects of the intrinsic length scales, including the dry GB widths and grain size, on the temperatures of barrierless transformations between the solid, premelt (an intermediate stationary state between solid and melt with a degree of disorder) and melt, their nucleation induced by the GB network, kinetics, and complex microstructures evolution are explored, which was still missing in the literature. The thermodynamic processes involved in the melting of polycrystalline solids, which include the jump-like (discontinuous) appearance of premelt or melt pockets in the TJ regions, followed by premelting and melting of the connected GBs, curvature-driven shrinking of the grains surrounded by the melt pools and their jump-like melting at critical temperatures, all occurring at temperatures below the bulk melting point, are revealed. The reverse transformation (solidification) of the molten GB network and the bistability regime, where the temperatures for solid → premelt and premelt → solid transformations differ and yield thermal hysteresis, are studied. The role of the disjoining potential on the jump-like GB premelting and stability of the thermodynamic states is explored.},

However, the mismatch between anode and cathode dynamics is the biggest barrier to improving their performance. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for the preparation of porous MXene by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-controlled etching to solve the capacity degradation and ion diffusion limitation, which are caused by van der Waals forces between MXene nanosheets. This approach facilitates the realization of three-dimensional ion channels with both vertical and horizontal pathways, significantly enhancing the availability of active sites and improving the ion diffusion rate. By adjusting the amount of oxidant, porous MXene (P-MXene-2) with an optimal pore size range was obtained. The assembled half-cell has a capacity of 180 mAh g −1 at a rate of 0.05 A g −1 . Furthermore, by combining a porous carbon cathode with porous MXene and electrolyte screening, a SIHC with a high energy density of 110.6 Wh kg −1 at 1000 W kg −1 and 71.1 Wh kg −1 at 20 kW kg −1 was successfully constructed.

The key gas-sensing characteristics concerning chemiresistive (CR) and field-effect transistor (FET) gas sensing have been thoroughly explored. The results show that Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N can work as either CR or FET gas-sensing materials for detecting H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 O, whereas B-C 2 N can work as a disposable gas sensor for O 2 , H 2 O, and NH 3 . Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N are the most selective toward O 2 and NH 3 , followed by CO and H 2 O in an oxygen- and ammonia-free environment, while B-C 2 N is the most selective toward H 2 O and NH 3 . More importantly, the adsorption strength of target molecule plays a critical role in gas-sensing mechanism as well as selectivity, recovery time, and sensitivity. This study offers theoretical perspectives on 2D hybrid carbon-based nanomaterials for efficient gas sensing.},

Highly polarized spin probes were produced in situ by the addition of muonium to the aromatic anions, and the muon and methylene proton hyperfine coupling constants (hfccs) of these radical anions were determined from the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonance fields in the ALC- μ SR spectra. The motionally averaged dipolar muon hfccs, | D μ ‖ | ⁠ , were determined from the width and amplitude of the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonances and used to estimate the extent of reorientational motion. The results are consistent with the counterions being electrostatically trapped near the oil/water interface of the surfactant bilayer and undergoing large amplitude anisotropic motion. This motion is generally more restricted in DODMAC bilayers compared with DHTAC, which is likely related to the relative flexibility of the headgroups to which the counterions are loosely bound. The motion of the ortho isomers is generally more restricted than the para isomers, while there is no obvious trend regarding the ethyl, chloro, and hydroxy substituents.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission, which may increase the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells, proceeds via multiple spin levels of a triplet pair. To clarify the spin-related elementary processes of the triplet pair, we measured the magnetoluminescence effect of the fluorescence of rubrene, in the form of orthorhombic polycrystalline powder, in the range of ±300 mT at room temperature. Model simulations using the density matrix method were performed to elucidate how the features of the magnetoluminescence effect depend on the triplet pair dynamics. Simulations of the observed field dependence of the magnetoluminescence effect revealed an anisotropy of 1:100 for the two-dimensional hopping of triplet excitons forming a triplet pair in the ab plane, for which the exchange interaction depends on the separation distance between the two triplet excitons. The effective lifetime of the spin-correlated triplet pair responsible for the magnetoluminescence effect is estimated to be 2.2 ns.},

The contributions of hot carriers, cooled carriers, and defect-trapped carriers to the transient absorption signals and the dynamic evolution of the carriers among themselves are elucidated. By comparing the carrier dynamics taking place at the boundary and internal regions, we find that the benign shallow defect state in the grain boundary region has a positive effect on accelerating the cooling of hot carriers, while the deep energy level defects induce excited state absorption signals.

  abstract = {Radical scavenging reaction rate constants were measured by monitoring the free induction decay (FID) of the unpaired electron of radicals by using laser-synchronized pulsed-EPR. This method probes large electron spin magnetization arisen from dynamic electron spin polarization (DEP), which remarkably enhances the EPR signal. DEP decays with the longitudinal spin relaxation time, which was observed by using the FID detection method. In the presence of a radical scavenger, the DEP decay time depends on both spin-lattice relaxation and the chemical reaction with the scavenger, the latter of which reduces radical concentration. The plots of DEP decay rates against the radical scavenger concentrations gave the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for various radicals. This procedure was applied to determine the radical scavenging reaction rate constants of hydroxycyclohexyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, diphenylphosphinoyl, and α,α-dimethoxybenzyl radicals. The measured rate constants show good agreement with the previously reported values determined by using another method monitoring electron spin echo (ESE) decays of the radicals. We discussed the advantageous and disadvantageous characters of the FID detection method with respect to the existing ESE method in the viewpoints of signal intensity, selectivity of radicals, the simpleness of the measurements, and so on.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we investigate the thermal conductivity ( κ ) of different core–shell nanowires using molecular dynamics simulation and Green–Kubo (EMD), imposing a temperature gradient (NEMD) and Müller-Plathe (rNEMD) approaches. We show that in GaAs@InAs nanowires, the interface effect becomes more significant than the nanowire cross-sectional geometry. In particular, κ decreases as the interface area increases, reaching a minimum, and then increases when the interface strain relaxes. This is particularly important for thermoelectric applications, where minimization of κ is desired. In particular, the different methods can predict minima at different core diameters without special considerations. In addition, the NEMD approach and, to a lesser extent, rNEMD tend to overestimate the κ values, which cannot be corrected with the methods available in the literature. By analyzing the temperature and length dependence, (I) we show that interfacial scattering primarily involves phonon–phonon interactions, which mainly affect low-energy modes, a mechanism that effectively reduces κ at low temperatures. (II) The Langevin thermostat tends to pump low-energy modes in the NEMD approach, but this effect decreases with longer nanowires. (III) Energy exchanges in rNEMD stimulate high-energy phonons, derived from the saturation of κ at a much shorter nanowire length than NEMD. These findings highlight the challenges of accurately determining κ of ultrathin core–shell nanowires, where only the EMD approach provides precise results. With the recognition of non-equilibrium contributions to the overestimation of κ by NEMD and rNEMD, these methods can still provide valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying thermal transport mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We investigate fundamental aspects concerning selectivity in hydrogenation reactions for Solid Catalyst with Ionic Liquid Layer (SCILL)-type systems. Some of us recently reported that the adsorption behavior of 1,3-butadiene and 1-butene on Pt(111) can be tuned with ultrathin layers of the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 1 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]): Increasing the IL coverage leads to increased blocking of olefin adsorption sites. Notably, a smaller IL amount is needed to prevent 1-butene adsorption as compared to 1,3-butadiene adsorption, leading to a selectivity window, in which 1,3-butadiene still can be adsorbed while 1-butene cannot. With the aim to evaluate whether this is a general behavior, we study an IL with a longer alkyl chain at the cation, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]), and an IL with a different anion, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 8 C 1 Im][PF 6 ]). Indeed, we observe a selectivity window for all ILs and thus demonstrate that this concept also applies for other ILs with different chain lengths and anions. Nevertheless, there are pronounced differences for the three ILs in terms of the IL coverages required for full blocking and the width of the selectivity window. Different explanations are discussed, e.g., the structure of the IL layer and the interaction strengths of olefins and ILs with the substrate.},

  abstract = {Aluminum (Al) is a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low volume expansibility. However, scalable fabrication of nanostructured Al still faces a great challenge. In addition, the lithium storage performance of Al anode materials always encounters a severe strike within a dozen discharge/charge cycles, and such an abnormal behavior of the Al anode material remains enigmatic. Herein, a mechanochemistry method without using any solvent is developed to achieve scalable production of Al nanoparticles and the morphology of the obtained Al nanoparticles could be regulated using Ketjen black (KB). KB with a chain-like structure could regulate the Al crystal growth process and the aggregation of Al nanoparticles during the solid-phase reaction, shortening the electron transfer path among Al crystals, ultimately activating the lithium storage behavior of nanostructured Al. Initial discharge/charge capacities of 630.6 and 402.0 mA h g −1 were achieved at 50 mA g −1 ; unfortunately, the nanostructured Al still suffered from rapid deterioration of lithium storage performance. Comprehensive analysis demonstrated that the raised energy barrier of LiAl formation and the slow lithium diffusion kinetics in the Al matrix may be the main factors destroying the lithium storage performance of the Al anode material. This work provided more evidence for illustrating the lithium storage behavior of the Al anode.},

  abstract = {Quantifying thermodynamics, structural, and dynamical properties of brine confined in clay pores is critical for a variety of geo-energy applications, including underground hydrogen storage (UHS) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are applied here to study aqueous NaCl brines within 10-Å kaolinite slit pores. NaCl concentrations are chosen at 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt. %, all below the solubility limit and high enough to provide statistically relevant information. The distribution of the ions within the nanopores is found not to be homogeneous. Explicitly, Na + cations, preferentially attracted to the siloxane surface, accumulate in regions with low water density, whereas Cl − anions, attracted to the gibbsite surface of kaolinite, are found within the hydration layers. Confinement affects the properties of ions, with ion pairing being more pronounced within the pore than in bulk aqueous solutions at similar temperatures, pressures, and compositions. Conversely, the ions affect the properties of confined water. For example, the lifetime of water–water hydrogen bonds in confinement is shortened within the hydration shells; increasing salinity from 5 to 12.5 wt. % reduces the likelihood of water density fluctuations near the kaolinite surfaces, although when the NaCl concentration rises from 12.5 to 15 wt. %, Cl − anions enhance the likelihood of density fluctuations for the hydration layer near the gibbsite surface. The simulated molecular trajectories are studied further to extract diffusion coefficients. While confinement in the kaolinite nanopore reduces the mobility of all species, non-monotonic trends are observed as a function of salt concentration. The trends seem associated with the likelihood of ion pairing. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients for the cations are predicted to be higher than those for the anions, which is contrary to what is typically observed in bulk brines. Because density fluctuations are correlated with properties such as the solubility of gases in confined water, our observations may have important implications for geo-energy applications such as UHS and CCS.},

The traditional Boltzmann transport equation method is highly accurate but limited by the low-order phonon scattering model, which makes it difficult to resolve the high-order scattering effects of low symmetry layered materials. The classical molecular dynamics calculation is efficient but lacks accuracy due to the missing multi-component potential function. In this study, we develop a strategy to predict the thermal conductivity of K 0.8 Li 0.27 Ti 1.73 O 4 (KLTO), a model of layered oxides by machine-learning using a deep neural network model to acquire the interatomic potential of KLTO. The deep learning potential (DLP) is in excellent agreement with density functional theory in predicting atomic force, energy, and elastic properties. In addition, the calculated out-of-plane thermal conductivity values based on the DLP (0.37 W m −1 K −1 ) are close to experimental results (0.28 W m −1 K −1 ). This machine-learning framework for constructing interatomic potentials can be extended to other layered materials, offering a promising approach for advancing the theoretical study of such systems.},

  abstract = {Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) is a toxic chemical that poses significant risks to human health and the environment; therefore, its level must be accurately monitored. Herein, the adsorption of CNCl by transition metal-doped fluorinated diamanes (F-diamanes) has been extensively studied via first-principles calculations. Key parameters such as adsorption energies, charge transfer amounts, bandgaps, sensitivity, densities of states, projected density of states, charge density differences, and recovery time were systematically analyzed. Results reveal that monometallic doping significantly enhances CNCl adsorption, with increases in adsorption energy by 164%–368% and charge transfer by 1234%–1571%, particularly in the AuFD-CNCl, AgFD-CNCl, and CuFD-CNCl systems, which demonstrated improved sensing performances. Similarly, bimetallic co-doping further strengthened adsorption, with energy enhancements of 277%–309% and charge transfer increases of 1238%–1505%. Au-CuFD-CNCl, Au-AgFD-CNCl, and Cu-AgFD-CNCl systems also showed superior sensing performances. Meanwhile, the recovery time of CNCl molecules on the AuFD, AgFD, Au-CuFD, and Au-AgFD surfaces was drastically reduced to acceptable levels at 279–412 K, leading to their desorption. Therefore, these four systems exhibited excellent reversibility properties, suggesting their applicability in gas-sensing applications. This work can facilitate the applications of doped F-diamanes in environmental conservation, energy storage, and chemical engineering.},

  abstract = {In this study, a solution system of KCl–NH 4 Cl–NH 3 –H 2 O with different mass fractions was prepared at room temperature using x-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. From x-ray scattering, it was obtained that the peak near Q = 2.50 Å −1 in the F ( Q ) function changed from a flat-topped blunt peak to a bimodal peak as the concentration of ammonia increased. This change indicated that increased ammonia altered the hydrogen bonding network within the mixed solution. In the G ( r ) function, the peak near 3.25 Å enhances with the increase in ammonia concentration, suggesting a higher occurrence of N(NH 4 + )–N(NH 3 ) interactions. Raman spectroscopy findings demonstrated that in the KCl–NH 4 Cl aqueous mixture, the area of DDAA-type hydrogen bonds increased as KCl concentration decreased and NH 4 Cl concentration increased. This suggests that KCl disrupts DDAA-type hydrogen bonds more significantly than NH 4 Cl. The situation was reversed when ammonia was added to the system, implying that KCl damages the DDAA-type hydrogen bonding structure less than NH 4 Cl when NH 3 is present in the solution. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the coordination number of K–Cl increases with ammonia concentration, as ammonia’s lone pair of electrons can bind to NH 4 + to stabilize the [NH 4 (H 2 O) m−n (NH 3 ) n ] + complex. This study elucidates the underlying microscopic mechanisms behind the decrease in KCl solubility and the increase in NH 4 Cl solubility upon increased ammonia.},

  abstract = {Two main frameworks are commonly used to describe electrolyte solutions: the non-primitive model, which rigorously accounts for all interactions between ions and solvent molecules; and the primitive model, which treats the solvent as a dielectric continuum, only describing ion–ion interactions explicitly. The primitive model offers simple Helmholtz energy expressions, including the Debye–Hückel (DH) equation, the primitive mean spherical approximation (MSA), and the Born theory of solvation. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of primitive model approaches by comparing their Helmholtz energies with data from molecular simulations obtained for non-primitive model electrolyte solutions. We model electrolyte solutions as mixtures of equally sized, charged, and (non-polarizable) dipolar Lennard-Jones particles. Using thermodynamic integration, we isolate the Helmholtz energy contributions related to solvent–solvent, ion–solvent, and ion–ion interactions. Molecular simulations are performed across two temperatures and two densities, a range of charges, dipole moments, and ion mole fractions (0.005 ≤ x ions ≤ 0.05). Our results show that while the primitive model expressions provide a qualitatively reasonable description of electrolyte solutions, they systematically underestimate the Helmholtz energy contributions associated with ion–solvent and ion–ion interactions. Achieving quantitative agreement requires empirical adjustments to the Born radius. Notably, the optimized Born radii are significantly larger than the actual ion sizes used in the molecular simulations, questioning the primitive model’s applicability. This work presents rigorous benchmarks for the use of MSA, DH, and Born theories, along with molecular simulation data for non-primitive model electrolytes. These benchmarks provide insights for refining existing models and advancing the development of new equations of state for electrolyte solutions.},

However, the accurate determination of enthalpy, heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, isochoric pressure coefficient, and isobaric thermal expansion coefficient requires the addition of a quantum correction to the kinetic energy (QCKE). The QCKE is a post-simulation contribution to the thermodynamic properties of quantum fluids and, as such, can be used to improve the accuracy of any predictions using an intermolecular potential. The addition of QCKE to the SAAP + FH-1 potential results in values for the thermodynamic properties that are close to reference data for hydrogen at temperatures greater than 40 K and pressures up to 100 MPa.},

  abstract = {Rare earth aluminum garnets are important materials in optical, dielectric, and thermal barrier applications. To advance the understanding of their melt processing and glass forming ability, we report the atomic structure of molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 over 1770–2630 K, which spans the equilibrium and supercooled liquid regimes. The melt density at T m = 2283 K is 5.50 g cm −3 , measured via silhouette imaging of electrostatically levitated drops over 1010–2420 K. Four separate structure measurements were made with aerodynamically levitated melts using x-ray and neutron diffraction with isotope substitution of Yb ( 172 Yb, 174 Yb, or nat Yb). Empirical potential structure refinement models were developed, which are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Coordination environments for Al–O are predominantly 4- and 5-coordinate, with a mean coordination of n AlO = 4.43(8), while Yb–O environments mostly range from 5- to 8-coordinate, with n YbO = 6.26(8). The cation–oxygen polyhedra are connected primarily by corner-sharing, with edge-sharing constituting up to ∼1/3 of the connectivity among polyhedra with Yb or higher-coordinated Al–O. Structurally, the –Al–O– network in molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 appears conducive to glass formation: n OAl = 1.85(3), there are 1.86 AlO x –AlO x connections per Al atom (e.g., a mixture of Q 3 and Q 4 units), and the modal ring size is six cations. These characterize a network that is somewhat less constrained compared to SiO 2 glass, yet Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 cannot be quenched into crystal-free glass. Aluminum garnet compositions with larger rare earth cations do form glass, so these characterizations help reveal the structural characteristics corresponding to the limit of glass forming ability in rare earth aluminates.},

  abstract = {[ F e ( t e r p y ) 2 ] 2 + (terpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) is a transition metal complex where the spin state is photoswitchable and where the properties of the metal-centered quintet excited state ( 5 MC) can be tuned by substituting different electron withdrawing or electron donating groups on the 4′ position of the terpyridine. To better understand the physics determining the photoswitching performance, a deeper insight into the positions of the relevant potential energy surfaces and the molecular structure of the 5 MC state is needed. We present a structural investigation based on Time Resolved x-ray Solution Scattering (TR-XSS) by which we determine the average d Fe–N bond-length elongation following population of the 5 MC state as well as the lifetime of this state in a series of seven modified [ F e ( t e r p y ) 2 ] 2 + systems in aqueous solution following photo-excitation. The analysis of the TR-XSS data is supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics calculations. The quintet state lifetime is determined to vary by more than a factor of 10 (from 1.5 to 16 ns) based on the electron withdrawing/donating properties of the substituting group. Both the DFT calculations and the structural analysis of the experimental data show that the main photo-induced change in metal–ligand bond lengths Δ d Fe–N is ∼0.2 Å for all systems.},

However, the precise identification of preferred doping sites is challenging owing to its high structural complexity, which hinders establishing the structure–activity relationship. Here, through density functional theory calculations coupled with energy evaluation, delicate structural analysis, valence electron counting, and localized molecular orbital topology, we characterize the tetrahedral Au 3 Ag with closed-shell two valence electrons [Au 3 Ag(2 e )] as a fundamental building block in face-centered-cubic (FCC) ligand-protected AuAg (LP-AuAg) alloy nanoclusters. The kernel structures of FCC LP-AuAg alloy clusters are constructed by rational spatial packing of Au 3 Ag(2 e ), Au 4 (2 e ), and Au 3 (2 e ) blocks, aligning with the grand unified model of ligand-protected Au nanoclusters. In addition, we predict 40 FCC LP-AuAg alloy nanoclusters with 141 low-energy isomers. This work underscores the crucial role of subset blocks in stabilizing the entire cluster and provides valuable insights into the structural features of FCC LP-AuAg alloy clusters.},

A comprehensive study with two excitation wavelengths and a broadband white-light continuum probe (400–1400 nm) has determined that a torsional isomerization mechanism is the most probable for both isomers. This has shed light on the excited state behavior of the elusive push–pull Z isomer, which has its properties mostly predicted by simulations and systematically lacks experimental observations. Meanwhile, another unproductive relaxation pathway, associated with a symmetric bending motion, was found only for the E isomer. When relaxing through this pathway, the molecule encounters a potential barrier in the ground state, which requires significant structural reorganization before full relaxation. This local minimum can be more general than expected and may be behind unsolved issues in the literature of azobenzenes.},

  abstract = {An uncertainty-driven active learning strategy was employed to achieve efficient point sampling for full-dimension potential energy surface constructions. Model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network models, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added to the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. A reference potential energy surface (PES) of the 6-D H 2 O–He system was constructed first by the MLRNet model with a weighted Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.028 cm −1 . The full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method. The current sampling method is reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, where the single precision model achieves a test set RMSE of 0.3253 cm −1 with 472 fitting points and the double precision model is 0.0710 cm −1 with only 613 points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy. However, the MLRNet, with fewer parameters, shows lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles, indicating its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to validate the accuracy of PESs. The energy levels of the double precision LS-FI-NN showed great agreement with the reference PES’s results, with only 0.0161 and 0.0044 cm −1 average errors for vibrational levels and the band origin shifts.},

The results show that the initial velocity of the droplets significantly influences the coalescence time and jumping characteristics. As the initial velocity increases, the coalescence time decreases, and the horizontal velocity increases, suggesting that controlling the initial velocity can adjust droplet motion behavior. In terms of energy conversion, the total energy conversion rate remains relatively constant at lower initial velocities but increases significantly as the velocity rises. This is primarily due to the reduced coalescence time and viscous dissipation caused by the increased initial kinetic energy, allowing more energy to be converted into the kinetic energy of jumping. The energy conversion rate in the horizontal direction increases with initial velocity, while in the vertical direction, it tends to decrease. This study deepens the understanding of coalescence-induced jumping phenomena at the nanoscale and provides a theoretical basis for engineering applications, showing that droplet behavior can be effectively modulated by controlling the initial velocity.},

Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to I ( P 3 / 2 2 ) and I * ( P 1 / 2 2 ) products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump–probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states.

  abstract = {Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a stationary background of the so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump–probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton–exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we show both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excited-state dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump–probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and is independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.},

The priority focus in area-selective ALD is to achieve the desired selectivity; thus, most studies to date have been concentrated on the reaction mechanism of ALD on growth/nongrowth substrates or the development of novel methodologies to resolve the challenges associated with its implementation in high-volume manufacturing. In this study, we performed area-selective ALD of SiO 2 on SiO 2 , where SiO 2 was not grown on SiN x , and suggested area-selective ALD approaches that could simultaneously enhance selectivity and film quality. An NH 3 plasma treatment was applied to functionalize the SiN x surface with more Si–NH bonds, which exhibited low reactivity toward Si precursors. Although the SiO 2 surface was also functionalized with Si–NH bonds, it was not fully converted into Si–NH because of its thermodynamic nature at low temperatures. Consequently, the results showed that NH 3 plasma pretreatment was effective in increasing selectivity. Therefore, we performed a layer-by-layer NH 3 plasma treatment during the ALD of SiO 2 to deposit high-quality films without losing selectivity. The SiO 2 film was densified, as confirmed by x-ray reflection spectra without nitrogen impurity incorporation. Electrical property measurements of metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors confirmed that this approach enabled simultaneous selectivity and SiO 2 film-quality enhancement.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction almost three decades ago, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has evolved into a mature and powerful technique to reveal the inner workings of quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution. In general, this technique can isolate different contributions to the nonlinear response and provides access to different dynamical quantum pathways of the system evolution. Such isolation of pathways can be achieved in different experimental geometries. In its original, fully noncollinear implementation, directional phase matching allows for such signal isolation, while in the modern commonly employed pump–probe geometry, experimentally challenging phase-cycling schemes are employed. Here, we show how rephasing, non-rephasing, and zero- and double-quantum 2DES signals can be isolated in the pump–probe geometry without a need for phase-cycling. For this, we utilize established causality restrictions of the nonlinear response, allowing us to separate the different contributions in the spectral domain. We demonstrate this using data recorded for a molecular J-aggregate, acting as an effective three-level system. This approach bridges the gap between the capabilities of shaper-based and fully noncollinear 2DES and experimentally simpler implementations, such as those based on birefringent common-path interferometers.},

By integrating ultrafast techniques such as pump–probe and coherent multidimensional spectroscopy with microscopy techniques utilizing high numerical aperture objective lenses and structured beams, these approaches provide label-free chemical contrast and reveal transient phenomena critical to understanding complex systems. Recent advancements, including adaptive optics and tailored beam profiles, have further enhanced spatial and temporal control, unlocking new possibilities for studying heterogeneous systems. This work explores time-resolved nonlinear microspectroscopy using Laguerre–Gaussian beams with orbital angular momentum. Analytical expressions for pump–probe microspectroscopy signals are derived to elucidate how beam parameters influence nonlinear responses reflecting spatial diffusion and ultrafast relaxation processes. The results demonstrate the potential of customized ultrafast pulses and spatial light fields to improve both resolution and sensitivity, advancing dynamic studies in materials science, chemistry, and biology.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that the transition state of a chemical reaction is not a single, static structure but rather a distribution of configurations. However, the implications of this distributed nature remain incompletely characterized, particularly for quantum proton and hydride transfer reactions, where variations in donor–acceptor separations at the transition state are key: they can determine whether or not tunneling contributes to the transfer. Consequently, the transition state’s characterization critically depends on the chosen reaction coordinate, and several geometry-based and energy-based coordinates have been proposed for empirical valence bond and hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of such reactions. Here, we systematically evaluate these coordinates, using a general analytic model for proton- and hydride-transfer reactions alongside important aspects of the enzymatic hydride transfer in formate dehydrogenase as a case study. Our analysis reveals significant limitations of common geometry-based and vertical energy gap coordinates, which often fail to isolate environmental effects and can bias the description of transition states. To address these issues, we propose an equilibrium energy difference coordinate that excludes the rapid fluctuations of the transferring quantum proton or hydride, focusing instead on the environment’s polarization. Additionally, we demonstrate that the broad distribution of transition state configurations implies that key reaction properties, such as rate constants and kinetic isotope effects, may not always report on the same subset of transition state configurations. This insight helps resolve some mechanistic ambiguities and highlights the importance of carefully selecting reaction coordinates for simulating reaction dynamics (especially for quantum particle transfers) in enzymatic and condensed-phase chemistry.},

Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighboring spins (the spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However, in the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique appears ineffective at low mobility values. These findings provide valuable insights into nucleation phenomena at low temperatures, contributing to theoretical and experimental understanding.},

We find that only one vibrational entropy approximation—the one proposed by Truhlar in 2011—which is used in only ∼2% of cases, is stable in the low-lying frequency region and does not exhibit this problem. Accordingly, this approximation shows the best accuracy and robustness on a diverse set of experimental complexation energies and can be somewhat improved even further.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In Paper I [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in Paper II [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.},

It argues that, due to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, the justification for using equilibrium thermostats for nonequilibrium simulations is inherited only by cases in which the perturbation is small enough for the perturbed system to behave like the unperturbed equilibrium system. In the process, this paper categorizes models of external perturbations in molecular dynamics as either responsive—i.e., perturbations that impose a force—or directive—i.e., perturbations that impose a trajectory. Since directive perturbations have not been studied enough in the literature but are becoming more relevant, their effects on simple perturbed thermostatted systems are considered. Finally, using a perturbed two-point harmonic oscillator as well as a driven particle immersed in a simple Lennard-Jones fluid, it gives an approximation for the limit of justified equilibrium thermostat use for perturbed systems. This paper hopes to inspire further research in the fields of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been extensively studied as T 2 contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The theory of nuclear magnetic relaxation induced by superparamagnetic nanoparticles has been validated by numerous experimental studies in the case of spherical particles. Recently, several studies focused on the synthesis of cubic nanoparticles. Some of them reported significantly higher relaxivities compared to their spherical counterpart and attributed this increase to their specific shapes. This work investigates the impact of cube-shaped nanoparticles on nuclear magnetic relaxation through Monte Carlo methods. Transverse relaxation at high static magnetic field is simulated by modeling the proton diffusion in the magnetic field generated by a cubic or a spherical nanoparticle. The results indicate that, in the case of magnetite nanoparticles, there is no significant difference between both shapes for sizes above 30 nm when particles are compared at equal volumes and magnetization. Below this size, a −40%–15% variation of the relaxation rates is predicted for the cubic case compared to the spherical case. These results are explained using general relaxation models that incorporate the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the nanoparticles. The simulation predictions are compared to some experimental results from the literature, revealing that, in some cases, the magnetic field specific to the nanoparticle shape alone cannot explain the observed increase in the relaxation rate of cubic nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion in graphene nanochannels is pivotal for applications such as gas sensing and membrane separation, where nanoscale confinement introduces unique transport phenomena. Unlike bulk-phases, diffusion in graphene nanochannels is significantly influenced by adsorption, which modifies density distributions and alters diffusivity behavior. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are combined with a theoretical framework to comprehensively investigate gas diffusion under varying pressures and channel heights. A modified Chapman–Enskog model, derived from atomistic Lennard-Jones potential parameters, is proposed to account for the effects of confinement. Simulation results reveal that gas diffusivity decreases with increasing gas-phase pressure and decreasing channel height due to enhanced density in the nanochannels. Interestingly, for ultra-narrow channels ( h ≲ 0.7 nm), the diffusivity correction factor exhibits non-monotonic behavior, initially decreasing but subsequently increasing due to overlapping repulsive potential fields. The proposed model integrates adsorption effects through density predictions based on the Boltzmann distribution and effectively predicts gas diffusivities with relative errors of less than 13%, even under strong confinement. These findings highlight the critical interplay between adsorption and confinement in shaping gas transport within graphene nanochannels. The theoretical model provides a predictive tool for designing graphene-based gas separation and sensing devices, offering fundamental insights for optimizing their performance.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer processes are ubiquitous in nature and intensely investigated. The investigations concentrate on the transfer of small to intermediate sized energies. Here, we pose the question of whether the transfer of large energies, where relativistic effects play a central role, can be efficient. At large energies, the process leads to ionization of the environment, i.e., it is the interatomic (or intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) process. To that end, we derive asymptotic expressions for the ICD amplitude by employing the Dirac–Breit Hamiltonian and expanding the frequency dependent Coulomb–Breit interaction between the electrons of the donor and those of the acceptor in powers of the inverse distance between their centers of mass. Expressions are separately derived for the two popular Feynman and Coulomb gauges. At long range, the two expressions have a different appearance but are proven to be equivalent. The derived energy transfer rate at long range shows that when the donor is embedded in an environment, the transfer can be highly efficient. A key is that the radiative lifetime of the donor is extremely short (it can be in the attosecond, 10 −18 s, regime), and the x-ray emission typically dominates by far Auger decay (also called Auger–Meitner decay), and the ICD can quench this emission. This contrasts with the situation at small to intermediate sized energies, where the radiative lifetime is much smaller and Auger decay (if the channel is open) dominates. In these cases, the major contribution to ICD comes from the neighbors nearby.},

  abstract = {Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs.

  abstract = {The original constrained dipole moment density functional theory allows one to control the magnitude of the molecular dipole moment in a variational and non-empirical way . In this work, we extend this methodology to control the three Cartesian components of the molecular dipole moment . The new theoretical development is suitable for the calculation of the charge-transfer energy contributions to the total interaction energies in non-covalent complexes. To test the reliability of the theoretical development, we form three sets of non-covalent complexes from the literature with a total of fifty-one systems. The former set of complexes includes many different types of non-covalent interactions, the second set consists of prototypical non-covalent complexes and three biologically relevant interactions between DNA base pairs, and the third set comprises halogen bonding complexes. We determined the charge-transfer energy contributions and the total interaction energies of all these complexes. The calculated charge-transfer energies are in very good agreement with the ones calculated using the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology, which has been proven to be reliable. Nevertheless, the new procedure relies on the molecular dipole moment, which is observable, while the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology relies on a definition of a population analysis.},

In this article, we examine a wide range of correlation measures to evaluate their potential as MR diagnostics. We identify a small set of valid size-intensive correlation measures based on maximum metrics, exhibiting similar predictive values. Among these, we highlight I ND max ⁠ , which offers an easy interpretation: it captures the largest deviation of a natural orbital occupancy from the boundary values corresponding to a single-reference wave function. No energy-based correlation measure was found suitable for constructing MR diagnostics. Finally, we demonstrate how average correlation measures, although not suitable as MR diagnostics, can provide a more comprehensive view of electron correlation within the molecule.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell–Schrödinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. In addition, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach—an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.},

  abstract = {Introducing heavy atoms, or replacing atoms with heavier ones, is a routine approach for accelerating spin-flipping photophysical processes. However, predicting its impact on phosphorescence efficiency is not straightforward. Herein, we report an unexpected consequence of bromine-to-iodine substitution in a bromothienyl diketone derivative, TIPS-BrTn , that exhibits outstanding room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in cyclohexane solution. Contrary to our expectation, the iodo-congener TIPS-ITn exhibited feeble photoluminescence, which we confirmed as RTP by ultrafast spectroscopy. Further experimental and theoretical studies revealed that, in the T 1 state, an excited-state symmetry breaking occurred on TIPS-ITn while TIPS-BrTn preserved the centrosymmetric geometry. We identified the driving force for the symmetry breaking as an intramolecular two-center three-electron bonding interaction between iodine and carbonyl oxygen in the (n,π*) excited state. Consequently, while the direct T 1 –S 0 spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in TIPS-BrTn is symmetry-forbidden and zero, that of TIPS-ITn is non-zero due to the loss of centrosymmetry, thereby accelerating nonradiative T 1 –S 0 decay to diminish the RTP. Importantly, the phosphorescence rate constant is not solely dictated by the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC; instead, it can be rationalized by the intensity borrowing from higher singlet states. Thus, our work highlights the importance of controlling molecular symmetry, which could suppress the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC and lead to a preferential acceleration of radiative decay over nonradiative decay for achieving efficient RTP.},

In this perspective article, we discuss common notions, recent results, and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of ν −1/2 appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. In addition, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic ν −1/2 behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape toward higher temperatures.},

The use of two strategies of spin labeling of mRNAs allowed us to study for the first time the effect of the structure and location of spin labels on the measured interspin distances in human ribosome complexes. Experiments using dipolar EPR spectroscopy, supported by molecular dynamics calculations, demonstrated that labels introduced at nucleotide bases provide a higher resolution between mRNA conformations in the ribosome mRNA channel, compared to labels introduced at the ribose-phosphate backbone. Although ribose-phosphate labeling turned out to be less informative on its own for studying mRNA conformations in the ribosome than the previously used base labeling, it can find application in other complex studies of the structure of RNAs and their complexes.},

  abstract = {The elasticity of phospholipid membranes as a function of hydration was investigated using coarse-grained molecular simulations. Multilamellar membranes consist of two or more lipid bilayers separated by a thin layer of water, a system commonly found in cell membranes that provides surface tension in the alveoli of the lungs and on cartilaginous surfaces of synovial joints. The objective was to quantify the response of such systems to compression in the direction perpendicular to the membranes as a function of the amount of water between the bilayers or hydration of the system. The present study investigated a variety of phospholipids with six levels of hydration found in multilamellar bilayers in biological systems. Our simulations support the existence of a universal behavior of the increase in surface area per lipid as a function of the normal pressure difference, the difference between the pressure applied in the direction normal to the membrane and the pressure applied in the directions parallel to the membrane. Normalizing the surface area per lipid and the pressure difference by their respective values at rupture yields a composite function of two linear regimes for all the hydration levels under investigation. Where possible, a physics-based interpretation of the normalization scales was provided. Although some parameters of the model are determined empirically, the model represents a promising step in continuum modeling of the response of multilamellar lipid membranes as a function of mechanical stress and hydration.},

We show the importance of taking optical aberrations into account, as these impact apparent contact angle measurements. Ddx4 N condensates are seen to partially dry (contact angles above 90°) a model membrane, with little dependence on the magnitude of charge on, or tyrosine content of, Ddx4 N . Further contact angle measurements on surfaces of varying hydrophilicity reveal a preference of Ddx4 N condensates for hydrophobic surfaces, suggesting an intrinsic repulsion between protein condensates and hydrophilic membrane surfaces. This observation is in line with previous studies relating protein adsorption to surface hydrophilicity.

Here, we report a theoretical study on the phase behavior of XLCMs with symmetric and asymmetric side blocks by using the self-consistent field theory (SCFT). A large number of ordered structures, including smectic phases, simple and giant polygons, are obtained as solutions of the SCFT equations. Phase diagrams of XLCMs as a function of the total length and asymmetric ratio of the side chains are constructed. For XLCMs with symmetric side blocks, the theoretically predicted phase transition sequence is in good agreement with experiments. For XLCMs with a fixed total side chain length, transitions between layered structure to polygonal phases, as well as between different polygonal phases, could be induced by varying the asymmetry of the side chains. The free energy density, domain size, side chain stretching, and molecular orientation are analyzed to elucidate mechanisms stabilizing the different ordered phases.},

S086 has two crystalline forms (α and ξ) with the same molecular composition, but only the crystal structure of the latter has been disclosed. Using the carboxylic group (COO − ) and the amide group (CONH) as structural probes, the core structures and local dynamics of the Ca 2+ coordination complex in the unit cell of the two cocrystals were examined by ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. A notable variation in the molar ratio of bidentate to bridging binding types of COO − groups that bind to Ca 2+ was first identified between the two crystal forms by linear IR spectroscopy. This variation is accompanied by greater local structural rigidity of the α-crystal compared to that of the ξ-crystal, as evidenced by a greater residual amplitude in the spectral diffusion dynamics extracted from the time-dependent 2D IR spectroscopy. Vibrational energy transfer between the bidentate and tridentate COO − groups in the α-crystal was found to be faster than that in the ξ-crystal, suggesting shorter intermolecular distances between EXP3174 and sacubitril in the former. These findings provide dynamical structural parameters that help to understand the stability and releasing mechanisms of the drug molecules.},

  abstract = {We analyze motility-induced phase separation and bubbly phase separation in a two-dimensional lattice model of self-propelled particles. We compare systems where the dense (liquid) phase has slab and droplet geometries. We find that interfacial fluctuations of the slab are well-described by capillary wave theory, despite the existence of bubbles in the dense phase. We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize the dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.},

  abstract = {The piezoionic effect holds significant promise for revolutionizing biomedical electronics and ionic skins. However, modeling this multiphysics phenomenon remains challenging due to its high complexity and computational limitations. To address this problem, this study pioneers the application of deep operator networks to effectively model the time-dependent piezoionic effect. By leveraging a data-driven approach, our model significantly reduces computational time compared to traditional finite element analysis (FEA). In particular, we trained a DeepONet using a comprehensive dataset generated through FEA calibrated to experimental data. Through rigorous testing with step responses, slow-changing forces, and dynamic-changing forces, we show that the model captures the intricate temporal dynamics of the piezoionic effect in both the horizontal and vertical planes. This capability offers a powerful tool for real-time analysis of piezoionic phenomena, contributing to simplifying the design of tactile interfaces and potentially complementing existing tactile imaging technologies.},

Here, a photonic structure with a dielectric-MO material planar sandwiched between a dielectric resonator array and a metallic reflector is designed and studied. The results show that near-perfect nonreciprocity can be obtained with an extremely small magnetic excitation on the order of 0.2 T, which could be reached with permanent magnets. Moreover, the physical origin of such a phenomenon and the dependence of the thermal emission performances on the structural dimensions are also studied.

  abstract = {Condensed phase explosives typically contain defects such as voids, bubbles, and pores; this heterogeneity facilitates the formation of hot spots and triggers decomposition reaction at low densities. The study of the thermal decomposition mechanisms of explosives at different densities has thus attracted considerable research interest. Gaining a deeper insight into these mechanisms would be helpful for elucidating the detonation processes of explosives. In this work, we developed an ab initio neural network potential for the FOX-7 system using machine learning method. Extensive large-scale (1008 atoms) and long-duration (nanosecond timescale) deep potential molecular dynamics simulations at different densities were performed to investigate the effect of the density on the thermal decomposition mechanism. The results indicate that the initial reaction pathway of the FOX-7 explosives is the cleavage of the C–NO 2 bond at different densities, while the frequency of C–NO 2 bond cleavage decreases at higher density. Increasing the initial density of FOX-7 significantly increases the reaction rate during the initial decomposition and the formation of final products. However, it leads to a decrease in released heat and has minimal impact on the decomposition temperature. In addition, by analyzing the molecular dynamics trajectories and conducting quantum chemical calculations, we identified two lower-barrier production pathways to produce the CO 2 and N 2 .},

  abstract = {The most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently developed using antisolvent-based fabrication technology. Despite extensive analysis of various aspects of the antisolvent method—such as the type of antisolvent, dropping time, and precursor compatibility—some antisolvents still produce uneven film surface morphology on centimeter-scale substrates. The decoupling of the relationship between local structural characteristics, such as grain boundaries and defects, and the optoelectronic performance of PSCs is currently one of the most highly regarded research issues in the field. In this study, we utilized high-resolution white light interferometry to characterize the morphological distributions of perovskite films from the center to edge, using anisole as an example of the antisolvent. We observed that macro cracks at the center of the film typically exhibit dense ridge morphology, while cracks toward the edges display a concave morphology. We analyze the stress mechanism by using EDS mapping and AFM in detail, attributing this phenomenon to the competitive attachment of 2D islands and boundaries for adatoms, which are influenced by changes in grain size. The devices at different locations were fabricated and their performance analyzed. Our findings indicate that these protruding cracks do not significantly affect the current and voltage of the photovoltaic device; however, concave cracks lead to a decrease in the device fill factor. We attribute this decrease to enhanced carrier recombination at the interface due to this morphology. This study provides valuable insights into the formation of perovskite film morphology under antisolvent treatment and the relationship between film local morphology and PSCs performance.},

  abstract = {The traditional Gouy–Chapman–Stern theory has been effective in explaining the behavior of dilute electrolytes in the electrical double layer but falls short when it comes to describing how ions behave at the metal/electrolyte interface. This is because it overlooks key factors such as the molecular structure of water at the interface and the effects of electron screening in the metal. To address these gaps, we revisit ion adsorption at the metal/electrolyte interface. The approach combines the method of images with a field-theoretic framework for dilute electrolytes and metals described by the Thomas–Fermi model. Nonlocal polarization correlations in water are described by a first-order gradient expansion in the Landau free energy functional. Unlike earlier approaches that relied on the “specular reflection approximation,” our method provides a less constrained way to handle the complex electrostatic boundary conditions at the interface. Analyzing the behavior of a test charge near the interface, an electrostatic energy minimum is found. This minimum depends on the metal’s screening properties and the overall potential drop across the double layer. In addition, the alignment of water dipoles at the interface creates an asymmetry in the energy experienced by positively and negatively charged ions. Finally, we derived an expression for the electrosorption isotherm by describing both the distribution of the electrostatic potential and the lateral interactions between charges along the interface. Our findings highlight how the structure of interfacial water can drive processes such as underpotential deposition by creating favorable electrostatic conditions for ion adsorption.},

The solid state route is adopted to prepare these dilute weight% ( x = 1, 3, and 5) ferrite based composites. The incorporation of ferrite phase improves the interfacial tensile strain and grain boundary volume fraction in the said composite. The incommensurate to commensurate magnetic transition (T N2 ) of YBaCuFeO 5 is shifted to a high temperature by 10 K with the lowest concentration and indistinguishable in higher concentrations due to the magnetic dominance of ferrites. The irreversibility of magnetization due to the field history mostly stems from the uncompensated spins and a competitive interaction among the magnetic phases at the interface. The magnetic isotherms show unusual negative exchange bias phenomena in the said system, and a large room temperature spontaneous exchange bias (∼1 kOe) is achieved with a dilute incorporation x = 5. The exchange bias field and coercive fields (H C ) are, however, contrary to each other with temperature (and concentration) explained with a schematic model on the basis of dominating irreversible spins at high temperatures. In a field of ±50 kOe, the exchange bias field is dropped, while H C is increased, which might be due to the dominance of Zeeman energy over the uniaxial anisotropy. The non-collinear magnetic phase transition of YBaCuFeO 5 at T ≤ 175 K plays a pivotal role in reducing the exchange bias compared to its collinear phase (300 K). Moreover, the extent of this bias field (∼1 kOe) can be considered a useful component in efficient device fabrication.},

We find that the hopping-site energy distributions inferred from the amorphous structures deviate from the Gaussian distribution, especially in their low-energy tails. Mostly for this reason, the effect of disorder on charge-carrier mobility is much weaker than predicted by the lattice/Gaussian models and dependent on system density. The lattice models of electron–hole recombination in disordered systems, which assume a Gaussian site energy distribution, are found to be more accurate than those of charge-carrier transport. This is explained by the strong Coulomb trapping of electron–hole pairs before recombination, which makes the role of hopping-site energy disorder less significant.},

Validation of this relation was structured at different levels, taking into account various ingredients as the apolar–polar character, macromolecular structure, the presence of hydrogen bonds, or complex structure and dynamics. The results reclaim the suitability of dielectric spectroscopy to echo the primary structural relaxation of glass-forming systems, demonstrating that the dielectric response effectively captures the structural relaxation by reliably correlating with entropy fluctuations. The correlation with entropy fluctuations holds even when the dielectric strength of the systems is high and the dielectric response is narrow and dominated by cross correlations, proving that dipolar intermolecular interactions are fundamental to the structural relaxation and not a particularity of the dielectric probe. This one-to-one correspondence between structural and dielectric α relaxation does not support the existence of a generic spectral shape for the primary structural relaxation valid for all kinds of susceptibility functions.},

We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant ɛ 0 with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in ɛ 0 is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in ɛ 0 , our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor G K with increasing pressure. This decrease in G K is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.},

The effect of the central ring on the overall network topology is analyzed in terms of both topological and geometric distances. For larger central rings, the first topological shell becomes exclusively populated by four- and five-membered rings, which leads to an effective upper limit on the size of the central ring that can effectively be accommodated. The topological shells are found to show ordering at significant distances away from the central ring. The effective correlation lengths are determined as a function of both central ring size and level of network disorder, which allows for an understanding of the potential density of large rings that may be accommodated.},

  abstract = {Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are environmentally friendly green solvents and hold great promise in the pharmaceutical industry. The secondary structure of a protein, lysozyme, follows a non-monotonous behavior in aqueous glyceline (choline chloride + glycerol) as the wt. % of water is increased. However, it is unclear how the hydration affects the stability of the protein in a non-linear way. In this work, we have performed all-atom molecular dynamic simulations for 1 μ s with the lysozyme protein in an aqueous glyceline deep eutectic solvent (DES) by varying the wt. % of water. The simulated radius of gyration, R g , values can qualitatively reproduce the protein behavior such that the R g increases initially with an increase in wt. % of water, reaches the peak at 40 wt. %, and then gradually decreases with dilution. Several other properties, including root mean square deviation, root-mean square fluctuation, secondary structure of the protein, and solvent accessible surface area, are examined to explore the NADES effect on the protein structure. Next, we analyze the hydrogen bond profile of intra-protein and among various interspecies, e.g., protein–DES, DES–DES, protein–water, and water–water. The variation in protein–protein hydrogen bonds with concentrations can qualitatively explain the non-linear conformational dependence of the protein. The radial distribution function analyses show various microscopic structures formed due to the DES and water interaction, which play a critical role in protein behavior. This study indicates that at lower wt. % of water, the protein is constrained in a strong hydrogen bond network formed by glycerol and water molecules, resulting in a lower R g . As the wt. % of water increases, the protein–water interaction drives the protein to expand, reflecting an increasing R g . At sufficiently higher wt. % of water, the DES constituent and the water molecules interact strongly with the protein, resulting in a decrease in R g . Overall, the investigation offers a microscopic insight into the protein conformation in DES.},

The model provides unique access to both local and global properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure pseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging fluctuations under shear. Crucially, the dynamics are dominated by a small population of bonds that are locally unstable, which give rise to quasi-localized, low-frequency vibrational modes and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a correction to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche statistics based on diverging length fluctuations. Our model combines a coarse-grained view with a continuous, real-space implementation, providing novel insights to a wide class of amorphous solids.},

  abstract = {The lack of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration has long hindered a comprehensive atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties. The Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) approach, which involves diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of potential energy in instantaneous liquid configurations, has emerged as a promising framework in this direction. However, several conceptual challenges remain, particularly related to the approach’s inability to capture anharmonic effects. In this study, we present a set of “experimental facts” through a comprehensive INM analysis of simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N 2 , CS 2 , Ga, and Pb, across a wide temperature range from the solid to gas phase. First, we examine the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the DOS obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. We then analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS in search of potential universal behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between INMs and other properties of liquids, including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. In addition, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperatures as the system approaches the solid phase, revealing a significant fraction of unstable modes even in crystalline solids. Finally, we confirm the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and uncover its complex temperature-dependent behavior, challenging current theoretical models.},

To understand this unusual feature, we have measured the responses to high amplitude ac and dc electric fields at the fundamental frequency. The static limits of these results are entered into a model aimed at reproducing nonlinear dielectric susceptibility spectra using the concept of a fictive electric field. This model reproduces the “hump” in the third-harmonic response and its seeming disappearance. It is revealed that the “hump” is predominantly the result of reduced time constants, a consequence of the energy the sample absorbs from the electric field. At elevated temperatures, the “hump” only appears to vanish because its reduced amplitude submerges below the extraordinarily high level of polarization saturation of this liquid.},

  abstract = {This study delves into the fragmentation mechanisms of the oxazolone form (OXA) of protonated cyclo-di-glycine using chemical dynamics simulations at multiple internal energies. While we focus our in-depth analyses on a representative total energy of 178 kcal/mol, we also performed simulations over the 127–187 kcal/mol range. This broader energy sampling reveals how the population of states evolves with increasing internal energy, enabling us to compute rate constants and then effective energy thresholds using a previously introduced three-state model [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. By transforming molecular geometries into graph representations, we systematically analyze fragmentation processes and identify key intermediates and ion–molecule complexes (IMCs) that play a crucial role in fragmentation dynamics. The study highlights the distinct isomerization landscapes of OXA, driven by IMC formation, which contrasts with the previously reported behavior of cyclic and linear forms [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. The resulting fragmentation channels are characterized by their unique energetic thresholds and branching ratios and can provide a molecular explanation of what was observed experimentally. Thanks to an accurate analysis of the trajectories using our graph-theory-based tools, it was possible to point out the particular behavior of OXA fragmentation, which is different from other isomers. In particular, the important role of IMCs is shown, which has an impact on populating different isomeric structures.},

Eight rotationally resolved excitation spectra were observed in 17 800–23 650 cm −1 , allowing the determination of the vibrational frequencies and rotational constants for the ground and five highly excited electronic states. Six low-energy Ω states below 3500 cm −1 were identified from the SVL emission spectra and assigned to six spin–orbit components of the X 3 Σ − and A 3 Π electronic states. Furthermore, high-level ab initio calculations were performed on numerous Λ − S and Ω electronic states to support the assignments from the experimental observations. The spectral results elucidate the bonding characteristics of PdO and provide support for verifying the significant relativistic effect on the bonding of PtO.},

The AIMD simulations visually demonstrate that CO 2 3 + undergoes several bending vibrations in ∼50–480 fs, and in the final dissociation stages, the electron density distribution in three-dimensional space migrates from the O ion to the C ion, while the bond strength rapidly decreases to 0, resulting in bond breaking assisted by the asymmetric stretching vibrations. The measured kinetic energy releases are in general agreement with AIMD simulations, and the deduced amount of energy transfer into the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom of CO 2+ is about 3 eV less than that estimated by the Coulomb potential.},

The first key step is the expansion of a database of accurate semi-experimental equilibrium structures with additional molecular geometries optimized by version 2 of the Pisa composite scheme. Then, the templating synthon approach is used to improve the accuracy of structures optimized by a hybrid density functional paired with a double zeta basis set, leveraging chemical similarity to cluster different molecular environments and refine bond lengths and valence angles. A set of prototypical biomolecular building blocks is used to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve spectroscopic accuracy for molecular systems too large to be treated by state-of-the-art composite wavefunction methods. In addition, a freely accessible web-based tool has been developed to facilitate the post-processing of geometries optimized using standard electronic structure codes, thereby providing an accurate and efficient tool for the computational study of medium- to large-sized molecules, also accessible to experiment-oriented researchers.},

In particular, the C s ( A ′ 2 ) stationary points are now global minima for the latter pair of radical cations, and C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) represents the transition state. Attempts are being made to understand such inconsistent findings via a combination of JT and epikernel principles. The barriers between equivalent C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) global minimum structures for C H 4 + are found to be low, and thus C H 4 + undergoes rapid interconversion along cyclic exchange of three hydrogen atoms via C s transition state. The general features of the ground state PESs of SiH 4 + and GeH 4 + are similar.

Such data are important ingredients in the modeling of non-local thermal equilibrium conditions that characterize the atmosphere, media of astronomical interest, and cold and hot plasmas, where O( 1 D), also formed when O 2 molecules break, represents a significant fraction of the gas mixture. To this end, we developed analytical potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the 1 Π and 1 Δ electronic states of the N 2 –O( 1 D) system to accurately describe the interaction in the long, medium, and first repulsive range of intermolecular distances, the most effective regions in inelastic collisions under a variety of conditions of interest. The derived PESs are used to calculate the vibration-to-translation (V–T) and vibration-to-electronic (V–E) energy transfer rates by mixed quantum–classical dynamics and by the Landau–Zener formulation, respectively. In addition, the datasets are extended to cover the entire N 2 vibrational ladder by using the Gaussian process regression. The results show that at low temperatures, where V–E relaxation dominates, N 2 vibrational quenching by O( 1 D) collisions is faster than by O( 3 P) collisions.},

While charged closed-shell transition metal complexes aggregating spontaneously to form oligomers has long been observed experimentally, the interpretation of the nature of so-called metallophilicity is still ongoing. For the dimer [(2,2′-bpy) 2 Ag] 2 2+ , qualitative electrostatic potential, non-covalent interaction, atoms-in-molecules analyses, and quantitative energy decomposition analysis calculations indicate that the electrostatic repulsion between two like formal charges at silver centers can be overcome by long-range dispersion attraction and short-range electronic correlation from ligands. In addition, delocalizing the net charges on silvers over the whole ligands can decrease electrostatic repulsion of metal centers to stabilize oligomers. The vital role of the screening effect of solvent has also been realized in the bound binding of the title system. Overall, this research highlights the importance of ligand stacking to argentophilicity, while d 10 –d 10 attraction of silver centers presents quite little contribution.},

We show that vicinal hyperconjugation between the orbitals in the C–H bonds and in the oxygen atom is responsible for this puzzling conformational preference. The transition state for the rotation yields an ≈ 0.6 kcal/mol rotational barrier, which matches the thermal energy at room conditions and, therefore, renders the O–H bond a free rotor.

Herein, we subjected these bent PBI derivatives to theoretical calculations and time-resolved spectroscopy. The current study has offered rational explanations for several unique photophysical characteristics of bent PBIs: (1) the redshifts of the S 0 –S 1 transitions, (2) the decrease in extinction coefficients, (3) the broadening of spectral shapes, and (4) the suppression of nonradiative decay processes.

The binary cluster features a linear B 3 chain along its C 3 axis, as well as three lateral Zn–Zn dimers, in which a central B atom is sandwiched by two quasi-planar BZn 3 units in an eclipsed form. Chemical bonding analyses show that the B 3 chain motif has Lewis-type B–B σ single bonds and a pair of orthogonal three-center two-electron (3c-2e) π bonds, collectively leading to a B–B bond order of two. Stabilizing a boron single chain is scarce in the literature, as is observing a series of double B=B bonds in a monoatomic chain fashion. The triangular pyramid BZn 3 units are each in a unique triplet σ 2 σ* 1 σ* 1 configuration, thus rendering σ aromaticity to the cluster according to the reversed 4 n Hückel rule. It is proposed that the alloy cluster can be rationalized using the concept of electronic transmutation, wherein a close chemical analogy to the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) molecule is established.},

  abstract = {Metal-doped silicon clusters have been extensively studied due to their promising applications in the semiconductor industry and microelectronics. In this study, indium-doped silicon clusters (InSi n −/0 , n = 3–11) were investigated using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations. It is found that InSi n − anions exhibit geometrical and electronic structures resembling their Si n+1 counterparts, with the substitution of one silicon atom by an indium atom leading to exohedral doping and multiple coordination characteristics. The exohedral configuration is attributed to a weak In–Si bond and the limited atomic valence of indium, while the multiple coordination arises from the joint contributions of three orthogonal 5 p orbitals of indium atom. Electronic structure similarities between InSi n − anions and Si n+1 clusters are confirmed by their identical valence molecular orbitals. The valence p -type orbitals of InSi n − primarily contribute to chemical bonding, whereas the valence s -type orbitals predominantly hold electron lone pairs, as demonstrated by the electron localization function and localized molecular orbital analysis. These results provide insights into the structural and electronic properties of indium-doped silicon clusters.},

  abstract = {Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flips, and magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange–correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn–Sham (KS) and generalized KS (GKS) orbitals, the KS potentials, and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze seven standard exchange–correlation functionals and find two main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, as well as the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential, when using the optimized effective potential method within the KS scheme. When calculations are performed using the GKS approach, no jumps are observed, as expected. Moreover, we demonstrate that for high-spin systems, a full three-dimensional treatment is crucial; the spherical approximation commonly used in atoms causes a qualitative deviation. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.},

The porphyrins contain central elements from three distinct groups in the Periodic Table with different oxidation states, types, and numbers of axial ligands, as well as different peripheral substituents on the porphyrin ring. Shortly after photoexcitation, in all cases, the primary multiplet polarization of the porphyrin triplet state evolves into long-lived net polarization whose lifetime is determined by the lifetime of the triplet state. The zero-field splitting parameters and sign of the multiplet polarization vary significantly among the porphyrins, but the transient EPR spectra taken at later times are remarkably similar. The development of long-lived net polarization is proposed to involve the dynamic Jahn–Teller effect, in which hopping between the two lowest triplet states occurs.},

Recently, the pursuit of this goal has been aided by machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which provide energies and forces at quantum mechanical accuracy but at a fraction of the cost of the reference quantum mechanical calculations. Assembling the training set of relevant configurations is key to building the MLIP. Here, we demonstrate two approaches to training reactive MLIPs based on reaction pathway information. One approach exploits reaction datasets containing reactant, product, and transition state structures. Using an S N 2 reaction dataset, we accurately locate reaction pathways and transition state geometries of up to 170 unseen reactions. In another approach, which does not depend on data availability, we present an efficient active learning procedure that yields an accurate MLIP and converged minimum energy path given only the reaction end point structures, avoiding quantum mechanics driven reaction pathway search at any stage of training set construction. We demonstrate this procedure on an S N 2 reaction in the gas phase and with a small number of solvating water molecules, predicting reaction barriers within 20 meV of the reference quantum chemistry method. We then apply the active learning procedure on a more complex reaction involving a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and proton transfer, comparing the results against the reactive ReaxFF force field. Our active learning procedure, in addition to rapidly finding reaction paths for individual reactions, provides an approach to building large reaction path databases for training transferable reactive machine learning potentials.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is now a widely used tool in molecular science. Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: neural spline flows, conditional flow matching, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) neural spline flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) conditional flow matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) denoising diffusion probabilistic models appear the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib 9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.},

Modern machine-learning (ML) potentials provide the most precise representation compared to electronic structure calculations, while traditional potentials provide a less precise but computationally much faster representation and, thus, allow simulations of larger systems. We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential into a multi-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with an optimum of performance and precision in large, complex atomistic systems. The required precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and updated automatically during simulation. We use copper as demonstrator material with an embedded atom model as classical force field and an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as ML potential, but, in principle, a broader class of potential combinations can be coupled by this method. The approach is developed for the molecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent problems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed adaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces with a precision of 10 me V/Å and the ACE-energy exactly for the precisely calculated atoms in a nanoindentation of 4 × 10 6 atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a speedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.},

While significant effort has been made in this field over the last decade, data-driven approaches generally rely on the paradigm of imposing a fixed base of library functions. In order to promote sparsity, finding the optimal set of basis functions is a necessary condition but a challenging task to guess in advance. Here, we propose an alternative approach that consists of optimizing the very library of functions while imposing sparsity. The robustness of our results is not only evaluated by the quality of the fit of the discovered model but also by the statistical distribution of the residuals with respect to the original noise in the data. In order to avoid choosing one metric over the other, we would rather rely on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for systematically generating a subset of optimal models sorted in a Pareto front. We illustrate how this method can be used as a tool to derive microkinetic equations from experimental data.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is finding increasingly more applications in quantum chemistry, particularly to simulate electronic structure and molecular properties of simple systems. The transformation of a molecular Hamiltonian from the fermionic space to the qubit space results in a series of Pauli strings. Calculating the energy then involves evaluating the expectation values of each of these strings, which presents a significant bottleneck for applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) in quantum chemistry. Unlike fermionic Hamiltonians, the terms in a qubit Hamiltonian are additive. This work leverages this property to introduce a novel method for extracting information from the partial qubit Hamiltonian, thereby enhancing the efficiency of VQEs. This work introduces the SHARC-VQE (Simplified Hamiltonian Approximation, Refinement, and Correction-VQE) method, where the full molecular Hamiltonian is partitioned into two parts based on the ease of quantum execution. The easy-to-execute part constitutes the partial Hamiltonian, and the remaining part, while more complex to execute, is generally less significant. The latter is approximated by a refined operator and added up as a correction into the partial Hamiltonian. SHARC-VQE significantly reduces computational costs for molecular simulations. The cost of a single energy measurement can be reduced from O ( N 4 ϵ 2 ) to O ( 1 ϵ 2 ) for a system of N qubits and accuracy ϵ , while the overall cost of VQE can be reduced from O ( N 7 ϵ 2 ) to O ( N 3 ϵ 2 ) ⁠ . Furthermore, measurement outcomes using SHARC-VQE are less prone to errors induced by noise from quantum circuits, reducing the errors from 20%–40% to 5%–10% without any additional error correction or mitigation technique. In addition, the SHARC-VQE is demonstrated as an initialization technique, where the simplified partial Hamiltonian is used to identify an optimal starting point for a complex problem. Overall, this method improves the efficiency of VQEs and enhances the accuracy and reliability of quantum simulations by mitigating noise and overcoming computational challenges.},

From the theoretical perspective, the energy landscape theory from protein folding inspired the development of the minimal chromatin model (MiChroM). In this work, two biologically relevant MiChroM energy terms were minimized under different conditions, revealing a competition between loci compartmentalization and motor-driven activity mechanisms in chromatin folding. Enhancing the motor activity energy baseline increased the lengthwise compaction and reduced the polymer entanglement. Concomitantly, decreasing compartmentalization-related interactions reduced the overall polymer collapse, although compartmentalization given by the microphase separation remained almost intact. For multiple chromosome simulations, increased motorization intensified the territory formation of the different chains and reduced compartmentalization strength lowered the probability of contact formation of different loci between multiple chains, approximating to the experimental inter-contacts of the human chromosomes. These findings have direct implications for experimental data-driven chromosome modeling, specially those involving multiple chromosomes. The interplay between phase-separation and territory formation mechanisms should be properly implemented in order to recover the genome architecture and dynamics, features that might play critical roles in regulating nuclear functions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of complex biomolecules requires simplified models that not only make computations feasible but also reveal fundamental mechanisms. Coarse-graining (CG) achieves this by grouping atoms into beads, whose stochastic dynamics can be derived using the Mori–Zwanzig formalism, capturing both reversible and irreversible interactions. In liquid, the dissipative bead–bead interactions have so far been restricted to hydrodynamic couplings. However, friction does not only arise from the solvent but, notably, from the internal degrees of freedom missing in the CG beads. This leads to an additional “internal friction” whose relevance is studied in this contribution. By comparing with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), we neatly show that in order to accurately reproduce the dynamics of a globular protein in water using a CG model, not only a precise determination of elastic couplings and the Stokesian self-friction of each bead is required. Critically, the inclusion of internal friction between beads is also necessary for a faithful representation of protein dynamics. We propose to optimize the parameters of the CG model through a self-averaging method that integrates the CG dynamics with an evolution equation for the CG parameters. This approach ensures that selected quantities, such as the radial distribution function and the time correlation of bead velocities, match the corresponding MD values.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy experiments have examined photoprotective mechanisms in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex, showing that exciton transfer pathways change significantly depending on the environmental redox conditions. Higgins et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 118 (11), e2018240118 (2021)] have theoretically linked these observations to changes in a quantum vibronic coupling, whereby onsite energies are altered under oxidizing conditions such that exciton energy gaps are detuned from a specific vibrational motion of the bacteriochlorophyll a . These arguments rely on an analysis of exciton transfer rates within Redfield theory, which is known to provide an inaccurate description of the influence of the vibrational environment on the exciton dynamics in the FMO complex. Here, we use a memory kernel formulation of the hierarchical equations of motion to obtain non-perturbative estimations of exciton transfer rates, which yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate that onsite energy shifts alone do not reproduce the reported rate changes in the oxidative environment. We systematically examine a model that includes combined changes in both site energies and the frequency of a local vibration in the oxidized complex while maintaining consistency with absorption spectra and achieving qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the measured changes in transfer rates. Our analysis points to potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian, which was originally derived by fitting spectra to perturbative theories. Overall, our work suggests that further experimental and theoretical analyses may be needed to understand the variations of exciton dynamics under different redox conditions.},

  abstract = {In light of the recent discrepancies reported between fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo and local natural orbital coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large molecular systems [Al-Hamdani et al. , Nat. Commun. 12 , 3927 (2021)], the applicability of CCSD(T) is assessed using a model framework. The use of the semi-empirical π -space only Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) model for studying large molecules is critically examined and is shown to recover both bandgap closure as system size increases and long range dispersive behavior of r −6 with increasing separation between monomers. Since bandgap closure in systems with long-range Coulomb interactions is problematic for perturbative methods, such as CCSD(T), this model, therefore, serves as a testing ground for such methods, enabling them to be benchmarked with high-order CC methods, which are not possible with ab initio Hamiltonians. Using the PPP model, coupled cluster methodologies, CCSDTQ and CCSDT(Q), are then used to benchmark CCSDT and CCSD(T) methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large one- and two-dimensional molecular systems up to the dibenzocoronene dimer. We show that CCSD(T) demonstrates no signs of overestimating the interaction energy for these systems. Furthermore, by examining the Hartree–Fock HOMO–LUMO gap of these large molecules, the perturbative treatment of the triples contribution in CCSD(T) is not expected to cause problems for accurately capturing the interaction energy for system sizes up to at least circumcoronene.},

  abstract = {The calculation of the coherent nonlinear response of a system is essential to correctly interpret results from advanced techniques such as two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a δ -function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for the exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. In addition, we present simulation results that replicate previously reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signals, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneities.},

Unlike diffusion-driven approaches, our method directly enforces mass removal at the fluid interface in a reaction-limited manner while maintaining numerical stability. Using the inherent color-gradient magnitude and a single adjustable parameter, evaporation sites are chosen in a computationally efficient way with seamless mass exchange between the components, with no change to the core algorithm. Extensive validation across diverse interface geometries and evaporation flux magnitudes demonstrates high accuracy, with errors below 5% for unit density ratios. For density contrasts, the method remains robust in the limit of smaller evaporation flux magnitudes and density ratios. Our approach extends the applicability of the color-gradient LB model to scenarios involving reaction-limited evaporation, such as droplet evaporation on heated substrates, vacuum evaporation of molten metals, and drying processes in porous media.},

  abstract = {Understanding the state space structure of complex quantum systems can help to effectively characterize the system properties and explore underlying mechanisms. The structure of the state space could be quite complicated for quantum many-body systems, and the systematic decomposition of the state space is normally involved. Recently, a modular tensor diagram approach was proposed to reorganize the state space hierarchically based on a modular basis. Here, we review the construction of spin eigenfunctions for multiple exciton systems and further develop modular tensor diagrams to exemplify the hierarchical symmetry of the state space. The newly constructed spin eigenfunctions for quadruple excitons, along with the results for triple excitons, are used to demonstrate the effective decomposition of the state space into hierarchical tensorial structures. A universal recursive relation is derived to determine the coefficients of spin eigenfunctions exhibiting transformation symmetry between different classes of elementary modules for an arbitrary number of exciton units. Interestingly, different coupling schemes mapped to quantum many-body interactions lead to different spin adapted basis states, which may correspond to different realistic systems upon the breakdown of spin degeneracy. This work highlights the hierarchical symmetry of the tensorial structure of quantum many-body systems, which may facilitate a better understanding of the structure property relationship toward the object-oriented materials design.},

Femtosecond time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy was employed to study the molecular dynamics of N 2 and O 2 in air at room temperature. To reveal hidden spectral features, we have for the first time applied an analytical method that balances time resolution and frequency resolution, namely, the superlet transform (SLT), to perform time-frequency resolved spectral analysis of the complex molecular dynamics of N 2 and O 2 in air. A distinct evolution of the partial rotational modes of N 2 and O 2 outside the selective excitation region was observed, which is related to energy transfer collisions between N 2 and O 2 molecules during the rotational energy relaxation process in air. The SLT results accord well with the S-branch rotational spectra of N 2 and O 2 obtained from theoretical calculations, confirming the validity of SLT analysis. This method provides a valuable experimental analysis technique to deepen the understanding of the microscopic dynamic processes in molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be surmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling (going from exponential to possibly a very high-ordered polynomial) and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for the path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This technique can be used for simulation of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium correlation functions and is demonstrated here using examples from both. We show that the cost becomes constant with the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators, which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be instrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for very large systems.},

An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated.

  abstract = {Solvation free energy is a driving force that plays an important role in the stability of biomolecular conformations. Currently, the implicit solvent model is widely used to calculate solvation energies of biomolecules such as proteins. However, for proteins, the implicit solvent calculation does not provide much detailed information since a protein is highly inhomogeneous on its surface. In this study, we develop an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which allows us to investigate detailed site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, including the role of counter ions and intra-protein interactions. This approach facilitates the analysis of specific residue interactions with solvent molecules, extending the understanding of protein solubility to the energetic impacts of site-specific residue–solvent interactions. Our study showed that specific residue–solvent interactions are strongly influenced by the electrostatic environment created by its nearby residues, especially charged residues. In particular, charged residues on the protein surface are mainly responsible for the heterogeneity of the electrostatic environment of the protein surface, and they significantly affect the local distribution of water. In addition, counter ions change the local electrostatic environment and alter specific residue–water interactions. Neutral residues also interact with water, with polar residues being more prominent than nonpolar ones but contributing less to solvation energy than charged residues. This study illustrates an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which gives residue-specific contributions to protein solvation and provides detailed information on site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity.},

These modifications give a continuous “modified” action over the whole energy range. The multidimensional versions of the mVPT2 and mYF theories have been applied to the collinear H + H 2 and D + H 2 reactions to calculate thermal reaction rates. The results show that the rates computed using the mVPT2 theory are marginally better than those computed by the mYF theory. The corresponding kinetic isotopic effects have also been computed. Both the theories account for the correct ℏ 2 limit at high temperature and not the parabolic barrier limit as in various other theories. The mVPT2 and mYF theories also improve upon the thermal rates in the low temperature limit due to the shifting of the action by the zero point energy shift E 0 . The resulting theory is more accurate than the ring polymer molecular dynamics based approximation over the whole temperature range probed. The results presented here indicate that the multidimensional version of the modified VPT2 theory may be the recommended method for computing thermal tunneling rates in multidimensional systems.},

However, the chemical diversity of these materials presents a vast screening space, making it challenging to efficiently identify high-performance materials solely through theoretical calculations or experiments. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a multidimensional high-throughput screening strategy that combines machine learning with first-principles calculations, specifically designed to identify MHIPs with optimal bandgap and light absorption properties. The bandgap and light absorption models have achieved determination coefficients (r 2 ) of 0.9896 and 0.9833, with root mean square errors of 0.1890 eV and 0.2190 10 5 eV · cm −1 , respectively, demonstrating the high precision and reliability of the models. In the present work, the generation of 306 521 candidate materials through mixed B-site elements is reported, leading to the successful identification of 295 materials with ideal characteristics for MHIPs via screening. Subsequently, an in-depth density functional theory validation is conducted on 20 of these materials. The research results demonstrate that Cs 2 AgBi 0.5 Sb 0.25 Ir 0.25 I 6 and CsSn 0.75 Ge 0.25 I 3 exhibit outstanding performance, making them the most promising candidate materials for practical applications.

Building an understanding of how hydrated electrons behave in solution has been a long-standing effort of simulation methods, of which density functional theory (DFT) has come to the fore in recent years. The ability of DFT to model the reactive chemistry of hydrated electrons is an attractive advantage over semi-classical methodologies; however, relatively few density functional approximations (DFAs) have been used for the hydrated electron simulations presented in the literature. Here, we simulate hydrated electron systems using a series of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals spanning Jacob’s ladder. We calculate a variety of experimental and other observables of the hydrated electron and compare the XC functional dependence for each quantity. We find that the formation of a stable localized hydrated electron is not necessarily limited to hybrid XC functionals and that some hybrid functionals produce delocalized hydrated electrons or electrons that react with the surrounding water at an unphysically fast rate. We further characterize how different DFAs impact the solvent structure and predicted spectroscopy of the hydrated electron, considering several methods for calculating the hydrated electron’s absorption spectrum for the best comparison between structures generated using different density functionals. None of the dozen or so DFAs that we investigated are able to correctly predict the hydrated electron’s spectroscopy, vertical detachment energy, or molar solvation volume.},

However, the effects of proton uptake or release of histone ionizable groups on nucleosome–partner protein interactions and higher-order chromatin structures remain largely unexplored. Here, we conducted comprehensive analyses of histone titratable residue pKa values in various nucleosome contexts, utilizing 96 experimentally determined complex structures. We revealed that pH-induced changes in histone residue protonation states modulated nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and significantly influenced nucleosome–partner protein interactions. Furthermore, we observed that proton uptake or release often accompanied nucleosome–partner protein interactions, facilitating their binding processes. In addition, our findings suggest that alterations in histone protonation can also regulate nucleosome self-association, thereby modulating the organization and dynamics of higher-order chromatin structure.

  abstract = {The benchmark theory of hydration forces that relies on the phenomenological expressions developed by Marčelja and Radić (MR) has recently been revived by experimental, computational, and theoretical advances. Here, we consider the effect of surface polarization on electrolytes in a slab geometry by combining the MR approach to polarization with Poisson–Boltzmann theory. Due to the coupling of bulk and surface fields, not only is the electrostatics modified by polarization, but maybe even more importantly, vice versa: a finite polarization at the wall is sufficient to generate a finite electrostatic potential even in the absence of net charges on the wall. We determine the polarization and electrostatic potential profiles and the free energy of the system. Our results show that the presence of surface polarization alone suffices to imprint the bulk structural properties on the electrostatic field in an electrolyte.},

  abstract = {The instant crystallization of semi-crystalline polymers has become possible following the recent advances in Fast Scanning Calorimetry (FSC) and enables us to make a bridge between the time scale available experimentally with those accessible with computer simulations. Although the FSC observations have provided new information on the crystallization kinetics and evolution of the crystals, the molecular details on the chain exchange events between the ordered and disordered domains of crystals have remained elusive. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the detailed chain dynamics and thermodynamics of polyamide 6 (PA6) system under two heating treatments: (i) quenching PA6 melt deeply below the melting temperature T m and (ii) annealing the resulting quenched system to a temperature close to T m . We categorized the chains into mobile amorphous fraction (MAF) and rigid amorphous fraction (RAF), based on the length of consecutive chain’s bond angles in the trans state. In the deep quenched system close to the glass transition temperature T g , the mobility of the MAF chains is strongly suppressed and they remain in the glassy state. However, upon rising the temperature close to melting temperature, the system undergoes recrystallization, leading to the coexistence of RAF and supercooled liquid MAF chains. The highly mobile unentangled MAF chains explore the interphase domains, and during the late-stage of crystallization, they are thermally translocated into the lamella by reducing the fold number of RAF chains. The chain mobility in the annealed system could potentially lead to improved biodegradation in semi-crystalline chains.},

  abstract = {We present a mechanistic study of hole spin dynamics in colloidal cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanosheets, aiming to gain insights into the elusive interplay between two counteracting surface effects, i.e., hole-trapping interaction [between the valence-band heavy-hole (HH) state and its nearby localized surface trap (LST) state] vs spin-exchange interaction [between the HH spin state and the surface dangling-bond spin (DBS) state]. Differently from our previous work adopting a strategy of ligand engineering [see Wu et al. , Adv. Opt. Mater. 12 , 2400583 (2024)], we here implement an alternative strategy of element doping to regulate the LST and DBS states in the Ag + -doped CdSe nanosystem. It is observed that the hole spin-flip lifetime is shortened when the Ag + -doping level is elevated, demonstrating that the hole–DBS exchange interaction can effectively compete against the coexisting hole–LST trapping interaction, mainly due to the doping-induced increase in the density of the DBS state. Markedly, this observation is contrary to that in the ligand-engineering case, where the hole-trapping interaction plays a predominant role due to the strong ligand/CdSe orbital hybridization. This work elucidates the interplay between the two surface effects and enriches the understanding about the subtle DBS-related effect, providing valuable mechanistic information for rational design and optimization of spintronic applications based on colloidal nanostructures.},

  abstract = {The release of Ag + ions into the environment through silica layers is a promising strategy for the development of anti-microbial surface coating devices. The aim of the present study is to provide some insight into the elementary mechanisms of diffusion of Ag + ions through silica with the objective of proposing control strategies. Thanks to the development of interaction potentials based on neural networks, the diffusion processes were studied via molecular dynamics simulations. Silver diffusion was found to be anomalous and sub-diffusive, the origin of which could be attributed to deceleration and temporal anti-correlations. This sub-diffusion has been attributed primarily to the disordered nature of the silica matrix. Furthermore, it is magnified by the presence of coordination defects within the silica matrix. These defects, in particular the under-coordinated oxygen atoms, act as traps for Ag + by forming O–Ag bonds, thereby limiting the jump length and retaining the ion for long duration. By comparison with existing diffusion models, the diffusion mechanism in the absence of defects appears to be of the fractional Brownian motion type, substantially modified by the presence of defects. Two possible approaches have emerged to tune the release of Ag + ions through the silica layer: the monitoring of the number of defects and the opening/closing of diffusion paths via, e.g., a modification of the silica density.},

  abstract = {Calcium, one of the most abundant elements in the Earth’s mantle, does not react easily with noble gases (e.g., He and Xe) under ambient conditions. However, high pressure can alter electron configurations in atoms, leading to the formation of unconventional compounds. In this study, we systematically investigate Ca–Xe compounds across pressures of 0–150 GPa using calypso structure prediction methods combined with first-principles calculations. We identify four novel Ca–Xe compounds P m 3 ̄ m -CaXe, P 4/ mmm -CaXe 2 , I 4/ m -Ca 3 Xe, and P 4/ mmm -Ca 2 Xe 3 that demonstrate stability over a wide pressure range from 37.5 to 150 GPa. All these compounds exhibit metallic properties and are dynamically stable, as indicated by the absence of imaginary frequencies in their phonon dispersion spectra. Ionic bonding between Ca and Xe is observed due to electron transfer from Ca to Xe. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that P m 3 ̄ m -CaXe, P 4/ mmm -CaXe 2 , and P 4/ mmm -Ca 2 Xe 3 remain solid up to pressures of 135 GPa and temperatures of 4000 K. In contrast, I 4/ m -Ca 3 Xe undergoes a transition from solid to liquid at temperatures above 3500 K due to weakened Ca–Xe bonds. The findings suggest that these Ca–Xe compounds could potentially be synthesized experimentally under high-pressure conditions. The results offer theoretical guidance for discovering new high-pressure Xe compounds and provide valuable insights into Xe chemistry.},

  abstract = {In this work, the high-temperature and high-pressure ferroelectric, structural, and electrical transport properties for CuInP 2 Se 6 upon compression and decompression under different hydrostatic environments were comprehensively studied via Raman spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. Upon non-hydrostatic pressurization, CuInP 2 Se 6 experienced two successive phase transitions at 5.4 and 14.1 GPa originating from the rapid compression of van der Waals gaps and the local structure variation of Se–P–Se bonds, followed by a metallization at 25.1 GPa. Furthermore, a ∼2.0 GPa pressure hysteresis was detected for the emergence of electronic transformation in CuInP 2 Se 6 under hydrostatic conditions owing to the influence of hydrostaticity. Upon decompression, the phase transition of CuInP 2 Se 6 was demonstrated to be reversible with considerable pressure hysteresis under different hydrostatic environments. In addition, the positive sinusoidal voltage-dependent electrical current relations with the nonlinearity factors of ∼1.0 manifested the Ohmic response of CuInP 2 Se 6 under high pressure conditions. Meantime, the disappearance of the P 1 Raman peak and the discontinuities in Raman shifts and full width at half-maximums offered robust evidence on the occurrence of ferroelectric crossover in CuInP 2 Se 6 . It is the first time that the phase boundary from the mixed antiferroelectric and ferroelectric (FE) orderings into the FE state of CuInP 2 Se 6 is well established [i.e., T C (K) = 165.5 P (GPa) + 292.1] under the conditions of 298–873 K and 0.4–40.3 GPa.

  abstract = {The ladder-type population transfer of the HF molecule steered by four-color harmonic laser pulses (HLPs) is investigated using the time-dependent quantum wave packet method. It is found that although there exist large background excitations and many (resonant) transition pathways during the driving, nearly 100% of the population could be transferred to the target state. In particular, such a process could be coherently controlled by changing the phases of the four HLPs, especially the phases of the fundamental and second HLPs, which can be accounted for in large part by the combined effects of the corresponding transition pathways and the maximal amplitude of the total electric field. However, for manipulating the phases of the third and fourth HLPs, both the changes in the maximal electric field amplitude and the asymmetry size fail to guide the variation of the target-state population because of the correlated effects of all these transition pathways, particularly the ones that do not contain the third and fourth HLP excitations. Importantly, our results also denote that the variation of the maximal electric field amplitude may give a well qualitative prediction about the phase-controlled population when the manipulated phase is directly related to all the transition pathways, which is the general case in the widely used two-color scheme. In addition, the maximal amplitude of the total electric field tends to play a more important role than its asymmetry size in the phase-controlled population transfer process.},

  abstract = {Manganese is one of the most intriguing elements showing multiple magnetic phases. In order to shed some light on the complex behavior, the manganese dimer has been the focus of extensive interest in theoretical research. Various quantum techniques have been utilized to comprehend the characteristics of the Mn dimer. Several approaches and functionals have been employed that suggest that the ferromagnetic (FM) state is its lowest energy configuration. Nevertheless, these findings are inconsistent with the experimental results showing that Mn 2 has an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Σ g + 1 configuration at an interatomic Mn–Mn distance of d Mn–Mn = 3.40 Å. This work presents a comparative assessment of outcomes obtained through several levels of the exchange–correlation functional: generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, GGA+ U , and the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06), the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 0, and the Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr. The results of our investigation are discussed based on previous theoretical and experimental reports. We found that the best description is obtained with the hybrid HSE06 functional. The Mn 2 has a FM coupling at short distances and the characteristic AFM Σ g + 1 state at d Mn–Mn = 3.27 Å. Furthermore, we obtained a magnetic moment ( μ ) per Mn atom of μ = 4.527 μ B , a stretching frequency of ω = 80 cm −1 , and a binding energy of E b = −195 meV, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.},

By means of dedicated annealing procedures, relative concentration dependencies, and a specialized dual inlet deposition procedure enabling complexation between specific isotopically substituted subunits, the present work identifies the intramolecular vibrational transitions experimentally for these three isotopologues of the binary complex and the most stable cyclic conformations of selectively deuterated mixed (HCl) m (H 2 O) n ( m + n ≤ 4) cluster molecules embedded in inert neon “quantum matrices” at 4 K. The vibrational assignments up to mixed ternary cluster molecules are supported by harmonic CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12 frequency predictions in conjunction with anharmonic corrections employing second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. While the assigned O–H and O–D stretching transitions in neon are systematically spectrally redshifted by 0.2%–0.5% relative to previously reported observations in supersonic jets, the assigned H–Cl and D–Cl stretching transitions all reveal anomalous excessive spectral redshifts in neon increasing with the size of the cluster molecules. These cluster-size dependent excessive H–Cl/D–Cl spectral redshifts in neon indicate that the extent of charge transfer is enhanced strongly with the complexation of an increasing number of H 2 O molecules as predicted by quantum chemical models for more than a decade.},

Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) is one of the promising methods to solve this issue, and numerous studies have been conducted to understand its physical mechanism using a particular combination of a dye and a quencher of interest. However, the research across multiple dye–quencher combinations remains largely unexplored. Here, we explore plenty of dye–quencher combinations and reveal that not only the electron transfer process but also the optimal value of the g -value difference (Δ g ), considerably affected by the escape process of a radical pair, plays a key role in maximizing the enhancement of the NMR signal by photo-CIDNP. The combinations of 115 quenchers with several dyes were experimentally investigated, and 36 photo-CIDNP active quenchers were revealed. Exploration of many different dye–quencher combinations with four dyes revealed that molecular diffusion significantly affects the Δ g dependence of photo-CIDNP enhancement of each dye. These findings provide important insights into pioneering new dye–quencher combinations suitable for biological and medical applications.},

In the valence bond-molecular mechanics, VB-MM, framework, we have developed this potential based on a reduced number of high-level ab initio calculations, the input data. The new PES has been subjected to a series of stringent tests. PES-2024 simultaneously describes both (R1) and (R2) reaction paths, forming the water molecule and describing reasonably the topology of the reaction: high exothermicities, low barriers, and the presence of intermediate complexes. Based on this surface, quasi-classical trajectory calculations were performed at room temperature for both paths, with special emphasis on the H 2 O(v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ) product stretching (v 1 and v 3 modes) and bending (v 2 mode) vibrational excitations, comparing the results with the recent experimental evidence.

An l = 1 resonance centered around 0.02 cm −1 is also found to dominate the j = 2 → j ′ = 0 and j = 4 → j ′ = 2 transitions in v = 4 for He–D 2 collisions consistent with our prior studies of Δ j = −2 transition in He + D 2 ( v = 2, j = 2) collisions. Our analysis does not support the hypothesis of Perreault et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 13 , 10912 (2022)] that a strong l = 2 resonance controls the angular distribution for Δ j = −2 transition for both systems. Despite improvements in the development of the potential energy surface, a good agreement with SARP experiments for v = 2 is achieved only when contributions from collision energies less than 1.0 cm −1 were excluded in the computation of velocity averaged differential rate coefficients for both systems. This could be due to some uncertainties in the velocity spread in the experiment that employs co-propagation of the collision partners and possibly, the neglect of transverse velocities in the simulation of the experiment.},

We focus on the coupled-trajectory mixed quantum-classical (CTMQC) algorithm and on the (combined) coupled-trajectory Tully surface hopping [(C)CTTSH] in comparison to independent-trajectory approaches, such as multi-trajectory Ehrenfest and Tully surface hopping. Our analysis includes not only electronic populations but also additional electronic and nuclear properties in position and momentum space. For both DMABN and fulvene, the recently developed CCTTSH algorithm successfully resolves the internal inconsistencies of coupled-trajectory Tully surface hopping. Instead, we find that DMABN highlights a significant weakness of CTMQC, which arises when the trajectories remain for a long time in the vicinity of a region of strong nonadiabaticity.},

The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long-times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. We identify an exceptional point that indicates the onset of broken symmetry between an unsynchronized and synchronized dynamical phase of the system as correlations within the environment are increased. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.},

While much attention has been given to orthogonal ES methods, relatively little work has been done to develop nonorthogonal ES methods for excited states, particularly those involving nonorthogonal orbital optimization. We present here a numerically stable formulation of the Resonating Hartree–Fock (ResHF) method that uses the matrix adjugate to remove numerical instabilities arising from nearly orthogonal orbitals, and as a result, we demonstrate improvements to ResHF wavefunction optimization. We then benchmark the performance of ResHF against complete active space self-consistent field in the avoided crossing of LiF, the torsional rotation of ethene, and the singlet–triplet energy gaps of a selection of small molecules. ResHF is a promising excited state method because it incorporates the orbital relaxation of state-specific methods, while retaining the correct state crossings of state-averaged approaches. Our open-source ResHF implementation, yucca, is available on GitLab.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of polymer properties using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations requires a properly relaxed starting structure. Polymer models built from scratch by specialized algorithms (self-avoiding random walk, Monte Carlo, etc.) are far from relaxed and, moreover, often possess a large number of structural defects: close contacts between atoms, wrong bond distances, voids, unfavorable molecular conformations or packing, etc. This is especially problematic for ring-containing polymers whose initial structures also include ring spearing (bonds passing through cycles, including benzene rings). All these defects must be eliminated before running an MD simulation to correctly predict polymer properties. Short MD simulations can be enough to remove close contacts; however, ring spearing elimination and general structure relaxation cannot be achieved this way. In this work, we propose α-Replica Exchange MD (α-REMD)–a Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD protocol that reliably eliminates ring spearing defects and performs a general relaxation of the system. Its efficiency is demonstrated on five polyethersulfones whose initial geometries contained numerous ring intersections that were completely removed by α-REMD.},

We extend a number of physical concepts at the core of Kohn–Sham DFT, such as density representability, to the matrix density functional. In this work, we establish the existence of the universal matrix functional for many states as a proper generalization of the Lieb universal functional for the ground state. Consequently, the variation principle of MSDFT can be rigorously defined within an appropriate domain of matrix densities, thereby providing a solid framework for DFT of both the ground state and excited states. We further show that the analytical structure of the Hamiltonian matrix functional is considerably constrained by the subspace symmetry and invariance properties, requiring and ensuring that all elements of the Hamiltonian matrix functional are variationally optimized in a coherent manner until the Hamiltonian matrix within the subspace spanned by the lowest eigenstates is obtained. This work solidifies the theoretical foundation to treat multiple electronic states using density functional theory.},

The effects are shown for propane and diethyl ether as representative examples of potential hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, but the findings of this work are equally applicable to other multispin systems in the liquid or gas phase. These results are relevant to both adiabatic longitudinal transport after dissociation engenders net alignment (ALTADENA) experiments (where 1 H nuclei are polarized) and MFC protocols used to transfer parahydrogen spin order to a heteronucleus such as 13 C. The investigated effects should be incorporated for a correct evaluation of both the maximum possible NMR signal enhancement and the pairwise selectivity, which are useful in the context of mechanistic studies in the field of catalytic hydrogenation. Among signal enhancement damping factors in ALTADENA, such as T 1 relaxation and insufficient adiabaticity of a field sweep, the inherent loss of net magnetization in spin systems containing magnetically equivalent protons (especially in PHIP systems commonly used for mechanistic studies such as propene or propane) has not been thoroughly considered and needs to be clarified. The maximum possible net magnetization in ALTADENA for diethyl ether and propane was shown to be ∑|⟨I iz ⟩| ≈ 0.56 for diethyl ether and ∑|⟨I iz ⟩| ≈ 0.45 for propane, respectively. The inherent loss of net heteronuclear magnetization of the same order of magnitude with an increase in the number of magnetically equivalent protons was also demonstrated for A m M n X-type spin systems.},

  abstract = {Membrane protein folding in the viscous microenvironment of a lipid bilayer is an inherently slow process that challenges experiments and computational efforts alike. The folding kinetics is moreover associated with topological modulations of the biological milieu. Studying such structural changes in membrane-embedded proteins and understanding the associated topological signatures in membrane leaflets, therefore, remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we first aim to estimate the free energy barrier and the minimum free energy path (MFEP) connecting the membrane-embedded fully and partially inserted states of the bacteriorhodopsin fragment. To achieve this, we have considered independent sets of simulations from membrane-mimicking and membrane-embedded environments, respectively. An autoencoder model is used to elicit state-distinguishable collective variables for the system utilizing membrane-mimicking simulations. Our in-house Expectation Maximized Molecular Dynamics algorithm is initially used to deduce the barrier height between the two membrane-embedded states. Next, we develop the Geometry Optimized Local Direction search as a post-processing algorithm to identify the MFEP and the corresponding peptide conformations from the autoencoder-projected trajectories. Finally, we apply a graph attention neural network (GAT) model to learn the membrane surface topology as a function of the associated peptide structure, supervised by the membrane-embedded simulations. The resultant GAT model is then utilized to predict the membrane leaflet topology for the peptide structures along MFEP, obtained from membrane-mimicking simulations. The combined framework is expected to be useful in capturing key phenomena accompanying folding transitions in membranes. We discuss opportunities and avenues for further development.},

We then assessed their performance for the prediction of xCT excitation energies. Thanks to self-consistency, our methods yield small errors relative to high-level coupled cluster methods and outperform other same scaling ( N 5 ) methods, such as CC2 and ADC(2). In particular, O2BMP2, whose scaling can be reduced to N 4 , can even reach the accuracy of CC3 ( N 7 ) with errors less than 0.1 eV.

In particular, the conventional approach for calculating kinetic temperature using the full-time step momentum introduces errors proportional to the square of the time step (Δ t 2 ), leading to unreliable results when employing a large time step under isothermal–isobaric conditions. By calculating kinetic energy using the half-time step momentum in pressure evaluation, we can reduce the numerical errors.

However, a single mean-field wavefunction may not have sufficient flexibility to flag the correlated orbital space where there are multiple correlation mechanisms present. In such situations, there are multiple nearly degenerate self-consistent field solutions that describe different correlation mechanisms, but it is often not possible to know a priori when such situations will occur or if sufficient solutions have been obtained. In this work, we examine the role of spin and spatial symmetries of nonorthogonal multiconfigurational self-consistent field (NOMCSCF) calculations in revealing correlation mechanisms. We provide details of the theory for optimization of NOMCSCF wavefunctions with desired symmetries, establish which types of symmetries recover the most correlation energy when the symmetry constraints are relaxed, and discuss how the different-orbitals for different-configuration wavefunctions reveal the different correlation mechanisms present.},

  abstract = {Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is a powerful polymer field-theoretic simulation tool that plays a crucial role in the study of block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly. However, the computational cost of implementing SCFT simulations is comparatively high, particularly in computationally demanding applications where repeated forward simulations are needed. Herein, we propose a deep learning-based method to accelerate the SCFT simulations. By directly mapping early SCFT results to equilibrium structures using a deep neural network (DNN), this method bypasses most of the time-consuming SCFT iterations, significantly reducing the simulation time. We first applied this method to two- and three-dimensional large-cell bulk system simulations. Both results demonstrate that a DNN can be trained to predict equilibrium states based on early iteration outputs accurately. The number of early SCFT iterations can be tailored to optimize the trade-off between computational speed and predictive accuracy. The effect of training set size on DNN performance was also examined, offering guidance on minimizing dataset generation costs. Furthermore, we applied this method to the more computationally demanding inverse directed self-assembly-lithography problem. A covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy-based inverse design method was proposed. By replacing the forward simulation model in this method with a trained DNN, we were able to determine the guiding template shapes that direct the BCP to self-assemble into the target structure with certain constraints, eliminating the need for any SCFT simulations. This improved the inverse design efficiency by a factor of 100, and the computational cost for training the network can be easily averaged out over repeated tasks.},

  abstract = {We present an approach for augmenting Gaussian atomic orbitals with correct nuclear cusps. Like the atomic orbital basis set itself and unlike previous cusp corrections, this approach is independent of the many-body method used to prepare wave functions for quantum Monte Carlo. Once the basis set and molecular geometry are specified, the cusp-corrected atomic orbitals are uniquely specified, regardless of which density functionals, quantum chemistry methods, or subsequent variational Monte Carlo optimizations are employed. We analyze the statistical improvement offered by these cusps in a number of molecules and find them to offer similar advantages as molecular-orbital-based approaches while remaining independent of the choice of many-body method.},

We present a numerical methodology for estimating the frequency fluctuations; the methodology is based on the reference interaction site model self-consistent field with a constrained spatial electron density distribution, a theoretical model of solvation fields based on classical statistic mechanics. By applying the present theory to the C–N stretching vibrations of several nitrile compounds, our estimated frequency fluctuation scale and bandwidth shift by changing solvent kinds reproduced the experimental data. Furthermore, we regard the standard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random variables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the dominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the vibrational axis. In addition, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential become spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with the solute. The development of the solvation field confirms that the nonuniformity of the electrostatic field is crucial to the frequency fluctuations.},

  abstract = {We consider an open one-dimensional spin-crossover chain, in which each site can be in either a low spin (LS) or a high spin (HS) state. The sites interact elastically through nearest neighbor (nn) and next-nearest neighbor (nnn) springs with local equilibrium distances depending on the spin states. The system’s Hamiltonian is solved numerically using the Monte Carlo method, applied on both spin states and atomic displacements. This study focuses on the investigations of the isothermal relaxation of a photoinduced HS metastable chain, by analyzing the interplay between the electronic and structural properties along this process. The obtained results indicate that the nucleation and growth mechanisms of LS domains during relaxation are significantly influenced by the amplitude of the intermolecular interactions. Thus, increasing the latter reduces the number of HS/LS clusters due to the high cost of stored elastic energy at HS/LS interfaces. In the second part, we inject an elastic frustration between the equilibrium nn and nnn bond lengths, resulting in the emergence of two distinct relaxation regimes, which depend on the frustration rate, ξ . A detailed analysis of the effect of ξ on the isothermal HS to LS relaxation reveals the stabilization of rich intermediate self-organized electronic structures with long lifetime along this process. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate that the shape of the relaxation curves transforms from a continuous to a two-step behavior, which is reminiscent of the thermal dependence of the order parameters of such models in equilibrium thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls—mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material—that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. In addition, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.},

Despite these exciting developments, 2DIR spectroscopy remains limited by Abbe’s diffraction limit, which restricts its spatial resolution. Aimed to address this challenge, the integration of action-based detection methods, notably the atomic force microscope (AFM)-based photothermal detection, offers a promising solution. AFM-2DIR spectroscopy combines the high spatial resolution of AFM with the richness of molecular insights of 2DIR, allowing nanoscale analysis of heterogeneous samples.

  abstract = {Semi-flexible polymers, such as actin filaments, can deform the shape of membrane when confined in a membrane vesicle, playing an important role in biological processes. Here, we use dynamic Monte Carlo simulations to study an active polymer chain confined in a membrane vesicle. For flexible polymer chains, the membrane shape is governed by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and polymer activity. Stiff membrane is unaffected by small active forces, but moderate forces cause the polymer to alternate between stretched and disordered configurations, increasing the asphericity of both the polymer and the vesicle. For semi-flexible polymer chains, their stiffness can significantly impact both the vesicle and polymer shapes. We identify distinct classes of configurations that emerge as a function of polymer stiffness, membrane bending rigidity, and polymer activity. A weak polymer activity can cause the polymer to align along its contour, effectively increasing its stiffness. However, a moderate polymer activity softens the polymer chain. For membranes with low bending rigidities κ , large-scale deformations, such as wormlike or tadpole-shaped vesicles, appear at a weak polymer activity and high polymer stiffness. In the wormlike configuration, the polymer chain adopts a hairpin configuration to minimize the polymer bending energy. As the polymer stiffness increases, a tadpole-like vesicle forms, with part of the polymer deforming the membrane into a protrusion while the rest remaining confined in a bud-like structure. For stiffer membranes, we observe oblate vesicles containing toroidal polymer chains, resulting from the high cost of membrane bending energy. A moderate polymer activity causes the softening of the polymer chain, leading to a nearly spherical vesicle with slight shape fluctuation. We further characterize the order parameter of toroidal polymer chains in oblate vesicles and reveal that a slight increase in polymer activity leads to a more ordered helical structure of polymer chains.},

  abstract = {2D porous material supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) have demonstrated great potential for CO 2 separation and purification, outperforming the original porous material. However, the working mechanism behind their enhanced CO 2 selectivity remains unclear. In this study, we have conducted molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the CO 2 /N 2 separation performance and the underlying mechanism of SILMs taking 2D rhombic N-graphdiyne (r-N-GDY) with intrinsic high thermal stability and porous structure covered with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the representative SILM model. We found that the increase in the SILM thickness can decrease the permeance of CO 2 and N 2 but can effectively increase the CO 2 /N 2 selectivity. The optimal SILM thickness is found to be 0.6 nm with the permeance reaching 5.7 × 10 5 GPU for CO 2 and the selectivity being up to 25.8, which is 15 times higher than the 1.7 of bare r-N-GDY. This is because CO 2 encounters a much lower transmembrane energy barrier than N 2 . At the molecular level, it is fascinating to observe a cation-gating mechanism, where IL cations play a determinative role in CO 2 selectivity. More specifically, the IL cations normally bind at the pore site, like a closed gate for gas. When a CO 2 molecule approaches the pore, the IL cation moves away; thus, the gate is opened for CO 2 translocation. In contrast, N 2 molecules are incapable of opening the cation gate. Such a cation-gating process guarantees the high selectivity of SILMs. This study offers insight into enhanced CO 2 selectivity and provides theoretical guidance for designing nanocomposite membranes for gas or water treatment.},

However, the influence of third component incorporation on exciton properties and charge photogeneration processes in terpolymer-based solar cells is still unclear. In this work, time-resolved spectroscopies were employed to study exciton properties and charge photogeneration processes in PSCs based on a series of terpolymers, PM1 and PM2, which have 20% and 50% of thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) building blocks on the PM6 backbone, respectively. For neat terpolymer films, we found that the small amount (20%) of TTz incorporation in PM6 slightly reduces the exciton diffusion coefficient, but the exciton lifetime is significantly increased, resulting in a significant increase in exciton diffusion length. However, further increasing the TTz component (50%) in the PM6 backbone decreases exciton lifetime, the diffusion coefficient, and consequently exciton diffusion length. We found that a small amount of acceptor (Y6) addition can efficiently dissociate terpolymer excitons due to the weak molecular stacking of terpolymers in the blend films. For terpolymer:Y6-based blend films, we find that the small amount of TTz incorporation (PM1) could reduce the phase size of the donor and suppress bimolecular carrier recombination in blend films. Furthermore, we find that the energy level offset plays a critical role in charge photogeneration processes, and a HOMO energy level offset of 0.06 eV can dissociate acceptor excitons in terpolymer-based organic solar cells effectively.},

Through experimental research and systematic simulations, the EOF-induced ICR was found to exhibit voltage-dependent ratios. In the considered cases with a weak EOF or strong ionic diffusion, a large deviation appears between the ion concentration inside the micropore and the bulk value, which fails the prediction by solution conductivity gradients. Based on our simulation results, effective equations were developed for the theoretical description of ion concentration distributions along the micropore axis under a coupled concentration gradient and electric field. With the predicted ion distributions inside micropores, the ICR ratio can be conveniently calculated using the derived electrical resistance of the microfluidic system, which applies to micropores of 200–1000 nm in diameter. Because the surface charge density is the only unknown input parameter, our developed equations can be used to evaluate the surface charge density of micropores using the measured EOF-induced ICR ratio under concentration gradients.},

  abstract = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable performance advancements over the past decade. In inverted p–i–n PSCs, commonly utilized electron transport layers (ETL), such as C 60 and PCBM, are associated with notable stability challenges and high production costs. This study reports on a novel and highly stable perovskite solar cell that employs iron-doped zinc oxide (FZO) nanoparticles as the ETL and nickel oxide (NiO x ) as the hole transport layer, demonstrating a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼12%. In comparison with PSCs that utilize zinc oxide (ZnO) as the ETL, those incorporating FZO demonstrated a maximum PCE enhancement of 18.3%. The incorporation of iron doping mitigates the basicity of the ZnO ETL, thereby reducing the deprotonation at the FZO/perovskite interface and enhancing the stability of the PSCs. The unpackaged FZO device maintained an initial PCE of 90% after 400 h at a relative humidity of 45% ± 5%. (2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid and 2-phenylethylamine hydroiodide were used to passivate the NiO x /perovskite and perovskite/ZnO(FZO) interfaces, respectively, which further improved the PSC performance. Ultimately, FZO-based PSCs with a PCE of 13.65%, an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.04 V, a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of 20.79, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.1% were obtained, and the PCE demonstrated a notable increase of over 35% compared to pristine ZnO-based devices. Results indicate that high device performance, low fabrication costs, and excellent stability can be attained through the use of simple chemically synthesized oxides as inorganic selective charge transport layers in PSCs.},

  abstract = {The quadrupole coupling constant C Q and the asymmetry parameter η of the aluminum nuclei in two polymorphs of the complex aluminum hydride CsAlH 4 are determined from both 27 Al magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and 27 Al NMR spectra recorded for stationary samples by using the Solomon echo sequence. The accuracy with which these parameters can be determined from the static spectra [CsAlH 4 ( o ): C Q = (1.42 ± 0.01) MHz, η = (0.62 ± 0.01) and CsAlH 4 ( t ): C Q = (1.43 ± 0.02) MHz, η &lt; 0.03] seems to be slightly higher than via the MAS approach. The experimentally determined parameters ( δ iso , C Q , and η ) are compared with those obtained from DFT-GIPAW (density functional theory—gauge-including projected augmented wave) calculations. When using DFT-optimized structures, the magnitude of the quadrupole coupling constant is overestimated by about 45% for both polymorphs. Further calculations in which the geometry of the AlH 4 tetrahedra is varied show a high sensitivity of C Q to the H–Al–H angles. Modest changes in the angles on the order of one to three degrees are sufficient to achieve a near-perfect agreement between GIPAW calculations and experiments. The deviations found for the DFT-optimized structures are explained with the neglect of thermal motion, which typically leads to a reduction in the distortion of the AlH 4 tetrahedra. From a broader perspective, the uncertainty in the positions of the hydrogen atoms renders the accurate reproduction or prediction of quadrupole coupling constants for aluminum hydrides challenging.},

  abstract = {The two-distribution model is developed to determine the group-modified pore size distribution (PSD) of activated carbon, where the PSD is modified by the group distribution. This model assumes an ensemble composed of the elementary confined density distribution for fluids and the group-modified PSD for activated carbon. The group-modified PSD is derived by fitting the theoretical adsorption, calculated using the two-distribution model with grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation-dependent kernels of the N 2 isotherm at 77.4 K and a single CO 2 adsorption data point at 273.0 K, to experimental adsorption data for activated carbon. The group-modified PSD is validated against adsorption data for seven fluids on various activated carbons. In this analysis, the adsorption isotherms calculated using the two-distribution model with PSD, homogeneous group-modified PSD, and inhomogeneous group-modified PSD are compared and evaluated. The results show that the two-distribution model accurately interprets the group-modified PSD.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations are important tools for predicting the thermophysical properties of liquids, and a rigorous validation of the model potentials is crucial to ensure their reliability for new applications. In the existing literature on empirical force fields, there is an obvious lack of data for shear and bulk viscosity. While experimental or model values for shear viscosity are widely available and represent an excellent benchmark, bulk viscosity is more challenging to measure, and experimental values are available for only a handful of liquids. Here, we present an analysis of both shear and bulk viscosity, calculated from molecular dynamics simulations via the Green–Kubo relations, for over 140 small molecular Newtonian liquids from the Virtual Chemistry database. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive reference for these transport properties for the popular optimized potential for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field and the generalized Amber force field (GAFF).},

  abstract = {The motion of a fluid induced by thermal gradients in the absence of external forces is known as thermo-osmosis. The physical explanation of this phenomenon stems from the emergence of gradients in the tangential pressure due to the presence of a confining surface. The microscopic origin of the effect has recently been elucidated in the framework of linear response theory. Here, by use of conservation laws, we provide an explicit solution of the equations governing the fluid flow at stationarity in slab geometry, expressing the thermo-osmotic coefficient as the integrated mass current–heat current correlation function (which vanishes in the bulk). A very simple expression for the pressure gradient in terms of equilibrium properties is also derived. To test the theoretical predictions in a controlled setting, we performed extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions. Few simple models of wall–particle interactions are examined, and the resulting pressure drop and velocity profile are compared with the theoretical predictions both in the liquid regime and in the gas regime.},

  abstract = {The ability to control chemical reactions by coupling organic molecules to confined light in a cavity has recently attracted much attention. While most previous studies have focused on single-mode photonic or plasmonic cavities, here we investigate the effect of hybrid metallodielectric cavities on photoisomerization reactions. Hybrid cavities, which support both photonic and plasmonic modes, offer unique opportunities that arise from the interplay between these two distinct types of modes. In particular, we demonstrate that interference in the spectral density due to a narrow photonic mode and a broad plasmonic mode that are coupled to each other enables hybrid cavities to provide an energy-selective Purcell effect. This effect enhances electronic relaxation only to the desired molecular geometry, providing the ability to increase the yield of photoisomerization reactions. As a test case, we study the asymmetric proton transfer reaction in the electronically excited state of 3-aminoacrolein. Our results, which are robust for a range of realistic cavity parameters, highlight the advantages of hybrid cavities in cavity-induced photochemical processes.},

By employing UV–visible spectrophotometry and dynamic light scattering, it has been shown that in diglycidyl oligomers, regardless of the nature of the monomeric unit, the formation of silver nanoparticles occurs, and the kinetics of this process has been studied. At the same time, in the medium of aliphatic diamine, the reduction of silver ions is absent, indicating the formation of a complex compound. XANES and EXAFS confirmed the formation of such a complex, established the probable coordination number of silver equal to three, and characterized the nearest atomic environment of silver. The SAXS results indicate the formation of complexes of extended conformation environment associated oligodiamine molecules, which favors the formation of an extended network of associates. The SAXS data were used to calculate the composition of the mixture of complexes and associates of diamine molecules for a saturated solution of silver nitrate in diamine. The results of this work will be used to develop new oligomer–silver nanocomposites with unique optical and bactericidal properties.},

  abstract = {Despite the capability of bis-(thio)carbohydrazones to coordinate metals and the remarkable biological properties of the resulting complexes, no general information is known about their individual behavior in solution. This study is focused on two recently synthesized compounds, a bis-thiocarbohydrazone ( bis-TCH ) and a bis-carbohydrazone ( bis-CH ) isolated as sodium salts, that have shown chelating properties toward copper(II) and zinc(II) metal ions along with promising cytotoxic activity. In this work, an integrated theoretical–computational, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and vibrational characterization of both bis-TCH and bis-CH anions in a non-protic solvent (dimethylsulfoxide) is presented to better elucidate their properties. Their protonic NMR spectra underline the presence of cis – trans , EE isomers, characterized by a significant conformational freedom at room temperature. The presence of oxygen or sulfur heteroatoms can tune the molecular conformational dynamics driving a different interaction with the solvent, as highlighted by density functional theory calculations and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that a quantitative agreement with the NMR and Raman signals is achieved only when an explicit solvent description is included. The insights achieved by this study can contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of bis-carbohydrazones and bis-thiocarbohydrazones in solution, a crucial and mandatory step to improve the design of novel, more potent analogs.},

In addition, we study the speed dependence of these parameters. The R 0 (0) and R 0 (1) theoretical thermally averaged collisional widths and shifts between 500 and about 15 K are in excellent agreement with the values reported in the literature. Below this temperature range, we confirm the persistent substantial disagreement that exists since 1985 between experimental and theoretical values. We thus focus on this regime, which is important for astrophysical applications, and we discuss various beyond-Voigt effects at low temperatures to try to understand this mismatch. We show that such mechanisms do not allow experimental widths and shifts to be reconciled with those from theory.},

The utility of the model is demonstrated by comparing experimental data with calculations performed using the theory. In particular, we show that skimmer interference is negligible compared to attenuation by “background” gas for room-temperature beams. Our treatment does not depend on any free parameters and obviates the complexity of previous theories. As a result, we are able to devise a number of design recommendations to minimize interference in sources operating with cryogenic-temperature beams.},

The geometry mutual-matching between TP-[11]CPP and C 82 Gd is perfect, and the two main configurations of TP-[11]CPP@C 82 Gd host–guest complexes could be formed spontaneously with high binding energies. Interestingly, the position of the Gd atom in the C 82 cage can be adjusted by its external host molecule. The binding strength depends on the structure of the host, but the binding thermodynamics is decided by the structure of the fullerene cage. The selective binding of empty cage C 82 from its mixture with EMF C 82 Gd is discussed by using a standard Boltzmann expression of statistical thermodynamics. In addition, the FT-IR and UV–visible spectra are simulated, host–guest noncovalent interaction regions are investigated based on the electron density and reduced density gradient, and magnetic susceptibility is preliminarily investigated, which may be helpful for a deep understanding of the present host–guest systems in the future. It is anticipated that such a theoretical calculation regarding to carbonaceous nanosize host–guest structures would be a driven force for the developments of novel nanohoop@EMF systems in functional materials, nonchromatographic separation and even nano single molecular electret devices.},

Further deposition of VOPc leads to the bilayer formation with an O-up top layer and an O-down bottom layer. High-resolution STM images demonstrate that not only single-molecule chirality but also organizational chirality is transferred from the underlying chiral voids to the top layer. The organizational chirality of the top layer manifests as chiral windmill protrusions, distinct from the chiral voids of the bottom layer. After annealing the bilayer to 310 K, strain is relaxed in the form of a mass density wave (MDW). In particular, the organizational chirality inside MDW domains is opposite to that outside the domains, indicating a chiral switch takes place after the strain relaxation.},

In this study, we investigate the spin dynamics of thiophene-fused π-systems lacking phenazine units to enable the effective utilization of triplet states in thiophene-containing π-systems.

  abstract = {We introduce a novel signal enhancement technique, termed steadyDFS, for quadrupolar solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It can substantially increase the performance of double frequency sweeps (DFSs) for all half-integer quadrupolar spins ( I = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2, and 9/2). In steadyDFS, the DFS and readout pulse are repeated multiple times with a repetition time of T R,DFS to generate a steady state that provides substantial sensitivity enhancement. Using a series of simulations, we show that steadyDFS can outperform conventional DFS methods, and enhancements per unit time of ∼5 to 21 can be achieved depending on the value of I . The sensitivity of steadyDFS is robust toward changes in repetition times and quadrupolar relaxation rates of the system. Moreover, steadyDFS is highly modular and can be combined with quadrupolar Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (QCPMG) detection. Using 39 K ( I = 3/2), 17 O ( I = 5/2), and 49 Ti ( I = 7/2) as representative challenging nuclei, we show that enhancements up to 46× can be realized experimentally via steadyDFS-QCPMG, translating to a 20× enhancement per unit time. We applied steadyDFS-QCPMG to protonated and deprotonated samples, as well as to samples with a diverse range of transverse relaxation times (i.e., T 2 / T 2 *), where steadyDFS-QCPMG can provide an enhancement per unit time of at least 7. For samples that are not amendable to QCPMG, we explored the use of steady-state free precession (SSFP). Although SSFP is fundamentally incompatible with steadyDFS, we show that beneficial results can be obtained when DFSs are combined with SSFP in an interruptive manner.},

Another less intense mass peak at m/z 53 was also observed, which could either result from the dissociative ionization of the energized C 4 H 6 primary products or indicate another product channel, C 4 H 5 + H 2 . Given the presence of CH and C 3 H 6 in cold molecular clouds (e.g., TMC-1, Lupus-1a, L1495B, L1521F, and Serpens South 1a), it is predicted that these products can exist in low-temperature interstellar environments.},

  abstract = {We introduce an approach to describe fractional charging of molecules interacting non-covalently with their environment. The formalism is based on dividing the full orbital space into orbitals localized to the molecule and orbitals localized to the environment. This enables a separation of the full electronic Hamiltonian into terms referencing only molecule, environment, or interaction terms. The interaction terms are divided into particle-conserving interactions and particle-non-conserving (particle-breaking) interactions. The particle-conserving interactions are dominant and may be included using standard embedding schemes. The particle-breaking terms are responsible for inducing fractional charging, and we show that the local orbital space approach provides a convenient framework for different types of perturbative treatments. In the local orbital basis, we generate a basis of many-electron states for the composite system, in which a specific molecular charge may label each state. This basis is used to construct a projection operator acting on the Liouville–von Neumann equation for the composite system to yield an equation for the reduced density matrix for the molecule. The diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix represent populations of different molecular charge states and determine the fractional charging. The projected Liouville–von Neumann equation is the starting point for two perturbative treatments: damped response theory and Redfield theory. The damped response framework introduces energy broadening of electronic states. Phenomenological broadening is also introduced into the Redfield equation. We illustrate the presented formalism by considering benzene physisorbed on a finite graphene sheet as a toy model.},

Here we develop a multiscale model for incorporating methylation in our nucleosome-resolution physics-based chromatin model to investigate the mechanisms by which H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) influence chromatin structure and gene regulation. We apply three types of energy terms for this purpose: short-range potentials are derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of wildtype and methylated chromatosomes, which revealed subtle local changes; medium-range potentials are derived by incorporating contacts between HP1 and nucleosomes modified by H3K9me3, to incorporate experimental results of enhanced contacts for short chromatin fibers (12 nucleosomes); for long-range interactions we identify H3K9me3- and H3K27me3-associated contacts based on Hi-C maps with a machine learning approach. These combined multiscale effects can model methylation as a first approximation in our mesoscale chromatin model, and applications to gene systems offer new insights into the epigenetic regulation of genomes mediated by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.},

In CP theory, perturbative corrections are added to the properties of a parent excitation space, which converge toward the properties of a target excitation space. For the CPS(D- n ) model, perturbative corrections through order n are added to the coupled cluster singles (CCS) excitation energies to target the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) excitation energies. Through a comparative analysis of excitation energy calculations across a diverse set of molecules and wavefunction methods, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of the third-order CPS(D) model, CPS(D-3), in calculating excitation energies. Our findings demonstrate that CPS(D-3) is a reliable alternative to established methods, particularly CCSD, while systematically overestimating the excitation energies compared to high-level coupled cluster methods such as CC3. These results highlight the strengths and limitations of CPS(D-3), as well as the promising directions for its future development.},

For systems with a large number of molecules in the cavity, i.e., in the thermodynamic limit, it is shown that linear response theory can be employed to describe the molecular response, which can be further modeled by an effective harmonic bath. This leads to analytical path integral expressions for the Dicke model, as well as its extensions that incorporate effects of static disorder and coupling to intramolecular vibrational degrees of freedom. The hierarchical equations of motion are then derived to simulate polariton dynamics and absorption spectra. By further taking advantage of the harmonic nature of both the system and the effective bath, an efficient exact diagonalization method is also obtained. Similar results are also obtained for the Tavis–Cummings model, the rotating-wave approximation of the Dicke model. Utilizing these theoretical findings, we simulate the polariton dynamics and absorption spectra and analyze the critical coupling strength for the superradiant transition in the presence of static disorder and coupling to intramolecular vibrational motion.},

  abstract = {In this computational study, we self-consistently calculate the rate constants of mutual neutralization reactions by incorporating the electron transfer probability, using Landau–Zener state transition theory with inputs derived from ab initio quantum chemistry calculations, into classical trajectory simulations. Electronic structure calculations are done using correlation consistent basis sets with multi-reference configuration interaction to map all the molecular electronic states below the ion-dissociation limit as a function of the distance between the reacting species. Our electronic structure calculations have been significantly improved from our previous work [Liu et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 159 , 114111 (2023)] through improved selection of molecular electronic configurations maintaining a fine grid of 1 a 0 over a wide range of bond lengths and accurate treatment of spin–orbit couplings. Non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements are calculated with the three-point central difference method near each avoided crossing to estimate the exact crossing point R x and coupling parameter H if , which are inputs to the multi-channel Landau–Zener theory to calculate the electron transition probability. Our approach is applied to estimate the mutual neutralization rate constants for the following ion pairs: Ar + –Cl − , Ar + –Br − , Ar + –I − at ∼133 Pa. Our predictions are compared against the experimental data reported by Shuman et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 140 , 044304 (2014)]. It is seen that the improvement in the electronic structure calculation results in excellent agreement between the simulation results and the available experimental data to within a factor of ∼2 or ∼±50%.},

This study examines the accuracy of charge densities obtained from different density functional theory (DFT) exchange–correlation functionals in comparison with coupled cluster calculations with single and double excitations. We find that modern DFT functionals can provide highly accurate charge densities, particularly in case of meta-generalized gradient approximations and hybrid functionals. In connection with Gaussian basis sets, it is necessary to use the largest basis sets available to obtain densities that are nearly free of basis set errors. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate computational methods for generating high-precision charge densities, which are, for instance, needed to generate reference data for training modern machine learned potentials.},

The simulations are performed using four levels of electronic structure theory: CASSCF(2,2), CASSCF(4,4), XMS-CASPT2(2,2), and XMS-CASPT2(4,4). These electronic structure models yield two distinct classes of excited-state reaction pathways, with different quantum yields for the isomerization. This illustrates the significance of the potential energy surfaces when simulating photoexcited dynamics. The nature of the two reaction pathways is related to topographical features on the surfaces, suggesting potential “design rules” for chemical modification via substituent groups. How the molecule approaches the conical intersection is also shown to play a decisive role in the reaction outcome.},

We benchmark ppRPA using various exchange-correlation functionals for 21 molecular systems and two point defect systems. Our results show that ppRPA with functionals containing appropriate amounts of exact exchange provides accuracy comparable to high-level wave function methods such as CCSDT and CASPT2, with significantly reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of ppRPA starting from an excited ( N − 2)-electron state calculated by ΔSCF for the first time, as well as its application to double excitations in bulk periodic systems. These findings suggest that ppRPA is a promising tool for the efficient calculation of double and partial double excitation energies in both molecular and bulk systems.},

  abstract = {The exact quantum dynamics of lattice models can be computationally intensive, especially when aiming for large system sizes and extended simulation times necessary to converge transport coefficients. By leveraging finite memory times to access long-time dynamics using only short-time data, generalized master equations can offer a route to simulating the dynamics of lattice problems efficiently. However, such simulations are limited to small lattices whose dynamics exhibit finite-size artifacts that contaminate transport coefficient predictions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel approach that exploits finite memory in both time and space to efficiently predict the many-body dynamics of dissipative lattice problems involving short-range interactions. This advance enables one to leverage the short-time dynamics of small lattices to nonperturbatively and exactly simulate arbitrarily large systems over long times. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by focusing on nonequilibrium polaron relaxation and transport in the dispersive Holstein model, successfully simulating lattice dynamics in one and two dimensions free from finite-size effects, thereby reducing the computational expense of such simulations by multiple orders of magnitude. Our method is broadly applicable and provides an accurate and efficient means to investigate nonequilibrium relaxation with microscopic resolution over mesoscopic length and time scales that are relevant to experiments.},

This conjecture is based on the weak interaction between the magnesium atoms themselves and with the helium atoms and was used to explain observations in femtosecond two-photon ionization experiments by different groups. However, this theory is incongruent with previous infrared spectroscopic observations, indicating the formation of tightly bound clusters when different atoms and molecules combine inside liquid helium. In this paper, we report the spectra (from 210 to 2210 nm) of magnesium-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets at different averaged droplet sizes and number of dopants. The measured spectra in this study are consistent with the formation of compact magnesium clusters rather than the metastable foam structure.},

However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become “lumped” onto the same observable “state” or when introducing “reaction coordinates” to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this Perspective, we highlight why, in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.},
