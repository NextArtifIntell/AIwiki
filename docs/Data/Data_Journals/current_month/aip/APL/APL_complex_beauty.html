Spin-1/2 noble gases have intrinsic coherence times in the order of hours to days, which allows for incredibly low frequency error of free-precession measurements. However, relaxation in miniature cells is dominated by interactions with the cell wall, which limits the performance of a chip-scale sensor that uses noble gases. While 129 Xe wall relaxation times have previously been limited to 10s of seconds in mm-sized cells, we demonstrate the first anodically bonded batch-fabricated cells with dual 3 He- 129 Xe isotopes and 87 Rb in a 6 mm 3 volume with 3 He and 129 Xe T 2 coherence times of, respectively, 4 h and 300 s.

The resonator operates in the cross-sectional Lamé (X-Lamé) mode at 64.7 MHz, exhibiting an ultra-high quality factor ( Q ) of 110 000 and a first-order temperature coefficient of frequency ( T C F 1 ) compensation. Additionally, the resonator provides amplitude-dependent frequency tunability through elastic Duffing. A secondary cross-sectional square-extensional (X-SE) mode at 92 MHz, with high linear temperature sensitivity, enables in situ temperature sensing. An oscillator is constructed with autonomous loop-gain control, leveraging the X-SE mode to compensate for the second-order TCF ( T C F 2 ) of the X-Lamé mode through nonlinear Duffing. This results in a frequency reference with a third-order temperature characteristic, featuring an insensitive region around the inflection points, with a T C F 3 of 7 ppb/ ° C 3 . An overall frequency drift of ± 1.88 ppb is measured for this weakly nonlinear oscillator over 1.47 °C temperature range near the 56 °C inflection point, showing an order of magnitude reduction in instability compared to the linear operation mode.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite materials have been extensively studied in the field of solar cells, and inorganic perovskites, with their good environmental and radiation stability, high defect tolerance, and high carrier mobility, also have great potential for betavoltaic batteries. In this study, we analyze the potential of all-inorganic perovskite betavoltaic batteries. The metal electrode commonly used in perovskite cell devices, such as Au, has a large effect on β particle incidence. MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) have excellent electrical conductivity, while their loose and porous structure reduces the effect on β particle incidence, which is an ideal electrode for betavoltaic nuclear batteries. Therefore, we propose the FTO/TiO 2 /CsPbBr 3 /NiO x /MWCNT structure and explore the prospects of CsPbBr 3 in betavoltaic batteries through simulations and experiments. The simulation results in an open-circuit voltage (V o c ) of 0.53 V, a short-circuit current (J s c ) of 21.53 nA cm −2 , a maximum output power (P m ) of 9.05 nW cm −2 , and a conversion efficiency ( ⁠ η ⁠ ) of 2.9%. The experimentally obtained V o c is 0.42 V, J s c is 12.22 nA cm −2 , P m is 2.55 nW cm −2 , and η is 0.8%.

However, the bidirectional response within a single band of vision sensors is still challenging to in-site recognize color target objects from a multi-spectral context. Here, inspired by avian eyes, we propose a tetrachromatic-bidirectional synaptic transistor based on WOx/WSe 2 heterojunctions with a ultraviolet (UV)-photoactive floating gate of CdS and realize the bio-avian vision with enhanced image and improved recognition under a multi-spectral background. The positive-synaptic responses are exhibited within the visible wavelength band while the negative response is for the UV wavelength band. Moreover, the bionic-kestrel vision behaviors are exhibited, such as the in-site enhanced color object images and the improved recognition accuracy from 58% to 93.1% due to the contribution of UV negative response. This work provides an effective neuromorphic vision to recognize the feature signatures from the multi-spectral contexts.},

We uncover the existence of the hidden symmetry and unearth the topology for the origin of chiral edge state pairs using winding number of a subspace Hamiltonian. The measured dispersion and localization of sound on the edges verify the observations in theory and simulations. This study not only enriches our understanding of acoustic topological systems but also provides a framework applicable to other physical contexts.},

Spin–orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interaction induce valley-layer locking when the bilayer is ferromagnetic, however, spin-layer locking appears for the case of antiferromagnetic states. The inequivalent interlayer antiferroelectric couplings correspond to different magnetic ground states, and the antiferroelectric states can be switched through the breathing process, so the ferroelectric, magnetic, and valley properties can be simultaneously modulated. Through first-principles calculations, we also predict a favorable breathing Kagome bilayer W 3 Br 8 , where the above coupling mechanism and tunable layer-locked valley Hall effects can be achieved.

The temperature dependence of α E exhibits a peak at the magnetic transition temperature T C in zero magnetic field, evidencing an enhanced magnetoelectric effect near the phase boundary. When a DC magnetic field is applied along either a - or b -axis, the peak position of α E shifts continuously to a higher temperature while the peak amplitude reaches the maximum at a critical field and decays for higher magnetic fields. The obtained magnetoelectric phase diagram suggests that the maximum dynamic magnetoelectric effect occurs in a region above T C where short-range magnetic correlations play a crucial role and the peak is due to a metamagnetic transition. The measurements of the magnetostrictive coefficient dλ/d H reveal that the magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the magnetoelastic coupling. Our study provides insights toward achieving significant dynamic magnetoelectric effect at high temperatures in polar magnets.},

Interestingly, we observed that in MnGe thin films, both π- and π/2-periodicities coexist. The emergence of π/2 periodicity is closely linked to specific features observed in the M–H curves. Magnetic force microscopy data reveal that the two periodic PHE signals correspond to distinct, spatially separated magnetic domains.

In this study, we theoretically investigated the motion of DWSKs driven by spin-polarized currents in ferromagnetic strips. Our findings reveal that the motion of DWSKs is contingent upon the direction of the current. When the current is applied parallel to the domain wall, both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin–orbit torque (SOT) can drive the DWSK along the domain wall. Conversely, for currents applied perpendicular to the domain wall, STT can induce DWSK motion by leveraging the skyrmion Hall effect as a driving force, whereas SOT-driven DWSKs halt their motion after sliding along the domain wall. Furthermore, we demonstrated the current-driven motion of DWSKs along curved domain walls and proposed a racetrack memory architecture utilizing DWSKs. These findings advance the understanding of DWSK dynamics and provide insights for the design of spintronic devices based on DWSKs.},

In this study, we report the generation of a large charge-to-spin conversion and bidirectional OOP-SOT by engineering a vertical magnetization gradient within a Co/Ho multilayer system. Exploiting the antiferromagnetic coupling between Co and Ho, the magnetization gradient up to 16.8 (emu/cm −3 )/nm was achieved by gradually varying the Ho layer thickness from 0.4 to 0.9 nm. The presence of the OOP-SOT was confirmed through Hall resistance-field loop shift measurements, which has been attributed to the broken symmetry in spin current reflection and transmission in the Co/Ho multilayer with vertical magnetic property gradients. Additionally, the effective field of the OOP-SOT is strongly correlated with the direction of the magnetization gradient, measured to be around +0.7 and –2.5 Oe/mA for the positive and negative magnetization gradients, respectively. Furthermore, the largest SOT in the Co/Ho multilayer with a negative gradient was observed compared to the positive gradient and uniform Co/Ho multilayer structures. The enhanced SOT is attributed to the bulk Rashba field generated by the gradient structure, along with increased spin polarization. The results demonstrated here provide a promising approach for utilizing magnetization gradients for the development of efficient, current-driven spin-based storage and logic devices.},

Multiple mechanisms related to efficiency loss are independently examined, including injection efficiency, carrier density vs current density relationship, phase space filling, quantum-confined Stark effect, and Coulomb enhancement. An optimal QW thickness of around 2.7 nm in these InGaN/GaN LEDs was determined for QWs having constant In composition. Despite improved control of deep-level defects and lower carrier density at a given current density, LEDs with thin QWs still suffer from an imbalance in enhancement effects on the radiative and intrinsic Auger–Meitner recombination coefficients. The imbalance in enhancement effects results in a decline in internal quantum efficiency and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW thickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We also investigate how LED modulation bandwidth varies with QW thickness, identifying the key trends and their implications for device performance.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic materials featuring topology and flatband in their electronic structure bridge the topological quantum physics and strongly correlated many-body physics, but materials that manifest this feature are rare. Here, we predict a class of ideal intrinsic magnetic topological insulators naturally featuring a nontrivial flatband in the two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb-kagome lattices X 2 Rb 3 ( X =Cr, Mo, W). In the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC), these monolayers are spin-polarized half-semimetals with a twofold degenerate nodal point and a flatband appearing at the Fermi level simultaneously. With SOC included, a significant bandgap (168 meV for W 2 Rb 3 ) opens up at the band touching point, and the flatband that spans the whole Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number ( C = 1). The topological property calculations verify that X 2 Rb 3 monolayers are intrinsic quantum anomalous Hall effect materials. Due to the similarity to 2D continuum Landau levels, the striking nontrivial flatband in X 2 Rb 3 makes it an ideal platform to investigate the flatband physics, such as the realization of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in real materials.},

These waves, termed designer flexural edge waves (DFEWs), are observed along the free edge of a thin plate featuring periodically corrugated rectangular grooves. These DFEWs can be activated unidirectionally using either a pair of point sources exhibiting phase differences or a “chiral” source characterized by a clockwise phase distribution, as evidenced in the experimental results. The observed asymmetric behavior in the former scenario is attributed to the destructive interference among the edge waves. In the latter scenario, we elucidate this phenomenon by analyzing the spatial Fourier spectrum. The chiral source induces a spatial asymmetry, while the periodic edge structure selects the specific evanescent components of the asymmetric Fourier spectrum.},

  abstract     = {The metal–semiconductor contact resistivity has become a severe challenge for three-dimensional (3D) integration. In this work, starting from the physical origin, we propose that the charge redistribution is an effective strategy for decreasing Schottky barrier height (SBH), subsequently leading to a reduction in contact resistivity. Guided by this perspective, first-principles calculations are utilized to investigate the effect of a series of metal dopants on the SBH in the NiSi/Si system. The Φ B e values of NiSi/Si can be reduced to 0.27, 0.28, and 0.22 eV in Sc, Ti, and Zr doped systems, respectively. Especially for the Zr dopant, it can achieve ultra-low contact resistivity of 2.30 × 10 −9 Ω cm 2 , which can be ascribed to the dominant charge redistribution effect. In contrast, high electronegativity dopants like Au and Ir increase Φ B e ⁠ . Dopant diffusion and concentration effects are also examined, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. This work provides a useful theoretical guidance in reducing contact resistivity for 3D integration.},

These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio frequency operation. Here, we show that ICL FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at λ ∼ 4.2 μ m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified shifted wave interference Fourier transform spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free running operation. Further, we show that, through active mode-locking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell–Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (∼100 ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.},

In this work, a synchrotron three-dimension reciprocal space mapping (3D-RSM) technique, which offers a larger Q -space range and higher spatial resolution, was developed and used to analyze YBCO films grown on (001)-oriented LAO, STO, and MgO substrates. The 3D-RSM results reveal that epitaxial YBCO c domains dominate the films, with minor YBCO a domains in YBCO/LAO. The YBCO c domains present a consistent epitaxial relationship with the substrate STO and LAO, with the domain boundary parallel to the substrate [110] or [ 1 ¯ 10] axes. In contrast, YBCO/MgO films exhibit two distinct in-plane epitaxy orientations. Quantitatively measured lattice constants indicate the possible T c -related oxygen vacancy condition therein. A 2-in. YBCO/MgO film, prepared by a homemade pulsed laser deposition system, verified the structural non-uniformity issues, suggesting room for further optimization.

By optimizing jet stability and controlling phase transition velocity, we achieved resolutions finer than 70 μ m, surpassing the limitations of traditional PVA hydrogel fabrication techniques.

  abstract     = {Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLSs). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor Q i as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of Q i at low powers over periods of 12–16 h (relative standard deviation σ Q i / Q i = 13 % ⁠ ). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips, and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power Q i fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence, due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {Graphite anodes are widely regarded as key components for achieving high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, research on the multiscale effects of anode microstructures remains lacking in depth. The influence of transport and reaction processes within the microstructure on overall battery performance requires a coupling investigation integrating both electrochemical and physical field data. In this study, we construct a two-dimensional (2D) multi-physics model and simulate the 2D geometry and internal electrochemical processes to investigate the multiscale effects of microstructures on overall battery performance. Concurrently, we design three distinct anode structures: porosity gradient distribution structures, hard carbon–graphite composite anodes, and hard carbon-coated graphite anodes to identify structural features that enhance key battery performance metrics. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of side-reaction products and the Li + concentration to reveal the influence of different microstructures on internal mass transport and electrochemical reactions. We also identify the factors within these three structures that contribute to extending battery lifespan and improving overall performance. This work systematically establishes the relationship between anode microstructures and battery performance, providing insights that are expected to optimize materials, reduce trial-and-error, and use simulations to guide experimental work more efficiently.},

In this work, a combination of magnetron co-sputtering and post-tellurization methods was used to prepare In doped Sb 2 Te 3 thin films. A high carrier concentration is ascribed to the increase in the density of states after In doping proved by first-principles calculations and experiments, which leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of ∼1686.84 S cm −1 and moderate S above ∼105.24 μ V K −1 . Consequently, a peak power factor of 18.68 μ W cm −1 K −2 was realized in In doped Sb 2 Te 3 thin films at 300 K, representing a ∼17% increase compared to the undoped samples. After 1000 bending cycles, the relative resistance evolution lower than 2% and relative S evolution lower than 5% exhibit excellent flexibility of In-doped flexible thermoelectric film.

The transport equations for both types of devices are derived using the ballistic transport theory. The electrocatalytic behavior of reaction sites in water splitting is modeled by using the Butler–Volmer equation. The impacts of the ESC parameters, including the extraction energy level and the transmission energy width, on the performance of HCPC devices have been investigated. The results indicate that the thermal losses from non-ideal ESCs significantly limit HCPC efficiency, which can be enhanced by optimizing ESC parameters. Comparisons show that HCPCs with quantum dot ESCs outperform those with quantum well ESCs, owing to their superior carrier transport capability and lower thermal loss rates. For an absorber bandgap of 1 eV ⁠ , the optimized solar-to- H 2 energy conversion efficiencies of the two HCPCs reach 62.34 % and 64.93 % ⁠ , respectively, highlighting the promising application potential of these catalysts.},

A multiplexed FP algorithm, utilizing both the bright-field and dark-field information, reconstructs a high-resolution quantitative phase image from the single-shot intensity image. Verified with resolution targets and a histological sample, our method achieved a resolution improvement of 2.5 times the diffraction limit of the objective lens and provided QPI over a large field-of-view.

BP-enhanced Raman spectroscopy provides superior enhancement compared to other 2D materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide, for biomolecular detection. We show that BP significantly amplifies the Raman signals of DNA nucleotides, enabling more sensitive and accurate detection of individual nucleotides. This enhancement may be attributed to the strong charge transfer with biomolecules and anisotropic structure, which increases molecular dipole moments when positioned on its surface. These factors lead to stronger molecular interactions and improved Raman signal sensitivity. Our findings highlight BP as a promising platform for biosensor applications, paving the way for more precise biomolecular sensing and advanced diagnostics.},

However, their intrinsic properties of photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, key to photodetector performance, are still limited with conventional approaches (e.g., material purification and defect passivation). Here, we propose an efficient ultrasound-assisted growth method to manipulate the crystal phase of all-inorganic perovskites. Morphological, structural, and elemental characteristics of perovskites are comprehensively investigated, confirming the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 –CsPbBr 3 dual-phase (DP) perovskites. The fabricated DP perovskites exhibit enhanced carrier dynamics compared to CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs), including over a tenfold increase in photoluminescence intensity and an extended carrier lifetime of 656 ns. Such impressive improvements originate from the repeated radiative recombination introduced by the hierarchical phase of DP perovskites. As a result, the DP perovskite-based photodetector also demonstrates improved photoresponse, including a larger on/off ratio exceeding 10 3 and a higher detectivity of 1.48 × 10 10 Jones, especially in the absence of conventional transporting layers. These results offer strong competitiveness for state-of-the-art perovskite photodetectors and deliver important implications for the widespread use of DP perovskites in assembling high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kilohertz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 μ W/ μ m 2 within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.},

Beyond their intriguing electrical transport phenomena, such as the negative magnetoresistance driven by the chiral anomaly and the anomalous Hall effect, they also exhibit intriguing second-order optoelectronic responses, such as the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). In this Letter, we investigate the CPGE in a class of double Weyl semimetal protected by the C 3 z T symmetry by using the effective model. Unlike double Weyl semimetal protected by C n z (n = 4, 6) symmetry, when time-reversal symmetry T is broken, one C 3 z T -protected double Weyl point (WP) evolves into four single WPs, three of which are related by C 3 z symmetry, and these WPs share the same topological charge and reside at the same energy level. This unique configuration enhances the CPGE trace due to the combined topological charge of the three WPs, resulting in a higher quantized plateau. Our findings provide promising prospects for the development of optoelectronic devices in the future.},

  abstract     = {Group IVA elements Si and Ge and their compounds possess abundant natural distribution and excellent electrical properties that are widely utilized in Si-based technology. The exploration for potentially high-performance thermoelectric materials within the Group IVA elements is a viable pursuit. In this work, Ca intercalated Germanene-CaGe 2 films were grown on sapphire substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the partial lack of Ca between the germanene buckled layers effectively increases the Seebeck coefficient without restraining the conductivity. A maximum power factor of 170 μ W/mK 2 at 523 K, which is seven times larger than the stoichiometric CaGe 2 film, was achieved in the Ca 0.835 Ge 2 film by suppression of bipolar effect and formation of a Ca-deficient phase. This study presents a promising approach to tuning the thermoelectric properties of layered semimetal materials through interlayer atomic modulation, which induces the buckled structure of the framework layer, thereby modifying the electronic structure.},

  abstract     = {The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of monolayer MoS 2 is limited by weak optical absorption due to its atomic scale thickness. To enhance PL intensity, field enhancement techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metal nanoparticles, are often employed. However, SPR-induced light confinement at the nanoscale also leads to significant localized heating. In this study, we investigated the impact of near-field heating due to SPR using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and tip-enhanced photoluminescence studies. Our results reveal nearly an order-of-magnitude difference in the enhancement factors (EFs) for Raman and PL signals of monolayer MoS 2 , with a local temperature increase of approximately 147 °C under the TERS tip at a laser power of 10.57 mW. The reduced PL EF compared with Raman EF is attributed to additional near-field heating from SPR. We further observed that local temperature fluctuations critically affect the EFs and found that a high thermal conductivity substrate can effectively mitigate the near-field thermal effects associated with SPR.},

  abstract     = {The ultra-high piezoelectric activity of K 0.5 Na 0.5 NbO 3 (KNN)-based single crystals with excellent electromechanical coupling characteristics has attracted great interest. However, the growth of KNN-based single crystals is restricted by their high melting point and harsh equipment conditions. In this work, a large-sized single crystal of (K 0.5 Na 0.5 ) 0.994 Bi 0.006 Nb 0.998 Cu 0.004 O 3 (KNNBC) was grown using an inexpensive and simple seed-free solid state crystal growth method. The growth mechanism, domain structures, defects, piezoelectric properties, as well as the conduction mechanisms of the KNNBC single crystal were systematically investigated. A significant piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) as high as 392 pC/N is obtained in the KNNBC single crystal, which is three times higher than that of ceramics with the same composition, and the single crystal also maintains a high Curie temperature ( T c ∼ 399 °C). The superior piezoelectric properties are believed to stem from the ordered arrangement of large-sized striped domains (∼300 nm) and the sensitivity to polarization rotation due to the flattening of the Landau energy density. Additionally, the spontaneous polarization combined with complex defect dipoles consisting of Cu 2+ ions and O 2− vacancies effectively modulates both the quality factor ( Q m ) and the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) of the single crystals. This work broadens the growth strategy of high-performance KNN-based single crystals and highlights the great benefits of the synergistic modulation of defects and domains on the piezoelectric properties of single crystals.},

Notably, the point dipole polarization model provides a more comprehensive explanation of the relaxation time ( τ ), activation energy ( ⁠ W η ⁠ ), and T. This behavior is attributed to strong polarization loss resulting from short-range electronic motion suppressed by those defect clusters, which provides a theoretical foundation for further understanding the mechanisms of microwave dissipation and high-temperature absorption potential.},

However, practical implementation remains challenging due to the limited control over valleytronic properties. Here, we propose ferroelectric HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 van der Waals heterostructure as a platform to overcome these limitations, enabling tunable and nonvolatile valleytronic behaviors. Our findings show that the electric polarization state of the Sc 2 CO 2 monolayer governs the electronic properties of heterostructures. Positive polarization induces a direct gap at the valleys, enabling valleytronic functionality for excitation and readout via circularly polarized light, while negative polarization results in an indirect-gap, suppressing valleytronic behavior. Moreover, our transport simulations further demonstrate a polarization-dependent ferroelectric p-i-n junction with 8 nm possesses a maximum tunnel electroresistance (TER) ratio of 1.60 × 10 8 % at a bias of 0.5 eV. These results provide insights into ferroelectric-controlled valleytronic transitions and position the HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 heterostructure as a promising candidate for energy-efficient valleytronic memory and nonvolatile storage applications.},

  abstract     = {Although the performance of BiFeO 3 (BFO) films has been extensively and deeply studied, further exploration is still needed to understand the correlation between a ferroelectric single domain and high performance in BFO single crystals. Therefore, we conduct the biased in situ transmission electron microscopy experiments on the electrical transport properties of BFO single crystals with single domains. The in situ measured I – V curves indicate neither one-way conduction nor resistance switching. The conductive behavior of BFO corresponds to space charge-limited conduction, indicating a high concentration of oxygen vacancies and the presence of Ohmic contact between the Pt electrode and BFO. After applying a DC constant voltage, the resistance decreases by approximately 50% and partially recovers after exposure to air. The electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra under different conditions indicate that BFO interacts with the external environment. Specifically, DC voltage causes BFO to release oxygen atoms, resulting in an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration and decrease in resistance. Air oxidation leads to a decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration and partial recovery of resistance. In addition, in situ heating experiments (at 20–400 °C) indicate that oxygen vacancies mainly originate from the external electric field rather than thermal effects.},

Recently, a family of Fe-based nanowires has been observed in high-throughput transition metal chalcogenides synthesized by chemical vapor deposition [Zhou et al. , Nat. Mater. 22 , 450–458 (2023)]. In this work, the atomic configuration, chemical composition, and magnetic properties of Fe 3 X 4 (X = S, Se, Te) nanowires were confirmed by first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Due to their intrinsic anisotropic character and strong d-p hybridization, Fe 3 X 4 nanowires exhibit antiferromagnetic semiconducting behavior with good stability, a tunable bandgap of 0.277–0.771 eV, a large vertical magnetic anisotropy energy of 2.39 meV/Fe, and a high Néel temperature of 680–840 K. Moreover, the calculation of the spin transport properties has shown that these Fe 3 X 4 nanowires possess the negative differential resistance behavior with the peak-to-valley current ratio from 1.84 to 6.85. Our results not only expand the database of magnetic nanowires but also provide a low-dimensional platform for multifunctional spin devices.},

However, reducing the thickness of the NiCo 2 O 4 film to a few atomic layers degrades its room temperature magnetic and electrical properties, limiting its practical application. In this study, a Co 3 O 4 buffer layer is introduced into ultrathin NiCo 2 O 4 films, which significantly enhances the Curie temperature beyond room temperature and reduces the resistivity, while preserving the strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as well as the robust anomalous Hall effect. It is found that the sheet resistance dramatically decreases with the increase in Co 3 O 4 thickness. The observed phenomena may originate from the increased occupation of Ni 3+ ions at octahedral sites due to the interfacial coupling, resulting in the intrinsic linear relationship between resistivity and Curie temperature. Additionally, the scaling relation between the anomalous Hall conductivity and longitudinal conductivity highlights the complex interaction between spin-dependent impurity scattering and the band intrinsic Berry curvature. This study indicates that interfacial coupling is an effective strategy for tuning the physical properties of oxides, providing a promising avenue for the application of NiCo 2 O 4 -based materials in miniaturized spintronic devices.},

With the increase in cycle number of [Co/Ni] × n multilayers, the switching ratio rapidly decreases, even cannot present the magnetization switching. This switching behavior can be attributed to the strong domain wall pinning in the samples with the maze domain structure. Moreover, although the samples in this work have the same spin current sources, the estimated SOT efficiencies vary greatly, suggesting that the SOT efficiency in a FM/heavy metal (HM) structure depends not only on the spin Hall effect and/or Rashba effect but also on the magnetic structure of FM layer.

  abstract     = {During the grain boundary diffusion (GBD) of Tb, the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures are the two main microstructures influencing the magnetic properties of the sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets. These two microstructures are all composed of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B phase, but the formation mechanisms are different. The difference in formation mechanism of the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures was studied by quenching the magnets at different temperatures and holding times. The (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell of the core–shell structure is the precondition for forming the reverse core–shell structure. The triple-junction phases (TJPs) area change proves that the Nd elements diffuse from the TJPs to the surface of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell to form the Tb-poor shell in the reverse core–shell structure and the Gaussian distribution of Tb in the shell of the core–shell structure. In addition, the difference in the Tb content distribution leads to different demagnetization processes, resulting in the opposite effect of these two microstructures on the coercivity. The GBD aims to increase the entire coercivity by enhancing the surface anisotropy field ( H A ), such as the Tb-rich shell for the grains and the Tb-rich surface (∼200 μ m) for the magnets. Therefore, for the reverse core–shell structure forming in the surface of the magnets, the surface with a low H A decreases the coercivity of the grains, reducing the coercivity of the magnets.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a data-driven measurement and sensing paradigm that capitalizes on the limited sensing capabilities of probabilistic bits (p-bits). Unlike traditional methods that rely on the high quality of individual devices, our approach achieves high precision through the extensive data collected from a large ensemble of p-bits. We demonstrate the feasibility of using magnetic tunnel junction-based p-bits in various applications, such as temperature stability monitoring, passive timekeeping, and weak magnetic field sensing. The paradigm is notably easy to implement and robust against device imperfections and non-uniformity, providing significant advantages in terms of practicality and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with high spin polarization and controllable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) are critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer Cr 2 Te 2 exhibits intrinsic dynamic/thermal stability, half-metallicity, and robust ferromagnetic ordering. The Curie temperature ( T c ) can be elevated from 90 to 190 K via external stimuli. Strain engineering, carrier doping, and electric-fields enable precise control of MAE, while tensile strain and electron doping enhance MAE to 2.680 meV. Conversely, compressive strain and hole doping induce a spin reorientation transition. Moreover, external electric fields also play a key role in determining MAE, suggesting a promising strategy for manipulating MAE in 2D ferromagnets. These modifications primarily arise from the alternations of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) strength between Te-derived p -orbitals within specific spin channels. These findings establish Cr 2 Te 2 as a versatile platform for spintronics integrating half-metallicity with dynamically adjustable magnetic properties and motivate further experimental exploration.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the orbital torque generated in ferromagnetic (FM)/manganese (Mn) bilayer systems based on angular-dependent spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) experiments. From the ST-FMR results, it is found that a relatively large out-of-plane anti-damping torque can be obtained in Ni/Mn bilayers. The Gilbert damping constant, derived from the resonant linewidth of frequency-dependent ST-FMR experiments, decreases almost linearly with increasing thickness of Mn, further indicating the out-of-plane anti-damping torque in Ni/Mn bilayer systems. The origin of this torque can be attributed to the orbital Rashba–Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the orbital diffusion length ( ⁠ λ L ⁠ ) in Mn is determined to be more than 17 nm and larger than spin diffusion length, suggesting that the torque observed in our sample is predominantly influenced by the orbital-related effect. Finally, the insertion of Pt in a Ni/Mn bilayer system significantly enhances the orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that Mn is a promising material for future orbitronics devices.},

  abstract     = {Understanding thermal transport behaviors across dissimilar metal films is essential for optimizing electronic devices&#39; performance and efficiency. However, the effect of interfacial parameters such as the thickness on interfacial thermal conductance ( G ) of metal/metal remains elusive. In this Letter, the G between Al and Cu with varying Cu thickness was investigated from 78 to 295 K using the time domain thermoreflectance technique combined with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM). The temperature dependence of G Al/Cu follows a pattern that is consistent with phonon-related thermal transport behaviors and decreases with increasing Cu thickness. The phonon related behaviors are attributed to the existence of the oxide layer at the interface. By taking the oxide layer into account, NEMD and DMM calculations match well with the experimental results, proving that the oxide layer hinders electron transport across the interface. We further find that strain distributions in Cu layers have a negative correlation with Cu thickness. When applying compressive strain on Cu, the overlap of phonon density of states between Cu and Al increases, especially for phonons of 6.5–9 THz, which is responsible for the Cu thickness-dependence in G Al/Cu . Our results not only help revealing strain effect on G but also pave the way for the thermal design of metal interconnect in integrated circuits.},

  abstract     = {Integrating high thermal conductivity cost-effective SiC to the Si-active-layer film is an effective solution to enhance the thermal performance of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and maintain its distinct electrical performance. Although direct bonding of Si films to SiC substrates demonstrates many advantages over epitaxial growth, different bonding techniques may yield disparate bonding qualities and heat dissipation abilities. Here, a comparative analysis from thermal-mechanical-structural perspectives of different Si/SiC interfaces, prepared by hydrophilic bonding (HB) and surface-activated bonding (SAB) methods, is systematically conducted. It was found that the amorphous interlayer thickness and thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of the SAB-Si/SiC heterojunction can be significantly modulated by annealing, accompanied by a beneficial decreased TBR at high working temperatures. Moreover, the residual stress within the Si film by SAB is greatly reduced to an order of magnitude lower than that by HB. In general, the SAB-Si/SiC interface exhibits a tunable microstructure, comparably low TBR, and nearly fully relaxed stress, potentially outperforming the HB-Si/SiC interface when considering the comprehensive performance. This work puts forward an important thermal-mechanical perspective to evaluate interface bonding quality for practical applications, and removes a headache barrier toward wafer-scale high-yield integration of Si active layers onto SiC substrates to greatly enhance SOI devices&#39; thermal management.},

This study systematically investigated the electrical properties, microstructure, elemental valence states, and energy-band alignment of these heterojunctions through multiple analytical techniques. Current–voltage measurements revealed an asymmetric, nonlinear behavior due to the depletion region at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface, with annealing further enhancing electrical performance by yielding a lower turn-on voltage of 0.3 V, an increased rectification ratio of 81.1, and a reduced ideality factor of 6.69. Band structure analysis showed that both the conduction band offset and valence band offset at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface increase, indicating a higher barrier height, resulting in more pronounced rectification behavior. X-ray diffraction showed that the laser-treated samples have polycrystalline structures, and annealing improved the crystallinity, thereby enhancing the conductivity. Furthermore, secondary ion mass spectroscopy confirmed the deep implantation of high concentrations of Cu ions into ZnO. Depth‐profiling x‐ray photoelectron spectra revealed the co-presence of Cu + and Cu 2+ , both of which contribute to the p -type conductivity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing ZnO heterojunctions in applications such as light-emitting diodes and laser diodes with a high level of efficiency and low turn-on voltage.},

However, the specific contact resistance values of p-GaN remain limited to the range of mid-10 −2 Ω cm 2 due to the low activation ratio of Mg dopants and high work function. Here, we propose an Ohmic contact method using a Pd-based metal stack to achieve lower specific contact resistance compared to conventional p-GaN contact metals such as Ni/Au or Pt/Au. A low specific contact resistance of 1.08 × 10 −5 Ω cm 2 was demonstrated for p-GaN by annealing a Pd-based tri-layer metal contact in an oxygen-rich ambient with an optimized Pd thickness. The mechanism driving this low specific contact resistance was investigated using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicated the mutual diffusion of Ni, Pd, and Ga atoms within the metal alloy. A NiO layer was formed on the top of the metal alloy, and Pd-Ga compounds were formed at the metal/p-GaN interface through mutual diffusion of atoms. This process increased the number of Ga vacancies in p-GaN, playing a crucial role in reducing its contact resistance.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the impact of constant forward electrical stress on beta-gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) from the prospective of defect evolution. Prolonged stress significantly increased the reverse leakage current density ( J R ) and forward current density ( J F ) under small bias and decreased the turn-on voltage ( V on ). Temperature-dependent current-voltage ( I-V-T ) analysis revealed that the reverse leakage current is dominated by Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission in both fresh and stressed SBDs, while the forward current transport mechanism transforms from thermionic emission (TE) to trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) after stress. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) results identified an intrinsic trap E 2 * (E C - 0.75 eV) within the β -Ga 2 O 3 drift layer, which is likely a Ga vacancy-related trap. The consistency of this energy level with the PF barrier proves that the increase in this trap is the main reason for the increase in J R . The spatial distribution features that the increase in trap concentration near the metal-semiconductor interface is much larger than that inside the bulk, which establishes the association between this trap and J F under small bias and V on . These findings highlight the critical role of trap evolution in SBD performance degradation under electrical stress.},

In this study, we investigate freestanding VO 2 microbeams that undergo reversible transitions from an insulating triclinic (T) phase to an insulating monoclinic (M2) phase, followed by a transition to the R phase. The latent heat changes associated with these first-order phase transitions are monitored using a recently developed chip-based differential scanning calorimetry technique, which demonstrates exceptional sensitivity and resolving power. A series of sharp endothermic and exothermic peaks are observed during the temperature ramping process. In contrast to the abrupt and complete transformation typically observed in conventional insulator-to-metal transitions, our findings reveal a scenario in which multiple domains coexist, and phase transitions occur sequentially within each domain. These results underscore the intricate relationship between domain dynamics and the multiple phase structures in VO 2 . Furthermore, they highlight the potential of advanced thermal analysis techniques to detect subtle thermal signals associated with phase transition processes, providing fresh insights into the underlying mechanisms.},

Through ab initio evolutionary structure searches and first-principles calculations, we identify a thermodynamically stable layered NaC 3 intercalation compound at 14.0 GPa, featuring a distinctive edge-sharing penta-octa-penta ( pop ) carbon framework with intercalated sodium atoms. Upon sodium removal, the resultant pop -graphite structure remains stable under ambient conditions, exhibiting superior electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility compared to conventional graphite.

Both phases are indirect bandgap, which is smaller than the atmospheric phase.

However, currently developed LARHEAs generally have poor room temperature ductility, which greatly limits their wide applications. In this study, two kinds of LARHEAs with chemical compositions of TiZrTaCr and TiZrTaV in equal atomic percentage were designed based on low neutron absorption cross section, low neutron activation, and mixing enthalpy parameters. The LARHEA samples were prepared by high vacuum arc-melting techniques, and their phase structures and mechanical properties were studied. It was found that the TiZrTaCr LARHEA exhibited two body-center-cubic (BCC) and one Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound phases, and it had a yield strength of 1364 ± 54 MPa, but it was brittle, while the TiZrTaV LARHEA formed three BCC solid solution phases, and it had a high yield strength of 1312 ± 57 MPa with a room temperature compression plasticity of 13% ± 0.8%. Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound formation in the solid solution matrix could have led to the brittleness of the LARHEAs, which was mainly due to the large negative mixing enthalpy of the Cr element with Zr element in this alloy system. This study proposed a basic method for LARHEA design to optimize the microstructures and improve the mechanical properties as structural materials.},

  abstract     = {The controllability of the spectral width and intensity of long-wave infrared (LWIR) emission is essential for various applications, including optical stealth, infrared radiation sources, and infrared lasers. Here, we proposed a multifunctional LWIR metasurface emitter with a switchable radiation state, which consists of germanium (Ge) rectangular pair resonators placed on a vanadium oxide (VO 2 ) film. By manipulating the reversible metal-to-insulator phase transition of phase change material VO 2 , the spatial and spectral emission characteristics could be dynamically controlled. The high loss of metallic VO 2 enables broadband emission in the LWIR band. The average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range reaches 91.3% and exhibits wide-angle emission properties. When the VO 2 is transformed to the insulating phase, the coupling effect of the symmetry-breaking rectangle with two quasi-bound states in the continuum modes enhances the emission intensity of VO 2 at a selective wavelength. This results in narrowband emission with a high-quality factor (Q-factor) and high directional selectivity. Notably, the emission peak&#39;s linewidth is only 28 nm, with a Q-factor of 293, and the average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range drops to 9.4%. Overall, the proposed metasurface device achieves an LWIR emissivity switching ratio of 9.7 between its two operating modes, showcasing significant differences in spectral and spatial radiation characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Open stopband (OSB) mitigation techniques are commonly used to improve the far-field radiating properties of leaky-wave antennas based on periodic structures. Recently, leaky waves have been proposed to focus energy in the near field through Bessel beams. However, the focusing character of Bessel beams is notably limited to a maximum distance known as the nondiffractive range . In this work, an OSB mitigation technique is originally exploited to significantly extend the nondiffractive range of a Bessel beam generated by a leaky-wave launcher in the microwave/millimeter-wave range. A comprehensive analysis of this device is presented, comparing the performance of the proposed launcher with the typical structure of a leaky-wave Bessel-beam launcher where the OSB is not suppressed. Theoretical results, corroborated by full-wave simulations, demonstrate that the proposed device achieves an impressive nondiffractive range of about 25 m. The latter, at 30 GHz, approximately corresponds to 2500 wavelengths (in vacuum) and to 50 times the aperture diameter which is about 50 cm. These results look particularly attractive for, e.g., near-field communications and wireless power transfer applications, where focusing energy in narrow regions and over large distances is a key factor.},

Perfect absorption of left-handed circularly polarized light (LCP) exceeding 99% and weak absorption of only about 6% of right-handed circularly polarized light (RCP) are achieved at 7.24 THz in frequency. The discrepancy in absorption responses of LCP and RCP results in a large circular dichroism (CD) of 0.94. The CD value in the THz region can be actively modulated between 0.02 and 0.94 by controlling the phase transition of VO 2 , which is closely related to the ambient temperature. Moreover, near-field imaging and encrypted presentation are realized by leveraging the metasurface and its mirror-image properties. Our work holds significant promise in widespread fields including THz intelligent absorption, imaging, and chiral detection.},

Due to the limitations of the materials and process, existing THz polarization converters generally have the disadvantages of narrow operating frequency band and non-flexibility. We experimentally demonstrate a flexible ultra-broadband THz polarization converter operating in reflection. It can efficiently convert a linearly polarized THz wave to its orthogonal counterpart in a broadband regime. The device consists of three layers: the lower metal film, the middle dielectric layer, and the upper metal resonance structure array. The unit cell of the upper metal resonance structure is a four-open-ring formed by subtracting two metal bars from a metal ring. The position of the opening is in the diagonal direction of 45° from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of the unit structure. The device is simulated using a full wave EM simulation software and fabricated by a surface micromachining process. The test experiment is completed using a THz-TDS spectrometer and the results show that the polarization conversion ratio is more than 0.8 in an ultra-broadband regime from 1.45 to 2.67 THz. This ultra-broadband conversion is mainly caused by the magnetic resonance of THz waves. More importantly, the convertible frequency band can be tailored for practical applications across the EM spectrum.},

However, there are instances where a droplet fails to rebound from a superhydrophobic surface. It has been reported that the combined effect of gravito-capillary length and visco-capillary length determines the pinning–bouncing criteria. While the fluid properties, such as viscosity and weight, are often considered primary factors influencing droplet rebound, this study highlights the crucial role of surface characteristics, particularly the contact angle hysteresis, in determining post-impact behavior. We propose a modified criterion that predicts droplet bouncing and pinning on superhydrophobic surfaces by integrating both fluid properties and the contact angle hysteresis of the surface. The findings emphasize the importance of surface morphology in droplet dynamics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of droplet behavior on non-wetting surfaces.},

The results demonstrate that the morphology of SiGe cladding can be controlled by adjusting the high-temperature H 2 baking conditions, leading to shapes such as triangular, circular, and hexagonal. Technology computer-aided design simulations and geometric phase analysis of TEM images revealed that the maximum compressive stress of SiGe cladding is 3 GPa, corresponding to a compressive strain of 2.48%, which significantly enhances hole mobility. Electrical performance tests and simulations on p -type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor devices with different morphologies showed excellent short-channel effect control, with a subthreshold swing (SS) of approximately 70 mV/dec and a drain-induced barrier lowering of only 40 mV/V.

  abstract     = {The presence of a macroscopic interface between ceramic insulators and vacuum inevitably leads to multipactor under high electric fields, which is a significant threat to various electronic and electrical devices, as it is typically regarded as a precursor to electrical breakdown. In this study, we report a strategy using functionally graded lattice structures (FGLS) to manipulate the multipactor of the ceramic surface. First, particle-in-cell simulations were conducted to study the secondary electron avalanche process. Simulation results indicated that the interaction between electrons and FGLS hinders the development of secondary electron avalanche. Also, a few positive charges can be accumulated on the ceramic surface since FGLS eliminates the macroscopic interface between insulators and vacuum. Subsequently, stereolithography 3D printing technology was adopted to fabricate ceramic insulators with FGLS, and a further experimental characterization verifies the reduction of secondary electron yield, especially for surfaces with finer structures.},

  abstract     = {We report on the fabrication and characterization of p–n diodes made from wide bandgap II-VI semiconductors (p-ZnTe/n-CdTe) containing nano-inclusions of narrow bandgap material (PbTe). The diodes are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy on semi-insulating GaAs (100) substrates. The PbTe nano-inclusions are formed either as a single layer of PbTe with a thickness of 350 nm or as multilayers built from alternating thin layers of PbTe and CdTe. Comparison of cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images with electron beam-induced current measurements confirms that the PbTe nano-inclusions are located in depletion regions of the diodes. Despite the presence of the highly conductive, narrow bandgap PbTe semiconductor between the p- an n-type layers, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices show rectifying behavior and acceptable diode parameters in the wide temperature range of 60–290 K. The p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes with PbTe nano-inclusions exhibit significant sensitivity to infrared radiation starting at the wavelength of about 1.5 μ m and with a long-wavelength cutoff of 3.9 and 5.4 μ m at 290 and 50 K, respectively. A peak sensitivity appears at a wavelength of 2.29 μ m and reaches the maximum of almost 1 V/W at a temperature of 150 K. The temperature dependence of the cutoff wavelength clearly shows that the sensitivity to infrared radiation of the wide bandgap p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes is due to band-to-band optical excitations taking place in PbTe nano-inclusions. The results presented here prove that such diodes can be used for infrared sensing or for two-color infrared solar cells.},

Polar phases of interest can include different ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and paraelectric phases, which can be transformed into each other through external stimuli, offering unprecedented control over polar material properties. With this level of control, important size limitations and integration problems can be overcome, and material platforms with tunable polar properties for multi-functional devices and sensors can be developed for the next generation of information and energy technologies. We highlight the co-existence of polar properties that have been found on local scales using advanced local characterization techniques as well as methods to control polar properties in transition metal thio-/selenophosphates.

The hexagonal wurtzite structure, which is a typical crystal structure in compound semiconductors, demonstrates pronounced anisotropy, especially in its response to external stimuli. Recently, mechanical behavior under light illumination has attracted increasing interest especially in semiconductor compounds. In this study, we investigated the anisotropy of illumination effects on the nanomechanical properties of wurtzite ZnO. Four surface orientations—(0001), (0001) 45° off, ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ), and ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ )—were subjected to nanoindentation creep and nanoindentation hardness tests under controlled light illumination. The indentation depth during nanoindentation creep under light illumination was consistently smaller than that in darkness for all surface orientations, confirming that light suppresses indentation creep deformation, but to different degrees depending on the surface orientation. This suggests that the activated slip systems and the distribution of dislocations play a crucial role in modulating dislocation behavior under light illumination. The nanoindentation hardness followed the trend on the four surface orientations: (0001) &gt; (0001) 45° off &gt; ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ) &gt; ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ ), reflecting anisotropic behavior in nanomechanical properties. Second and subsequent pop-in events were extracted, exhibiting different behaviors depending on the surface orientations, and may play a key role in determining the anisotropy in nanoindentation hardness. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the plastic anisotropy under light control in wurtzite ZnO.},

  abstract     = {Passive solar heating and radiative cooling attracted lots of attention in global energy consumption reduction due to their unique electricity-free advantage. However, static single radiation cooling or solar heating would lead to over-cooling or over-heating in cold or hot weather, respectively. How to achieve effective self-adaptive thermoregulation is critical for dynamic thermal management. Hence, in this work, a self-adaptive thermoregulation strategy was designed by coupling latent heat storage or release with reversible solar heating and radiative cooling. A commercial memory alloy could realize self-adaptive thermoregulation at the critical temperature between radiative cooling with high solar reflectance R ¯ solar = 0.95 and thermal emittance ε ¯ LWIR = 0.93, and solar heating with high solar absorptance α ¯ solar = 0.92 and low thermal emittance ε ¯ IR = 0.08. High thermal conductive phase change material could further improve the thermoregulation performance with a latent heat of ∼136 J g −1 , and thermal conductivity of 3.4 W m −1 K −1 , resulting in a superior heating performance than the single solar heating (39.9 vs 36.9 °C) and superior cooling performance than the single radiative cooling (33.8 vs 35.5 °C). The maximum heating temperature increase could be 12.7 °C in the cold situation, and the temperature drop could be 8.3 °C in the hot situation. Energy consumption calculation showed that the designed sample could save 68%–90% of annual energy consumption compared with the common roof, indicating that coupling spectral regulation with the latent heat can greatly improve the self-adaptive thermoregulation performance and save the total energy consumption in thermal management.},

  abstract     = {The lack of low-work function materials and the negative space charge effect have long prevented vacuum thermionic energy converters (VTECs) from becoming a practical means of power generation. Advancements in microfabrication have since provided solutions to these challenges, such as the suppression of negative space charge via a micro/nanoscale interelectrode vacuum gap distance, reigniting interest in VTECs as a potential clean energy technology. However, the limited operational lifetimes of many low-work function coatings have hindered their practical device-level implementation. Solid-state thermionic energy converters (SSTECs) have been proposed as a viable alternative to VTECs since they do not require an interelectrode vacuum gap or low-work function electrodes. Nevertheless, SSTECs still require a large temperature gradient between electrodes and are limited to low operating voltages. To address these limitations, we propose a near-field enhanced solid-state thermionic energy converter (NF-SSTEC), which leverages the advantages of SSTECs by eliminating the need for a large temperature gradient between the electrodes and increasing the range of possible operating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate conversion efficiencies of 16.8 % and power densities as high as 13.1 W cm −2 without needing a high-temperature gradient between the radiator and SSTEC. Additionally, we compare its performance under different radiation spectra, showing the potential for improvement via further optimization of the radiator.},

Specifically, we use a single gold subwavelength nanochannel to simultaneously apply both spatial confinement and plasmonic enhancement. Furthermore, instead of using an ultrafast laser, we demonstrate the feasibility of drilling nanochannels on suspended substrate using continuous lasers. In contrast to conventional plasmonic nanochannels with plasmonic enhancement only under transverse magnetic (TM) mode laser, our sample presents obvious plasmonic effects under both TM and transverse electric mode lasers, which is beneficial for improving the overall signal.

This study explored the vibration of buckled graphite sheets under external excitation using experimental analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and nonlinear isotropic plate model (NIPM). Notably, multiple peaks corresponding to the identical mode appeared in the spectrum. The additional peak distinct from the natural frequency arose from transition between two steady states of the film. Remarkably, the frequency of the peak corresponding to the transition exhibited greater sensitivity to external excitations and stress than the natural frequency of the resonator did. This phenomenon opens avenues for developing 2D resonant nanomechanical sensors with enhanced sensitivity, as well as bistable nanoelectromechanical resonators.},

However, further development of devices based on CsPbBr 3 is hampered by their poor electrical stability under operation. Migration and accumulation of native ions (Cs + , Pb 2+ , and Br - ) under electric fields has been suggested by many groups to be responsible for the observed device instabilities, although direct experimental evidence of ionic motion during operation has been seldom reported. In our study, ion migration has been probed by grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) in CsPbBr 3 polycrystalline layers grown in vapor phase. Our findings indicate that both Cs and Br experience ionic migration under electric field, suggesting that these ions are responsible for the measured current instability in our devices. In the timescale of a few hours, the ionic drifting rates of mobile Cs and Br under the top electrode were found to be similar, as high as ∼ 20 ppm h −1 V −1 mm.

We fabricate dielectric spiral PCs with different gradients of 1%, 11%, and 28% in the z -direction using the femtosecond laser direct writing technique. The predicted AT of light and the dependence of AT on the structural gradient amplitude due to the complex dispersion relations in PCs have been revealed through experimental measurements. These results demonstrate the potential of gradient 3D PCs in the development of diverse (AT) optical devices.},

We address related issues by examining the influence of the QD packing fraction ( PF ) on the charge transport and transmission in QD arrays. Using transfer matrix based algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations, we quantify the transmission across disordered QD assemblies. Our results indicate a critical packing fraction ( ⁠ P F c ⁠ ) of ∼ 0.64, marking a transition from a non-conducting to a conducting state, aligning well with experimental observations and analytical predictions.

  abstract     = {Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) has played an important role in determining the electronic band structures of semiconductors. However, the tip-induced band bending (TIBB) could strongly affect the measured valence and conduction band edges, which are of vital importance for a semiconductor. In the literature, the presence or absence of the TIBB effect in a given STS measurement is often not discussed thoroughly. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the TIBB effect in MoS 2 with varying thicknesses using light-modulated contact-mode STS. Our results demonstrate that the TIBB effect is strongly dependent on the thickness of MoS 2 . With thin MoS 2 of a few atomic layers (several nanometers), the TIBB approaches zero, and the measured STS can accurately reflect the band edges. While for thicker MoS 2 of ∼100 nm, the TIBB can be as large as ∼1 eV. This work clarifies the ambiguity about the TIBB effect and provides a foundation for the interpretation of STS data on atomically thin semiconductors.},

This study comprehensively tracks the ferroelectric polarization and phonon property changes resulting from interlayer sliding in a β -GaSe bilayer. The results indicate that sliding the upper layer of the bilayer induces charge transfer, causing polarization accompanied by periodic changes and reversal in non-polarized β -GaSe. Simultaneously, low-frequency optical phonons in polarized structures soften significantly, exhibiting a minimum or rapid decrease accompanied by the maximum value of in-plane polarization. Additionally, the sliding symmetry breaking has complex effects on phonon transport, causing intriguing changes in transport characteristics due to variations in group velocity and linewidth, which are closely related to ferroelectric polarization. This study reveals not only the polarization achieved in the β -GaSe bilayer through sliding-induced symmetry breaking but also its complex effects on phonons and profound physical changes, enriching our understanding of the associated condensed matter physics.},

However, the difference in charge between O 2− and F − anions makes the Ti 3+ arise in BTOT ceramics. The coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism was observed in BTOF ceramics at room temperature by P–E loop and M–H loop. Moreover, these two ferroic orders originate from the Ti atoms. This work presents an alternative scheme for exploring multiferroic materials with large polarization and magnetization at room temperature, and we also expect preferable magnetoelectric coupling.},

The dispersion relationships between the resonant frequencies and wavelengths for the resonators, including the shear horizontal (SH) and Rayleigh modes, are investigated. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the main SH mode provides a larger coupling coefficient ( K 2 ) and that the spurious Rayleigh mode can be shifted from the passband and away from the main SH mode. Although the proposed POI SAW resonators on two different substrates have comparable frequencies for the same wavelength, the sapphire-based substrate exhibits a larger K 2 of 28% and a higher fitted Bode- Q max of 977 at 1.4 GHz. The temperature behavior of the SAW resonators is measured over a temperature range from −25 to 250 °C. The findings indicated that the resonator with the Si-based substrate has better temperature stability, with a temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of −16.99 ppm/°C and a turning point at 150 °C. In contrast, the one with the sapphire-based substrate provides a moderate TCF of −22.15 ppm/°C and remains linear for temperatures above 200 °C. This study reveals the impact of different substrate structures on the performance of SAW resonators, providing guidance for the design of desired SAW devices and their applications.},

In this study, we present an alternative approach to flexoelectric-induced domain engineering in suspended two-dimensional CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS) membranes by varying the ambient pressure. By capping CIPS over cavity holes, internal air pressurization induces bulging, which results in unique encircled domain configurations governed by local strain gradients showing upward and downward polarizations at the center and the edge of the suspended membrane, respectively. Furthermore, this domain configuration can be bidirectionally modulated by varying the ambient pressure. We demonstrate reversible variations in domain size, driven by topographic changes that redistribute the strain gradient. Our findings demonstrate that ambient pressure can be used to engineer domains in suspended ferroelectric membranes, opening avenues for the development of emerging ferroelectric devices that are sensitive to ambient pressure.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the avalanche dynamics of ferroelectric domain switching in barium titanate single crystals across a range of temperatures using acoustic emission techniques. Ferroelectric domain switching induced by an electric field exhibits scale-invariant avalanche dynamics, with the energy exponent increasing from 1.63 ± 0.067 at room temperature to 1.92 ± 0.045 near the Curie point, before decreasing at higher temperatures. This peak in the exponent is attributed to the interplay between equilibrium critical fluctuations and avalanche criticality. As the temperature approaches the Curie point, smaller domains and reduced polarization promote lower-energy switching, increasing the energy exponent. Near the Curie temperature, equilibrium fluctuations further modify the energy landscape, likely generating more phase boundaries and amplifying the energy exponent. Above the Curie temperature, electric field-induced phase transition dominates the switching process, where the higher energy barrier hinders switching, resulting in more energetic events and a lower energy exponent. Across all temperatures, waiting time distributions exhibit double power-law behavior, with exponents of −1 ± 0.05 for short times and −2 ± 0.10 for long times, while aftershock activity follows Omori&#39;s law with an exponent close to −1, indicating robust temporal correlations in ferroelectric domain switching.

By employing floating-zone synthesis with proper heat-treatment process, we systematically tune oxygen vacancies and reveal their dual effect: oxygen vacancies enhance the pyroelectric figure-of-merit, while removing oxygen vacancies extends the effective lifetime in one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion. We discover that the phase transition in a heat-treated single crystal SBN60 device helps achieve stable electricity generation for approximately 7000 cycles in 30 h with enhanced functional reversibility.

In this work, the high-pressure structural, vibrational, and electrical transport properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 up to 60.0 GPa under different hydrostatic environments were systematically studied by Raman spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, and first-principles theoretical calculations. Under non-hydrostatic compression, Nb 2 GeTe 4 experienced a metallization at 11.8 GPa originating from the closure of bandgap due to the considerable compression of interlayer distance and sequential an isostructural phase transition (IPT) at 26.5 GPa. The comparable metallization pressure and the pronounced delay of IPT by ∼4.0 GPa under hydrostatic condition can be reasonably interpreted by the influence of deviatoric stress. Upon decompression, the phase transition of Nb 2 GeTe 4 was demonstrated to be reversible with the possible structural destruction under different hydrostatic environments. Moreover, Nb 2 GeTe 4 underwent a Ohmic-to-super-Ohmic conversion at 1000 mV under high pressure, which was presumably caused by the higher sinusoidal voltage than its thermal voltage. These findings enrich our foundational comprehension on high-pressure physicochemical properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 , thereby fostering its potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

We measure an increase in α by a factor of × 8 when the YIG is vacuum annealed at 300 °C. No such changes in α are observed when annealed at the same temperature in 1 × 10 −1 mbar of oxygen. We suggest that the main driver for the increase in α is the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , as demonstrated by soft x-ray magnetic spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {A magnetic skyrmion exhibits topological protection property, making it a highly promising candidate as an information carrier in spintronic devices. However, this information carrier may face deformation issues when driven by high current densities, causing the unstable message transmission. In this work, we explore the skyrmion deformation under different magnetic systems, including ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems. We conduct micromagnetic simulations and provide a theoretical analysis of AFM skyrmion deformation, where the skyrmion demonstrates the lowest susceptibility to deformation. We derive a canting term based on the Thiele equation, pointing out an essential term that explains the AFM deformation depression reason. This finding also indicates that the AFM system offers superior stability for skyrmion, making it a promising choice for better option for skyrmion-based spintronics devices.},

In this work, through micromagnetic simulations, we analyze the impact of changes in the size and position of the ring&#39;s hole on magnetization resonant modes in Permalloy eccentric nanorings. Our results show that the magnetization ground state forms a vortex centered either on the hole or on the geometric center of the nanoring, depending on the hole&#39;s position. The observed magnetic patterns yield spin wave modes that split when increasing the ring eccentricity. The new resonant frequencies are associated with hybridized radial and azimuthal modes, which form butterfly-like patterns, which are also observed in magnetic field-driven deviations of vortices from the center of nanodots. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the interplay between geometry and magnetization dynamics, which is crucial for designing magnetic nanostructures with specific functional properties.},

Rare earth (RE) metals, which are promising candidates for tuning spin transmission, can form antiferromagnetically coupled interfaces with ferromagnetic layers. In this study, we investigate the laser-induced ultrafast spin injection from permalloy (Py) into the RE metal holmium (Ho), modulated by interfacial engineering and varying the external magnetic field strength. The antiferromagnetically coupled interface between Py and Ho is confirmed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and its correlation with spin dynamic damping is revealed by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. More importantly, we demonstrate the effective modulation of spin transmission through an external magnetic field. At the Py/Ho interface, a substantial spin-mixing conductance (SMC) of approximately 7.71 × 10 15 cm −2 is observed, which can be modulated by approximately 35% under an external magnetic field. The applied high magnetic fields are found to suppress the large SMC, primarily due to the modified sperimagnetic structure at the Py/Ho interface. These findings demonstrate the excellent spin transmission efficiency in the Py/Ho system, providing a promising approach for magneto-dynamics modulation in spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Diamond and graphene, which have extremely high thermal conductivity, are considered ideal candidates for the preparation of high-performance thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the development of flexible TIMs with efficient heat transfer paths still hampers their thermal management applications. Herein, a highly oriented diamond–graphene composite film (DGCF) was prepared by one-step microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition on carbon cloth (CC) using N-butylamine as a single liquid carbon source. The hybridized composition of sp 3 /sp 2 and the heat transfer path length of DGCF are regulated by the deposition temperature and the thermal conductivity of CC/DGCF at 30 °C is 2.71 W m −1 K −1 , which is 15 times higher than that of CC. Further flexible TIMs of CC/DGCF are achieved using thermal silicone grease (TG) as filler, and the thermal conductivity of the final flexible compound of CC/DGCF/TG is 6.97 W m −1 K −1 at 30 °C, which is 39 times higher than that of pure CC and 2 times higher than that of TG, respectively. In the actual TIMs performance test, the cooling efficiency is 1.4 times higher than that of the commercial thermal conductive silicone pad. Furthermore, finite element simulations demonstrated that the film at 800 °C has the optimal sp 3 /sp 2 ratio for thermal response and the best thermal conductivity path structure. This finding provides a method for the design of highly flexible TIMs and increases the possibility of their practical application in electronic thermal management.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies have shown that higher-order phonon–phonon scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ lat ⁠ ) of 2D-GaN, with the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) calculated using experienced atomic displacement in the finite difference method. In this work, it is found that the 4th-IFCs of 2D-GaN are quite sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite difference method. The effects of the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent 4th-IFCs. The κ lat from three-phonon scattering is reduced by 65.6% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was previously thought the electron–phonon interactions have significant effects on the κ lat of two-dimensional materials. However, the effects of electron–phonon interactions on the κ lat of both n -type and p -type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be neglected due to the few phonon–electron scattering channels and the relatively strong four-phonon scattering.},

Our investigation examines the lattice constants and electronic energy bandgaps of both the superlattice structures and alloys across different Al concentrations, shedding light on the intricate relationship between composition and electronic properties. The analysis on electronic properties reveals that as the number of Al 2 O 3 monolayers in the Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 superlattice rises from 2 to 6 monolayers, the bandgap correspondingly expands from 5.29 to 6.43 eV.

An energy band model for carbon defect dynamics was established based on transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our model discernibly reveals that C N and tri-carbon in GaN intricately modulate both the absorption spectrum and carrier capture process: The rapid capture of holes by the C N defect significantly reduces the hole recombination time to hundreds of femtoseconds in the near-infrared band. Conversely, the tri-carbon defect exhibited a higher absorption cross section by an order of magnitude than that of free carrier in the visible region with a long carrier recombination time.

Typically, heterovalent impurities, or dopants, are added to semiconducting QDs to provide extra electrons and improve conductivity. Since each QD is expected to contain a few dopants, the extra electrons and their parent dopants have been difficult to locate. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of the extra electrons and their parent donors in epitaxial InAs/GaAs QDs using local-electrode atom-probe tomography and self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson simulations in the effective mass approximation. Although dopants are provided in both layers, the ionized donors primarily reside outside of the QDs, providing extra electrons that are contained within the QDs. Indeed, due to the quantum confinement-induced enhancement of the donor ionization energy within the QDs, a lower fraction of dopants within the QDs are ionized. These findings suggest a pathway toward the development of 3D modulation-doped nanostructures.},

Compared with its monolayer counterpart, the valley/spin polarization in the SVSiN 2 bilayer is highly tunable by electric field. Specifically, different stackings, magnetic orders, and vertical electric fields could result in various transport behaviors for the SVSiN 2 bilayer, including spin Hall current, valley Hall current, and anomalous Hall current with different valley, spin, and layer combinations. In addition, the AB and AC stacked SVSiN 2 bilayers with mirror symmetry breaking exhibit the coexistence of ferrovalley and ferroelectric polarization.

  abstract     = {In this Letter, high-voltage enhancement-mode (E-mode) GaN-based power devices were demonstrated by employing an ultrathin barrier epitaxial structure. We investigated the effects of interface states introduced by the barrier etching process on the devices&#39; reliability by fabricating and comparing metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS)-field effect transistors (FETs) without an AlGaN barrier layer and MIS-high electron mobility transistors (MIS-HEMTs) with a barrier layer. The threshold voltages (V th ) of the fabricated MIS-HEMT and MIS-FET reach 0.14 and 2.5 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the fabricated devices exhibited a high off-state breakdown voltage over 1500 V. Compared to high interface trap density (D it ) at the SiN/GaN interface of MIS-FET, a much lower D it was found at the SiN/AlGaN interface of MIS-HEMT owing to the barrier recess-free process. Thus, the MIS-HEMT exhibits a negligible V th shift tested via positive bias temperature instability, which is crucial in the practical application for the E-mode operation. Furthermore, a scheme of extracting the D it of the devices from the flatband voltages (V FB ) shift of C–V curves was developed, and the accuracy of the scheme was verified by multi-frequency C–V tests.},

  abstract     = {This work reveals the significant advantages of high-temperature nitrogen (N) ion implantation for fabricating current-blocking layers (CBLs) in β -Ga 2 O 3 . A comparative investigation on the structural and electrical properties of N-implanted β -Ga 2 O 3 was conducted under different implantation temperatures and post-implantation annealing (PIA) conditions. The results showed that the high-temperature implantation (HTI) at 500 °C, compared to the room-temperature implantation (RTI), introduced fewer structural defects and less lattice distortion to β -Ga 2 O 3 . The HTI-formed CBL demonstrated a far superior current-blocking capability than those formed by the RTI with/without a PIA, in terms of a much lower and more stable leakage current and a significantly enhanced breakdown voltage. Additionally, lateral MOSFETs fabricated with the HTI isolation exhibited a three orders of magnitude lower off-state leakage current while maintaining excellent on-state performance, compared to those using the isolation formed by RTI with PIA. These findings indicate that the in situ dynamic annealing effect of HTI effectively reduces implantation-induced damage, enhances impurity activation, and improves the overall performance of the N-implanted CBLs in β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

  abstract     = {The GaN family as an electronic material and AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as electronic devices have found their widespread usage in power electronics and radio frequency (RF) applications. The threshold voltage is a crucial parameter, and application-specific threshold voltage is a requirement for this technology. A large positive threshold voltage with enhancement-mode operation is useful for power electronics. A depletion-mode transistor is used for radio frequency (RF) applications where the electron mobility is much larger in the channel region due to low interface roughness. A multi-threshold voltage transistor is a desired feature to reduce nonlinearity through compensation in RF applications. We address the issue with threshold voltage by demonstrating a programmable threshold AlGaN/GaN transistor using a dielectric stack as the charge-trapping layer. We have fabricated and characterized a triple-layer dielectric gate stack for AlGaN/GaN metal–insulator–semiconductor HEMTs. The gate stack comprises a high-k tantalum oxide sandwiched between two aluminum oxide layers. The structure is analogous to the polysilicon–aluminum oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon memory used in silicon technology. In addition to providing a large programmable threshold voltage window, the fabricated diodes reduce the gate leakage current by more than four orders of magnitude. The experimental observations are explained by the band edge alignment of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure with the dielectric stack and using a charge-trapping process by a high positive program voltage.},

This CCW phenomenon is due to the dipole formation between the a-In 2 O 3 channel and the SiO X gate insulator by relocating oxygen atoms under the influence of the applied electric field. Hence, bipolar switching of gate bias (V GS ) alters the dipole direction and leads to low (V TL ) and high (V TH ) threshold voltages. The dipole formation increases with the electric field, which can be tailored by gate oxide (SiO X ) thickness or gate bias (V GS ). Therefore, the devices with a gate oxide thickness of 200 nm initially showed the clockwise hysteresis at V GS of 2 V, transformed to the CCW (MW of 4.2 V) with an increase in gate bias to 14 V. Therefore, a difference in oxygen density at the interface can form a dipole to exhibit the CCW phenomenon and behave FeFET-like.},

  abstract     = {Dual-main-phase (DMP) magnets, a promising approach for the efficient utilization of high-abundance rare earth elements, exhibit enhanced coercivity compared to single-main-phase (SMP) magnets. This study demonstrates that a DMP magnet exhibits a 43 kA/m coercivity increase over an SMP magnet of equivalent composition. Microstructural characterization reveals two main-phase grains with distinct core–shell structures in the DMP magnet. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the increased Nd content enhances the anisotropy field of the shells in Ce-rich grains, crucially contributing to the coercivity enhancement. Conversely, Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains do not significantly enhance coercivity. A micromagnetic model, constructed by substituting Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains with (Nd 0.5 Ce 0.5 ) 2 Fe 14 B grains, demonstrates a slight coercivity increase compared to the DMP magnets. Moreover, retaining only the core–shell structure in grains near the end faces maintains higher coercivity than that of DMP magnets. Experimental results of DyCoCu grain boundary diffusion show a 406 kA/m coercivity increase in the DMP magnet, less than the 510 kA/m increase in the diffused SMP magnet. Although diffusion significantly increases the anisotropy field in the shell, the core region of the Ce-rich grains maintains a low anisotropy field, limiting magnetic property enhancement. These findings underscore the critical role of an optimized core–shell structure in enhancing coercivity for Ce-rich magnets, suggesting that the DMP method may not represent the most effective strategy.},

However, the dimensional stability of those composites is not guaranteed due to the residual stress generated during fabrication and the microstructure instability of the matrix. Here, we studied the effects of heat treatments on the dimensional stability of ZTE Cu 2 P 2 O 7 /ZL101 composite (with 32 vol. % of ZL101) prepared using the pressure infiltration method. Compared with the as-cast case, after a certain heat treatment (water quenching after holding at 773 K for 1 h, then aging at 463 K for 8 h, and finally thermal-cold cycling between 463 and 77 K for three times), the dimensional stability was improved by a factor of 20 and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was highly reproducible in the subsequent temperature cycles test. The treated composite exhibits a CTE of −0.028 ppm/K at 240–305 K and a relatively high thermal conductivity of 29.5 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature, leading to a thermal distortion parameter well less than those of other ZTE materials. The improved dimensional stability and the CTE reproducibility can be attributed to the stabilization of matrix microstructure and the greatly relaxed residual stress as revealed by the analysis of 2θ-sin 2 ψ based on x-ray diffraction.},

In this work, we propose a three-dimensional carbon allotrope by interpenetrating α -graphyne sheets with van der Waals interactions and study its structural and electronic properties by first-principles calculations and tight-binding methods. Our calculations show that the energy of this interpenetrated α -graphyne is slightly lower than that of the α -graphyne nanosheet due to the weak van der Waals interactions, and its dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities are further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Remarkably, 3D interpenetrated α -graphyne is a semimetal with both Dirac nodal loops and triply degenerate nodal points near the Fermi level and the Fermi velocities at these nodal points are very high. These properties are superior to 2D α -graphyne and ordinary 3D carbon materials. Our work not only proposes a type of 3D carbon material with multiple types of fermions for carbon-based high-speed nanoelectronic devices but also shows that interpenetrating 2D materials with large hollows is a promising method for constructing 3D materials.},

A combination of HVPE and AlN substrate enabled decreasing deleterious carbon concentration and dislocation density, respectively, thus accentuating the influences of V Al -complexes on the luminescence processes. A low-temperature CL spectrum of unintentionally doped AlN exhibited predominant excitonic emissions at around 6 eV and a marginal deep-state emission band at around 3.7 eV that originates from residual carbon (&lt;10 16 cm −3 ) on nitrogen sites ( ⁠ C N ⁠ ). However, the sample was revealed to contain a considerable amount ( ⁠ ∼ 10 17 cm − 3 ⁠ ) of vacancy clusters, most likely comprising a V Al and nitrogen-vacancies ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ), namely, V Al V N 1 − 2 ⁠ , which act as nonradiative recombination centers that decrease overall CL intensity at elevated temperatures. With increasing Si-doping concentration ([Si]), major vacancy species progressively changed from V Al V N 1 − 2 to V Al O N 1 − 2 ⁠ , where O N is oxygen on N sites, which exhibit other deep-state emission bands ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 eV. Further increase in [Si] gave rise to the formation of donor-compensating defects comprising V Al and Si on the second-nearest-neighbor Al sites ( ⁠ Si Al ⁠ ), abbreviated by V Al − Si Al n ⁠ , which exhibit emission shoulders at around 2.9–3.0 eV. When [Si] exceeded 5 × 10 18 cm −3 , an emission band at around 4.5 eV emerged, which had been ascribed to originate from the nearest-neighbor Si Al C N complexes. Because V Al -complexes, including those containing impurities, are thermally stable, incorporation of vacancies should be blocked at the growth stage.},

Antimony selenide is well known for its thermoelectric properties. However, the on-surface synthesis of chain-like structures with varying stoichiometries remains challenging. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the epitaxial growth of SbSe chain structures. With increasing deposition of Sb and Se, a transition is observed in both the structural and electronic properties, shifting from semiconducting mixed chains to metallic uniform tri-chains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the elemental composition and helps determine the stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations show that the mixed-chain phase is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.17 eV, and that spin–orbit coupling induces band splitting. In contrast, the tri-chain phase, formed by weak van der Waals interactions between chains within the unit cell, undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition due to strong hybridization near the Fermi level. These findings not only provide a strategy for tuning the electronic properties of one-dimensional materials but also provide valuable insights for the design of thermoelectric and quantum materials, with potential applications in next-generation electronic devices.},

It was found that cubic CoSbS exhibits a higher solid solubility of Ni at the Co site compared to the orthorhombic sample. The high-density point defect Ni Co in cubic CoSbS results in enhanced phonon scattering, thereby sharply suppressing phonon thermal conductivity. First-principles calculations show that the cubic structure of CoSbS exhibits higher band degeneracy and greater band dispersion compared to the orthorhombic structure, resulting in superior electrical transport properties. As a result, an enhanced figure of merit zT ∼ 0.37 was obtained at 773 K for cubic Ni 0.1 Co 0.9 SbS, which is approximately 16% higher than that of the orthorhombic sample prepared by the same method. These results indicate that employing high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis techniques offers a practical and controllable approach to modulate the crystal structure and thermoelectric performance of CoSbS.},

  abstract     = {The inverse design of solid-state materials with targeted properties represents a significant challenge in materials science, particularly for piezoelectric semiconductors where both structural symmetry and electronic properties must be carefully controlled. Here, we employ the simplified line-input crystal-encoding system representation combined with the MatterGPT framework for discovering potential piezoelectric semiconductors. By training on a curated dataset of 1556 piezoelectric materials from the Materials Project database, our model learns to generate crystal structures with targeted piezoelectric properties through an autoregressive sampling process. Starting from approximately 5000 generated structures, we implemented a comprehensive screening workflow incorporating structural validity, thermodynamic stability, and property verification. This approach identified several promising candidates from 4100 reconstructed structures, each representing compounds unrecorded in existing databases. Among these, the most notable material demonstrated a piezoelectric stress coefficient of 25.9 C / m 2 in the e[1,6] direction. Additionally, these materials demonstrate suitable bandgaps ranging from 1.63 to 3.61 eV, suggesting potential applications in high-sensitivity sensors and high-temperature electronics. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining crystal structure language encoding with generative models for accelerating the discovery of functional materials with targeted properties.},

  abstract     = {The reversible transformation of radiative cooling and solar heating of the film is significant for a building&#39;s energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. The current technology is constrained by its reliance on complex control mechanisms and a narrow control scope, which collectively impede its practical deployment. In this Letter, we introduce an all-season smart film, a multilayer film composed of In 3 SbTe 2 (IST), CaF 2 , and ZnS on an Al substrate, which possesses the unique ability to synergistically modulate solar-thermal radiation. The solar absorptance and infrared emittance are ( a normal , ε normal ) = (0.829, 0.055) for the solar heating mode and (0.361, 0.835) for the radiative cooling mode, respectively. The underlying mechanism pertains to the Fabry–Pérot resonance and antireflection. The modulation property of the smart film remains excellent even when the incident angle is large. Furthermore, the smart film is capable of achieving multilevel modulation through the alteration of the crystalline IST percentage. The excellent modulation properties of the smart film are substantiated through a quantitative assessment of the net heat flux for terrestrial applications. This analysis reveals that the smart film with amorphous IST achieves a solar heating flux of 800 W/m 2 at 250 K, while for crystalline IST it exhibits a radiative cooling flux of 600 W/m 2 at 330 K. Such a simple multilayer structure can be easily fabricated, which would facilitate the advancement and practical implementation of an all-season smart film.},

  abstract     = {Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is widely employed as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells due to its low manufacturing cost and favorable energy-level alignment. However, the suboptimal quality of TiO 2 films and the presence of multiple defects at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, such as uncoordinated Pb 2+ and oxygen vacancy defects, significantly compromise both device efficiency and stability. This study proposes a synergistic passivation strategy through the introduction of an acetylamino-functionalized interlayer between the perovskite and TiO 2 . The acetylamino groups within the passivation layer establish strong interactions with uncoordinated Pb 2+ in the perovskite, thereby enhancing interface stability. Acetylamino groups can also interact with the TiO 2 layer by bonding with Ti 4+ and reducing oxygen vacancy defects, thereby enhancing the electron transport potential of the TiO 2 layer. The enhanced hydrophobicity of the TiO 2 film, induced by the passivation layer, further promotes perovskite crystallization by minimizing surface tension effects during film growth. Therefore, the device efficiency significantly increased from 16.49% to 19.26%. The lifetime of the unencapsulated device was evaluated under environmental conditions (relative humidity: 30% ± 5%, temperature: 25 ± 5 °C). The efficiency of the unmodified device decreased to 75.3% after 800 h, whereas the modified device maintained 90.1% of its initial efficiency, demonstrating higher stability.},

In this work, we demonstrate that the chemical activity of deposited species is crucial for determining the structure of the 3D/2D heterointerface. During pulsed laser deposition, the chemical activity of SrTiO 3 (STO) can be adjusted by controlling the oxygen partial pressure. Therefore, the relative contributions of chemical and vdW interactions at the STO/mica interface can be tuned.

At room temperature (RT), the MIS-HEMT fabricated with an atomic layer deposited (ALD)-Al 2 O 3 (MIS-HEMT B) exhibits higher maximum drain current ( I d,max ), peak transconductance ( g m,max ), and lower subthreshold slope ( SS ) and gate leakage current compared to MIS-HEMT A fabricated without ex situ Al 2 O 3 , signifying the effectiveness of the ALD-Al 2 O 3 layer to passivate severe surface states. Of note, when the temperature rises from 298 to 423 K, the values of I d,max and g m,max decrease noticeably, while SS and gate leakage current increase considerably in both MIS-HEMTs A and B. However, MIS-HEMT B demonstrates a lower degradation rate in various device properties at 423 K compared to MIS-HEMT A, implying that ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation improves thermal stability. Additionally, ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation reduces the interface state density from 7.48 × 10 12 to 5.3 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 , highlighting its critical role in improving overall device performance.},

Most nonvolatile diodes are realized in ferroelectric systems, but size effects in ferroelectrics limit device miniaturization. In this work, we demonstrate an electrically tunable nonvolatile diode based on non-ferroelectric two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures of GeSe and a quasi-2D electron gas on SrTiO 3 surfaces. The device achieves a tunable current rectification ratio of 10 3 –10 4 without gate bias application, with a continuously adjustable turn-on voltage from 0.1 to 2.1 V. Furthermore, the heterostructure demonstrates nonvolatile resistance switching behavior induced by applied bias voltage. The integration of electrical tunability and non-volatility in a single non-ferroelectric diode offers a promising platform for low-dimensional nonvolatile memory devices with multi-bit storage capability.},

While the LM facilitated the handling of the droplet, LM breaks down upon squeezing, which limits the robust handling. Here, we show that LM exhibits high compression stability when the jammed particles distort the liquid surface to form sub- to single-micron roughness. We find that the particle layers&#39; distortion increases with the evaporation of the inner liquid. Thus, we regulated the evaporation degree of the droplet by varying the mixing ratio of the nonvolatile and volatile liquids. First, we show the regulation of the mixing ratio and its effect on the equilibrium LM static shape and particle layer structure. Then, the effect of the LMs&#39; surface structure on their mechanical response is explored. When 90% of the inner liquid is evaporated, the submicrometer wrinkle structure appears on the LM surface. We name the LM with the wrinkle structure “wrinkled liquid marble (WLM).” The WLM exhibited high compression stability and significantly higher resilience force than the droplet one. We believe this work helps the practical use of the LMs by improving their mechanical stability. Moreover, the fundamental understanding of the particle layer stability at the interface can be advanced.},

The wavelength selectivity in the silicon metasurface corresponding to different configurations enables the GaSe film/silicon tunable metasurface heterostructure to have a response in the range of 1500–1630 nm, covering the telecommunication C and L bands. The response spectrum is derived from the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance of the metasurface structure, and the pump light and signal light correspond to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances of the metasurface structure. The high quality-factor of the quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance brought by the metasurface greatly improves the density of the electromagnetic field near the GaSe film, thus improving the sum-frequency generation conversion efficiency in the GaSe film. The pump and signal corresponding to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances introduced by the silicon metasurface are designed in the telecommunication band, while the sum-frequency light is located in the range that can be directly detected by a silicon detector. The low noise level in a silicon detector can guarantee the high sensitivity detection of shortwave infrared light. The results indicate that the upconversion detector attained a peak detectivity of 1.4 × 10 12 Jones at 1555.1 nm, comparable to commercial broadband InGaAs detectors (Thorlabs).},

To date, quantum memories have been realized in many different systems. However, most of them have complex structures and high cost. Besides, it is not easy to simultaneously achieve both high storage efficiency and fidelity. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a low-cost optical quantum memory with high efficiency and high fidelity, by utilizing a butterfly-shaped cavity consisting of one polarization beam splitter, two reflecting mirrors, and one pockels cell crystal. In order to quantify the quality of the quantum memory, we carry out tomography measurements on the time-bin qubits encoded with weak coherent states after storage for N rounds. The storage efficiency per round can reach up to 95.0%, and the overall state fidelity can exceed 99.1%. It thus seems very promising for practical implementation in quantum communication and networks.},

However, the efficiency of traditional lead halide PSCs is approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit, prompting interest in tin-lead perovskite solar cells (Eg ≈ 1.25 eV) as a candidate for tandem configurations with the potential to surpass this limit. A key challenge lies in optimizing the hole transport layer (HTL), as widely used PEDOT:PSS suffers from high acidity and poor crystallinity, hindering device performance. In this work, we used a formic acid modification of PEDOT:PSS to enhance its conductivity, energy band alignment, and crystallinity. Acid treatment promotes proton transfer, reducing insulating PSS chains and improving phase separation, thereby facilitating efficient hole transport. Tin–lead perovskite films fabricated on formic acid-treated PEDOT:PSS (Fa-PEDOT:PSS) exhibit improved crystallinity, larger grain size, and reduced defect density. Devices incorporating Fa-PEDOT:PSS demonstrate enhanced photovoltaic performance, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.87% with reduced hysteresis and excellent stability, retaining ∼90% of initial efficiency after 1600 h in an inert atmosphere. These findings highlight the potential of acid-treated PEDOT:PSS as an optimized HTL for tin–lead PSCs, paving the way for high-efficiency, environmentally friendly photovoltaic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have recently attracted considerable attention as promising drug carriers. In vivo imaging of AuNPs is required to investigate their pharmacokinetics. However, a direct and highly sensitive method has not yet been established. Therefore, we proposed the activation imaging of AuNPs that radioactivates AuNPs and non-invasively visualizes them using the emitted gamma rays. When the stable isotope of gold, 197 Au ⁠ , is irradiated with low-energy neutrons, it changes to radioactive 198 Au ⁠ , which predominantly emits 412-keV gamma rays. In this study, we synthesized [ 198 Au ] AuNPs through neutron irradiation and intratumorally injected them into tumor-bearing mice. In vivo imaging was performed using wideband x rays and gamma rays imager, and the distribution of [ 198 Au ] AuNPs in the body of mice was observed. Furthermore, we labeled the alpha-emitting therapeutic drug 211 At with [ 198 Au ] AuNPs ⁠ . Although 211 At itself can be visualized using its 79-keV x rays, the long-term tracking of 211 At -labeled AuNPs has been challenging due to its relatively short half-life of 7.2 h. The activation of AuNPs enables the long-term tracking of 211 At -labeled AuNPs owing to the 2.7-day half-life of 198 Au ⁠ . 211 At -labeled [ 198 Au ] AuNPs were injected intravenously into mice and visualized using a wideband x rays and gamma rays imager. Simultaneous imaging of 211 At and 198 Au was performed on the day of injection and 2 days after injection. Although 211 At could no longer be imaged 2 days after injection, the distribution of the drug was visualized using gamma rays from 198 Au ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {Perylenequinones are important photosensitizers commonly used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to their efficient photoreactivity and photostability, which originate from excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Herein, the mechanisms of ESIPT are explored through first-principle calculations, and the slowly-turned-on and rapidly-turned-off (STRT) laser pulse steered ground and excited states population redistribution of perylenequinone is characterized by employing time-dependent wave packet methods. It is revealed that the strengthened hydrogen bond favors proton transfer in the S 1 state, and due to enhanced non-resonant excitation and reduced energy exchange between the wave packet and external field during the falling period, the asymmetric pulses could increase the excited-state population, leading to improved excitation efficiency. Compared to traditional Gauss-type laser pulses, the optimization of STRT parameters (i.e., falling time, intensity, and wavelength) could bring more population in the excited state (&gt;80%) and promote subsequent proton transfer processes that are responsible for enhancing therapeutic effects during PDT. The present work offers valuable insights into the interactions between external fields and molecules, paving the way for optimized drug delivery systems with minimal damage to normal tissue and enhanced therapeutic efficacy.},

However, it is still unclear whether a nonmetallic filament conductive mechanism could exist in these thinnest memristors. Here, the resistive switching characteristics of h -BN atomristors with different electrodes are systematically investigated, it is found that the switching processes in these thinnest memory devices are primarily dominated by the interactions between electrode-atoms and defects in the dielectric layer, and the resistive switching mechanism in these atomic devices could be tuned by the kind of single-defect. Based on this, we propose a nonmetal filament conductive mechanism according to the nitrogen vacancy ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ) enhanced conductivity effect in a single layer h -BN.

However, it is confronted with the spurious mode issue, which can cause in-band ripples in filters. To obtain a cleaner frequency spectrum response, we propose an XBAR with a wave-shaped interdigital transducer (IDT) to suppress spurious modes. It is revealed by using a finite element method model, and spurious modes are significantly eliminated in the passband due to the non-parallel boundary of IDTs. We then experimentally verify the theoretical analyses. The wave-shaped XBAR is fabricated based on a Z-cut LiNbO 3 thin film, showing a nearly spurious-free impedance response. Then a filter based on the wave-shaped XBAR is fabricated, with fewer in-band ripples, featuring a center frequency of 5.77 GHz and a 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 7.8%.

The high-frequency SBDs suffer from the trade-off between the frequency ( f c ) and breakdown voltage ( V br ). We solved this problem with the gradient doping technique, and the f c and V br were improved at the same time. For the proposed gradient doped GaN SBD, the doping concentration of the drift layer increases gradually from top to bottom. Then, the capacitance was reduced by the lightly doped surface region, while the series resistance was reduced by the heavily doped bottom region. As a result, f c was improved, and a high f c of 710 GHz was obtained. In addition, V br was also enhanced by the lightly doped surface region, and a high V br of 28 V was achieved. As a consequence, f c · V br of the proposed SBD is about 2 times that of the previous GaN SBDs, which is a great improvement. The gradient doping technology fully exploits the potential of GaN SBD in high frequency and high voltage, making GaN SBD a promising candidate for terahertz (THz) applications.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-flexible all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are increasingly attracting attention as a complementary technology to traditional solar cells. This study developed mechanically durable ultra-flexible transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) made of polyimide (PI)/silver nanowire (AgNW), which were integrated into all-PSCs. Tensile and bending tests showed that the PI/AgNW TCE displayed higher flexibility and stability than the commercial polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/indium tin oxide (ITO) with R 0 /R 30000 of 1.0, Young modulus of 176.7 MPa, and elongation at break of 12.8%. When combined with the non-fullerene polymer acceptor, the all-polymer 9′-(2,12-di-tert-butyl-5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracen-7-yl)-9,9′′-diphenyl-9H,9′H,9′′H-3,3′:6′,3′′-tercarbazole (PM6):regio-regular polymer acceptor (PYF-T-o) device exhibited highly improved flexibility, maintaining a power conversion efficiency of 12.42% by 99.3% after 800 bending cycles. This performance far surpassed that of small molecule non-fullerene acceptor PM6: 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]-thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) devices using PET/ITO and PI/AgNW TCEs. The toughening mechanisms of TCEs and devices were further analyzed through finite element simulations, highlighting the importance of optimizing the mechanical properties of both the TCE and the active layer. This study underscores the significant potential of PI/AgNW-based all-PSCs in the field of ultra-flexible solar cells.},

An essential type of quantum interference with drastic destructive-constructive switching, known as Fano interference, has been widely reported in various kinds of nanoelectronics electronic systems, but not yet been electrostatically gating in a single-molecule device. Here, we fabricate the three-terminal single-molecule transistors based on the molecule with a long backbone and a side group to demonstrate the gate-controllable Fano interference. By applying bias and gate voltages, the two-dimensional differential conductance map shows the noncentrosymmetrical Fano patterns. Combined with the electron transport model and the first principles calculations, the resonant parameters of the Fano interference can unveil the coupling geometry of the junction and the spatial distribution of the resonant states. Our findings provide an instrumental method to induce and utilize the quantum interference behaviors at the molecular level.},

While it has been widely reported in chiral magnets, oxide heterostructures, and hybrid systems such as ferromagnet/heavy metal and ferromagnet/topological insulators, the study of non-collinear spin texture in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) monolayers is relatively lacking, hindering the understanding at the atomically thin scale. Here, we probe the temperature-dependent antisymmetric humps in Hall resistivity by utilizing the proximity coupling of Fe-doped monolayer WSe 2 (Fe:WSe 2 ) synthesized using chemical vapor deposition on a Pt Hall bar. Multiple characterization methods were employed to demonstrate that Fe atoms substitutionally replace W atoms, making a 2D vdW DMS at room temperature. Distinct from the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, we found the transverse Hall resistivity of Fe:WSe 2 displaying two additional antisymmetric peak features in the temperature-dependent measurements. These peaks are attributed to the magnetic features at the Fe:WSe 2 and Pt interface. Our work shows that a DMS synthesized from 2D vdW transition metal dichalcogenides is promising for realizing magnetic and spintronic applications.},

The simulation results exhibited good agreement with the observed voltage transient behavior and predictions from the nucleation-limited-switching model. Although the capacitor achieved a comparable polarization distribution after the relaxation process, the pathways to reach the static state differed for the different writing signals. Specifically, writing signals with higher amplitude result in more complex polarization domain structures just after the signal is turned off. Analysis of the relaxation process revealed that the dielectric component dominated the early stage, whereas domain-wall motion became more dominant in the later stage. These insights into the polarization relaxation dynamics will contribute to improvements in the operational speed and reliability of ferroelectric devices.},

Because a certain level of thermal budget is required to achieve ferroelectricity in 10 nm HZO thin films, the crystallization temperature can be lowered below 400 °C by simply increasing the annealing time. In addition, the analysis of the crystallization behavior of HZO thin films based on the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov model revealed that longer annealing times are required to lower the annealing temperature for HZO crystallization due to the limitation of the crystallization rate. Consequently, low-temperature (&lt;400 °C) ferroelectric HZO thin films with large remanent polarization along with improved leakage behavior and endurance were realized. These results not only facilitate the back-end-of-line integration of HZO thin films but also demonstrate the feasibility of in situ HZO crystallization by thermal budget for subsequent interconnect formation, simplifying the overall process and saving costs by eliminating a dedicated annealing process.},

Current morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior exhibits a higher permittivity but relatively high leakage. In this work, we propose a feasible approach to achieve MPB and low leakage by the charge balance effect in the doped HfO 2 -ZrO 2 superlattice system. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the synergy effect of doping and oxygen vacancies can achieve lower phase transition barriers between polar and nonpolar phases, suggesting the formation of more MPB regions. Especially for Y dopant, it is more preferred due to the smallest transition barrier. Additionally, defect states arising from oxygen vacancies can be passivized at the charge balance state to enable large bandgap, suppressing leakage currents. This work provides a potential solution for a dielectric material with a higher permittivity and a lower leakage, paving the way for future 3D DRAM capacitors.},

These “singles” are consistent with events occurring within the aluminum athermal phonon collection fins. Similarly, our measured detector noise is higher than the theoretical expectation.

Ferrimagnets (FIM) composed of rare earth and transition metals show peculiar properties near the magnetic compensation point, including an exceptionally high SOT efficiency and a significantly enhanced DMI effective field. Here, we investigate FIM [Co/Gd] N multilayers with a magnetic compensation by varying the number of stacking layers ( N ). The net magnetization is dominated by Co and Gd at small and large N , respectively, with the magnetic compensation point located at N = 9. The DMI effective field, obtained by using a magnetic droplet model, increases substantially when the multilayer approaches its magnetic compensation. Correspondingly, we found the emergence of current-induced magnetization switching in the Gd-dominated region, among which the case of N = 10 was realized without an assistance field. We attribute such magnetization switching behavior to the symmetry breaking provided by DMI, together with its large value and the huge SOT associated with it near the magnetic compensation. Our work establishes the direct connection between the DMI and the field-free SOT switching in rare-earth/transition-metal FIM systems.},

In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO 2 (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin-torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis supports the coexistence of USHE and APHE and demonstrates that both originate from the crystal symmetry of IrO 2 (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The zincblende (B3) to rock salt (B1) in ZnS is a typical pressure-induced phase transition. Meanwhile, B3-ZnS exhibits distinctive multi-phonon coupling behavior. Despite previous studies have explored the B3–B1 transition and phonon behavior in ZnS at room temperature, the effects of low temperature have yet to be experimentally verified. This has resulted in the absence of experimental data on the pressure–temperature ( P–T ) phase diagram at low temperatures. Here, we probe the pressure-induced B3–B1 phase transition and phonon evolution behavior of ZnS at low temperatures (90–300 K) using isothermal compression Raman spectroscopy. We experimentally determine the ZnS B3–B1 phase boundaries at low temperatures and obtain the corresponding Clapeyron slope, dP / dT = −16.4 ± 2.1 MPa/K. In addition, we found that the pressure coefficients ( ⁠ K i T ⁠ ) of all phonon modes of B3-ZnS decrease with decreasing temperature. This is mainly due to the reduction of anharmonic effects at low temperatures. Further, K i T of the multi-phonon coupling states are always larger than those of the single phonon state.},

  abstract     = {As an ultrawide bandgap semiconducting material, Ga 2 O 3 has attracted significant attention in providing a foundation for applications in optoelectronic and power devices. The structural incompatibility and/or lattice mismatch of the substrate poses a challenge in preparing vertical devices using Ga 2 O 3 . Additionally, the challenges Ga 2 O 3 faces in its epitaxy on a silicon substrate further hinder its integration with other silicon-based advanced electronics. This study demonstrated the use of Sr 3 Al 2 O 6 as a sacrificial layer to realize single-crystal freestanding ε-Ga 2 O 3 membranes with physical and performance characteristics comparable to those grown epitaxially on rigid substrates. Importantly, these membranes retained integrity after transfer. Observation of sharp diffraction peaks of ε-Ga 2 O 3 (00 l) orientation in x-ray diffraction indicates excellent single-crystalline characteristics and crystalline quality of ε-Ga 2 O 3 . High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed clear lattice structures belonging to the hexagonal crystal structure of ε-Ga 2 O 3 . The dark current of the photodetector made from freestanding ε-Ga 2 O 3 reaches 10 −12 A at 5 V, while the photocurrent under 100 μ W/cm 2 of 254 nm light illumination reaches 10 −9 A, with a responsivity of 81.16 mA/W, a detectivity of 2.36 × 10 12 Jones, and an external quantum efficiency of 39.67%. Its performance can be compared to or even better than photodetectors made using ε-Ga 2 O 3 directly grown rigid substrates. These results demonstrate that this approach overcomes challenges in fabricating ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based vertical devices and their integration with silicon, laying the groundwork for diverse applications with the next generation of semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Low-symmetry, non-centrosymmetric two-dimensional materials offer a promising basis for applications in multifunctional nanoelectronic devices. In this study, we utilize density functional theory calculations coupled with particle swarm optimization to design a monolayer polymorph of SbP 3 that exhibits monoclinic Pc symmetry and good stability (M-SbP 3 ). M-SbP 3 demonstrates excellent phonon-limited electron mobility of 3525 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature, with an ultrahigh anisotropy ratio of 108, which is four times the previously reported maximum value. Additionally, its optical absorption anisotropy ratio, reaching up to 13.3, is greater than that of most known two-dimensional low-symmetry materials. Due to the high anisotropy of the Young&#39;s modulus, the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson ratios can achieve positive values of 1.29 and 1.91, as well as negative values of −0.43 and −0.88. Furthermore, our results reveal two opposite piezoelectric responses in M-SbP 3 , with significant in-plane piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.5 × 10 −10 and −86.6 × 10 −10 C/m, respectively. These responses are primarily influenced by the clamped-ion term and may be associated with the high anisotropy of the electronic structure. Moreover, the electrical auxetic effects are a natural consequence of the high anisotropic piezoelectric responses. The highly anisotropic optoelectronic, mechanical, and piezoelectric properties, along with the coexisting mechanical and electrical auxetic effects, make M-SbP 3 a promising component for multifunctional nanoelectronic devices.},

These two heterostructures exhibit valley-selective linear dichroism, which enables the optical creation of interlayer or intralayer excitons with selected valley and electric polarization. Furthermore, both the K 2 Br 2 /Sn 2 Te 2 /K 2 Br 2 and Sn 2 Te 2 /K 2 ClBr/Sn 2 Te 2 heterostructures are ferrovalley materials due to the ferroelectricity of Sn 2 Te 2 and the built-in electric field caused by Janus K 2 ClBr, respectively.

  abstract     = {Stacking of freestanding membranes enables the formation of interfaces beyond what can be obtained with classical heteroepitaxy. In particular, twisted interfaces provide unique physical properties not existent in the corresponding individual layers. An ideal twist grain boundary yields an in-plane screw-dislocation network, assuming sufficiently strong interactions across the interface, for example, via covalent or ionic bonding. Hereby, the distance between dislocation lines, that is the length scale of the Moiré pattern, is set by the twist angle between the adjacent crystalline surfaces and the lattice mismatch in case that different materials are placed together. The associated strain gradients of the periodic pattern are especially appealing for oxide-based perovskites due to the intricate connection between surface polarization and subtle structural deformations such as the oxygen octahedra tilt. Recently, freestanding oxide perovskites became available via the sacrificial layer approach, opening a pathway toward oxide-based Moiré materials. Here, we demonstrate efficient bonding of a freestanding SrTiO 3 layer to a SrTiO 3 single-crystal by initially conducting a wafer-bonding process at high temperature and only subsequently dissolving the sacrificial layer. We investigate the twisted SrTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface with x-ray diffraction in grazing incidence geometry and observe clear signatures of a highly periodic lateral superlattice consistent with the formation of a screw-dislocation network. Our work demonstrates a robust route for the fabrication of twisted perovskites and their development into a functional material platform with designed strain gradients at the nanoscale.},

Herein, we investigate charge transfer at organic-perovskite heterojunctions and explore how bandgap engineering can be utilized to modulate interfacial charge dynamics. Using transient absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that charge transfer at the interface of organic-perovskite heterojunction can be regulated and enhanced by increasing the energy level offset, which is achieved through the adjustment of the halide ion ratio in the perovskite material. These findings provide insights into interfacial charge transfer mechanisms and confirm the feasibility of bandgap engineering as a strategy for tailoring charge-transfer properties in organic optoelectronic devices.},

Using a minimalist anisotropic nanofin library, we optimize the phase distribution of the metalens at each designed wavelength with the particle swarm algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate a stable focal length with a deviation of less than 4% and an average focusing efficiency of 80.5% in the visible wavelength range of 450–650 nm. Moreover, we design a multi-wavelength off-axis bi-focal metalens to demonstrate the flexible control of output light phase and dispersion achieved by this method. The generality of this design enables its implementation in various metasurface devices, accelerating applications in high-quality and multi-channel image display.},

Quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) can greatly localize the light field and enhance light–matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing a platform for high quality (Q) factors in chiral light devices. In this paper, we conduct a numerical investigation into the perfect chiral linear and nonlinear optical responses in the high-Q QBIC metasurfaces. The designed metasurface consists of silicon nanodisk tetrameric, and when one of these nanodisks is resized along a specific direction, symmetry breaking occurs within the structure. The high-Q QBICs of 1.13 × 10 4 can be excited by the right circularly polarized (RCP) light, while the response is weaker under the left circularly polarized (LCP) light. The observed circular dichroism (CD) value reaches 0.9988, indicating an almost perfect chiral optical resonance with a high Q-factor. Furthermore, we investigate the third and fifth harmonic generation of this device. Under RCP (LCP) light irradiation, their conversion efficiencies attain 2.99 × 10 − 2 ( ⁠ 7.98 × 10 − 4 ⁠ ) and 2.21 × 10 − 8 ( ⁠ 5.91 × 10 − 11 ⁠ ), and their corresponding harmonic CD values reach 0.948 and 0.994, respectively. Additionally, we calculate the conversion efficiency across different RCP power levels to further validate the generation of the third and fifth harmonics, as well as assess their CD values at varying powers, which show good stability.

The simulations of the PPWGs with both MM-filling types are made with a finite-difference time-domain Landau–Lifshits–Gilbert (LLG) electromagnetic solver MaxLLG, based on a joint solution of the Maxwell and LLG equations. It is shown that in both cases a bandwidth of the “extraordinary” slow forward EMW is wider by approximately an order of magnitude than a bandwidth of a similar wave existing in the PPWG completely filled with a single FM thin layer without wire inclusions. The ultra-wideband effect is observed only for FM MM thin plates located in high-intensity magnetic biased fields.},

In this work, we investigate κ -Ga 2 O 3 epilayers of varying thickness grown on β -Ga 2 O 3 substrates to elucidate the strain-driven phase transition within the intermediate layer at the κ -Ga 2 O 3 / β -Ga 2 O 3 polymorph interface. Reciprocal space mapping and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal that a pseudomorphic wetting layer forms during the early growth, followed by the nucleation of mixed κ / β -phase islands. As the film thickens, strain drives further κ -to- β transitions and thickens the disordered intermediate β -phase layer. First-principles calculations confirm that the κ -to- β phase transition is triggered when the in-plane strain exceeds the threshold value of 2.7%. These findings provide critical insights into phase transitions in Ga 2 O 3 hybrid polymorph structures and suggest future strategies for enhancing interface quality, which is crucial for enabling a high-density 2DEG channel through polarization engineering toward the next generation of Ga 2 O 3 -based electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Precision determination of the hyperfine splitting (HFS) of cadmium ions is useful to study space-time variation of fundamental physical constants and isotope shifts. In this work, we present the precision frequency measurement of the excited-state 2 P 3 / 2 hyperfine splitting of 111 , 113 Cd + ions using the laser-induced fluorescence technique. By introducing the technology of sympathetic cooling and measuring the doublet line transition exploitation of an optical comb system, the uncertainties are improved to 16 and 12 kHz, respectively, two orders of magnitude higher precision than the reported results from the linear transformation of isotope shifts. The magnetic dipole constants A P 3 / 2 of 111 Cd + and 113 Cd + are estimated to be 395 939 ( 8 ) and 411 275 ( 6 ) kHz ⁠ , respectively. The difference between the measured and theoretical hyperfine structure constants indicates that more physical effects are required to be considered in the theoretical calculation and provides critical data for the examination of deviation from King-plot linearity in isotope shifts.},

  abstract     = {p-hBN/n-AlGaN heterojunctions were fabricated using a dry-selective lift-off/transfer of Mg-doped hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layer on top of n-AlGaN. Electrical contacts were used as mechanical stressors to provide structural rigidity to hBN layers as well as enabling selective lift-off. These junctions exhibit a rectifying behavior with a rectification ratio of approximately 3 × 10 5 at 3 V. When junctions were forward biased, ultraviolet (UV) emission around 262 nm was measured. This emission corresponds to recombinations in the n-AlGaN layer, demonstrating good hole injection in the structure. Full light emitting diode (LED) structures were fabricated by integrating UV multi quantum wells (MQWs) into these junctions. Produced UV LEDs emit around 290 nm serving as a proof of concept for future layer transferred p-hBN/MQWs/n-AlGaN structures in which the Al content is increased to go toward deep ultraviolet (DUV) emission. The selective pick and place process used to build these LEDs has multiple advantages. First, it allows independent optimization of the p-side as well as of the n-side, which includes the quantum wells. Second, UV MQWs are protected from the high temperatures needed for high hBN material quality growth, and thus their thermal stability is not affected.},

Our approach involves developing a data-driven deep learning simulator that estimates the electromagnetic response. Specifically, the simulator predicts the electric field distribution at a given cross section of a plasmonic meta-atom based on its geometry. Since the simulator is differentiable, it enables the optimization of various powers of the electric field intensity by coupling it with a generator model and a suitable loss function. With respect to conventional methods that rely on trial and error for optimization and miss atoms intercoupling, our approach systematically considers the collective behavior of the metasurface and efficiently explores the design space. Furthermore, it is capable of capturing multiple local minima within these electrodynamic systems, with optimization results well beyond the training dataset. The generalization capability of the simulator and the behavior of the optimized geometries are validated against a finite element method numerical model.},

However, the efficiency of micro-LEDs sharply decreases with decreasing device size due to sidewall damage resulting from the mesa etching. Therefore, the implementation of a low-damage pixelization technique is essential for enhancing the performance of micro-LEDs. In this Letter, ion implantation (IIP) was employed to improve the performance of InGaN green micro-LED arrays with a pixel size of around 6.5 μ m and a resolution of 25 × 25. The peak external quantum efficiency of the micro-LED array is enhanced to 6.2%, which is much higher than the 2.4% of that fabricated by conventional inductively coupled plasma etching. In addition, the transmission data rate of the IIP-pixelized micro-LED array is 2.7 times higher, increasing from 115.5 to 307.3 Mbps at an operating current density of about 100 A/cm 2 .

With the rapid development of nonlinear metamaterials and metasurfaces, the concept of geometric phase has been extended to the regime of nonlinear optics and attracts growing interest due to its capability of manipulating the nonlinear optical fields. On the one hand, nonlinear geometric phase offers a platform to investigate the fundamental principles in light–matter interactions during the nonlinear optical processes. On the other hand, it can be applied to design nonlinear optical elements with versatile functionality, such as wavefront engineering, optical imaging, and optical holography. To give a comprehensive review of nonlinear geometric phase, here, we overview the fundamental mechanisms, including the symmetry selection rules, the origin of the geometric phase in harmonic generations, and the characteristics of nonlinear geometric phase. We summarize the related applications based on the concepts of nonlinear geometric phase and symmetry selection rules, mainly focusing on the recent progresses from nonlinear optical sources to nonlinear optical field manipulation and beyond. In addition to reviewing the achievements in a wide variety of applications based on the nonlinear geometric phase, we also give prospects on their future development.

However, in the conventional L-C-type matching circuits, resonator frequency tunability is limited by poor design flexibility of the shunt capacitance and hence the circuit. Recently, L-L-type matching circuits comprising a series and a shunt inductor have been proposed to address this issue. Here, we report RF reflectometry readout of silicon quantum dot-based charge sensors embedded in L-L-type circuits. We determine the inductance values for target resonance frequencies based on our equivalent circuit model that incorporates the parasitic elements of the inductors and demonstrate resonator frequency tunability of up to 1 GHz with 3-dB resonator bandwidths on the order of MHz. The measured conductance sensitivities, on the order of 10 −5 ( e 2 / h ) / Hz at 4 K, are only moderately dependent on the resonance frequency up to 630 MHz.

  abstract     = {Accurate detection and diagnosis of urolithiasis are critical to follow-up clinical treatments. Current stones diagnosis commonly relies on on-spot urinalysis assisted with extra gold standard examinations, however, the required hospital testing is cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, we develop a homogeneous plasmon-enhanced Raman biosensor integrated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, namely LASSO-ANN-PERB, to sensitively assess spectroscopic variations of human urine samples for label-free and rapid stone screening. In a practical scenario loaded with low-volume Raman features of urine from healthy subjects and patients, the integrated biosensor realizes an excellent stones identification accuracy as well as can largely shorten the time consumption throughout the workflow. These practically demonstrated merits suggest the potential of integrated biosensor with the unique ability to enable noninvasive urine fluid biopsy for further development of rapid stones diagnostics, which may promisingly advance the existing clinical routine toward a convenient one.},

  abstract     = {Non-contact pulsed magnetic fields can enhance the permeability of biological cells, creating an innovative approach for delivering external substances through cell membranes. However, the mechanism by which pulsed magnetic fields cause cell permeabilization remains unclear, and experimental findings from different researchers often vary widely, sometimes even contradicting one another. To gain a deeper understanding of cell permeabilization caused by pulsed magnetic fields, this study uses a theoretical analytical approach. It begins with a qualitative analysis of how the induced electric field and radial stress generated by a time-varying magnetic field affect the free energy of pores from an energy perspective. Next, a numerical model is developed to quantitatively explore the dynamic changes in pores driven by the induced electric field and radial stress. The results demonstrate that, compared to the numerical model considering only the induced electric field, the model incorporating both the induced electric field and radial stress increases the predicted pore expansion capability by 161.8%. This enhancement allows for more accurate predictions of pore formation on the cell membrane under the influence of pulsed magnetic fields. This study incorporates radial stress into a pore-opening dynamics model under pulsed magnetic fields and develops an associated numerical model, thereby providing a foundation for elucidating the permeabilization mechanisms of pulsed magnetic fields.},

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) study showed that modification at moderate concentration (20 mM modification) increases the “I/Pb” ratio from 2.08 to 2.72. Angle-resolved XPS study is performed by varying the takeoff angle from 150° to 90°. OAI treatment increases the I/Pb ratio at each takeoff angle, showing the coordination of Pb (II) has been fully improved. Besides, the atomic ratio between N2 (from OAI) and Pb (from PVSK) decreases from 1.13 to 0.86 (20 mM modification), showing that OAI prefers to react with the surface layer of PVSK. Due to the improved coordination environment of Pb (II), the work function of PVSK increases by approximately 0.3 eV as revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy study, the built-in potential of perovskite solar cell (PSC) increases from 1.0 to 1.05 V. Accordingly, carrier extraction is accelerated, while carrier lifetime is prolonged, and the power conversion efficiency of PSCs is upgraded from 20.47% to 24.00%, with the fill factor rising from 77.32% to 82.79% and the open-circuit voltage from 1.11 to 1.16 V.

Reservoir computing, a bio-inspired computing paradigm, excels at processing temporal signals and offers advantages like low training costs and easy deployment on edge devices. Many applications have been developed for reservoir computing using physical devices. However, there has been a paucity of research using reservoir computing to simulate the human tactile system. Furthermore, the implementation of a reusable physical reservoir computing system is of significant importance. Herein, we implement a near-sensor physical reservoir computing system for haptic simulation, utilizing a simple peripheral circuit design. The reservoir&#39;s high-dimensional, nonlinear, and short-term memory requirements are physically realized by a memristor with an integrated lithium polymer electrolyte and polycrystalline tungsten oxide layer, which exhibits good cycle-to-cycle consistency. As a proof of concept, the system completes the learning and classification tasks for Braille numerals and characters, achieving a high recognition accuracy of up to 96% within 400 cycles. This approach offers innovative insights for developing human–machine interaction applications with enhanced intelligent perception capability.},

Therefore, exploration for a flexible and transparent thermoelectric power generator (F-TTEG) is on the rise. In this study, we develop n -type transparent CdO films on the polyimide (PI) substrate, which exhibit outstanding flexibility, maintaining 90% and 99% of their original electrical conductivity and transmittance after 500 bending cycles around a 11-mm diameter rod. The films also demonstrate a high power factor of ∼ 1.3 μ W cm −1 K −2 at room temperature. A thermoelectric prototype consisting of 8-leg of the CdO film generates a voltage of 15.2 mV and a maximum power density of 5.48 W m −2 at a temperature difference of 85 K. This work suggests that CdO films offer promising prospect for the development of high performance F-TTEG devices.},

  abstract     = {Gray tin ( α -Sn) is an elemental topological material with various topological phases. It is predicted to be a 3D Dirac semimetal when appropriate strain is applied. However, the Dirac semi-metallic properties, such as chiral anomaly, are hard to be observed, probably due to the imperfections in the α -Sn samples. It is even more challenging to manipulate the topological properties in this metastable material without a sacrifice in the crystalline quality. Here, we report a strategy of Fermi level tuning by doping the α -Sn films grown on CdTe (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. The negative magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect, which are attributed to chiral anomaly, are observed in α -Sn when the Fermi level is tuned close to the bulk Dirac point. Detailed analyses of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations show nontrivial Berry phases for all the samples. Combined with first-principle calculations, these results provide a strong evidence of the three-dimensional Dirac semimetal phase in α -Sn. Furthermore, a clear transition from two-dimensional topological surface states to three-dimensional bulk Dirac cone is demonstrated in α -Sn by precise Fermi level tuning through doping. This study proves the 3D Dirac semimetal phase in α -Sn and provides an effective strategy to manipulate the topological properties for both fundamental studies and device applications.},

An approach of fabricating the engineered piezoelectric materials of laminated ceramic composites (LCCs) was proposed to break the bottleneck instead. Two or more piezoelectric ceramic layers are stacked in the order of alternatively opposite polarizations and are combined together by electrodes, which are connected as in the cases of bimorph or laminated multilayer ceramic capacitors. Experimentally, a compositional series of (1 − x )(K 0.48 Na 0.52 )(Nb 0.96 Sb 0.04 )O 3 – x (Bi 0.50 Na 0.50 )ZrO 3 (KNNS- x BNZ) ceramics and a textured 0.965(K 0.48 Na 0.52 ) 0.99 Li 0.01 (Nb 0.98 Sb 0.02 )O 3 -0.035(Bi 0.50 Na 0.50 )ZrO 3 (KNLNS-BNZ) ceramic were used to verify this approach. The four-layer LCC with thin ceramic plates of different KNNS- x BNZ compositions shows an averaged d 33 of 1230 pC/N, and temperature stability of d 33 changes within ±5% up to 120 °C. The three-layer LCC of KNLNS-BNZ textured ceramic exhibits d 33 of 1100 pC/N at room temperature with d 33 changes of less than 8.1% up to 190 °C.

However, its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study examines the influence of DC poling on pyroelectricity in Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 )O 3 films. Direct measurements of pyrocurrent hysteresis curves revealed asymmetries along both the voltage (horizontal) and pyrocurrent (vertical) axes that cannot be explained using conventional single-coefficient pyroelectric evaluations. The switchable and non-switchable contributions to the pyrocurrent were also investigated. Our results indicate that the switchable contribution is directly proportional to the remanent polarization, consistent with the behavior of ideal ferroelectrics. Conversely, the non-switchable pyrocurrent, which is of comparable magnitude, is enhanced by poling and exhibits dependence on the poling direction. This non-switchable contribution shares the same poling-time dependence as the internal bias field, suggesting its origin lies in electrets such as fixed dipoles or pinned domains. These findings underscore the value of directly evaluating pyrocurrent for both positive and negative voltage polarities and demonstrate the potential to enhance directional pyrocurrent in ferroelectric thin films through controlled poling.},

The interfacial strain and oriented bonds are both considered the origin of the Fe in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which remains decisive. Here, by the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and the vibrating sample magnetometer measurements, this study shows that in the Fe/Cr( t )/GaAs structure, the in-plane UMA of Fe originates from the chemical bonding between the Fe and the GaAs substrate by varying Cr thickness, t . The UMA drops as the Cr coverage increases, characterized by a decrease in the saturation field from 2400 to 57 Oe. The XMCD studies reveal that the Fe orbital moment, a signature of chemical bonds, decreases from 0.216 μ B at Cr = 0 ML to 0.138 μ B at Cr = 5 ML. The reduction of the Fe orbital moment and the UMA are qualitatively consistent, establishing a link between the UMA and the interfacial chemical bonds. The decreased UMA remains unchanged at t &gt; 5 ML, above which Fe and GaAs are fully separated by a continuous Cr layer. Our findings provide clear experimental evidence that the UMA in the Fe/GaAs system originates from the oriented interface bonds, clarifying the UMA origin in this prototype system.},

  abstract     = {Twisted spin waves (or twisted magnons, TMs) have significant potential in high-capacity communication due to their orbital angular momentum (OAM) degree of freedom. Consequently, manipulating the propagation of TMs has become an important topic in spintronics. Here, we theoretically study the band structures of TMs in ferromagnetic cylindrical magnonic crystals with periodically modulated anisotropy. We find that the TMs with arbitrary OAMs exhibit forbidden bands at the boundary of the Brillouin zone, though, in different frequency ranges. This unique feature offers a promising avenue for developing filters capable of blocking the propagation of TMs with specific OAMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of TM bandgaps, as their position and width can be easily adjusted by altering the magnitude of anisotropy or the period of the crystal structure. Full micromagnetic simulations are performed to verify the theoretical predictions, showing good agreement. Our work not only enhances our understanding of TM propagation characteristics but also paves the way for the design of advanced spintronic devices that harness the magnon OAM degree of freedom.},

  abstract     = {Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for spin–orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3 d ferromagnetic metals including spin–orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L1 0 -MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3 d ferromagnetic metals are on the order of 1000 ℏ/2 e (Ω cm) −1 at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01–0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L1 0 -MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10 000 ℏ/2 e (Ω cm) −1 , with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3 d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding of the spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Particles with high anisotropy in their magnetic properties and shape are of increasing interest for mechanobiology, where transducing a remotely applied magnetic field vector to a local mechanical response is crucial. An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available atomic force microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6 ± 0.6 × 10 −15 Nm torque while applying 373 ± 5 mT field at 12 ± 2° angle to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 μ m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a ≈1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles&#39; mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {Developing permanent magnets with fewer critical elements requires understanding hysteresis effects and coercivity through visualizing magnetization reversal. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of the geometry of nanoscale ferromagnetic inclusions in a paramagnetic/nonmagnetic matrix to understand the key factors that maximize the magnetic energy product of such nanocomposite systems. Specifically, we have considered a matrix of “3 μ m × 3 μ m × 40 nm” dimension, which is a sufficiently large volume, two-dimensional representation considering that the ferromagnetic inclusions&#39; thickness is less than 3.33% of the lateral dimensions simulated. Using this approach, which minimizes edge effects to approximate bulk-like magnetic behavior while remaining computationally tractable for simulation, we systematically studied the effect of the thickness of ferromagnetic strips, separation between the ferromagnetic strips due to the nonmagnetic matrix material, different saturation magnetization values, and the length of these ferromagnetic strips on magnetic coercivity and remanence by simulating the hysteresis loop plots for each geometry. Furthermore, we study the underlying micromagnetic mechanism for magnetic reversal to understand the factors that could help attain the maximum magnetic energy densities for ferromagnetic nanocomposite systems in a paramagnetic/nonmagnetic material matrix. In this study, we have used material parameters of an exemplary Alnico alloy system, a rare-earth-free, thermally stable nanocomposite, which could potentially replace high-strength NdFeB magnets in applications that do not require large energy products. However, we project the energy density ( BH ) max of materials with higher saturation magnetization to have an ideal theoretical limit of ( BH ) max ∼94 kJ/m 3 (∼12 MGOe), which is ∼(35%–40%) of the energy density of Rare-Earth Free Magnets. This energy density could be higher if exchange bias from antiferromagnets, defects, and pinning is included and could stimulate further experimental work on the fabrication and large-scale manufacturing of RE-free PMs with different nanocomposite systems.},

A silicon diaphragm measuring 1.5 × 1.5 mm 2 is coated with Pt (100-nm-thick) and FeGa (100-nm-thick) thin films. An alternating charge current passed through the FeGa/Pt/Si diaphragm under a magnetic field perpendicular to the charge current generates an alternating spin current via the spin Hall effect in the Pt film, transferring angular momentum from the Pt film to the FeGa film. The injected spin current provides energy and changes the effective temperature, thereby varying the thermal fluctuation of the magnetic moments. In a magnetic material with volume magnetostriction, the thermal fluctuation of the magnetic moments affects its volume. When the spin fluctuations change, the volume magnetostriction induces a corresponding expansion or contraction of the material. Both electrodeposited and ion-beam sputter-deposited FeGa films are investigated, and it is observed that the FeGa film exhibits SVE. The force generated by the SVE is evaluated based on the vibration amplitude at the fundamental resonant mode. This study demonstrates that the force generated by the SVE is correlated with the volume magnetostriction and the deposition process.},

In this work, we present an MTJ design with a free layer and two polarizers capable of computing the sigmoidal activation function and its gradient at the device level. This design enables both feedforward and backpropagation computations within a single device, extending neuromorphic computing frameworks previously explored in the literature by introducing the ability to perform backpropagation directly in hardware. Our algorithm implementation reveals two key findings: (i) the small discrepancies between the MTJ-generated curves and the exact software-generated curves have a negligible impact on the performance of the backpropagation algorithm, (ii) the device implementation is highly robust to inter-device variation and noise, and (iii) the proposed method effectively supports transfer learning and knowledge distillation. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the performance of an edge computing network using weights from a software-trained model implemented with our MTJ design. The results show a minimal loss of accuracy of only 0.4% for the Fashion MNIST dataset and 1.7% for the CIFAR-100 dataset compared to the original software implementation. These results highlight the potential of our MTJ design for compact, hardware-based neural networks in edge computing applications, particularly for transfer learning.},

Owing to the high valence Ni 3+ associated with Re NiO 3 that is rather oxidative and also results in bi-polar carriers from generating Ligand holes, we demonstrate that their low resistive contact is only achievable for using inert metal (e.g., the standard electrode potential beyond 0.4 V) with either high W (e.g., &gt;5 eV) or low W (e.g., &lt;4.7 eV). This sheds light on alternative contacting strategies for Re NiO 3 using the much cheaper Cu or Ag with low W that can also achieve abrupt resistive switch across MIT, in addition to the present noble metal with high W . Furthermore, the magnitude of W was also discovered to dominate the hydrogen-triggered Mottronic transition for Re NiO 3 via upward (or downward) bending the energy bands that promotes (or inhibits) the H + inward diffusion that switches the orbital configurations between the electron itinerant Ni 3+ and electron localized Ni 2+ . Clarifying these previously overlooked roles from the perspective of the metallic contacts further paves the way for the correlated electronic applications of Re NiO 3 .},

The mobility of free carriers is one such parameter that defines the ultimate performance of electronic devices. The dependence of two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) mobility on 2DHG density in an undoped gate controlled compressively strained Ge quantum well (QW) grown on Si (cs-GoS), with QW thicknesses of 15 and 30 nm, is studied and compared at T = 0.3 K.

  abstract     = {An increasing magnetic field perpendicular to an undoped semiconductor surface at low temperature is known to strengthen the binding of localized electrons to stationary ions, as the wavefunction&#39;s tails evolve from exponential to Gaussian. It is also known that application of a high bias voltage to a depleted semiconductor can liberate bound charge and induce a large drop in electrical resistance. We connect these established results to experimental electrical transport measurements on off-state germanium Schottky-barrier metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFETs) with an aluminum oxide insulating dielectric and platinum germanide contacts. We make measurements at the three distinct orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the substrate and the current. At 6 K, we observe sharp attenuation of current by more than 2 orders of magnitude, within 60 mT, at a crossover magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate. A 1 T magnetic field attenuates the current by more than 4 orders of magnitude. The strength of the attenuation and the value of the crossover field are controlled by both the gate–source and drain–source voltages. The attenuation is much weaker when the magnetic field is parallel to the current. Finally, we orient the magnetic field parallel to the substrate, but perpendicular to the current, allowing us to distinguish charge hopping at the oxide interface from charge hopping in the bulk. This large off-state magnetoresistance can be exploited for cryogenic magnetic- and photo-detection, and for high-bias, low-leakage MOSFETs.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the GeO 2 thin film has attracted intense attention due to its ultrawide optical bandgap energy (&gt;4 eV), endowing it with quite a promising application for solar-blind photodetectors (SBPDs). Although many epitaxial growth strategies of GeO 2 thin films have been achieved, the design for the controllable GeO 2 SBPDs is still rarely reported, thus hampering its development as next-generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we deposited pure GeO 2 films with ultrawide bandgap energies of around 5.81 eV using the radio frequency magnetron sputtering method and fabricated back-gated three-terminal SBPDs based on GeO 2 /p-Si heterojunction structures. Subsequently, boosted optoelectronic characteristics at 213 nm, including a lower dark current of 93.52 pA, a higher photon-to-dark-currents ratio of 98.88, and a larger breakdown drain-source voltage (V DS ) over 30 V, are demonstrated due to the introduction of SiO 2 layer between the GeO 2 film and the Si substrate. More importantly, by applying the various voltages on the gate voltage (V GS ) of the GeO 2 /SiO 2 /p-Si three-terminal SBPDs, a significant change in the threshold V DS is achieved in the range from −21.91 to 8.16 V, demonstrating that the V GS can effectively regulate the turn-on V DS of the device. The obtained results can be instructive for the high-performance SBPDs based on GeO 2 films, and our findings will provide a promising approach for achieving high-performance GeO 2 -based SBPDs.},

Designing effective termination structures is a critical step in exploiting the advantages of β -Ga 2 O 3 power diodes. Among various types of termination structures, mesa technique features a simple preparation process and theoretically high efficiency electric field management capability in β -Ga 2 O 3 devices. In order to further reduce the peak electric field along the mesa sidewall and corner, the p-type NiO junction termination extension (JTE) structure was incorporated. However, deep level transient spectroscopy revealed a new shallow energy level at E c –0.28 eV related to interface states inducing by dry etching, which is the cause of the weakened JTE structure effect and instability of electrical properties. A low-temperature post-annealing process was proposed to eliminate the interface states, thereby achieving better charge balance and enhancing the breakdown voltage of compounded termination device from 1.35 to 2.1 kV without sacrificing the forward characteristics. This work reveals the energy level related to interface states introduced by dry etching in β -Ga 2 O 3 and facilitates the fabrication of high-performance devices.},

  abstract     = {p-type ultrawide bandgap oxide semiconductors play a crucial role in developing optoelectronic and electronic devices. Our previous studies have identified rock salt-structured Zn 1−x Ni x O (∼0.27 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloys as promising wide bandgap oxides for achieving p-type doping. This is attributed to their high valence band maximum position, which favors the formation of native acceptors, such as nickel vacancies (V Ni ). However, the application of p-type O-rich Zn 1−x Ni x O 1+δ alloys in bipolar devices remains unexplored. In this study, we synthesized rock salt-structured p-type Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ thin films with a bandgap ∼4.4 eV using room-temperature magnetron sputtering in varying oxygen flow ratios (0%–30%). The structural and optoelectronic properties of films were characterized by x-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and variable-temperature Hall-effect measurements. We observed a significant increase in subgap absorption with higher oxygen flow ratios. Subsequently, p-Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ /n-ZnO heterojunction diodes were fabricated on ITO glass. These p–n diodes exhibited high rectification ratio up to ∼3.1 × 10 4 and an ideality factor of ∼3.1. The band diagram of the p–n heterojunction was simulated using SCAPS-1D. These findings underscore the potential of p-type ultrawide bandgap Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ semiconductors in bipolar device applications, demonstrating their promising performance for future optoelectronic and electronic technologies.},

The internal electric field formed at the interface of Van der Waals junction promotes the separation and efficient transfer of photogenerated carriers, showing the characteristics of low power consumption, self-drive, high responsiveness, and ultrafast response. Therefore, we fabricate a transverse homojunction photodetector by mechanical stripping. Furthermore, considering the influence of the contact between the two sides of the metal electrodes, we select the metal electrodes corresponding to the matching work function according to the Fermi level with different thicknesses of MoTe 2 , and two anti-barrier layers are obtained. Finally, a transverse homojunction self-driven photodetector with Au-thin MoTe 2 -thick MoTe 2 –Ni/Au structure is fabricated, which improves the photosensitivity and response time, and broadens the spectral detection range. When V ds = 0 V, the rectifier ratio increases to 4.6 × 10 3 , which is 50 times higher than that of symmetrical electrode homojunction. Under zero bias voltage, when the spot area is 3 × 10 −9 m 2 , the photosensitivity reaches 28 mA/W (637 nm), the response time is 38.83/40.17 μ s, and the infrared detection is extended to 1550 nm.

Traditional methods, relying on high-quality factor resonators or hybrid systems with external feedback, often struggle with complexity, environmental sensitivity, and integration challenges. Advances in non-Hermitian physics and parity-time (PT) symmetry, particularly exceptional points (EPs), offer unique opportunities by leveraging coalescing eigenstates for frequency splitting sensing. However, PT systems require precise gain-loss balance and multi-resonance-mode setups, while EP-based sensors amplify both signals and noise, limiting their robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a single-resonator system with intrinsic anti-PT symmetry, incorporating a dual-channel excitation mechanism that enables dynamic adjustment of loss and coupling for precise resonance control. This design achieves an 80% linewidth reduction and dramatically enhances peak signal and sensitivity by 24.4-fold and 125-fold, respectively, offering a compact, high-performance solution for the next-generation sensing applications.},

Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a super QBIC within a flatband by introducing lateral geometric perturbations in a square lattice of etched holes in high-index Ge films, enabling strong coupling between energy bands. The super QBIC achieves a theoretical Q-factor two orders of magnitude higher than conventional QBICs, with nearly zero group velocity, and supports ultra-narrowband resonances with slow light effect. Experimentally, we report a robust Q-factor of ∼270 at a tilted angle, a full width at half maximum of ∼22 nm, and a field enhancement of ∼23 in accessible optical cavities. Vibrational strong coupling is achieved between the super QBIC mode and the C=O vibrational mode of polymethylmethacrylate molecules, with Rabi mode splitting and a Rabi energy of 24.2 cm −1 at zero detuning. Differential transmission spectra reveal a fivefold enhancement in molecular absorption due to strong field localization. These results demonstrate the potential of flatband metasurfaces for advancing surface-enhanced infrared absorption at the micrometer scale.},

  abstract     = {Rashba spin–orbit coupling locks the spin with the momentum of charge carriers at the broken inversion interfaces, which could generate a large spin galvanic response. Here, we demonstrate spin-to-charge conversion (inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect) in KTaO 3 (111) two-dimensional electron systems. We explain the results in the context of electronic structure, orbital character, and spin texture at the KTaO 3 (111) interfaces. We also show that the angle dependence of the spin-to-charge conversion on in-plane magnetic field exhibits a nontrivial behavior, which matches the symmetry of the Fermi states. Results point to opportunities to use spin-to-charge conversion as a tool to investigate the electronic structure and spin texture.},

  abstract     = {While numerous crystalline Si allotropes have been predicted in recent years and, in several instances, synthesized under high pressure, the exploration of Si phases with a lower density than conventional diamond Si (d-Si) is still in its infancy. Theoretical calculations on the electronic properties of these expanded Si forms suggest that, unlike the most stable d-Si structure, many may possess direct or quasi-direct bandgaps and only exhibit slightly higher formation energies than d-Si. The few that have been synthesized already display exciting optical properties, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Their unique open-framework, guest–host structures enable distinctive interactions between Si and interstitial guest/dopant atoms, offering exciting potentials in spintronics, energy storage, and bio/medical technologies. In this Perspective, we provide an introduction and overview of the latest theoretical and experimental advancements in low-density Si allotropes, emphasizing their potential in various electronic and energy-related applications. This work also highlights the critical challenges and future directions for the continued development of these Si allotropes for next-generation technological applications.},
