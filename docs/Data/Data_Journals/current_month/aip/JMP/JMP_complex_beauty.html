More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with δ -function potentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point interaction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first eigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first eigenvalue function , by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly and uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we also generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville problems to measure differential equations with non-trivial positive integrable weights, which provide the possibility of the further study of inverse spectral problems for more general measure differential equations.},

As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states.

The probability mass function is generalised using the q -deformed algebra developed within the framework of nonextensive statistics, leading to the emergence of a family of divergence measures in the asymptotic limit as the system size increases. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when q is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation.

We show that the matching conditions cannot be satisfied by the fluid with radial pressure, while the axial and azimuthal cases with a lapse function depending only on the time coordinate do satisfy these constraints.

We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold M , in the spirit of Lerner’s [Commun. Math. Phys. 32 , 19 (1973)], and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold Σ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite “large” in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when Σ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension. The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione’s [Indiana Univ.

The idea is to first define an “elementary” channel Φ 2 and then to analyze when Φ Φ 2 − 1 is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way—which even yields an explicit factorization of Φ—is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors x , x ⊥ such that 〈 x ⊥ | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = 〈 x | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = { 0 } where K Φ is the Kraus subspace of Φ and K Φ ⊥ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application—if possible—results in a factorization of Φ into in some sense “simple” channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.},

Notably, the system exhibits exceptionally sharp transmission resonances, a characteristic that distinguishes it from other quantum systems. Furthermore, the multifaceted transmission attributes of the SVC ρ , n are found to be critically dependent on both parameters, ρ and n , offering an intricate interplay that warrants deeper exploration. Our findings highlight a pronounced scaling behavior of reflection probability with k , which is underpinned by analytical derivations.},

  abstract     = {The non-commutative harmonic oscillators Q α β NH with parameters α , β &gt; 0, αβ &gt; 1 and two-photon quantum Rabi models H △ , g 2 p with △ ≥ 0, | g | &lt; 1 2 are both extensions of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. In the special case where α = β and △ = 0, it is immediately seen that Q α α NH is unitarily equivalent to α 2 − 1 1 − 4 g 2 H 0 , g 2 p ⁠ . The purpose of this paper is to establish relationships between Q α β NH and H △ , g 2 p for the general cases △ &gt; 0 and α ≠ β , and to show the fiber decomposition of Q α β NH in terms of H △ , g 2 p ⁠ . We also construct Feynman–Kac formulas for e − t H △ , g 2 p and e − t Q α β NH ⁠ . It is then considered the asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function ζ 2p ( s ) of H △ , g 2 p ⁠ .},

In this paper, we study the non–Abelian vortices in a quantum field theory which is the two–dimensions non–Abelian vortex zeromodes coupled to the massless four–dimensions Yang–Mills modes. We establish the existence and uniqueness for vortex solutions by researching the nonlinear elliptic equations systems with exponential terms in R 2 using the calculus of variations. In addition, the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at infinity and the quantized integrals in R 2 are obtained.},

First we prove there exists a unique solution for this equation by using a truncation method. Then, we establish the tightness of a family of probability distributions of solutions and obtain the existence of invariant measures by introducing an appropriate Lyapunov function and utilizing a decomposition approach. Finally, the regularity of the invariant measure is investigated, that is, the invariant measure is supported by a regular space.},
