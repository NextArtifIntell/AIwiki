  abstract     = {This paper proposes a real-size, single-shot, high-speed, and energy-efficient tensorized optical multimodal fusion network (TOMFuN) on an electro-photonic large-scale III–V-on-Si in-memory compute engine. The TOMFuN architecture leverages a memory-efficient and low-complexity self-attention for the embedding network for the text information and tensor-train and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decompositions for compressing the model parameters in the large-scale fully connected layers. Compared to full-size counterparts, our proposed network maintains a compatible inference accuracy in multimodal sentiment analysis tasks while requiring 92.8× fewer model parameters and 51.3× fewer hardware resources. Furthermore, the impact of photonic device imperfections on the TOMFuN architecture is investigated. The simulation results show that noise-aware on-chip training exhibits superior robustness. Finally, chip performance analysis shows that our TOMFuN inference accelerator has 230.73 PetaOps computational speed, 6.51 TOPS/W power efficiency, and 2.7 µ s latency with the input dimensions of 1024.},

The spatial distribution of the crystalline phase of an HZO film reveals that the tetragonal phase is a dominant crystal structure in the HZO film with [Zr] = 75%, resulting in anti-ferroelectric (AFE)-like double polarization switching. Analyses using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) find that the AFE-HZO capacitor effectively transforms the 3-bit time-series input into eight different reservoir output states. In reservoir computing tasks, the AFE-HZO capacitor with [Zr] = 75% achieves improved computational capacities compared with the other MFM capacitors with [Zr] = 0% and 50%. The AFE-HZO capacitor can effectively diversify time-series input signals through dynamic double polarization switching, leading to a more sub-divided and dispersive weight distribution across the adjustable weights in the readout part of our RC system.},

These resistance changes can remain for very long times or relax after a short time. Thus, memristors can be used as electronic synapses and neurons in artificial neural networks implemented in hardware. These fully memristive neuromorphic circuits are mainly intended for artificial intelligence applications. In this work, we explore the properties of a stochastic compact model for the electrical behavior of memristors in the two regimes of long-time (non-volatile) and short-time (volatile) memory for synapse and neuron functions, respectively. In the case of non-volatile memristors, we focus on potentiation/depression transients, programming energy, programming time, and power requirements for writing conductance weights in artificial network crossbars. As for volatile memristors, we consider the modeling of their behavior in the context of a leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron, demonstrating how the model captures the threshold activation function and the input signal frequency dependence.},

However, a large body of natural phenomena incorporates memory effects that are best described via fractional integro-differential equations (FIDEs), in which the integral or differential operators accept non-integer orders. Addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear FIDEs is a recognized difficulty, necessitating the application of generic methods with immediate practical relevance. This work introduces the Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equations Solver (UniFIDES), a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to expeditiously solve a variety of FIDEs in both forward and inverse directions, without the need for ad hoc manipulation of the equations. The effectiveness of UniFIDES is demonstrated through a collection of integer-order and fractional problems in science and engineering. Our results highlight UniFIDES’ ability to accurately solve a wide spectrum of integro-differential equations and offer the prospect of using machine learning platforms universally for discovering and describing dynamic and complex systems.},

These limitations include increased leakage currents, pronounced short-channel effects, and quantum tunneling through the gate oxide, leading to higher power consumption and deviations from ideal behavior. Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) can overcome these challenges by utilizing the quantum tunneling of charge carriers to switch between on and off states and achieve a subthreshold swing below 60 mV/decade. This allows for lower power consumption, continued scaling, and improved performance in low-power applications. This review focuses on the design and operation of TFETs, emphasizing the optimization of device performance through material selection and advanced simulation techniques. The discussion will specifically address the use of two-dimensional materials in TFET design and explore simulation methods ranging from multi-scale approaches to machine learning-driven optimization.},

Machine learning has been actively explored as a means to this end; however, challenges remain in terms of versatility for different tasks and device types. In this study, we explore a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach: unlike traditional reinforcement learning techniques, the learning process of MBRL progresses by constructing a model for the environment, which is to be diverted for other tasks and/or devices, thereby minimizing time-consuming learning processes. Using pre-measured data, we construct an environment model and, despite the intrinsic sparse reward distribution of the QD system, demonstrate its suitability for MBRL by emulating the process of auto-tuning to a single QD region. Our results highlight the potential of MBRL for more generic QD auto-tuning techniques, providing a promising step toward fully automated QD tuning.},

  abstract     = {Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) is a key to understanding the mechanism of reactions in complex systems. Deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning approaches have become a powerful tool to find the RC. On the other hand, the hyperparameters that determine the DNN model structure can be highly flexible and are often selected intuitively and in a non-trivial and tedious manner. Furthermore, how the hyperparameter choice affects the RC quality remains obscure. Here, we explore the hyperparameter space by developing the hyperparameter tuning approach for the DNN model for RC and investigate how the parameter set affects the RC quality. The DNN model is built to predict the committor along the RC from various collective variables by minimizing the cross-entropy function; the hyperparameters are automatically determined using the Bayesian optimization method. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and the features that characterize the RC are extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools. The results show that the DNN models with diverse structures can describe the RC with similar accuracy, and furthermore, the features analyzed by XAI are highly similar. This indicates that the hyperparameter space is multimodal. The electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen H 18 plays an important role in the RC in water. The current study shows that the structure of the DNN models can be rather flexible, while the suitably optimized models share the same features; therefore, a common mechanism from the RC can be extracted.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant importance in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of reduced-order models, convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a universally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn nonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the system. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability. Thus, the resulting model is a black-box that effectively reduces the complexity of the system but does not provide insights into the meaning of the latent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel interpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains the reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature interpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE architecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our approach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for interpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our results show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and achieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over POD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the number of modes decreases. In addition, our method delivers interpretable features similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive than existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These approaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only provide interpretability to a limited extent.},

By incorporating the scattering physics of x rays into the network, SAXSNN could be trained to capture the complex mapping between the SAXS patterns in reciprocal space and the corresponding morphologies in real space in an unsupervised way. We demonstrated the performance of SAXSNN on the experimental SAXS patterns of semicrystalline and amorphous polymers, i.e., hard-elastic isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films and plasticized poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB). The morphologies reconstructed by SAXSNN are well consistent with our existing knowledge of the morphology of iPP films and PVB. The developed methodology here allows us to rapidly predict the morphologies for any given SAXS pattern without any in-prior phase information and, thus, provides an intuitive understanding of the microstructures of the measured samples. A real-time feedback of the morphologies of measured samples to SAXS beamline users at modern synchrotron radiation light sources will be feasible in the near future.},

  abstract     = {In materials informatics, feature selection and model selection are utilized in the knowledge extraction process, and the confidence evaluation of the selection result is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the extracted knowledge. In this study, we propose a novel method to quantitatively evaluate the significance of low-dimensional models obtained from an expanded feature space using the density of states (DoS) for the evaluation metrics. This method allows us to compare the performance of the selected model to those of other models and evaluate its significance. We further propose an evaluation method for feature importance based on marginal posterior probabilities using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework, which considers all models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through their application to a crystal structure dataset. Our results show that the DoS analysis reveals the presence of a large number of models with a comparable performance with the best model reported in a previous research work. This suggests that knowledge extracted from a single selected model can be unreliable and that considering other models is crucial. We also show that the BMA-based feature importance evaluation provides valuable insights into the importance of features, highlighting both primary features and functional forms. In addition, we demonstrate that the LASSO + L0 method commonly used in existing research deteriorates the search space for model selection. Our findings suggest that our proposed methods provide valuable tools for assessing the significance of low-dimensional models and extracting knowledge from large-scale data in materials informatics.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement—so-called entanglement engineering—for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon–phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.},

This model extends previous work on the U-net model. Here we trained binary-, three-, and five-class models using supervised learning on experimentally measured dynamic fracture experiments on various opaque structural ceramic materials that were adhered on transparent polymer (polycarbonate or acrylic) backing materials. Full details of the experimental investigations are outside the scope of this manuscript, but briefly, several different ceramics were loaded using spatially and time-varying mechanical loads to induce inelastic deformation and fracture processes that were recorded at frequencies as high as 5 MHz using high-speed optical imaging. These experiments provided a rich and diverse dataset that includes many of the common fracture modes found in static and dynamic fractures, including cone cracking, median cracking, comminution, and combined complex failure modes that involve effectively simultaneous activation and propagation of multiple fragmentation modes. While the training data presented here were obtained from dynamic fragmentation experiments, this study is applicable to static loading of these materials as the crack speeds are on the order of 1–10 km/s regardless of the loading rate. We believe the methodologies presented here will be useful in quantifying the failure processes in structural materials for protection applications and can be used for direct validation of engineering models used in design.},

RhoB, a key biomarker assessed via immunohistochemistry, is crucial in predicting responses to radiotherapy (RT), but variability in staining techniques and tumor heterogeneity often complicate these assessments. SRGNet integrates spatial statistics, nonlinear dynamics, graph theory, and graph convolutional networks to address these challenges. In testing, SRGNet outperformed 10 pre-trained convolutional neural networks, achieving 88% accuracy in biopsies from RT patients, with 67% accuracy for predicting survival under five years and 100% accuracy for survival over five years, along with 100% precision, an F1 score of 0.80, and an AUC of 0.73. For non-RT patients, SRGNet attained 91% accuracy, 100% precision for survival over five years, an F1 score of 0.86, and an AUC of 0.82. These results demonstrate SRGNet’s potential to enhance the precision and reliability of survival predictions in rectal cancer patients, overcoming challenges of RhoB expression variability and tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional autoencoders have proven to be an adequate tool to perform reduced-order modeling for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. Their goal is to reduce dimensionality strongly while preserving the most characteristic features of the system. Here, we show that these models rely sensitively on the completeness of the provided data. This is particularly challenging for fully turbulent flows with their coherent structures ranging from large-scale superstructures to dissipative eddies over orders of magnitude in time and space. As a result, an unrealistically large number of data snapshots would be required to properly cover all the essential dynamics, whereas the features on small time and length scales require only a small number of snapshots of the respective flow, especially the long lasting large-scale structures that are difficult to characterize either numerically or experimentally. We demonstrate for three types of flows that a missing representation of large-scale turbulent structures leads to failures in the training process. We suggest a method to mitigate this shortcoming. This includes the transformation of data samples to new large-scale structures, which enhance the data. Furthermore, we skip augmentations that are more detrimental to the model performance. We evaluate our method for three datasets, two from numerical simulations of turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection flows and one from laboratory experiment for the flow past an array of cylinders. We show that the method can substantially improve model utility for high-dimensional data. In this way, we avoid an intensive grid search through possible augmentation combinations without further knowledge about the underlying system.},

  abstract     = {This research offers a new analytical tool that unravels the nonlinear relation between the parameters of Viscoelastic Damping (VD) and the resulting frequency spectrum in musical membranes. Understanding how variations in VD parameters influence the resulting sounds is crucial for developing new tools for artistic expression and for designing musical instruments with distinct sound qualities. In the case of membranophones, the external damping is well understood, while the internal damping due to viscoelastic properties of materials remains unclear. In previous research, VD in musical membranes has been modeled using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model. Nonetheless, analyzing the complex relationships between the large parameter space of the model and the nonlinear behavior of VD is a challenging task. This study addresses this analysis through physics-based machine learning. We employed a FDTD model of a viscoelastically damped membrane to create a physics-informed dataset, which we subsequently analyzed using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Our findings reveal that the damping coefficient is the primary criterion when clustering the data. Furthermore, we found the internal structure of the cluster to depend on the rate of decay of the memory effect, i.e., the rate at which the energy introduced back into the system decreases. The study also demonstrates the benefits of using principal component analysis for the SOM initialization.},

A systematic survey of these and other algorithms in the nanophotonics context remains lacking. Here, we compare 24 widely used machine learning optimizers on inverse design tasks. We study two prototypical nanophotonics inverse design problems—the mode splitter and wavelength demultiplexer—across various system sizes, using both hand-tuned and meta-learned hyperparameters. We find that Adam derivatives, as well as the Fromage optimizer, consistently outperform L-BFGS and standard gradient descent, regardless of system size. While meta-learning has a negligible-to-negative impact on Adam and Fromage, it significantly improves others, particularly AdaGrad derivatives and simple gradient descent, such that their performance is on par with Adam. In addition, we observe that the most effective optimizers exhibit the lowest correlation between initial and final performance.

In this work, a synchrotron three-dimension reciprocal space mapping (3D-RSM) technique, which offers a larger Q -space range and higher spatial resolution, was developed and used to analyze YBCO films grown on (001)-oriented LAO, STO, and MgO substrates. The 3D-RSM results reveal that epitaxial YBCO c domains dominate the films, with minor YBCO a domains in YBCO/LAO. The YBCO c domains present a consistent epitaxial relationship with the substrate STO and LAO, with the domain boundary parallel to the substrate [110] or [ 1 ¯ 10] axes. In contrast, YBCO/MgO films exhibit two distinct in-plane epitaxy orientations. Quantitatively measured lattice constants indicate the possible T c -related oxygen vacancy condition therein. A 2-in. YBCO/MgO film, prepared by a homemade pulsed laser deposition system, verified the structural non-uniformity issues, suggesting room for further optimization.

By optimizing jet stability and controlling phase transition velocity, we achieved resolutions finer than 70 μ m, surpassing the limitations of traditional PVA hydrogel fabrication techniques.

The laser beatnote between two nearly identical systems, each using saturated absorption spectroscopy in a simple retroreflected configuration, exhibits an instability of 2.5 × 10 −13 at 1 s, consistent with phase noise analysis, and 3 × 10 −14 at 200 s. The primary contributors to the stability budget at 1 s are the FM-AM noise conversion and the intermodulation effect, both emerging from laser frequency noise. These results highlight the potential of microcell-based optical references to achieve stability performances comparable to that of an active hydrogen maser in a remarkably simple architecture.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLSs). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor Q i as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of Q i at low powers over periods of 12–16 h (relative standard deviation σ Q i / Q i = 13 % ⁠ ). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips, and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power Q i fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence, due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.},

In this study, we construct a two-dimensional (2D) multi-physics model and simulate the 2D geometry and internal electrochemical processes to investigate the multiscale effects of microstructures on overall battery performance. Concurrently, we design three distinct anode structures: porosity gradient distribution structures, hard carbon–graphite composite anodes, and hard carbon-coated graphite anodes to identify structural features that enhance key battery performance metrics. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of side-reaction products and the Li + concentration to reveal the influence of different microstructures on internal mass transport and electrochemical reactions. We also identify the factors within these three structures that contribute to extending battery lifespan and improving overall performance. This work systematically establishes the relationship between anode microstructures and battery performance, providing insights that are expected to optimize materials, reduce trial-and-error, and use simulations to guide experimental work more efficiently.},

A high carrier concentration is ascribed to the increase in the density of states after In doping proved by first-principles calculations and experiments, which leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of ∼1686.84 S cm −1 and moderate S above ∼105.24 μ V K −1 . Consequently, a peak power factor of 18.68 μ W cm −1 K −2 was realized in In doped Sb 2 Te 3 thin films at 300 K, representing a ∼17% increase compared to the undoped samples. After 1000 bending cycles, the relative resistance evolution lower than 2% and relative S evolution lower than 5% exhibit excellent flexibility of In-doped flexible thermoelectric film.

The electrocatalytic behavior of reaction sites in water splitting is modeled by using the Butler–Volmer equation. The impacts of the ESC parameters, including the extraction energy level and the transmission energy width, on the performance of HCPC devices have been investigated. The results indicate that the thermal losses from non-ideal ESCs significantly limit HCPC efficiency, which can be enhanced by optimizing ESC parameters. Comparisons show that HCPCs with quantum dot ESCs outperform those with quantum well ESCs, owing to their superior carrier transport capability and lower thermal loss rates. For an absorber bandgap of 1 eV ⁠ , the optimized solar-to- H 2 energy conversion efficiencies of the two HCPCs reach 62.34 % and 64.93 % ⁠ , respectively, highlighting the promising application potential of these catalysts.},

Verified with resolution targets and a histological sample, our method achieved a resolution improvement of 2.5 times the diffraction limit of the objective lens and provided QPI over a large field-of-view.

This enhancement may be attributed to the strong charge transfer with biomolecules and anisotropic structure, which increases molecular dipole moments when positioned on its surface. These factors lead to stronger molecular interactions and improved Raman signal sensitivity.

However, their intrinsic properties of photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, key to photodetector performance, are still limited with conventional approaches (e.g., material purification and defect passivation). Here, we propose an efficient ultrasound-assisted growth method to manipulate the crystal phase of all-inorganic perovskites. Morphological, structural, and elemental characteristics of perovskites are comprehensively investigated, confirming the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 –CsPbBr 3 dual-phase (DP) perovskites. The fabricated DP perovskites exhibit enhanced carrier dynamics compared to CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs), including over a tenfold increase in photoluminescence intensity and an extended carrier lifetime of 656 ns. Such impressive improvements originate from the repeated radiative recombination introduced by the hierarchical phase of DP perovskites. As a result, the DP perovskite-based photodetector also demonstrates improved photoresponse, including a larger on/off ratio exceeding 10 3 and a higher detectivity of 1.48 × 10 10 Jones, especially in the absence of conventional transporting layers. These results offer strong competitiveness for state-of-the-art perovskite photodetectors and deliver important implications for the widespread use of DP perovskites in assembling high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

For instance, DFT/MC simulation indicates that ( Ti 0.5 Cr 0.5 ) 4 C 3 MXenes exhibit interlayer segregation, where Cr atoms are favorable to segregate into the outermost top and bottom layers, forming out-of-plane MXene ( o -MXenes). Such an o -MXene structure was also found in ( Nb 0.5 Mo 0.5 ) 4 C 3 ⁠ , ( Cr 0.5 Mo 0.5 ) 4 C 3 ⁠ , and ( Ti 0.33 Cr 0.33 Mo 0.34 ) 4 C 3 MXenes, which is in good agreement with prior studies. The classical molecular dynamics (MD)/MC simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials further validate the interlayer segregation-induced o -MXene observed in the DFT/MC simulations. This DFT/MC framework can be easily extended to predict the stable phases for other material systems, suggesting its broad applicability and impact.},

  abstract     = {Light–matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kilohertz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 μ W/ μ m 2 within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.},

Beyond their intriguing electrical transport phenomena, such as the negative magnetoresistance driven by the chiral anomaly and the anomalous Hall effect, they also exhibit intriguing second-order optoelectronic responses, such as the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). In this Letter, we investigate the CPGE in a class of double Weyl semimetal protected by the C 3 z T symmetry by using the effective model. Unlike double Weyl semimetal protected by C n z (n = 4, 6) symmetry, when time-reversal symmetry T is broken, one C 3 z T -protected double Weyl point (WP) evolves into four single WPs, three of which are related by C 3 z symmetry, and these WPs share the same topological charge and reside at the same energy level. This unique configuration enhances the CPGE trace due to the combined topological charge of the three WPs, resulting in a higher quantized plateau. Our findings provide promising prospects for the development of optoelectronic devices in the future.},

In this work, Ca intercalated Germanene-CaGe 2 films were grown on sapphire substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the partial lack of Ca between the germanene buckled layers effectively increases the Seebeck coefficient without restraining the conductivity. A maximum power factor of 170 μ W/mK 2 at 523 K, which is seven times larger than the stoichiometric CaGe 2 film, was achieved in the Ca 0.835 Ge 2 film by suppression of bipolar effect and formation of a Ca-deficient phase.

To enhance PL intensity, field enhancement techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metal nanoparticles, are often employed. However, SPR-induced light confinement at the nanoscale also leads to significant localized heating. In this study, we investigated the impact of near-field heating due to SPR using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and tip-enhanced photoluminescence studies. Our results reveal nearly an order-of-magnitude difference in the enhancement factors (EFs) for Raman and PL signals of monolayer MoS 2 , with a local temperature increase of approximately 147 °C under the TERS tip at a laser power of 10.57 mW. The reduced PL EF compared with Raman EF is attributed to additional near-field heating from SPR. We further observed that local temperature fluctuations critically affect the EFs and found that a high thermal conductivity substrate can effectively mitigate the near-field thermal effects associated with SPR.},

  abstract     = {The ultra-high piezoelectric activity of K 0.5 Na 0.5 NbO 3 (KNN)-based single crystals with excellent electromechanical coupling characteristics has attracted great interest. However, the growth of KNN-based single crystals is restricted by their high melting point and harsh equipment conditions. In this work, a large-sized single crystal of (K 0.5 Na 0.5 ) 0.994 Bi 0.006 Nb 0.998 Cu 0.004 O 3 (KNNBC) was grown using an inexpensive and simple seed-free solid state crystal growth method. The growth mechanism, domain structures, defects, piezoelectric properties, as well as the conduction mechanisms of the KNNBC single crystal were systematically investigated. A significant piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) as high as 392 pC/N is obtained in the KNNBC single crystal, which is three times higher than that of ceramics with the same composition, and the single crystal also maintains a high Curie temperature ( T c ∼ 399 °C). The superior piezoelectric properties are believed to stem from the ordered arrangement of large-sized striped domains (∼300 nm) and the sensitivity to polarization rotation due to the flattening of the Landau energy density. Additionally, the spontaneous polarization combined with complex defect dipoles consisting of Cu 2+ ions and O 2− vacancies effectively modulates both the quality factor ( Q m ) and the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) of the single crystals. This work broadens the growth strategy of high-performance KNN-based single crystals and highlights the great benefits of the synergistic modulation of defects and domains on the piezoelectric properties of single crystals.},

Our findings show that the electric polarization state of the Sc 2 CO 2 monolayer governs the electronic properties of heterostructures. Positive polarization induces a direct gap at the valleys, enabling valleytronic functionality for excitation and readout via circularly polarized light, while negative polarization results in an indirect-gap, suppressing valleytronic behavior. Moreover, our transport simulations further demonstrate a polarization-dependent ferroelectric p-i-n junction with 8 nm possesses a maximum tunnel electroresistance (TER) ratio of 1.60 × 10 8 % at a bias of 0.5 eV. These results provide insights into ferroelectric-controlled valleytronic transitions and position the HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 heterostructure as a promising candidate for energy-efficient valleytronic memory and nonvolatile storage applications.},

Therefore, we conduct the biased in situ transmission electron microscopy experiments on the electrical transport properties of BFO single crystals with single domains. The in situ measured I – V curves indicate neither one-way conduction nor resistance switching. The conductive behavior of BFO corresponds to space charge-limited conduction, indicating a high concentration of oxygen vacancies and the presence of Ohmic contact between the Pt electrode and BFO. After applying a DC constant voltage, the resistance decreases by approximately 50% and partially recovers after exposure to air. The electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra under different conditions indicate that BFO interacts with the external environment. Specifically, DC voltage causes BFO to release oxygen atoms, resulting in an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration and decrease in resistance. Air oxidation leads to a decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration and partial recovery of resistance. In addition, in situ heating experiments (at 20–400 °C) indicate that oxygen vacancies mainly originate from the external electric field rather than thermal effects.},

In this work, the atomic configuration, chemical composition, and magnetic properties of Fe 3 X 4 (X = S, Se, Te) nanowires were confirmed by first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Due to their intrinsic anisotropic character and strong d-p hybridization, Fe 3 X 4 nanowires exhibit antiferromagnetic semiconducting behavior with good stability, a tunable bandgap of 0.277–0.771 eV, a large vertical magnetic anisotropy energy of 2.39 meV/Fe, and a high Néel temperature of 680–840 K. Moreover, the calculation of the spin transport properties has shown that these Fe 3 X 4 nanowires possess the negative differential resistance behavior with the peak-to-valley current ratio from 1.84 to 6.85.

However, reducing the thickness of the NiCo 2 O 4 film to a few atomic layers degrades its room temperature magnetic and electrical properties, limiting its practical application. In this study, a Co 3 O 4 buffer layer is introduced into ultrathin NiCo 2 O 4 films, which significantly enhances the Curie temperature beyond room temperature and reduces the resistivity, while preserving the strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as well as the robust anomalous Hall effect. It is found that the sheet resistance dramatically decreases with the increase in Co 3 O 4 thickness. The observed phenomena may originate from the increased occupation of Ni 3+ ions at octahedral sites due to the interfacial coupling, resulting in the intrinsic linear relationship between resistivity and Curie temperature. Additionally, the scaling relation between the anomalous Hall conductivity and longitudinal conductivity highlights the complex interaction between spin-dependent impurity scattering and the band intrinsic Berry curvature. This study indicates that interfacial coupling is an effective strategy for tuning the physical properties of oxides, providing a promising avenue for the application of NiCo 2 O 4 -based materials in miniaturized spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit torque (SOT) switching is a promising candidate mechanism to be applied in the spintronic devices. Here, we report the SOT switching in the [Co/Ni] × n multilayers with maze domain structures. The experimental results show that the SOT switching efficiency strongly depends on the magnetic structure of the ferromagnet (FM) layer. With the increase in cycle number of [Co/Ni] × n multilayers, the switching ratio rapidly decreases, even cannot present the magnetization switching. This switching behavior can be attributed to the strong domain wall pinning in the samples with the maze domain structure. Moreover, although the samples in this work have the same spin current sources, the estimated SOT efficiencies vary greatly, suggesting that the SOT efficiency in a FM/heavy metal (HM) structure depends not only on the spin Hall effect and/or Rashba effect but also on the magnetic structure of FM layer. This work provides a better understanding for the nature of SOT switching in the FM/HM heterostructures with maze domain.},

  abstract     = {During the grain boundary diffusion (GBD) of Tb, the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures are the two main microstructures influencing the magnetic properties of the sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets. These two microstructures are all composed of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B phase, but the formation mechanisms are different. The difference in formation mechanism of the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures was studied by quenching the magnets at different temperatures and holding times. The (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell of the core–shell structure is the precondition for forming the reverse core–shell structure. The triple-junction phases (TJPs) area change proves that the Nd elements diffuse from the TJPs to the surface of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell to form the Tb-poor shell in the reverse core–shell structure and the Gaussian distribution of Tb in the shell of the core–shell structure. In addition, the difference in the Tb content distribution leads to different demagnetization processes, resulting in the opposite effect of these two microstructures on the coercivity. The GBD aims to increase the entire coercivity by enhancing the surface anisotropy field ( H A ), such as the Tb-rich shell for the grains and the Tb-rich surface (∼200 μ m) for the magnets. Therefore, for the reverse core–shell structure forming in the surface of the magnets, the surface with a low H A decreases the coercivity of the grains, reducing the coercivity of the magnets.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with high spin polarization and controllable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) are critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer Cr 2 Te 2 exhibits intrinsic dynamic/thermal stability, half-metallicity, and robust ferromagnetic ordering. The Curie temperature ( T c ) can be elevated from 90 to 190 K via external stimuli. Strain engineering, carrier doping, and electric-fields enable precise control of MAE, while tensile strain and electron doping enhance MAE to 2.680 meV. Conversely, compressive strain and hole doping induce a spin reorientation transition. Moreover, external electric fields also play a key role in determining MAE, suggesting a promising strategy for manipulating MAE in 2D ferromagnets. These modifications primarily arise from the alternations of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) strength between Te-derived p -orbitals within specific spin channels. These findings establish Cr 2 Te 2 as a versatile platform for spintronics integrating half-metallicity with dynamically adjustable magnetic properties and motivate further experimental exploration.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the orbital torque generated in ferromagnetic (FM)/manganese (Mn) bilayer systems based on angular-dependent spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) experiments. From the ST-FMR results, it is found that a relatively large out-of-plane anti-damping torque can be obtained in Ni/Mn bilayers. The Gilbert damping constant, derived from the resonant linewidth of frequency-dependent ST-FMR experiments, decreases almost linearly with increasing thickness of Mn, further indicating the out-of-plane anti-damping torque in Ni/Mn bilayer systems. The origin of this torque can be attributed to the orbital Rashba–Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the orbital diffusion length ( ⁠ λ L ⁠ ) in Mn is determined to be more than 17 nm and larger than spin diffusion length, suggesting that the torque observed in our sample is predominantly influenced by the orbital-related effect. Finally, the insertion of Pt in a Ni/Mn bilayer system significantly enhances the orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that Mn is a promising material for future orbitronics devices.},

  abstract     = {Understanding thermal transport behaviors across dissimilar metal films is essential for optimizing electronic devices&#39; performance and efficiency. However, the effect of interfacial parameters such as the thickness on interfacial thermal conductance ( G ) of metal/metal remains elusive. In this Letter, the G between Al and Cu with varying Cu thickness was investigated from 78 to 295 K using the time domain thermoreflectance technique combined with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM). The temperature dependence of G Al/Cu follows a pattern that is consistent with phonon-related thermal transport behaviors and decreases with increasing Cu thickness. The phonon related behaviors are attributed to the existence of the oxide layer at the interface. By taking the oxide layer into account, NEMD and DMM calculations match well with the experimental results, proving that the oxide layer hinders electron transport across the interface. We further find that strain distributions in Cu layers have a negative correlation with Cu thickness. When applying compressive strain on Cu, the overlap of phonon density of states between Cu and Al increases, especially for phonons of 6.5–9 THz, which is responsible for the Cu thickness-dependence in G Al/Cu . Our results not only help revealing strain effect on G but also pave the way for the thermal design of metal interconnect in integrated circuits.},

  abstract     = {Integrating high thermal conductivity cost-effective SiC to the Si-active-layer film is an effective solution to enhance the thermal performance of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and maintain its distinct electrical performance. Although direct bonding of Si films to SiC substrates demonstrates many advantages over epitaxial growth, different bonding techniques may yield disparate bonding qualities and heat dissipation abilities. Here, a comparative analysis from thermal-mechanical-structural perspectives of different Si/SiC interfaces, prepared by hydrophilic bonding (HB) and surface-activated bonding (SAB) methods, is systematically conducted. It was found that the amorphous interlayer thickness and thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of the SAB-Si/SiC heterojunction can be significantly modulated by annealing, accompanied by a beneficial decreased TBR at high working temperatures. Moreover, the residual stress within the Si film by SAB is greatly reduced to an order of magnitude lower than that by HB. In general, the SAB-Si/SiC interface exhibits a tunable microstructure, comparably low TBR, and nearly fully relaxed stress, potentially outperforming the HB-Si/SiC interface when considering the comprehensive performance. This work puts forward an important thermal-mechanical perspective to evaluate interface bonding quality for practical applications, and removes a headache barrier toward wafer-scale high-yield integration of Si active layers onto SiC substrates to greatly enhance SOI devices&#39; thermal management.},

This study systematically investigated the electrical properties, microstructure, elemental valence states, and energy-band alignment of these heterojunctions through multiple analytical techniques. Current–voltage measurements revealed an asymmetric, nonlinear behavior due to the depletion region at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface, with annealing further enhancing electrical performance by yielding a lower turn-on voltage of 0.3 V, an increased rectification ratio of 81.1, and a reduced ideality factor of 6.69. Band structure analysis showed that both the conduction band offset and valence band offset at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface increase, indicating a higher barrier height, resulting in more pronounced rectification behavior. X-ray diffraction showed that the laser-treated samples have polycrystalline structures, and annealing improved the crystallinity, thereby enhancing the conductivity. Furthermore, secondary ion mass spectroscopy confirmed the deep implantation of high concentrations of Cu ions into ZnO. Depth‐profiling x‐ray photoelectron spectra revealed the co-presence of Cu + and Cu 2+ , both of which contribute to the p -type conductivity.

However, the specific contact resistance values of p-GaN remain limited to the range of mid-10 −2 Ω cm 2 due to the low activation ratio of Mg dopants and high work function. Here, we propose an Ohmic contact method using a Pd-based metal stack to achieve lower specific contact resistance compared to conventional p-GaN contact metals such as Ni/Au or Pt/Au. A low specific contact resistance of 1.08 × 10 −5 Ω cm 2 was demonstrated for p-GaN by annealing a Pd-based tri-layer metal contact in an oxygen-rich ambient with an optimized Pd thickness. The mechanism driving this low specific contact resistance was investigated using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicated the mutual diffusion of Ni, Pd, and Ga atoms within the metal alloy. A NiO layer was formed on the top of the metal alloy, and Pd-Ga compounds were formed at the metal/p-GaN interface through mutual diffusion of atoms. This process increased the number of Ga vacancies in p-GaN, playing a crucial role in reducing its contact resistance.},

The hole mobility for CsPbBr 3 at room temperature is modest to be around 25 cm 2 /(V · s). The value of the corresponding power-law index n for hole mobility on temperature (μ ∼ T -n ) is around −1.23 in the range of 155–350 K, which is well consistent with the previous FET and Hall effect measurements, as well as theoretical calculations. The polar optical phonon rather than acoustic phonon is confirmed to be responsible for scattering carriers at room temperature.

  abstract     = {This study explores the impact of constant forward electrical stress on beta-gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) from the prospective of defect evolution. Prolonged stress significantly increased the reverse leakage current density ( J R ) and forward current density ( J F ) under small bias and decreased the turn-on voltage ( V on ). Temperature-dependent current-voltage ( I-V-T ) analysis revealed that the reverse leakage current is dominated by Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission in both fresh and stressed SBDs, while the forward current transport mechanism transforms from thermionic emission (TE) to trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) after stress. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) results identified an intrinsic trap E 2 * (E C - 0.75 eV) within the β -Ga 2 O 3 drift layer, which is likely a Ga vacancy-related trap. The consistency of this energy level with the PF barrier proves that the increase in this trap is the main reason for the increase in J R . The spatial distribution features that the increase in trap concentration near the metal-semiconductor interface is much larger than that inside the bulk, which establishes the association between this trap and J F under small bias and V on . These findings highlight the critical role of trap evolution in SBD performance degradation under electrical stress.},

Featuring a 7 nm AlN barrier layer and the regrown n + -GaN Ohmic contacts, the device shows low sheet and contact resistances, leading to 1.6-A/mm output current, 3-V knee voltage, and consequent 75% power-added efficiency (PAE) and 1.3-W/mm output power density ( P out ) at 2.6 GHz and 6-V drain voltage ( V DS ). This PAE- P out result represents the state-of-the-art levels of low-voltage power amplifiers (LV PAs) for sub-6G applications. Meanwhile, the TAB-HEMT is found to exhibit satisfactory linearity and noise performance as well. The OIP3 (output third-order intercept point) value of 35.3 dBm is obtained at 6-V V DS , thanks to the elaborately designed thick AlN barrier. A minimum noise figure ( NF min ) as low as 0.32 dB at 2.6 GHz and V DS = 6 V is achieved thanks to the suppressed thermal noise enabled by low channel resistance. These results highlight the potential of the TAB-HEMT as an all-around and compact device platform for LV RF front-end-module applications.},

In this study, we investigate freestanding VO 2 microbeams that undergo reversible transitions from an insulating triclinic (T) phase to an insulating monoclinic (M2) phase, followed by a transition to the R phase. The latent heat changes associated with these first-order phase transitions are monitored using a recently developed chip-based differential scanning calorimetry technique, which demonstrates exceptional sensitivity and resolving power. A series of sharp endothermic and exothermic peaks are observed during the temperature ramping process. In contrast to the abrupt and complete transformation typically observed in conventional insulator-to-metal transitions, our findings reveal a scenario in which multiple domains coexist, and phase transitions occur sequentially within each domain. These results underscore the intricate relationship between domain dynamics and the multiple phase structures in VO 2 . Furthermore, they highlight the potential of advanced thermal analysis techniques to detect subtle thermal signals associated with phase transition processes, providing fresh insights into the underlying mechanisms.},

Here, we proposed a hitherto unknown layered carbon structure, designated as pop -graphite, synthesizable from high-pressure prepared sodium–carbon compounds. Through ab initio evolutionary structure searches and first-principles calculations, we identify a thermodynamically stable layered NaC 3 intercalation compound at 14.0 GPa, featuring a distinctive edge-sharing penta-octa-penta ( pop ) carbon framework with intercalated sodium atoms. Upon sodium removal, the resultant pop -graphite structure remains stable under ambient conditions, exhibiting superior electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility compared to conventional graphite. Our calculations reveal its intrinsic metallic nature and single-gap superconductivity, driven by electron–phonon coupling involving C p z states.

Our first-principles density functional theory calculations uncover that the phase transformation is due to the variation of Sn atomic coordination accompanied by the Sn–I polyhedral distortion. Both phases are indirect bandgap, which is smaller than the atmospheric phase. Further calculations show that intrapolyhedral Sn−Sn hybridization and interpolyhedral I–I coupling lead to the Sn–I polyhedral distortion.

However, currently developed LARHEAs generally have poor room temperature ductility, which greatly limits their wide applications. In this study, two kinds of LARHEAs with chemical compositions of TiZrTaCr and TiZrTaV in equal atomic percentage were designed based on low neutron absorption cross section, low neutron activation, and mixing enthalpy parameters. The LARHEA samples were prepared by high vacuum arc-melting techniques, and their phase structures and mechanical properties were studied. It was found that the TiZrTaCr LARHEA exhibited two body-center-cubic (BCC) and one Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound phases, and it had a yield strength of 1364 ± 54 MPa, but it was brittle, while the TiZrTaV LARHEA formed three BCC solid solution phases, and it had a high yield strength of 1312 ± 57 MPa with a room temperature compression plasticity of 13% ± 0.8%. Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound formation in the solid solution matrix could have led to the brittleness of the LARHEAs, which was mainly due to the large negative mixing enthalpy of the Cr element with Zr element in this alloy system. This study proposed a basic method for LARHEA design to optimize the microstructures and improve the mechanical properties as structural materials.},

Here, we proposed a multifunctional LWIR metasurface emitter with a switchable radiation state, which consists of germanium (Ge) rectangular pair resonators placed on a vanadium oxide (VO 2 ) film. By manipulating the reversible metal-to-insulator phase transition of phase change material VO 2 , the spatial and spectral emission characteristics could be dynamically controlled. The high loss of metallic VO 2 enables broadband emission in the LWIR band. The average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range reaches 91.3% and exhibits wide-angle emission properties. When the VO 2 is transformed to the insulating phase, the coupling effect of the symmetry-breaking rectangle with two quasi-bound states in the continuum modes enhances the emission intensity of VO 2 at a selective wavelength. This results in narrowband emission with a high-quality factor (Q-factor) and high directional selectivity. Notably, the emission peak&#39;s linewidth is only 28 nm, with a Q-factor of 293, and the average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range drops to 9.4%. Overall, the proposed metasurface device achieves an LWIR emissivity switching ratio of 9.7 between its two operating modes, showcasing significant differences in spectral and spatial radiation characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Open stopband (OSB) mitigation techniques are commonly used to improve the far-field radiating properties of leaky-wave antennas based on periodic structures. Recently, leaky waves have been proposed to focus energy in the near field through Bessel beams. However, the focusing character of Bessel beams is notably limited to a maximum distance known as the nondiffractive range . In this work, an OSB mitigation technique is originally exploited to significantly extend the nondiffractive range of a Bessel beam generated by a leaky-wave launcher in the microwave/millimeter-wave range. A comprehensive analysis of this device is presented, comparing the performance of the proposed launcher with the typical structure of a leaky-wave Bessel-beam launcher where the OSB is not suppressed. Theoretical results, corroborated by full-wave simulations, demonstrate that the proposed device achieves an impressive nondiffractive range of about 25 m. The latter, at 30 GHz, approximately corresponds to 2500 wavelengths (in vacuum) and to 50 times the aperture diameter which is about 50 cm. These results look particularly attractive for, e.g., near-field communications and wireless power transfer applications, where focusing energy in narrow regions and over large distances is a key factor.},

In this work, we theoretically propose a temperature-tunable terahertz (THz) chiral absorber based on a metasurface of Ag–VO 2 nested split-rings. Perfect absorption of left-handed circularly polarized light (LCP) exceeding 99% and weak absorption of only about 6% of right-handed circularly polarized light (RCP) are achieved at 7.24 THz in frequency. The discrepancy in absorption responses of LCP and RCP results in a large circular dichroism (CD) of 0.94. The CD value in the THz region can be actively modulated between 0.02 and 0.94 by controlling the phase transition of VO 2 , which is closely related to the ambient temperature. Moreover, near-field imaging and encrypted presentation are realized by leveraging the metasurface and its mirror-image properties. Our work holds significant promise in widespread fields including THz intelligent absorption, imaging, and chiral detection.},

  abstract     = {Polarization is one of the basic properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, and polarization conversion is essential in many terahertz (THz) applications, including communications and sensitive measurements. Due to the limitations of the materials and process, existing THz polarization converters generally have the disadvantages of narrow operating frequency band and non-flexibility. We experimentally demonstrate a flexible ultra-broadband THz polarization converter operating in reflection. It can efficiently convert a linearly polarized THz wave to its orthogonal counterpart in a broadband regime. The device consists of three layers: the lower metal film, the middle dielectric layer, and the upper metal resonance structure array. The unit cell of the upper metal resonance structure is a four-open-ring formed by subtracting two metal bars from a metal ring. The position of the opening is in the diagonal direction of 45° from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of the unit structure. The device is simulated using a full wave EM simulation software and fabricated by a surface micromachining process. The test experiment is completed using a THz-TDS spectrometer and the results show that the polarization conversion ratio is more than 0.8 in an ultra-broadband regime from 1.45 to 2.67 THz. This ultra-broadband conversion is mainly caused by the magnetic resonance of THz waves. More importantly, the convertible frequency band can be tailored for practical applications across the EM spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Drop impact on non-wetting surfaces has garnered significant interest due to its potential applications in water repellency, drag reduction, self-cleaning, and anti-icing. However, there are instances where a droplet fails to rebound from a superhydrophobic surface. It has been reported that the combined effect of gravito-capillary length and visco-capillary length determines the pinning–bouncing criteria. While the fluid properties, such as viscosity and weight, are often considered primary factors influencing droplet rebound, this study highlights the crucial role of surface characteristics, particularly the contact angle hysteresis, in determining post-impact behavior. We propose a modified criterion that predicts droplet bouncing and pinning on superhydrophobic surfaces by integrating both fluid properties and the contact angle hysteresis of the surface. The findings emphasize the importance of surface morphology in droplet dynamics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of droplet behavior on non-wetting surfaces.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of silicon germanium (SiGe) cladded channels for stacked nanowires (NWs), focusing on morphological control and strain engineering to enhance device performance. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the Si NWs and SiGe cladding morphology. The results demonstrate that the morphology of SiGe cladding can be controlled by adjusting the high-temperature H 2 baking conditions, leading to shapes such as triangular, circular, and hexagonal. Technology computer-aided design simulations and geometric phase analysis of TEM images revealed that the maximum compressive stress of SiGe cladding is 3 GPa, corresponding to a compressive strain of 2.48%, which significantly enhances hole mobility. Electrical performance tests and simulations on p -type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor devices with different morphologies showed excellent short-channel effect control, with a subthreshold swing (SS) of approximately 70 mV/dec and a drain-induced barrier lowering of only 40 mV/V. These findings provide valuable guidelines for fabricating high-quality SiGe channels with controlled structures, enabling the realization of high carrier mobilities in future devices.},

In this study, we report a strategy using functionally graded lattice structures (FGLS) to manipulate the multipactor of the ceramic surface. First, particle-in-cell simulations were conducted to study the secondary electron avalanche process. Simulation results indicated that the interaction between electrons and FGLS hinders the development of secondary electron avalanche. Also, a few positive charges can be accumulated on the ceramic surface since FGLS eliminates the macroscopic interface between insulators and vacuum. Subsequently, stereolithography 3D printing technology was adopted to fabricate ceramic insulators with FGLS, and a further experimental characterization verifies the reduction of secondary electron yield, especially for surfaces with finer structures.},

  abstract     = {We report on the fabrication and characterization of p–n diodes made from wide bandgap II-VI semiconductors (p-ZnTe/n-CdTe) containing nano-inclusions of narrow bandgap material (PbTe). The diodes are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy on semi-insulating GaAs (100) substrates. The PbTe nano-inclusions are formed either as a single layer of PbTe with a thickness of 350 nm or as multilayers built from alternating thin layers of PbTe and CdTe. Comparison of cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images with electron beam-induced current measurements confirms that the PbTe nano-inclusions are located in depletion regions of the diodes. Despite the presence of the highly conductive, narrow bandgap PbTe semiconductor between the p- an n-type layers, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices show rectifying behavior and acceptable diode parameters in the wide temperature range of 60–290 K. The p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes with PbTe nano-inclusions exhibit significant sensitivity to infrared radiation starting at the wavelength of about 1.5 μ m and with a long-wavelength cutoff of 3.9 and 5.4 μ m at 290 and 50 K, respectively. A peak sensitivity appears at a wavelength of 2.29 μ m and reaches the maximum of almost 1 V/W at a temperature of 150 K. The temperature dependence of the cutoff wavelength clearly shows that the sensitivity to infrared radiation of the wide bandgap p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes is due to band-to-band optical excitations taking place in PbTe nano-inclusions. The results presented here prove that such diodes can be used for infrared sensing or for two-color infrared solar cells.},

With this level of control, important size limitations and integration problems can be overcome, and material platforms with tunable polar properties for multi-functional devices and sensors can be developed for the next generation of information and energy technologies. We highlight the co-existence of polar properties that have been found on local scales using advanced local characterization techniques as well as methods to control polar properties in transition metal thio-/selenophosphates.

The hexagonal wurtzite structure, which is a typical crystal structure in compound semiconductors, demonstrates pronounced anisotropy, especially in its response to external stimuli. Recently, mechanical behavior under light illumination has attracted increasing interest especially in semiconductor compounds. In this study, we investigated the anisotropy of illumination effects on the nanomechanical properties of wurtzite ZnO. Four surface orientations—(0001), (0001) 45° off, ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ), and ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ )—were subjected to nanoindentation creep and nanoindentation hardness tests under controlled light illumination. The indentation depth during nanoindentation creep under light illumination was consistently smaller than that in darkness for all surface orientations, confirming that light suppresses indentation creep deformation, but to different degrees depending on the surface orientation. This suggests that the activated slip systems and the distribution of dislocations play a crucial role in modulating dislocation behavior under light illumination. The nanoindentation hardness followed the trend on the four surface orientations: (0001) &gt; (0001) 45° off &gt; ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ) &gt; ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ ), reflecting anisotropic behavior in nanomechanical properties. Second and subsequent pop-in events were extracted, exhibiting different behaviors depending on the surface orientations, and may play a key role in determining the anisotropy in nanoindentation hardness. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the plastic anisotropy under light control in wurtzite ZnO.},

  abstract     = {Passive solar heating and radiative cooling attracted lots of attention in global energy consumption reduction due to their unique electricity-free advantage. However, static single radiation cooling or solar heating would lead to over-cooling or over-heating in cold or hot weather, respectively. How to achieve effective self-adaptive thermoregulation is critical for dynamic thermal management. Hence, in this work, a self-adaptive thermoregulation strategy was designed by coupling latent heat storage or release with reversible solar heating and radiative cooling. A commercial memory alloy could realize self-adaptive thermoregulation at the critical temperature between radiative cooling with high solar reflectance R ¯ solar = 0.95 and thermal emittance ε ¯ LWIR = 0.93, and solar heating with high solar absorptance α ¯ solar = 0.92 and low thermal emittance ε ¯ IR = 0.08. High thermal conductive phase change material could further improve the thermoregulation performance with a latent heat of ∼136 J g −1 , and thermal conductivity of 3.4 W m −1 K −1 , resulting in a superior heating performance than the single solar heating (39.9 vs 36.9 °C) and superior cooling performance than the single radiative cooling (33.8 vs 35.5 °C). The maximum heating temperature increase could be 12.7 °C in the cold situation, and the temperature drop could be 8.3 °C in the hot situation. Energy consumption calculation showed that the designed sample could save 68%–90% of annual energy consumption compared with the common roof, indicating that coupling spectral regulation with the latent heat can greatly improve the self-adaptive thermoregulation performance and save the total energy consumption in thermal management.},

  abstract     = {The lack of low-work function materials and the negative space charge effect have long prevented vacuum thermionic energy converters (VTECs) from becoming a practical means of power generation. Advancements in microfabrication have since provided solutions to these challenges, such as the suppression of negative space charge via a micro/nanoscale interelectrode vacuum gap distance, reigniting interest in VTECs as a potential clean energy technology. However, the limited operational lifetimes of many low-work function coatings have hindered their practical device-level implementation. Solid-state thermionic energy converters (SSTECs) have been proposed as a viable alternative to VTECs since they do not require an interelectrode vacuum gap or low-work function electrodes. Nevertheless, SSTECs still require a large temperature gradient between electrodes and are limited to low operating voltages. To address these limitations, we propose a near-field enhanced solid-state thermionic energy converter (NF-SSTEC), which leverages the advantages of SSTECs by eliminating the need for a large temperature gradient between the electrodes and increasing the range of possible operating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate conversion efficiencies of 16.8 % and power densities as high as 13.1 W cm −2 without needing a high-temperature gradient between the radiator and SSTEC. Additionally, we compare its performance under different radiation spectra, showing the potential for improvement via further optimization of the radiator.},

Specifically, we use a single gold subwavelength nanochannel to simultaneously apply both spatial confinement and plasmonic enhancement. Furthermore, instead of using an ultrafast laser, we demonstrate the feasibility of drilling nanochannels on suspended substrate using continuous lasers. In contrast to conventional plasmonic nanochannels with plasmonic enhancement only under transverse magnetic (TM) mode laser, our sample presents obvious plasmonic effects under both TM and transverse electric mode lasers, which is beneficial for improving the overall signal.

  abstract     = {Nanomechanical resonators crafted from two-dimensional materials exhibit heightened sensitivity to stress. The impact of tensile stress on resonators has received extensive attention. However, relatively little emphasis has been focused on the behavior of resonators under compression stresses, especially in the buckled state. This study explored the vibration of buckled graphite sheets under external excitation using experimental analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and nonlinear isotropic plate model (NIPM). Notably, multiple peaks corresponding to the identical mode appeared in the spectrum. The additional peak distinct from the natural frequency arose from transition between two steady states of the film. Remarkably, the frequency of the peak corresponding to the transition exhibited greater sensitivity to external excitations and stress than the natural frequency of the resonator did. This phenomenon opens avenues for developing 2D resonant nanomechanical sensors with enhanced sensitivity, as well as bistable nanoelectromechanical resonators.},

  abstract     = {Bulk CsPbBr 3 is an emerging semiconductor that has shown unprecedented increase in performance over the last decade for optoelectronic applications. However, further development of devices based on CsPbBr 3 is hampered by their poor electrical stability under operation. Migration and accumulation of native ions (Cs + , Pb 2+ , and Br - ) under electric fields has been suggested by many groups to be responsible for the observed device instabilities, although direct experimental evidence of ionic motion during operation has been seldom reported. In our study, ion migration has been probed by grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) in CsPbBr 3 polycrystalline layers grown in vapor phase. Our findings indicate that both Cs and Br experience ionic migration under electric field, suggesting that these ions are responsible for the measured current instability in our devices. In the timescale of a few hours, the ionic drifting rates of mobile Cs and Br under the top electrode were found to be similar, as high as ∼ 20 ppm h −1 V −1 mm. This work paves the way for a better understanding of ion motion issues that play a key role in the optoelectronic properties of CsPbBr 3 devices.},

By analyzing the iso frequency surface&#39;s response of spiral photonic crystals, we predict the AT of light at certain incident angles. We fabricate dielectric spiral PCs with different gradients of 1%, 11%, and 28% in the z -direction using the femtosecond laser direct writing technique.

  abstract     = {Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) has played an important role in determining the electronic band structures of semiconductors. However, the tip-induced band bending (TIBB) could strongly affect the measured valence and conduction band edges, which are of vital importance for a semiconductor. In the literature, the presence or absence of the TIBB effect in a given STS measurement is often not discussed thoroughly. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the TIBB effect in MoS 2 with varying thicknesses using light-modulated contact-mode STS. Our results demonstrate that the TIBB effect is strongly dependent on the thickness of MoS 2 . With thin MoS 2 of a few atomic layers (several nanometers), the TIBB approaches zero, and the measured STS can accurately reflect the band edges. While for thicker MoS 2 of ∼100 nm, the TIBB can be as large as ∼1 eV. This work clarifies the ambiguity about the TIBB effect and provides a foundation for the interpretation of STS data on atomically thin semiconductors.},

This study comprehensively tracks the ferroelectric polarization and phonon property changes resulting from interlayer sliding in a β -GaSe bilayer. The results indicate that sliding the upper layer of the bilayer induces charge transfer, causing polarization accompanied by periodic changes and reversal in non-polarized β -GaSe. Simultaneously, low-frequency optical phonons in polarized structures soften significantly, exhibiting a minimum or rapid decrease accompanied by the maximum value of in-plane polarization. Additionally, the sliding symmetry breaking has complex effects on phonon transport, causing intriguing changes in transport characteristics due to variations in group velocity and linewidth, which are closely related to ferroelectric polarization. This study reveals not only the polarization achieved in the β -GaSe bilayer through sliding-induced symmetry breaking but also its complex effects on phonons and profound physical changes, enriching our understanding of the associated condensed matter physics.},

The dispersion relationships between the resonant frequencies and wavelengths for the resonators, including the shear horizontal (SH) and Rayleigh modes, are investigated. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the main SH mode provides a larger coupling coefficient ( K 2 ) and that the spurious Rayleigh mode can be shifted from the passband and away from the main SH mode. Although the proposed POI SAW resonators on two different substrates have comparable frequencies for the same wavelength, the sapphire-based substrate exhibits a larger K 2 of 28% and a higher fitted Bode- Q max of 977 at 1.4 GHz. The temperature behavior of the SAW resonators is measured over a temperature range from −25 to 250 °C. The findings indicated that the resonator with the Si-based substrate has better temperature stability, with a temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of −16.99 ppm/°C and a turning point at 150 °C. In contrast, the one with the sapphire-based substrate provides a moderate TCF of −22.15 ppm/°C and remains linear for temperatures above 200 °C. This study reveals the impact of different substrate structures on the performance of SAW resonators, providing guidance for the design of desired SAW devices and their applications.},

In this study, we present an alternative approach to flexoelectric-induced domain engineering in suspended two-dimensional CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS) membranes by varying the ambient pressure. By capping CIPS over cavity holes, internal air pressurization induces bulging, which results in unique encircled domain configurations governed by local strain gradients showing upward and downward polarizations at the center and the edge of the suspended membrane, respectively. Furthermore, this domain configuration can be bidirectionally modulated by varying the ambient pressure. We demonstrate reversible variations in domain size, driven by topographic changes that redistribute the strain gradient. Our findings demonstrate that ambient pressure can be used to engineer domains in suspended ferroelectric membranes, opening avenues for the development of emerging ferroelectric devices that are sensitive to ambient pressure.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the avalanche dynamics of ferroelectric domain switching in barium titanate single crystals across a range of temperatures using acoustic emission techniques. Ferroelectric domain switching induced by an electric field exhibits scale-invariant avalanche dynamics, with the energy exponent increasing from 1.63 ± 0.067 at room temperature to 1.92 ± 0.045 near the Curie point, before decreasing at higher temperatures. This peak in the exponent is attributed to the interplay between equilibrium critical fluctuations and avalanche criticality. As the temperature approaches the Curie point, smaller domains and reduced polarization promote lower-energy switching, increasing the energy exponent. Near the Curie temperature, equilibrium fluctuations further modify the energy landscape, likely generating more phase boundaries and amplifying the energy exponent. Above the Curie temperature, electric field-induced phase transition dominates the switching process, where the higher energy barrier hinders switching, resulting in more energetic events and a lower energy exponent. Across all temperatures, waiting time distributions exhibit double power-law behavior, with exponents of −1 ± 0.05 for short times and −2 ± 0.10 for long times, while aftershock activity follows Omori&#39;s law with an exponent close to −1, indicating robust temporal correlations in ferroelectric domain switching.

By employing floating-zone synthesis with proper heat-treatment process, we systematically tune oxygen vacancies and reveal their dual effect: oxygen vacancies enhance the pyroelectric figure-of-merit, while removing oxygen vacancies extends the effective lifetime in one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion. We discover that the phase transition in a heat-treated single crystal SBN60 device helps achieve stable electricity generation for approximately 7000 cycles in 30 h with enhanced functional reversibility.

  abstract     = {Nb 2 GeTe 4 , a two-dimensional ferroelastic semiconductor, has garnered intense research interest due to its nontrivial physicochemical characteristics of high carrier mobility as well as extraordinary ferroelasticity and optical absorbance along with potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this work, the high-pressure structural, vibrational, and electrical transport properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 up to 60.0 GPa under different hydrostatic environments were systematically studied by Raman spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, and first-principles theoretical calculations. Under non-hydrostatic compression, Nb 2 GeTe 4 experienced a metallization at 11.8 GPa originating from the closure of bandgap due to the considerable compression of interlayer distance and sequential an isostructural phase transition (IPT) at 26.5 GPa. The comparable metallization pressure and the pronounced delay of IPT by ∼4.0 GPa under hydrostatic condition can be reasonably interpreted by the influence of deviatoric stress. Upon decompression, the phase transition of Nb 2 GeTe 4 was demonstrated to be reversible with the possible structural destruction under different hydrostatic environments. Moreover, Nb 2 GeTe 4 underwent a Ohmic-to-super-Ohmic conversion at 1000 mV under high pressure, which was presumably caused by the higher sinusoidal voltage than its thermal voltage. These findings enrich our foundational comprehension on high-pressure physicochemical properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 , thereby fostering its potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) have shown remarkable photon detection characteristics, and scalable architectures allow for the fabrication of SNSPD cameras with over a hundred thousand pixels. Producing such large format devices requires the use of a high throughput lithography process such as stepper photolithography. This restricts nanowire widths to the resolution limit of the photolithography system, which limits performance, particularly for mid-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we develop an SNSPD fabrication process that uses bidirectional atomic layer etching to reduce nanowire widths by &gt; 100 nm, achieving performance that has only previously been attained using low throughput electron beam lithography. This fabrication process will allow for high-pixel count SNSPD cameras with improved performance due to reduced nanowire widths.},

We demonstrate that introducing an asymmetric shunt resistor significantly enhances the noise performance while maintaining the inherent simplicity and tunability of the SQUID design. By optimizing the asymmetry factor, our asymmetric shunted second-order gradient SQUID current sensor reaches a low white flux noise of 0.65 μ Φ 0 /√Hz using a direct readout strategy, representing a threefold improvement over its symmetric counterpart. This noise level surpasses that of the SQUID with the additional positive feedback method and is comparable to the series SQUID arrays, making the asymmetric shunted SQUID suitable for meeting the readout requirements of various scientific instruments.},

Our results show that α is strongly affected by relatively mild annealing conditions ( T = 300 °C) when performed in a vacuum. This increase needs to be taken into account when obtaining the spin-mixing conductance from spin pumping measurements. We measure an increase in α by a factor of × 8 when the YIG is vacuum annealed at 300 °C. No such changes in α are observed when annealed at the same temperature in 1 × 10 −1 mbar of oxygen. We suggest that the main driver for the increase in α is the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , as demonstrated by soft x-ray magnetic spectroscopy.},

In this work, we explore the skyrmion deformation under different magnetic systems, including ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems. We conduct micromagnetic simulations and provide a theoretical analysis of AFM skyrmion deformation, where the skyrmion demonstrates the lowest susceptibility to deformation. We derive a canting term based on the Thiele equation, pointing out an essential term that explains the AFM deformation depression reason. This finding also indicates that the AFM system offers superior stability for skyrmion, making it a promising choice for better option for skyrmion-based spintronics devices.},

Our results show that the magnetization ground state forms a vortex centered either on the hole or on the geometric center of the nanoring, depending on the hole&#39;s position. The observed magnetic patterns yield spin wave modes that split when increasing the ring eccentricity. The new resonant frequencies are associated with hybridized radial and azimuthal modes, which form butterfly-like patterns, which are also observed in magnetic field-driven deviations of vortices from the center of nanodots. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the interplay between geometry and magnetization dynamics, which is crucial for designing magnetic nanostructures with specific functional properties.},

Rare earth (RE) metals, which are promising candidates for tuning spin transmission, can form antiferromagnetically coupled interfaces with ferromagnetic layers. In this study, we investigate the laser-induced ultrafast spin injection from permalloy (Py) into the RE metal holmium (Ho), modulated by interfacial engineering and varying the external magnetic field strength. The antiferromagnetically coupled interface between Py and Ho is confirmed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and its correlation with spin dynamic damping is revealed by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. More importantly, we demonstrate the effective modulation of spin transmission through an external magnetic field. At the Py/Ho interface, a substantial spin-mixing conductance (SMC) of approximately 7.71 × 10 15 cm −2 is observed, which can be modulated by approximately 35% under an external magnetic field. The applied high magnetic fields are found to suppress the large SMC, primarily due to the modified sperimagnetic structure at the Py/Ho interface. These findings demonstrate the excellent spin transmission efficiency in the Py/Ho system, providing a promising approach for magneto-dynamics modulation in spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Diamond and graphene, which have extremely high thermal conductivity, are considered ideal candidates for the preparation of high-performance thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the development of flexible TIMs with efficient heat transfer paths still hampers their thermal management applications. Herein, a highly oriented diamond–graphene composite film (DGCF) was prepared by one-step microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition on carbon cloth (CC) using N-butylamine as a single liquid carbon source. The hybridized composition of sp 3 /sp 2 and the heat transfer path length of DGCF are regulated by the deposition temperature and the thermal conductivity of CC/DGCF at 30 °C is 2.71 W m −1 K −1 , which is 15 times higher than that of CC. Further flexible TIMs of CC/DGCF are achieved using thermal silicone grease (TG) as filler, and the thermal conductivity of the final flexible compound of CC/DGCF/TG is 6.97 W m −1 K −1 at 30 °C, which is 39 times higher than that of pure CC and 2 times higher than that of TG, respectively. In the actual TIMs performance test, the cooling efficiency is 1.4 times higher than that of the commercial thermal conductive silicone pad. Furthermore, finite element simulations demonstrated that the film at 800 °C has the optimal sp 3 /sp 2 ratio for thermal response and the best thermal conductivity path structure. This finding provides a method for the design of highly flexible TIMs and increases the possibility of their practical application in electronic thermal management.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies have shown that higher-order phonon–phonon scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ lat ⁠ ) of 2D-GaN, with the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) calculated using experienced atomic displacement in the finite difference method. In this work, it is found that the 4th-IFCs of 2D-GaN are quite sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite difference method. The effects of the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent 4th-IFCs. The κ lat from three-phonon scattering is reduced by 65.6% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was previously thought the electron–phonon interactions have significant effects on the κ lat of two-dimensional materials. However, the effects of electron–phonon interactions on the κ lat of both n -type and p -type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be neglected due to the few phonon–electron scattering channels and the relatively strong four-phonon scattering.},

Our investigation examines the lattice constants and electronic energy bandgaps of both the superlattice structures and alloys across different Al concentrations, shedding light on the intricate relationship between composition and electronic properties.

Our model discernibly reveals that C N and tri-carbon in GaN intricately modulate both the absorption spectrum and carrier capture process: The rapid capture of holes by the C N defect significantly reduces the hole recombination time to hundreds of femtoseconds in the near-infrared band. Conversely, the tri-carbon defect exhibited a higher absorption cross section by an order of magnitude than that of free carrier in the visible region with a long carrier recombination time. This work clarifies the modulation mechanisms of complex carbon defects in GaN&#39;s nonlinear absorption and provides scientific guidance for designing broadband and integrated ultrafast optical nonlinear devices.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are nanostructures that can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to their 3D quantization. Typically, heterovalent impurities, or dopants, are added to semiconducting QDs to provide extra electrons and improve conductivity. Since each QD is expected to contain a few dopants, the extra electrons and their parent dopants have been difficult to locate. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of the extra electrons and their parent donors in epitaxial InAs/GaAs QDs using local-electrode atom-probe tomography and self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson simulations in the effective mass approximation. Although dopants are provided in both layers, the ionized donors primarily reside outside of the QDs, providing extra electrons that are contained within the QDs. Indeed, due to the quantum confinement-induced enhancement of the donor ionization energy within the QDs, a lower fraction of dopants within the QDs are ionized. These findings suggest a pathway toward the development of 3D modulation-doped nanostructures.},

Using first principles calculations, we demonstrate that the valley and spin degeneracy in the SVSiN 2 bilayer can be manipulated through different interlayer magnetic orders and stackings. Compared with its monolayer counterpart, the valley/spin polarization in the SVSiN 2 bilayer is highly tunable by electric field. Specifically, different stackings, magnetic orders, and vertical electric fields could result in various transport behaviors for the SVSiN 2 bilayer, including spin Hall current, valley Hall current, and anomalous Hall current with different valley, spin, and layer combinations. In addition, the AB and AC stacked SVSiN 2 bilayers with mirror symmetry breaking exhibit the coexistence of ferrovalley and ferroelectric polarization.

The threshold voltages (V th ) of the fabricated MIS-HEMT and MIS-FET reach 0.14 and 2.5 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the fabricated devices exhibited a high off-state breakdown voltage over 1500 V. Compared to high interface trap density (D it ) at the SiN/GaN interface of MIS-FET, a much lower D it was found at the SiN/AlGaN interface of MIS-HEMT owing to the barrier recess-free process. Thus, the MIS-HEMT exhibits a negligible V th shift tested via positive bias temperature instability, which is crucial in the practical application for the E-mode operation. Furthermore, a scheme of extracting the D it of the devices from the flatband voltages (V FB ) shift of C–V curves was developed, and the accuracy of the scheme was verified by multi-frequency C–V tests.},

A comparative investigation on the structural and electrical properties of N-implanted β -Ga 2 O 3 was conducted under different implantation temperatures and post-implantation annealing (PIA) conditions. The results showed that the high-temperature implantation (HTI) at 500 °C, compared to the room-temperature implantation (RTI), introduced fewer structural defects and less lattice distortion to β -Ga 2 O 3 . The HTI-formed CBL demonstrated a far superior current-blocking capability than those formed by the RTI with/without a PIA, in terms of a much lower and more stable leakage current and a significantly enhanced breakdown voltage. Additionally, lateral MOSFETs fabricated with the HTI isolation exhibited a three orders of magnitude lower off-state leakage current while maintaining excellent on-state performance, compared to those using the isolation formed by RTI with PIA. These findings indicate that the in situ dynamic annealing effect of HTI effectively reduces implantation-induced damage, enhances impurity activation, and improves the overall performance of the N-implanted CBLs in β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

  abstract     = {The GaN family as an electronic material and AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as electronic devices have found their widespread usage in power electronics and radio frequency (RF) applications. The threshold voltage is a crucial parameter, and application-specific threshold voltage is a requirement for this technology. A large positive threshold voltage with enhancement-mode operation is useful for power electronics. A depletion-mode transistor is used for radio frequency (RF) applications where the electron mobility is much larger in the channel region due to low interface roughness. A multi-threshold voltage transistor is a desired feature to reduce nonlinearity through compensation in RF applications. We address the issue with threshold voltage by demonstrating a programmable threshold AlGaN/GaN transistor using a dielectric stack as the charge-trapping layer. We have fabricated and characterized a triple-layer dielectric gate stack for AlGaN/GaN metal–insulator–semiconductor HEMTs. The gate stack comprises a high-k tantalum oxide sandwiched between two aluminum oxide layers. The structure is analogous to the polysilicon–aluminum oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon memory used in silicon technology. In addition to providing a large programmable threshold voltage window, the fabricated diodes reduce the gate leakage current by more than four orders of magnitude. The experimental observations are explained by the band edge alignment of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure with the dielectric stack and using a charge-trapping process by a high positive program voltage.},

This CCW phenomenon is due to the dipole formation between the a-In 2 O 3 channel and the SiO X gate insulator by relocating oxygen atoms under the influence of the applied electric field. Hence, bipolar switching of gate bias (V GS ) alters the dipole direction and leads to low (V TL ) and high (V TH ) threshold voltages. The dipole formation increases with the electric field, which can be tailored by gate oxide (SiO X ) thickness or gate bias (V GS ). Therefore, the devices with a gate oxide thickness of 200 nm initially showed the clockwise hysteresis at V GS of 2 V, transformed to the CCW (MW of 4.2 V) with an increase in gate bias to 14 V. Therefore, a difference in oxygen density at the interface can form a dipole to exhibit the CCW phenomenon and behave FeFET-like.},

  abstract     = {Dual-main-phase (DMP) magnets, a promising approach for the efficient utilization of high-abundance rare earth elements, exhibit enhanced coercivity compared to single-main-phase (SMP) magnets. This study demonstrates that a DMP magnet exhibits a 43 kA/m coercivity increase over an SMP magnet of equivalent composition. Microstructural characterization reveals two main-phase grains with distinct core–shell structures in the DMP magnet. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the increased Nd content enhances the anisotropy field of the shells in Ce-rich grains, crucially contributing to the coercivity enhancement. Conversely, Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains do not significantly enhance coercivity. A micromagnetic model, constructed by substituting Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains with (Nd 0.5 Ce 0.5 ) 2 Fe 14 B grains, demonstrates a slight coercivity increase compared to the DMP magnets. Moreover, retaining only the core–shell structure in grains near the end faces maintains higher coercivity than that of DMP magnets. Experimental results of DyCoCu grain boundary diffusion show a 406 kA/m coercivity increase in the DMP magnet, less than the 510 kA/m increase in the diffused SMP magnet. Although diffusion significantly increases the anisotropy field in the shell, the core region of the Ce-rich grains maintains a low anisotropy field, limiting magnetic property enhancement. These findings underscore the critical role of an optimized core–shell structure in enhancing coercivity for Ce-rich magnets, suggesting that the DMP method may not represent the most effective strategy.},

The treated composite exhibits a CTE of −0.028 ppm/K at 240–305 K and a relatively high thermal conductivity of 29.5 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature, leading to a thermal distortion parameter well less than those of other ZTE materials. The improved dimensional stability and the CTE reproducibility can be attributed to the stabilization of matrix microstructure and the greatly relaxed residual stress as revealed by the analysis of 2θ-sin 2 ψ based on x-ray diffraction.},

In this work, we propose a three-dimensional carbon allotrope by interpenetrating α -graphyne sheets with van der Waals interactions and study its structural and electronic properties by first-principles calculations and tight-binding methods. Our calculations show that the energy of this interpenetrated α -graphyne is slightly lower than that of the α -graphyne nanosheet due to the weak van der Waals interactions, and its dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities are further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Remarkably, 3D interpenetrated α -graphyne is a semimetal with both Dirac nodal loops and triply degenerate nodal points near the Fermi level and the Fermi velocities at these nodal points are very high. These properties are superior to 2D α -graphyne and ordinary 3D carbon materials. Our work not only proposes a type of 3D carbon material with multiple types of fermions for carbon-based high-speed nanoelectronic devices but also shows that interpenetrating 2D materials with large hollows is a promising method for constructing 3D materials.},

A combination of HVPE and AlN substrate enabled decreasing deleterious carbon concentration and dislocation density, respectively, thus accentuating the influences of V Al -complexes on the luminescence processes. A low-temperature CL spectrum of unintentionally doped AlN exhibited predominant excitonic emissions at around 6 eV and a marginal deep-state emission band at around 3.7 eV that originates from residual carbon (&lt;10 16 cm −3 ) on nitrogen sites ( ⁠ C N ⁠ ). However, the sample was revealed to contain a considerable amount ( ⁠ ∼ 10 17 cm − 3 ⁠ ) of vacancy clusters, most likely comprising a V Al and nitrogen-vacancies ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ), namely, V Al V N 1 − 2 ⁠ , which act as nonradiative recombination centers that decrease overall CL intensity at elevated temperatures. With increasing Si-doping concentration ([Si]), major vacancy species progressively changed from V Al V N 1 − 2 to V Al O N 1 − 2 ⁠ , where O N is oxygen on N sites, which exhibit other deep-state emission bands ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 eV. Further increase in [Si] gave rise to the formation of donor-compensating defects comprising V Al and Si on the second-nearest-neighbor Al sites ( ⁠ Si Al ⁠ ), abbreviated by V Al − Si Al n ⁠ , which exhibit emission shoulders at around 2.9–3.0 eV. When [Si] exceeded 5 × 10 18 cm −3 , an emission band at around 4.5 eV emerged, which had been ascribed to originate from the nearest-neighbor Si Al C N complexes. Because V Al -complexes, including those containing impurities, are thermally stable, incorporation of vacancies should be blocked at the growth stage.},

  abstract     = {Low-dimensional materials have attracted significant attention due to their unique physical properties and broad potential applications. Antimony selenide is well known for its thermoelectric properties. However, the on-surface synthesis of chain-like structures with varying stoichiometries remains challenging. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the epitaxial growth of SbSe chain structures. With increasing deposition of Sb and Se, a transition is observed in both the structural and electronic properties, shifting from semiconducting mixed chains to metallic uniform tri-chains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the elemental composition and helps determine the stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations show that the mixed-chain phase is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.17 eV, and that spin–orbit coupling induces band splitting. In contrast, the tri-chain phase, formed by weak van der Waals interactions between chains within the unit cell, undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition due to strong hybridization near the Fermi level. These findings not only provide a strategy for tuning the electronic properties of one-dimensional materials but also provide valuable insights for the design of thermoelectric and quantum materials, with potential applications in next-generation electronic devices.},

In this work, both the conventional orthorhombic and distinct cubic CoSbS compounds were facilely synthesized using the high-pressure and high-temperature method. It was found that cubic CoSbS exhibits a higher solid solubility of Ni at the Co site compared to the orthorhombic sample. The high-density point defect Ni Co in cubic CoSbS results in enhanced phonon scattering, thereby sharply suppressing phonon thermal conductivity. First-principles calculations show that the cubic structure of CoSbS exhibits higher band degeneracy and greater band dispersion compared to the orthorhombic structure, resulting in superior electrical transport properties. As a result, an enhanced figure of merit zT ∼ 0.37 was obtained at 773 K for cubic Ni 0.1 Co 0.9 SbS, which is approximately 16% higher than that of the orthorhombic sample prepared by the same method. These results indicate that employing high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis techniques offers a practical and controllable approach to modulate the crystal structure and thermoelectric performance of CoSbS.},

Here, we employ the simplified line-input crystal-encoding system representation combined with the MatterGPT framework for discovering potential piezoelectric semiconductors. By training on a curated dataset of 1556 piezoelectric materials from the Materials Project database, our model learns to generate crystal structures with targeted piezoelectric properties through an autoregressive sampling process. Starting from approximately 5000 generated structures, we implemented a comprehensive screening workflow incorporating structural validity, thermodynamic stability, and property verification. This approach identified several promising candidates from 4100 reconstructed structures, each representing compounds unrecorded in existing databases. Among these, the most notable material demonstrated a piezoelectric stress coefficient of 25.9 C / m 2 in the e[1,6] direction. Additionally, these materials demonstrate suitable bandgaps ranging from 1.63 to 3.61 eV, suggesting potential applications in high-sensitivity sensors and high-temperature electronics. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining crystal structure language encoding with generative models for accelerating the discovery of functional materials with targeted properties.},

The current technology is constrained by its reliance on complex control mechanisms and a narrow control scope, which collectively impede its practical deployment. In this Letter, we introduce an all-season smart film, a multilayer film composed of In 3 SbTe 2 (IST), CaF 2 , and ZnS on an Al substrate, which possesses the unique ability to synergistically modulate solar-thermal radiation. The solar absorptance and infrared emittance are ( a normal , ε normal ) = (0.829, 0.055) for the solar heating mode and (0.361, 0.835) for the radiative cooling mode, respectively. The underlying mechanism pertains to the Fabry–Pérot resonance and antireflection. The modulation property of the smart film remains excellent even when the incident angle is large. Furthermore, the smart film is capable of achieving multilevel modulation through the alteration of the crystalline IST percentage. The excellent modulation properties of the smart film are substantiated through a quantitative assessment of the net heat flux for terrestrial applications. This analysis reveals that the smart film with amorphous IST achieves a solar heating flux of 800 W/m 2 at 250 K, while for crystalline IST it exhibits a radiative cooling flux of 600 W/m 2 at 330 K. Such a simple multilayer structure can be easily fabricated, which would facilitate the advancement and practical implementation of an all-season smart film.},

  abstract     = {Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is widely employed as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells due to its low manufacturing cost and favorable energy-level alignment. However, the suboptimal quality of TiO 2 films and the presence of multiple defects at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, such as uncoordinated Pb 2+ and oxygen vacancy defects, significantly compromise both device efficiency and stability. This study proposes a synergistic passivation strategy through the introduction of an acetylamino-functionalized interlayer between the perovskite and TiO 2 . The acetylamino groups within the passivation layer establish strong interactions with uncoordinated Pb 2+ in the perovskite, thereby enhancing interface stability. Acetylamino groups can also interact with the TiO 2 layer by bonding with Ti 4+ and reducing oxygen vacancy defects, thereby enhancing the electron transport potential of the TiO 2 layer. The enhanced hydrophobicity of the TiO 2 film, induced by the passivation layer, further promotes perovskite crystallization by minimizing surface tension effects during film growth. Therefore, the device efficiency significantly increased from 16.49% to 19.26%. The lifetime of the unencapsulated device was evaluated under environmental conditions (relative humidity: 30% ± 5%, temperature: 25 ± 5 °C). The efficiency of the unmodified device decreased to 75.3% after 800 h, whereas the modified device maintained 90.1% of its initial efficiency, demonstrating higher stability.},

In this work, we demonstrate that the chemical activity of deposited species is crucial for determining the structure of the 3D/2D heterointerface. During pulsed laser deposition, the chemical activity of SrTiO 3 (STO) can be adjusted by controlling the oxygen partial pressure. Therefore, the relative contributions of chemical and vdW interactions at the STO/mica interface can be tuned.

At room temperature (RT), the MIS-HEMT fabricated with an atomic layer deposited (ALD)-Al 2 O 3 (MIS-HEMT B) exhibits higher maximum drain current ( I d,max ), peak transconductance ( g m,max ), and lower subthreshold slope ( SS ) and gate leakage current compared to MIS-HEMT A fabricated without ex situ Al 2 O 3 , signifying the effectiveness of the ALD-Al 2 O 3 layer to passivate severe surface states. Of note, when the temperature rises from 298 to 423 K, the values of I d,max and g m,max decrease noticeably, while SS and gate leakage current increase considerably in both MIS-HEMTs A and B. However, MIS-HEMT B demonstrates a lower degradation rate in various device properties at 423 K compared to MIS-HEMT A, implying that ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation improves thermal stability. Additionally, ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation reduces the interface state density from 7.48 × 10 12 to 5.3 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 , highlighting its critical role in improving overall device performance.},

While the LM facilitated the handling of the droplet, LM breaks down upon squeezing, which limits the robust handling. Here, we show that LM exhibits high compression stability when the jammed particles distort the liquid surface to form sub- to single-micron roughness. We find that the particle layers&#39; distortion increases with the evaporation of the inner liquid. Thus, we regulated the evaporation degree of the droplet by varying the mixing ratio of the nonvolatile and volatile liquids. First, we show the regulation of the mixing ratio and its effect on the equilibrium LM static shape and particle layer structure. Then, the effect of the LMs&#39; surface structure on their mechanical response is explored. When 90% of the inner liquid is evaporated, the submicrometer wrinkle structure appears on the LM surface. We name the LM with the wrinkle structure “wrinkled liquid marble (WLM).” The WLM exhibited high compression stability and significantly higher resilience force than the droplet one. We believe this work helps the practical use of the LMs by improving their mechanical stability.

  abstract     = {Optical two-way time and frequency transfer (O-TWTFT) is an enabling technology that has applications ranging from fundamental investigations of relativity to the operation of global navigation satellite systems. Linear-optical-sampling (LOS) between optical frequency combs has been used to create very stable optical two-way time and frequency transfer links over free-space. Here, we demonstrate two-way time and frequency transfer using LOS between electro-optic frequency combs. This two-way electro-optic time and frequency transfer system demonstrated instabilities as low as 15 fs at 1 s of averaging time. These results show a pathway to highly stable, frequency agile, and low SWaP-C time transfer networks.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a heterostructure integrating a two-dimensional nonlinear GaSe film on a silicon metasurface supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (BIC) mode, to enhance the nonlinear sum-frequency generation (SFG) process in the GaSe film, where incoming shortwave infrared (SWIR) photons are upconverted to visible photons. The wavelength selectivity in the silicon metasurface corresponding to different configurations enables the GaSe film/silicon tunable metasurface heterostructure to have a response in the range of 1500–1630 nm, covering the telecommunication C and L bands. The response spectrum is derived from the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance of the metasurface structure, and the pump light and signal light correspond to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances of the metasurface structure. The high quality-factor of the quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance brought by the metasurface greatly improves the density of the electromagnetic field near the GaSe film, thus improving the sum-frequency generation conversion efficiency in the GaSe film. The pump and signal corresponding to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances introduced by the silicon metasurface are designed in the telecommunication band, while the sum-frequency light is located in the range that can be directly detected by a silicon detector. The low noise level in a silicon detector can guarantee the high sensitivity detection of shortwave infrared light. The results indicate that the upconversion detector attained a peak detectivity of 1.4 × 10 12 Jones at 1555.1 nm, comparable to commercial broadband InGaAs detectors (Thorlabs).},

To date, quantum memories have been realized in many different systems. However, most of them have complex structures and high cost. Besides, it is not easy to simultaneously achieve both high storage efficiency and fidelity. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a low-cost optical quantum memory with high efficiency and high fidelity, by utilizing a butterfly-shaped cavity consisting of one polarization beam splitter, two reflecting mirrors, and one pockels cell crystal. In order to quantify the quality of the quantum memory, we carry out tomography measurements on the time-bin qubits encoded with weak coherent states after storage for N rounds. The storage efficiency per round can reach up to 95.0%, and the overall state fidelity can exceed 99.1%. It thus seems very promising for practical implementation in quantum communication and networks.},

  abstract     = {Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown tremendous promise due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and cost-efficient fabrication. However, the efficiency of traditional lead halide PSCs is approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit, prompting interest in tin-lead perovskite solar cells (Eg ≈ 1.25 eV) as a candidate for tandem configurations with the potential to surpass this limit. A key challenge lies in optimizing the hole transport layer (HTL), as widely used PEDOT:PSS suffers from high acidity and poor crystallinity, hindering device performance. In this work, we used a formic acid modification of PEDOT:PSS to enhance its conductivity, energy band alignment, and crystallinity. Acid treatment promotes proton transfer, reducing insulating PSS chains and improving phase separation, thereby facilitating efficient hole transport. Tin–lead perovskite films fabricated on formic acid-treated PEDOT:PSS (Fa-PEDOT:PSS) exhibit improved crystallinity, larger grain size, and reduced defect density. Devices incorporating Fa-PEDOT:PSS demonstrate enhanced photovoltaic performance, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.87% with reduced hysteresis and excellent stability, retaining ∼90% of initial efficiency after 1600 h in an inert atmosphere. These findings highlight the potential of acid-treated PEDOT:PSS as an optimized HTL for tin–lead PSCs, paving the way for high-efficiency, environmentally friendly photovoltaic technologies.},

However, a direct and highly sensitive method has not yet been established. Therefore, we proposed the activation imaging of AuNPs that radioactivates AuNPs and non-invasively visualizes them using the emitted gamma rays. When the stable isotope of gold, 197 Au ⁠ , is irradiated with low-energy neutrons, it changes to radioactive 198 Au ⁠ , which predominantly emits 412-keV gamma rays. In this study, we synthesized [ 198 Au ] AuNPs through neutron irradiation and intratumorally injected them into tumor-bearing mice. In vivo imaging was performed using wideband x rays and gamma rays imager, and the distribution of [ 198 Au ] AuNPs in the body of mice was observed. Furthermore, we labeled the alpha-emitting therapeutic drug 211 At with [ 198 Au ] AuNPs ⁠ . Although 211 At itself can be visualized using its 79-keV x rays, the long-term tracking of 211 At -labeled AuNPs has been challenging due to its relatively short half-life of 7.2 h. The activation of AuNPs enables the long-term tracking of 211 At -labeled AuNPs owing to the 2.7-day half-life of 198 Au ⁠ . 211 At -labeled [ 198 Au ] AuNPs were injected intravenously into mice and visualized using a wideband x rays and gamma rays imager. Simultaneous imaging of 211 At and 198 Au was performed on the day of injection and 2 days after injection.

It is revealed that the strengthened hydrogen bond favors proton transfer in the S 1 state, and due to enhanced non-resonant excitation and reduced energy exchange between the wave packet and external field during the falling period, the asymmetric pulses could increase the excited-state population, leading to improved excitation efficiency. Compared to traditional Gauss-type laser pulses, the optimization of STRT parameters (i.e., falling time, intensity, and wavelength) could bring more population in the excited state (&gt;80%) and promote subsequent proton transfer processes that are responsible for enhancing therapeutic effects during PDT. The present work offers valuable insights into the interactions between external fields and molecules, paving the way for optimized drug delivery systems with minimal damage to normal tissue and enhanced therapeutic efficacy.},

However, it is still unclear whether a nonmetallic filament conductive mechanism could exist in these thinnest memristors. Here, the resistive switching characteristics of h -BN atomristors with different electrodes are systematically investigated, it is found that the switching processes in these thinnest memory devices are primarily dominated by the interactions between electrode-atoms and defects in the dielectric layer, and the resistive switching mechanism in these atomic devices could be tuned by the kind of single-defect. Based on this, we propose a nonmetal filament conductive mechanism according to the nitrogen vacancy ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ) enhanced conductivity effect in a single layer h -BN.

  abstract     = {Laterally excited bulk acoustic wave resonator (XBAR) based on lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) substrates has been a hotspot and is widely believed to be a potential candidate for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, it is confronted with the spurious mode issue, which can cause in-band ripples in filters. To obtain a cleaner frequency spectrum response, we propose an XBAR with a wave-shaped interdigital transducer (IDT) to suppress spurious modes. It is revealed by using a finite element method model, and spurious modes are significantly eliminated in the passband due to the non-parallel boundary of IDTs. We then experimentally verify the theoretical analyses. The wave-shaped XBAR is fabricated based on a Z-cut LiNbO 3 thin film, showing a nearly spurious-free impedance response. Then a filter based on the wave-shaped XBAR is fabricated, with fewer in-band ripples, featuring a center frequency of 5.77 GHz and a 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 7.8%. This research demonstrates a potential solution for high-frequency and wideband filters based on LNOI platforms meeting 6G requirements.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a 710 GHz GaN Schottky barrier diode (SBD) with high breakdown voltage was proposed and fabricated. The high-frequency SBDs suffer from the trade-off between the frequency ( f c ) and breakdown voltage ( V br ). We solved this problem with the gradient doping technique, and the f c and V br were improved at the same time. For the proposed gradient doped GaN SBD, the doping concentration of the drift layer increases gradually from top to bottom. Then, the capacitance was reduced by the lightly doped surface region, while the series resistance was reduced by the heavily doped bottom region. As a result, f c was improved, and a high f c of 710 GHz was obtained. In addition, V br was also enhanced by the lightly doped surface region, and a high V br of 28 V was achieved. As a consequence, f c · V br of the proposed SBD is about 2 times that of the previous GaN SBDs, which is a great improvement. The gradient doping technology fully exploits the potential of GaN SBD in high frequency and high voltage, making GaN SBD a promising candidate for terahertz (THz) applications.},

This study proposes a PST based on bilayer indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) homojunctions with tunable gallium ratios. By optimizing the gallium content, oxygen vacancy concentrations in the channel were precisely controlled, suppressing deionization processes and enhancing device performance. The IGZO homojunction PST demonstrated outstanding electrical characteristics (I on /I off = 1.2 × 10 7 , μ = 3.88 cm 2 /Vs, V th = 0 V) and exhibited high photocurrent and robust persistent photoconductivity under visible light. The device mimicked various synaptic behaviors, including excitatory postsynaptic current, paired-pulse facilitation, the transition from short-term plasticity to long-term plasticity, spiking-rate-dependent plasticity, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, leveraging the potentiation and depression behaviors of the IGZO homojunction PST, a triple-layer neural network achieved 96.8% accuracy in pattern recognition tasks. These results underscore the IGZO homojunction PST&#39;s immense potential for advancing artificial vision systems.},

This study developed mechanically durable ultra-flexible transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) made of polyimide (PI)/silver nanowire (AgNW), which were integrated into all-PSCs. Tensile and bending tests showed that the PI/AgNW TCE displayed higher flexibility and stability than the commercial polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/indium tin oxide (ITO) with R 0 /R 30000 of 1.0, Young modulus of 176.7 MPa, and elongation at break of 12.8%.

An essential type of quantum interference with drastic destructive-constructive switching, known as Fano interference, has been widely reported in various kinds of nanoelectronics electronic systems, but not yet been electrostatically gating in a single-molecule device. Here, we fabricate the three-terminal single-molecule transistors based on the molecule with a long backbone and a side group to demonstrate the gate-controllable Fano interference. By applying bias and gate voltages, the two-dimensional differential conductance map shows the noncentrosymmetrical Fano patterns. Combined with the electron transport model and the first principles calculations, the resonant parameters of the Fano interference can unveil the coupling geometry of the junction and the spatial distribution of the resonant states. Our findings provide an instrumental method to induce and utilize the quantum interference behaviors at the molecular level.},

While it has been widely reported in chiral magnets, oxide heterostructures, and hybrid systems such as ferromagnet/heavy metal and ferromagnet/topological insulators, the study of non-collinear spin texture in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) monolayers is relatively lacking, hindering the understanding at the atomically thin scale. Here, we probe the temperature-dependent antisymmetric humps in Hall resistivity by utilizing the proximity coupling of Fe-doped monolayer WSe 2 (Fe:WSe 2 ) synthesized using chemical vapor deposition on a Pt Hall bar. Multiple characterization methods were employed to demonstrate that Fe atoms substitutionally replace W atoms, making a 2D vdW DMS at room temperature. Distinct from the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, we found the transverse Hall resistivity of Fe:WSe 2 displaying two additional antisymmetric peak features in the temperature-dependent measurements. These peaks are attributed to the magnetic features at the Fe:WSe 2 and Pt interface. Our work shows that a DMS synthesized from 2D vdW transition metal dichalcogenides is promising for realizing magnetic and spintronic applications.},

The simulation results exhibited good agreement with the observed voltage transient behavior and predictions from the nucleation-limited-switching model. Although the capacitor achieved a comparable polarization distribution after the relaxation process, the pathways to reach the static state differed for the different writing signals. Specifically, writing signals with higher amplitude result in more complex polarization domain structures just after the signal is turned off. Analysis of the relaxation process revealed that the dielectric component dominated the early stage, whereas domain-wall motion became more dominant in the later stage. These insights into the polarization relaxation dynamics will contribute to improvements in the operational speed and reliability of ferroelectric devices.},

Because a certain level of thermal budget is required to achieve ferroelectricity in 10 nm HZO thin films, the crystallization temperature can be lowered below 400 °C by simply increasing the annealing time. In addition, the analysis of the crystallization behavior of HZO thin films based on the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov model revealed that longer annealing times are required to lower the annealing temperature for HZO crystallization due to the limitation of the crystallization rate. Consequently, low-temperature (&lt;400 °C) ferroelectric HZO thin films with large remanent polarization along with improved leakage behavior and endurance were realized. These results not only facilitate the back-end-of-line integration of HZO thin films but also demonstrate the feasibility of in situ HZO crystallization by thermal budget for subsequent interconnect formation, simplifying the overall process and saving costs by eliminating a dedicated annealing process.},

In this work, we propose a feasible approach to achieve MPB and low leakage by the charge balance effect in the doped HfO 2 -ZrO 2 superlattice system. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the synergy effect of doping and oxygen vacancies can achieve lower phase transition barriers between polar and nonpolar phases, suggesting the formation of more MPB regions. Especially for Y dopant, it is more preferred due to the smallest transition barrier. Additionally, defect states arising from oxygen vacancies can be passivized at the charge balance state to enable large bandgap, suppressing leakage currents.

Ferrimagnets (FIM) composed of rare earth and transition metals show peculiar properties near the magnetic compensation point, including an exceptionally high SOT efficiency and a significantly enhanced DMI effective field. Here, we investigate FIM [Co/Gd] N multilayers with a magnetic compensation by varying the number of stacking layers ( N ). The net magnetization is dominated by Co and Gd at small and large N , respectively, with the magnetic compensation point located at N = 9. The DMI effective field, obtained by using a magnetic droplet model, increases substantially when the multilayer approaches its magnetic compensation. Correspondingly, we found the emergence of current-induced magnetization switching in the Gd-dominated region, among which the case of N = 10 was realized without an assistance field. We attribute such magnetization switching behavior to the symmetry breaking provided by DMI, together with its large value and the huge SOT associated with it near the magnetic compensation. Our work establishes the direct connection between the DMI and the field-free SOT switching in rare-earth/transition-metal FIM systems.},

  abstract     = {Crystal symmetry plays an important role in the Hall effects. Unconventional spin Hall effect (USHE), characterized by Dresselhaus and out-of-plane spins, has been observed in materials with low crystal symmetry. Recently, antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) was discovered in rutile RuO 2 and IrO 2 (101) thin films, which also exhibit low crystal symmetry. In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO 2 (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin-torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis supports the coexistence of USHE and APHE and demonstrates that both originate from the crystal symmetry of IrO 2 (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.},

Using the model, the achievable quantification accuracy at different noise levels has been systematically assessed. The assessment has revealed the chain noise effect in routine post-processing steps and provided essential experimental instructions to improve quantification precision and accuracy at given noise levels. The ineffectiveness of several denoising methods in improving accuracy and precision has also been verified.

Despite previous studies have explored the B3–B1 transition and phonon behavior in ZnS at room temperature, the effects of low temperature have yet to be experimentally verified. This has resulted in the absence of experimental data on the pressure–temperature ( P–T ) phase diagram at low temperatures. Here, we probe the pressure-induced B3–B1 phase transition and phonon evolution behavior of ZnS at low temperatures (90–300 K) using isothermal compression Raman spectroscopy. We experimentally determine the ZnS B3–B1 phase boundaries at low temperatures and obtain the corresponding Clapeyron slope, dP / dT = −16.4 ± 2.1 MPa/K. In addition, we found that the pressure coefficients ( ⁠ K i T ⁠ ) of all phonon modes of B3-ZnS decrease with decreasing temperature. This is mainly due to the reduction of anharmonic effects at low temperatures. Further, K i T of the multi-phonon coupling states are always larger than those of the single phonon state.},

  abstract     = {As an ultrawide bandgap semiconducting material, Ga 2 O 3 has attracted significant attention in providing a foundation for applications in optoelectronic and power devices. The structural incompatibility and/or lattice mismatch of the substrate poses a challenge in preparing vertical devices using Ga 2 O 3 . Additionally, the challenges Ga 2 O 3 faces in its epitaxy on a silicon substrate further hinder its integration with other silicon-based advanced electronics. This study demonstrated the use of Sr 3 Al 2 O 6 as a sacrificial layer to realize single-crystal freestanding ε-Ga 2 O 3 membranes with physical and performance characteristics comparable to those grown epitaxially on rigid substrates. Importantly, these membranes retained integrity after transfer. Observation of sharp diffraction peaks of ε-Ga 2 O 3 (00 l) orientation in x-ray diffraction indicates excellent single-crystalline characteristics and crystalline quality of ε-Ga 2 O 3 . High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed clear lattice structures belonging to the hexagonal crystal structure of ε-Ga 2 O 3 . The dark current of the photodetector made from freestanding ε-Ga 2 O 3 reaches 10 −12 A at 5 V, while the photocurrent under 100 μ W/cm 2 of 254 nm light illumination reaches 10 −9 A, with a responsivity of 81.16 mA/W, a detectivity of 2.36 × 10 12 Jones, and an external quantum efficiency of 39.67%. Its performance can be compared to or even better than photodetectors made using ε-Ga 2 O 3 directly grown rigid substrates. These results demonstrate that this approach overcomes challenges in fabricating ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based vertical devices and their integration with silicon, laying the groundwork for diverse applications with the next generation of semiconductors.},

In this study, we utilize density functional theory calculations coupled with particle swarm optimization to design a monolayer polymorph of SbP 3 that exhibits monoclinic Pc symmetry and good stability (M-SbP 3 ). M-SbP 3 demonstrates excellent phonon-limited electron mobility of 3525 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature, with an ultrahigh anisotropy ratio of 108, which is four times the previously reported maximum value. Additionally, its optical absorption anisotropy ratio, reaching up to 13.3, is greater than that of most known two-dimensional low-symmetry materials. Due to the high anisotropy of the Young&#39;s modulus, the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson ratios can achieve positive values of 1.29 and 1.91, as well as negative values of −0.43 and −0.88. Furthermore, our results reveal two opposite piezoelectric responses in M-SbP 3 , with significant in-plane piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.5 × 10 −10 and −86.6 × 10 −10 C/m, respectively. These responses are primarily influenced by the clamped-ion term and may be associated with the high anisotropy of the electronic structure. Moreover, the electrical auxetic effects are a natural consequence of the high anisotropic piezoelectric responses. The highly anisotropic optoelectronic, mechanical, and piezoelectric properties, along with the coexisting mechanical and electrical auxetic effects, make M-SbP 3 a promising component for multifunctional nanoelectronic devices.},

These two heterostructures exhibit valley-selective linear dichroism, which enables the optical creation of interlayer or intralayer excitons with selected valley and electric polarization. Furthermore, both the K 2 Br 2 /Sn 2 Te 2 /K 2 Br 2 and Sn 2 Te 2 /K 2 ClBr/Sn 2 Te 2 heterostructures are ferrovalley materials due to the ferroelectricity of Sn 2 Te 2 and the built-in electric field caused by Janus K 2 ClBr, respectively.

  abstract     = {Stacking of freestanding membranes enables the formation of interfaces beyond what can be obtained with classical heteroepitaxy. In particular, twisted interfaces provide unique physical properties not existent in the corresponding individual layers. An ideal twist grain boundary yields an in-plane screw-dislocation network, assuming sufficiently strong interactions across the interface, for example, via covalent or ionic bonding. Hereby, the distance between dislocation lines, that is the length scale of the Moiré pattern, is set by the twist angle between the adjacent crystalline surfaces and the lattice mismatch in case that different materials are placed together. The associated strain gradients of the periodic pattern are especially appealing for oxide-based perovskites due to the intricate connection between surface polarization and subtle structural deformations such as the oxygen octahedra tilt. Recently, freestanding oxide perovskites became available via the sacrificial layer approach, opening a pathway toward oxide-based Moiré materials. Here, we demonstrate efficient bonding of a freestanding SrTiO 3 layer to a SrTiO 3 single-crystal by initially conducting a wafer-bonding process at high temperature and only subsequently dissolving the sacrificial layer. We investigate the twisted SrTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface with x-ray diffraction in grazing incidence geometry and observe clear signatures of a highly periodic lateral superlattice consistent with the formation of a screw-dislocation network. Our work demonstrates a robust route for the fabrication of twisted perovskites and their development into a functional material platform with designed strain gradients at the nanoscale.},

Quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) can greatly localize the light field and enhance light–matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing a platform for high quality (Q) factors in chiral light devices. In this paper, we conduct a numerical investigation into the perfect chiral linear and nonlinear optical responses in the high-Q QBIC metasurfaces. The designed metasurface consists of silicon nanodisk tetrameric, and when one of these nanodisks is resized along a specific direction, symmetry breaking occurs within the structure. The high-Q QBICs of 1.13 × 10 4 can be excited by the right circularly polarized (RCP) light, while the response is weaker under the left circularly polarized (LCP) light. The observed circular dichroism (CD) value reaches 0.9988, indicating an almost perfect chiral optical resonance with a high Q-factor. Furthermore, we investigate the third and fifth harmonic generation of this device. Under RCP (LCP) light irradiation, their conversion efficiencies attain 2.99 × 10 − 2 ( ⁠ 7.98 × 10 − 4 ⁠ ) and 2.21 × 10 − 8 ( ⁠ 5.91 × 10 − 11 ⁠ ), and their corresponding harmonic CD values reach 0.948 and 0.994, respectively. Additionally, we calculate the conversion efficiency across different RCP power levels to further validate the generation of the third and fifth harmonics, as well as assess their CD values at varying powers, which show good stability.

The second type is a two-layer MM structure that consists of a dielectric FM thin plate bordering a dielectric nonmagnetic thin plate. The periodic lattice of the dielectrically insulated metal wires is embedded in both plates. The simulations of the PPWGs with both MM-filling types are made with a finite-difference time-domain Landau–Lifshits–Gilbert (LLG) electromagnetic solver MaxLLG, based on a joint solution of the Maxwell and LLG equations. It is shown that in both cases a bandwidth of the “extraordinary” slow forward EMW is wider by approximately an order of magnitude than a bandwidth of a similar wave existing in the PPWG completely filled with a single FM thin layer without wire inclusions.

  abstract     = {A reconfigurable asymmetrical broadband mid-infrared light filter utilizing a vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) triangular grating structure is designed by materials informatics. The design applies the unique phase-transition characteristics of VO 2 to facilitate asymmetrical light transmission, enhancing forward transmission via surface plasmon polaritons when VO 2 is metallic state at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, as VO 2 transitions to a dielectric state, no free electrons are available for excitation, resulting in a more symmetric transmission. The operational bandwidth or wavelength of the filter can be adjusted through geometric parameters of the triangular structures.},

  abstract     = {Polarization engineering can enable high-density two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of ferroelectric/non-polar κ -Ga 2 O 3 / β -Ga 2 O 3 hybrid polymorph structures, whereas the formation of a disordered intermediate layer has prevented the experimental observation of 2DEG, with phase transition being the primary obstacle. In this work, we investigate κ -Ga 2 O 3 epilayers of varying thickness grown on β -Ga 2 O 3 substrates to elucidate the strain-driven phase transition within the intermediate layer at the κ -Ga 2 O 3 / β -Ga 2 O 3 polymorph interface. Reciprocal space mapping and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal that a pseudomorphic wetting layer forms during the early growth, followed by the nucleation of mixed κ / β -phase islands. As the film thickens, strain drives further κ -to- β transitions and thickens the disordered intermediate β -phase layer. First-principles calculations confirm that the κ -to- β phase transition is triggered when the in-plane strain exceeds the threshold value of 2.7%. These findings provide critical insights into phase transitions in Ga 2 O 3 hybrid polymorph structures and suggest future strategies for enhancing interface quality, which is crucial for enabling a high-density 2DEG channel through polarization engineering toward the next generation of Ga 2 O 3 -based electronic devices.},

By introducing the technology of sympathetic cooling and measuring the doublet line transition exploitation of an optical comb system, the uncertainties are improved to 16 and 12 kHz, respectively, two orders of magnitude higher precision than the reported results from the linear transformation of isotope shifts. The magnetic dipole constants A P 3 / 2 of 111 Cd + and 113 Cd + are estimated to be 395 939 ( 8 ) and 411 275 ( 6 ) kHz ⁠ , respectively.

Electrical contacts were used as mechanical stressors to provide structural rigidity to hBN layers as well as enabling selective lift-off. These junctions exhibit a rectifying behavior with a rectification ratio of approximately 3 × 10 5 at 3 V. When junctions were forward biased, ultraviolet (UV) emission around 262 nm was measured. This emission corresponds to recombinations in the n-AlGaN layer, demonstrating good hole injection in the structure. Full light emitting diode (LED) structures were fabricated by integrating UV multi quantum wells (MQWs) into these junctions. Produced UV LEDs emit around 290 nm serving as a proof of concept for future layer transferred p-hBN/MQWs/n-AlGaN structures in which the Al content is increased to go toward deep ultraviolet (DUV) emission. The selective pick and place process used to build these LEDs has multiple advantages. First, it allows independent optimization of the p-side as well as of the n-side, which includes the quantum wells. Second, UV MQWs are protected from the high temperatures needed for high hBN material quality growth, and thus their thermal stability is not affected.},

Our approach involves developing a data-driven deep learning simulator that estimates the electromagnetic response. Specifically, the simulator predicts the electric field distribution at a given cross section of a plasmonic meta-atom based on its geometry. Since the simulator is differentiable, it enables the optimization of various powers of the electric field intensity by coupling it with a generator model and a suitable loss function. With respect to conventional methods that rely on trial and error for optimization and miss atoms intercoupling, our approach systematically considers the collective behavior of the metasurface and efficiently explores the design space. Furthermore, it is capable of capturing multiple local minima within these electrodynamic systems, with optimization results well beyond the training dataset. The generalization capability of the simulator and the behavior of the optimized geometries are validated against a finite element method numerical model.},

Therefore, the implementation of a low-damage pixelization technique is essential for enhancing the performance of micro-LEDs. In this Letter, ion implantation (IIP) was employed to improve the performance of InGaN green micro-LED arrays with a pixel size of around 6.5 μ m and a resolution of 25 × 25. The peak external quantum efficiency of the micro-LED array is enhanced to 6.2%, which is much higher than the 2.4% of that fabricated by conventional inductively coupled plasma etching. In addition, the transmission data rate of the IIP-pixelized micro-LED array is 2.7 times higher, increasing from 115.5 to 307.3 Mbps at an operating current density of about 100 A/cm 2 .

On the one hand, nonlinear geometric phase offers a platform to investigate the fundamental principles in light–matter interactions during the nonlinear optical processes. On the other hand, it can be applied to design nonlinear optical elements with versatile functionality, such as wavefront engineering, optical imaging, and optical holography. To give a comprehensive review of nonlinear geometric phase, here, we overview the fundamental mechanisms, including the symmetry selection rules, the origin of the geometric phase in harmonic generations, and the characteristics of nonlinear geometric phase. We summarize the related applications based on the concepts of nonlinear geometric phase and symmetry selection rules, mainly focusing on the recent progresses from nonlinear optical sources to nonlinear optical field manipulation and beyond.

However, in the conventional L-C-type matching circuits, resonator frequency tunability is limited by poor design flexibility of the shunt capacitance and hence the circuit. Recently, L-L-type matching circuits comprising a series and a shunt inductor have been proposed to address this issue. Here, we report RF reflectometry readout of silicon quantum dot-based charge sensors embedded in L-L-type circuits. We determine the inductance values for target resonance frequencies based on our equivalent circuit model that incorporates the parasitic elements of the inductors and demonstrate resonator frequency tunability of up to 1 GHz with 3-dB resonator bandwidths on the order of MHz. The measured conductance sensitivities, on the order of 10 −5 ( e 2 / h ) / Hz at 4 K, are only moderately dependent on the resonance frequency up to 630 MHz.

This study reports on the synthesis of Mo-doped Ni/NiO hetero-nanoparticles supported on oxygen-deficient NiMoO 4 (NiMoO X ), with tannic acid (TA) integrated as both a carbon source and stabilizing agent (Ni/NiO-Mo/C@NiMoO X ). In situ Raman spectroscopy elucidates the mechanism through which TA enhances the electrocatalytic activity. The resultant catalyst demonstrates superior HOR/HER performance, featuring a current density of 2.5 mA cm −2 at 100 mV overpotential for HOR, remaining stable for 24 h, and in HER, exhibiting a remarkably low overpotential of just −12 mV at a current density of −10 mA cm −2 , with stability persisting for over 300 h, outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst.},

A very high sensitivity of 0.58 mA/ng/ml with good linearity (Adj. R 2 = 0.99) was observed for the detection of S100B with a response time of less than 15 s. The platform offers a shelf life of four weeks with minute degradation of −3.08% and −4.66% in its stability and reactivity.

Current stones diagnosis commonly relies on on-spot urinalysis assisted with extra gold standard examinations, however, the required hospital testing is cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, we develop a homogeneous plasmon-enhanced Raman biosensor integrated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, namely LASSO-ANN-PERB, to sensitively assess spectroscopic variations of human urine samples for label-free and rapid stone screening. In a practical scenario loaded with low-volume Raman features of urine from healthy subjects and patients, the integrated biosensor realizes an excellent stones identification accuracy as well as can largely shorten the time consumption throughout the workflow. These practically demonstrated merits suggest the potential of integrated biosensor with the unique ability to enable noninvasive urine fluid biopsy for further development of rapid stones diagnostics, which may promisingly advance the existing clinical routine toward a convenient one.},

  abstract     = {Non-contact pulsed magnetic fields can enhance the permeability of biological cells, creating an innovative approach for delivering external substances through cell membranes. However, the mechanism by which pulsed magnetic fields cause cell permeabilization remains unclear, and experimental findings from different researchers often vary widely, sometimes even contradicting one another. To gain a deeper understanding of cell permeabilization caused by pulsed magnetic fields, this study uses a theoretical analytical approach. It begins with a qualitative analysis of how the induced electric field and radial stress generated by a time-varying magnetic field affect the free energy of pores from an energy perspective. Next, a numerical model is developed to quantitatively explore the dynamic changes in pores driven by the induced electric field and radial stress. The results demonstrate that, compared to the numerical model considering only the induced electric field, the model incorporating both the induced electric field and radial stress increases the predicted pore expansion capability by 161.8%. This enhancement allows for more accurate predictions of pore formation on the cell membrane under the influence of pulsed magnetic fields. This study incorporates radial stress into a pore-opening dynamics model under pulsed magnetic fields and develops an associated numerical model, thereby providing a foundation for elucidating the permeabilization mechanisms of pulsed magnetic fields.},

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) study showed that modification at moderate concentration (20 mM modification) increases the “I/Pb” ratio from 2.08 to 2.72. Angle-resolved XPS study is performed by varying the takeoff angle from 150° to 90°. OAI treatment increases the I/Pb ratio at each takeoff angle, showing the coordination of Pb (II) has been fully improved. Besides, the atomic ratio between N2 (from OAI) and Pb (from PVSK) decreases from 1.13 to 0.86 (20 mM modification), showing that OAI prefers to react with the surface layer of PVSK. Due to the improved coordination environment of Pb (II), the work function of PVSK increases by approximately 0.3 eV as revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy study, the built-in potential of perovskite solar cell (PSC) increases from 1.0 to 1.05 V. Accordingly, carrier extraction is accelerated, while carrier lifetime is prolonged, and the power conversion efficiency of PSCs is upgraded from 20.47% to 24.00%, with the fill factor rising from 77.32% to 82.79% and the open-circuit voltage from 1.11 to 1.16 V.

Reservoir computing, a bio-inspired computing paradigm, excels at processing temporal signals and offers advantages like low training costs and easy deployment on edge devices. Many applications have been developed for reservoir computing using physical devices. However, there has been a paucity of research using reservoir computing to simulate the human tactile system. Furthermore, the implementation of a reusable physical reservoir computing system is of significant importance. Herein, we implement a near-sensor physical reservoir computing system for haptic simulation, utilizing a simple peripheral circuit design. The reservoir&#39;s high-dimensional, nonlinear, and short-term memory requirements are physically realized by a memristor with an integrated lithium polymer electrolyte and polycrystalline tungsten oxide layer, which exhibits good cycle-to-cycle consistency. As a proof of concept, the system completes the learning and classification tasks for Braille numerals and characters, achieving a high recognition accuracy of up to 96% within 400 cycles. This approach offers innovative insights for developing human–machine interaction applications with enhanced intelligent perception capability.},

In this study, we develop n -type transparent CdO films on the polyimide (PI) substrate, which exhibit outstanding flexibility, maintaining 90% and 99% of their original electrical conductivity and transmittance after 500 bending cycles around a 11-mm diameter rod. The films also demonstrate a high power factor of ∼ 1.3 μ W cm −1 K −2 at room temperature. A thermoelectric prototype consisting of 8-leg of the CdO film generates a voltage of 15.2 mV and a maximum power density of 5.48 W m −2 at a temperature difference of 85 K.

However, the Dirac semi-metallic properties, such as chiral anomaly, are hard to be observed, probably due to the imperfections in the α -Sn samples. It is even more challenging to manipulate the topological properties in this metastable material without a sacrifice in the crystalline quality. Here, we report a strategy of Fermi level tuning by doping the α -Sn films grown on CdTe (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. The negative magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect, which are attributed to chiral anomaly, are observed in α -Sn when the Fermi level is tuned close to the bulk Dirac point. Detailed analyses of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations show nontrivial Berry phases for all the samples. Combined with first-principle calculations, these results provide a strong evidence of the three-dimensional Dirac semimetal phase in α -Sn. Furthermore, a clear transition from two-dimensional topological surface states to three-dimensional bulk Dirac cone is demonstrated in α -Sn by precise Fermi level tuning through doping. This study proves the 3D Dirac semimetal phase in α -Sn and provides an effective strategy to manipulate the topological properties for both fundamental studies and device applications.},

An approach of fabricating the engineered piezoelectric materials of laminated ceramic composites (LCCs) was proposed to break the bottleneck instead. Two or more piezoelectric ceramic layers are stacked in the order of alternatively opposite polarizations and are combined together by electrodes, which are connected as in the cases of bimorph or laminated multilayer ceramic capacitors. Experimentally, a compositional series of (1 − x )(K 0.48 Na 0.52 )(Nb 0.96 Sb 0.04 )O 3 – x (Bi 0.50 Na 0.50 )ZrO 3 (KNNS- x BNZ) ceramics and a textured 0.965(K 0.48 Na 0.52 ) 0.99 Li 0.01 (Nb 0.98 Sb 0.02 )O 3 -0.035(Bi 0.50 Na 0.50 )ZrO 3 (KNLNS-BNZ) ceramic were used to verify this approach. The four-layer LCC with thin ceramic plates of different KNNS- x BNZ compositions shows an averaged d 33 of 1230 pC/N, and temperature stability of d 33 changes within ±5% up to 120 °C. The three-layer LCC of KNLNS-BNZ textured ceramic exhibits d 33 of 1100 pC/N at room temperature with d 33 changes of less than 8.1% up to 190 °C.

However, its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study examines the influence of DC poling on pyroelectricity in Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 )O 3 films. Direct measurements of pyrocurrent hysteresis curves revealed asymmetries along both the voltage (horizontal) and pyrocurrent (vertical) axes that cannot be explained using conventional single-coefficient pyroelectric evaluations. The switchable and non-switchable contributions to the pyrocurrent were also investigated. Our results indicate that the switchable contribution is directly proportional to the remanent polarization, consistent with the behavior of ideal ferroelectrics. Conversely, the non-switchable pyrocurrent, which is of comparable magnitude, is enhanced by poling and exhibits dependence on the poling direction. This non-switchable contribution shares the same poling-time dependence as the internal bias field, suggesting its origin lies in electrets such as fixed dipoles or pinned domains. These findings underscore the value of directly evaluating pyrocurrent for both positive and negative voltage polarities and demonstrate the potential to enhance directional pyrocurrent in ferroelectric thin films through controlled poling.},

  abstract     = {Fe/GaAs is a prototype system of spin injection at room temperature. The interfacial strain and oriented bonds are both considered the origin of the Fe in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which remains decisive. Here, by the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and the vibrating sample magnetometer measurements, this study shows that in the Fe/Cr( t )/GaAs structure, the in-plane UMA of Fe originates from the chemical bonding between the Fe and the GaAs substrate by varying Cr thickness, t . The UMA drops as the Cr coverage increases, characterized by a decrease in the saturation field from 2400 to 57 Oe. The XMCD studies reveal that the Fe orbital moment, a signature of chemical bonds, decreases from 0.216 μ B at Cr = 0 ML to 0.138 μ B at Cr = 5 ML. The reduction of the Fe orbital moment and the UMA are qualitatively consistent, establishing a link between the UMA and the interfacial chemical bonds. The decreased UMA remains unchanged at t &gt; 5 ML, above which Fe and GaAs are fully separated by a continuous Cr layer. Our findings provide clear experimental evidence that the UMA in the Fe/GaAs system originates from the oriented interface bonds, clarifying the UMA origin in this prototype system.},

  abstract     = {Twisted spin waves (or twisted magnons, TMs) have significant potential in high-capacity communication due to their orbital angular momentum (OAM) degree of freedom. Consequently, manipulating the propagation of TMs has become an important topic in spintronics. Here, we theoretically study the band structures of TMs in ferromagnetic cylindrical magnonic crystals with periodically modulated anisotropy. We find that the TMs with arbitrary OAMs exhibit forbidden bands at the boundary of the Brillouin zone, though, in different frequency ranges. This unique feature offers a promising avenue for developing filters capable of blocking the propagation of TMs with specific OAMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of TM bandgaps, as their position and width can be easily adjusted by altering the magnitude of anisotropy or the period of the crystal structure. Full micromagnetic simulations are performed to verify the theoretical predictions, showing good agreement. Our work not only enhances our understanding of TM propagation characteristics but also paves the way for the design of advanced spintronic devices that harness the magnon OAM degree of freedom.},

  abstract     = {Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for spin–orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3 d ferromagnetic metals including spin–orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L1 0 -MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3 d ferromagnetic metals are on the order of 1000 ℏ/2 e (Ω cm) −1 at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01–0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L1 0 -MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10 000 ℏ/2 e (Ω cm) −1 , with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3 d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding of the spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Particles with high anisotropy in their magnetic properties and shape are of increasing interest for mechanobiology, where transducing a remotely applied magnetic field vector to a local mechanical response is crucial. An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available atomic force microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6 ± 0.6 × 10 −15 Nm torque while applying 373 ± 5 mT field at 12 ± 2° angle to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 μ m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a ≈1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles&#39; mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {Developing permanent magnets with fewer critical elements requires understanding hysteresis effects and coercivity through visualizing magnetization reversal. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of the geometry of nanoscale ferromagnetic inclusions in a paramagnetic/nonmagnetic matrix to understand the key factors that maximize the magnetic energy product of such nanocomposite systems. Specifically, we have considered a matrix of “3 μ m × 3 μ m × 40 nm” dimension, which is a sufficiently large volume, two-dimensional representation considering that the ferromagnetic inclusions&#39; thickness is less than 3.33% of the lateral dimensions simulated. Using this approach, which minimizes edge effects to approximate bulk-like magnetic behavior while remaining computationally tractable for simulation, we systematically studied the effect of the thickness of ferromagnetic strips, separation between the ferromagnetic strips due to the nonmagnetic matrix material, different saturation magnetization values, and the length of these ferromagnetic strips on magnetic coercivity and remanence by simulating the hysteresis loop plots for each geometry. Furthermore, we study the underlying micromagnetic mechanism for magnetic reversal to understand the factors that could help attain the maximum magnetic energy densities for ferromagnetic nanocomposite systems in a paramagnetic/nonmagnetic material matrix. In this study, we have used material parameters of an exemplary Alnico alloy system, a rare-earth-free, thermally stable nanocomposite, which could potentially replace high-strength NdFeB magnets in applications that do not require large energy products. However, we project the energy density ( BH ) max of materials with higher saturation magnetization to have an ideal theoretical limit of ( BH ) max ∼94 kJ/m 3 (∼12 MGOe), which is ∼(35%–40%) of the energy density of Rare-Earth Free Magnets. This energy density could be higher if exchange bias from antiferromagnets, defects, and pinning is included and could stimulate further experimental work on the fabrication and large-scale manufacturing of RE-free PMs with different nanocomposite systems.},

A silicon diaphragm measuring 1.5 × 1.5 mm 2 is coated with Pt (100-nm-thick) and FeGa (100-nm-thick) thin films. An alternating charge current passed through the FeGa/Pt/Si diaphragm under a magnetic field perpendicular to the charge current generates an alternating spin current via the spin Hall effect in the Pt film, transferring angular momentum from the Pt film to the FeGa film. The injected spin current provides energy and changes the effective temperature, thereby varying the thermal fluctuation of the magnetic moments. In a magnetic material with volume magnetostriction, the thermal fluctuation of the magnetic moments affects its volume. When the spin fluctuations change, the volume magnetostriction induces a corresponding expansion or contraction of the material. Both electrodeposited and ion-beam sputter-deposited FeGa films are investigated, and it is observed that the FeGa film exhibits SVE. The force generated by the SVE is evaluated based on the vibration amplitude at the fundamental resonant mode. This study demonstrates that the force generated by the SVE is correlated with the volume magnetostriction and the deposition process.},

This design enables both feedforward and backpropagation computations within a single device, extending neuromorphic computing frameworks previously explored in the literature by introducing the ability to perform backpropagation directly in hardware. Our algorithm implementation reveals two key findings: (i) the small discrepancies between the MTJ-generated curves and the exact software-generated curves have a negligible impact on the performance of the backpropagation algorithm, (ii) the device implementation is highly robust to inter-device variation and noise, and (iii) the proposed method effectively supports transfer learning and knowledge distillation. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the performance of an edge computing network using weights from a software-trained model implemented with our MTJ design. The results show a minimal loss of accuracy of only 0.4% for the Fashion MNIST dataset and 1.7% for the CIFAR-100 dataset compared to the original software implementation. These results highlight the potential of our MTJ design for compact, hardware-based neural networks in edge computing applications, particularly for transfer learning.},

This asymmetry introduces unique thermal modulation capabilities, taking control of thermal radiation in the near-field regime. VO 2 transitions from an insulating to a metallic state, while GST undergoes a reversible switch between amorphous and crystalline phases, each inducing substantial changes in thermal transport properties. By strategically combining these materials, the transistor exhibits enhanced functionality, dynamically switching between states of absorbing and releasing heat by tuning the temperature of gate. This gate terminal not only enables active and efficient thermal management but also provides effective opportunities for manipulating heat flow in radiative thermal circuits.

  abstract     = {This Letter introduces an innovative electrically tunable suspended acoustic waveguide utilizing aluminum scandium nitride thin film. This design allows for dynamic modulation of the phase of traveling acoustic waves through the application of a vertical electric field. With both simulation and experimental approaches, the study explores how the waveguide width and inherent dispersion properties influence phase modulation. Results indicate that broader waveguides demonstrate more significant phase lag, with phase shifts of 37.2°, 40.8°, and 44.7° for waveguide widths of 10, 20, and 30 μ m, respectively, measured in 200 μ m-long segments under a ±40 V DC bias at 1.05 GHz. The exceptionally low V π ·L of 6.44 V·cm underscores the system&#39;s ability to control phase efficiently with minimal power consumption. The exceptional properties of the waveguide make it a promising candidate for advanced acoustic signal processing, enabling precise phase control to enhance both device performance and energy efficiency.},

However, further improvements in the laser performance have been bottlenecked by the limited junction properties of GeSn through conventional epitaxy and wafer bonding. This work leverages semiconductor grafting to synthesize and characterize optically pumped ridge edge-emitting lasers with an AlGaAs nanomembrane transfer-printed onto an epitaxially grown GeSn substrate, interfaced by an ultrathin Al 2 O 3 layer. The uniform formation of this nanometer-thin ALD-Al 2 O 3 interlayer and structural integrity of the grafted heterojunction are confirmed in STEM. The grafted AlGaAs/GeSn DHS lasers show a lasing threshold of 11.06 mW at 77 K and a maximum lasing temperature of 130 K. These results highlight the potential of the grafting technique for enhancing charge carrier and optical field confinements, paving the way for room-temperature electrically injected GeSn lasers.},

  abstract     = {While the multiple electronic phase transitions in rare-earth perovskite nickelates ( Re NiO 3 ) open up a new paradigm in developing the next-generation logical devices and sensors catering for artificial intelligence, their respective contact strategy for making electronic devices largely relies on noble metal (e.g., Pt). Herein, we demonstrate the critical roles associated with the work function ( W ) of the contacting metal that is critical in the device application of Re NiO 3 based on both their conventional metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) and the recently discovered hydrogen-triggered Mottronic transition. Owing to the high valence Ni 3+ associated with Re NiO 3 that is rather oxidative and also results in bi-polar carriers from generating Ligand holes, we demonstrate that their low resistive contact is only achievable for using inert metal (e.g., the standard electrode potential beyond 0.4 V) with either high W (e.g., &gt;5 eV) or low W (e.g., &lt;4.7 eV). This sheds light on alternative contacting strategies for Re NiO 3 using the much cheaper Cu or Ag with low W that can also achieve abrupt resistive switch across MIT, in addition to the present noble metal with high W . Furthermore, the magnitude of W was also discovered to dominate the hydrogen-triggered Mottronic transition for Re NiO 3 via upward (or downward) bending the energy bands that promotes (or inhibits) the H + inward diffusion that switches the orbital configurations between the electron itinerant Ni 3+ and electron localized Ni 2+ . Clarifying these previously overlooked roles from the perspective of the metallic contacts further paves the way for the correlated electronic applications of Re NiO 3 .},

  abstract     = {An increasing magnetic field perpendicular to an undoped semiconductor surface at low temperature is known to strengthen the binding of localized electrons to stationary ions, as the wavefunction&#39;s tails evolve from exponential to Gaussian. It is also known that application of a high bias voltage to a depleted semiconductor can liberate bound charge and induce a large drop in electrical resistance. We connect these established results to experimental electrical transport measurements on off-state germanium Schottky-barrier metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFETs) with an aluminum oxide insulating dielectric and platinum germanide contacts. We make measurements at the three distinct orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the substrate and the current. At 6 K, we observe sharp attenuation of current by more than 2 orders of magnitude, within 60 mT, at a crossover magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate. A 1 T magnetic field attenuates the current by more than 4 orders of magnitude. The strength of the attenuation and the value of the crossover field are controlled by both the gate–source and drain–source voltages. The attenuation is much weaker when the magnetic field is parallel to the current. Finally, we orient the magnetic field parallel to the substrate, but perpendicular to the current, allowing us to distinguish charge hopping at the oxide interface from charge hopping in the bulk. This large off-state magnetoresistance can be exploited for cryogenic magnetic- and photo-detection, and for high-bias, low-leakage MOSFETs.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the GeO 2 thin film has attracted intense attention due to its ultrawide optical bandgap energy (&gt;4 eV), endowing it with quite a promising application for solar-blind photodetectors (SBPDs). Although many epitaxial growth strategies of GeO 2 thin films have been achieved, the design for the controllable GeO 2 SBPDs is still rarely reported, thus hampering its development as next-generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we deposited pure GeO 2 films with ultrawide bandgap energies of around 5.81 eV using the radio frequency magnetron sputtering method and fabricated back-gated three-terminal SBPDs based on GeO 2 /p-Si heterojunction structures. Subsequently, boosted optoelectronic characteristics at 213 nm, including a lower dark current of 93.52 pA, a higher photon-to-dark-currents ratio of 98.88, and a larger breakdown drain-source voltage (V DS ) over 30 V, are demonstrated due to the introduction of SiO 2 layer between the GeO 2 film and the Si substrate. More importantly, by applying the various voltages on the gate voltage (V GS ) of the GeO 2 /SiO 2 /p-Si three-terminal SBPDs, a significant change in the threshold V DS is achieved in the range from −21.91 to 8.16 V, demonstrating that the V GS can effectively regulate the turn-on V DS of the device. The obtained results can be instructive for the high-performance SBPDs based on GeO 2 films, and our findings will provide a promising approach for achieving high-performance GeO 2 -based SBPDs.},

Designing effective termination structures is a critical step in exploiting the advantages of β -Ga 2 O 3 power diodes. Among various types of termination structures, mesa technique features a simple preparation process and theoretically high efficiency electric field management capability in β -Ga 2 O 3 devices. In order to further reduce the peak electric field along the mesa sidewall and corner, the p-type NiO junction termination extension (JTE) structure was incorporated. However, deep level transient spectroscopy revealed a new shallow energy level at E c –0.28 eV related to interface states inducing by dry etching, which is the cause of the weakened JTE structure effect and instability of electrical properties. A low-temperature post-annealing process was proposed to eliminate the interface states, thereby achieving better charge balance and enhancing the breakdown voltage of compounded termination device from 1.35 to 2.1 kV without sacrificing the forward characteristics.

Our previous studies have identified rock salt-structured Zn 1−x Ni x O (∼0.27 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloys as promising wide bandgap oxides for achieving p-type doping. This is attributed to their high valence band maximum position, which favors the formation of native acceptors, such as nickel vacancies (V Ni ). However, the application of p-type O-rich Zn 1−x Ni x O 1+δ alloys in bipolar devices remains unexplored. In this study, we synthesized rock salt-structured p-type Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ thin films with a bandgap ∼4.4 eV using room-temperature magnetron sputtering in varying oxygen flow ratios (0%–30%). The structural and optoelectronic properties of films were characterized by x-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and variable-temperature Hall-effect measurements. We observed a significant increase in subgap absorption with higher oxygen flow ratios. Subsequently, p-Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ /n-ZnO heterojunction diodes were fabricated on ITO glass. These p–n diodes exhibited high rectification ratio up to ∼3.1 × 10 4 and an ideality factor of ∼3.1. The band diagram of the p–n heterojunction was simulated using SCAPS-1D. These findings underscore the potential of p-type ultrawide bandgap Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ semiconductors in bipolar device applications, demonstrating their promising performance for future optoelectronic and electronic technologies.},

When V ds = 0 V, the rectifier ratio increases to 4.6 × 10 3 , which is 50 times higher than that of symmetrical electrode homojunction. Under zero bias voltage, when the spot area is 3 × 10 −9 m 2 , the photosensitivity reaches 28 mA/W (637 nm), the response time is 38.83/40.17 μ s, and the infrared detection is extended to 1550 nm.

It can be primarily attributed to the LaCoO 3 QDs. In addition to appropriate Fermi level and high QY, the LaCoO 3 QDs with carrier inducing–injecting–driving can ameliorate the carrier dynamics for PCE-transparency balance, meanwhile increasing the hole by Cu vacancy.

  abstract     = {Precision detection and weak signal amplification are vital for applications in quantum sensing, optics, acoustics, and electronics, where narrow linewidths and high sensitivity are crucial. Traditional methods, relying on high-quality factor resonators or hybrid systems with external feedback, often struggle with complexity, environmental sensitivity, and integration challenges. Advances in non-Hermitian physics and parity-time (PT) symmetry, particularly exceptional points (EPs), offer unique opportunities by leveraging coalescing eigenstates for frequency splitting sensing. However, PT systems require precise gain-loss balance and multi-resonance-mode setups, while EP-based sensors amplify both signals and noise, limiting their robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a single-resonator system with intrinsic anti-PT symmetry, incorporating a dual-channel excitation mechanism that enables dynamic adjustment of loss and coupling for precise resonance control. This design achieves an 80% linewidth reduction and dramatically enhances peak signal and sensitivity by 24.4-fold and 125-fold, respectively, offering a compact, high-performance solution for the next-generation sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) in the mid-infrared region have been widely explored to enhance light–matter interactions for biochemical sensing. However, their steep dispersion bands often limit Q-factor stability under focused light. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a super QBIC within a flatband by introducing lateral geometric perturbations in a square lattice of etched holes in high-index Ge films, enabling strong coupling between energy bands. The super QBIC achieves a theoretical Q-factor two orders of magnitude higher than conventional QBICs, with nearly zero group velocity, and supports ultra-narrowband resonances with slow light effect. Experimentally, we report a robust Q-factor of ∼270 at a tilted angle, a full width at half maximum of ∼22 nm, and a field enhancement of ∼23 in accessible optical cavities. Vibrational strong coupling is achieved between the super QBIC mode and the C=O vibrational mode of polymethylmethacrylate molecules, with Rabi mode splitting and a Rabi energy of 24.2 cm −1 at zero detuning. Differential transmission spectra reveal a fivefold enhancement in molecular absorption due to strong field localization. These results demonstrate the potential of flatband metasurfaces for advancing surface-enhanced infrared absorption at the micrometer scale.},

Notably, the tetrafluorinated crystals, composed of fluorinated OH6FQ cations and trifluorinated anions, meet essential requirements for efficient THz wave generation, including large macroscopic optical nonlinearity, optimal facet orientation in as-grown crystals with mm-size, plate-like morphology, and relatively low THz absorption across both the entire-molecular phonon and anion-stretching vibration regions. These tetrafluorinated crystals exhibit over 20 times higher optical-to-THz amplitude conversion efficiency compared to inorganic ZnTe, with a broad bandwidth extending up to 16 THz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of tetrafluorinated ionic organic THz crystals, showing promising potential for diverse THz photonic and nonlinear optical applications.},

Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows an exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. This measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.},

We propose an all-dielectric multilayer film metasurface to create an optical resonator and its perfectly mirrored counterpart, inducing FP-BICs and validating the conclusions.

  abstract     = {Controlling and enhancing light–matter coupling at subwavelength scales is an essential requirement in the realm of meta-photonics. Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a standout platform for delivering high-quality (Q) factor resonances and near-field electromagnetic hotspots. However, in the terahertz (THz) domain, experimental validation of high-Q BICs resonances with strong robustness and advanced maneuverability in such all-dielectric photonic systems remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and feasible fabrication approach to unlock the full potential of BICs-inspired resonances within the array of silicon cross elliptical resonators. Our results suggest that the designed THz-MS can support two symmetry-protected BICs with a topological charge of ±1 and several accidental BICs with a topological charge of +1 simultaneously. By introducing small perturbations to the individual resonator, the original two symmetry-protected BICs transform into quasi-BICs that bow to the inverse-square law. Astoundingly, for larger symmetry breaking, two additional BICs can be observed in the asymmetric THz-MSs surpass typical inverse-square rule, hence presenting a supererogatory degree of freedom for tailoring BICs resonances on demand. We bear out theoretical findings by transmission experiments implemented on the fabricated samples. We observe experimentally ultrasharp dual quasi-BICs resonances with a highest measured Q factor of up to 371, a level of performance that was previously unattainable with all-dielectric THz-MS on a substrate. The results mark an important step toward enriching the family of BICs and promise exciting opportunities in the field of THz optoelectronic devices and metadevices.},

Among the different growth methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y 2 O 3 ) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz, or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y 2 O 3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er 3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.},

However, the bulky nature of Ga 2 O 3 limits its application in miniaturized, integrated and multifunctional devices, and polarization imaging based on Ga 2 O 3 photodetector has not yet been realized. Here, we report a convenient method to prepare 2D β-Ga 2 O 3 flakes via liquid-metal-assisted exfoliation. Benefiting from high crystallinity and polarization-sensitive absorption of prepared ultrathin β-Ga 2 O 3 flake in monoclinic structure, the β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetector exhibits an ultra-fast response speed (100/78 μ s for rise/decay time) and a prominent anisotropy ratio (∼2.8) of polarization photoresponse under 265 nm illumination. An unambiguous detection of linearly polarized light has also been realized by the double symmetry-breaking of twisted β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetectors. Moreover, a four-layer twistedly stacked detection system further enables a one-step and well-defined polarization imaging with high resolution (150 × 150 pixels) to acquire spatial polarization information. This work presents a novel strategy for preparing ultrathin 2D gallium oxides and demonstrates a promising route to realize well-defined solar-blind polarization imaging in a simple manner.},

Here, we demonstrate a significant shift of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in ferromagnetic films placed between two superconductor gating layers. Through deliberate modifications of the interface structure using various insertion layers, we have determined that the superconducting proximity effect has a minimal impact on the modulation of ferromagnetic resonance characteristics. Instead, our findings strongly support very recent theoretical predictions that emphasize the phenomenon of ultrastrong coupling between Kittel magnons and Cooper pairs arising from the superconducting magnetoelectric effect.

  abstract     = {Optogenetics with high temporal and spatial resolution hold great potentials to replace the traditional drug and electrical stimulation techniques, which calls for optical probing devices with low crosstalk and organic damages. Here, we report a fabrication method of optoelectrical probes for precise modulation of neurons. A linear array of flip-chipped green resonant-cavity μ LEDs (RCLED) with an emitting aperture of 50 μ m is integrated on Si platform as the stimulation source. Due to the top/bottom Bragg reflectors, the RCLEDs&#39; output light view-angle is narrowed to &lt;90°. The emission wavelength demonstrates remarkable stability under various injection current densities. Under the 50 A/cm 2 driving current density, the RCLEDs&#39; output optical density is 100 mW/mm 2 and maximum temperature rise is 0.5 °C, both of which exhibit great improvement compared with those of the optical probes on sapphire substrate. Using these green RCLED probes to stimulate Mac-mCherry photosensitive protein, the analgesia and inhibition effects for medium prefrontal cortex GABAergic neurons are verified. This work provides an effective approach to fabricate integrated microscale light sources for precise stimulation and modulation of neurons, which facilitate the study of complex neural functions.},

  abstract     = {As an effective method for thermal management technologies, doping or substitution has been extensively utilized to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of various materials. Intensive studies have been conducted about the phonon mechanism of isoelectronic alloying since the 1950s. Very recently, the specific role of aliovalent doping was elucidated in the half-Heusler NbFeSb system. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated the mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity through aliovalent doping by combining first-principles calculations and neutron diffraction studies for the case study of the TiCoSb half-Heusler system. The softening of the acoustic branches induced by aliovalent doping can effectively reduce the phonon group velocities. Moreover, the introduction of compensating defects, resulting from changes in the Fermi level, plays a vital role in decreasing the relaxation time of phonons, as demonstrated by the analysis of neutron powder diffraction. Due to these two factors, doping with adjacent elements results in a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (for instance, Ni doping at the Co site in the TiCoSb half-Heusler system), especially in the low-temperature range. Our findings provide valuable insight into the phonon scattering mechanism in aliovalent-doped materials and demonstrate the role of compensating defects in heat transport, which is applicable to other doped semiconductor systems.},

By integrating x-ray-guided wireless manipulation with UMRs, we aim to address challenges associated with precise and controlled blood clot intervention. The untethered nature and size of these robots enhance maneuverability and accessibility within complex vascular networks, potentially improving clot removal efficiency. We explore mechanical fragmentation, chemical lysis, and hybrid dissolution techniques that combine mechanical fragmentation with chemical lysis, highlighting their potential for targeted and efficient blood clot removal. Through experimental validation using an ex vivo endovascular thrombosis model within the iliac artery of a sheep, we demonstrate direct revascularization of a 13-mm-long, 1-day-old blood clot positioned inside the left common iliac artery. This was achieved by deploying a UMR into the abdominal aorta within 15 min. Additionally, both mechanical fragmentation and hybrid dissolution achieve a greater volume rate of change compared to no intervention (control) and chemical lysis alone. Mechanical fragmentation exhibits clot removal with a median of 0.87 mm 3 /min and a range of 2.81 mm 3 /min, while the hybrid approach demonstrates slower but more consistent clot removal, with a median of 0.45 mm 3 /min and a range of 0.23 mm 3 /min.},

  abstract     = {Phototransistors have great application prospects in automotive vehicle, smart home, healthcare, imaging, and display. However, so far, there has been no report of flexible phototransistors that simultaneously achieve both high mobility and detectivity. Additionally, phototransistors are conventionally relied on thick channel layers and previous thin channel layers based devices only show poor performance. Here, we report flexible phototransistors based on ultrathin niobium-doped indium oxide (InNbO, 5 nm)/indium tin oxide (ITO, 3 nm) channel layers, which possess high mobility (49.21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and high detectivity (3.02 × 10 14 Jones) simultaneously. Significantly, the devices offer a broad spectral responsivity (from violet to green emissions). We postulate that the high mobility can be ascribed to the diffusion of Sn atoms (from ITO) and conduction band offset (between InNbO and ITO), while the high detectivity originates from the low dark current. To illustrate the capabilities of flexible phototransistors, we demonstrate both a flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display pixel circuit and an imaging system. Our approach unlocks new possibilities to achieve flexible phototransistors with superior performance, which suggest a great potential in next-generation flexible, stretchable, bendable, and low-cost electronics.},

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a prominent branch of non-linear optics (NLO) heavily reliant on conventional bulk NLO crystals. However, the difficulty in downsizing these crystals imposes technical limitations on the future of miniaturized NLO devices. Tellurene emerges as a promising candidate to overcome these restrictions, excelling in electrical applications and believed to possess a giant second-order optical susceptibility comparable to conventional NLO crystals. In this study, a face-to-face substrate configuration is employed for the synthesis of ultrathin tellurene via PVD. Our findings reveal that tellurene&#39;s SHG performance surpasses that of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides by two orders of magnitude, with maximum efficiency when the flake thickness is between 16 and 20 nm under various wavelengths. High sensitivity to thickness variation encourages post-growth thinning through hydrogen plasma etching, enabling precise engineering of the flake thickness for optimal SHG. This establishes a foundation for controlled tellurene thickness, further broadening its potential in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {The band alignment (BA) between two materials is a fundamental property that governs the functionality and performance of electronic and electrochemical devices. However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of the bulk has made a deep understanding of the physics of BAs elusive. Building on the theory of the ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [Choe et al. , Phys. Rev. B 103 , 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, specifically explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt a neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way that maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to the CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be accurately described by the sum of localized point dipoles that exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, regardless of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation &lt; 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be easily applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.},

For the first time, we have successfully achieved significant regulation of ABMR through the application of gate voltage. Our quantified analysis reveals a profound link between the tunable anisotropy in Rashba spin splitting and the precise modulation of the Fermi level filling, highlighting its central role in governing gate-modulated ABMR.

Despite more than half a century of study, unraveling the underlying transport physics within this space has been nontrivial due to the complex electronic structure, disorder, and small bandgap within these alloys. Furthermore, as Peltier coolers, Bi 1− x Sb x alloys operate in a bipolar regime; as such, understanding the impact of minority carriers is critical for further improvements in device performance. This study unites first principles calculations with low-temperature experimental measurements to create a generalized model for transport within semiconducting Bi-Sb alloys. Our exploration reveals the interplay between the complex, degenerate valence band structure with the extremely light conduction bands. By building a hybrid computational/experimental model, an understanding of both the electron and hole relaxation times emerges both as a function of temperature and energy. Special quasi-random supercell calculations reveal that, despite significant atomic disorder, the electronic band structures within the alloy remains largely unaffected and electron–phonon scattering dominates. For charge carriers near the band edges, the relaxation times are thus extremely long, consistent with cyclotronic behavior appearing at low magnetic fields ( ⁠ ≪ 1 T). Modeling thermoelectric performance suggests that the valence band edge deformation potential is significantly weaker and highlights the potential for p -type compositions to meet or exceed the current n -type alloys.},

  abstract     = {As a wide bandgap semiconductor, diamond holds both excellent electrical and thermal properties, making it highly promising in the electrical industry. However, its hole mobility is relatively low and dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, which severely limits further applications. Herein, we proposed that the hole mobility can be efficiently enhanced via slight compressive shear strain along the [100] direction, while the improvement via shear strain along the [111] direction is marginal. This impressive distinction is attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix. The shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the band degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant suppression of interband electron–phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole mobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron scatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons. Remarkably, the in-plane hole mobility of diamond is increased by ∼ 800 % at 800 K with a 2% compressive shear strain along the [100] direction. The efficient shear strain strategy can be further extended to other semiconductors with face-centered cubic geometry.},

  abstract     = {This study utilized co-sputtering to fabricate Mo-doped VO 2 films and identified an optimal concentration exhibiting a lower phase transition temperature (T h = 55.8 °C) and a broader hysteresis window ( ⁠ Δ T = 13.6 °C). At the atomistic scale, it is demonstrated that Mo dopant-induced localized strain accelerates the phase transition, which leads to the relaxation of the tetragonal structure. Furthermore, the effects of Mo doping on the phase transition process and electrical properties are characterized at the nanoscale using conductive atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, and the potential application in selectors can be evaluated. The results indicated that Mo doping destabilizes the M1 phase by introducing a high density of electrons, thereby significantly reducing the electron–electron interactions as per the Mott model. Moreover, the device exhibited stable threshold and memristive properties at room temperature, quickly switching from high to low-resistance states at a threshold voltage of 2.37 V and maintaining stability over more than 1000 cycles with a selectivity &gt;10 2 . The present work not only highlights the role of Mo doping in enhancing the functional properties of VO 2 but also demonstrates its feasibility in high-performance selectors devices.},

  abstract     = {In response to the challenges posed by traditional computing architectures in handling big data and AI demands, neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising alternative inspired by the brain&#39;s efficiency. This study focuses on three-terminal synaptic transistors utilizing graphene and P(VDF-TrFE) to achieve dynamic reconfigurability between excitatory and inhibitory response modes, which are crucial for mimicking biological functions. The devices operate by applying different top gate spikes (±25 V and ±10 V) to modulate the polarization degree of P(VDF-TrFE), thereby regulating the carrier type and concentration in the graphene channel. This results in the effective realization of enhancement and inhibition processes in two neural-like states: excitatory and inhibitory modes, accompanied by good neural plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and spike-time-dependent plasticity. With these features, the synaptic devices achieve brain-like memory enhancement and human-like perception functions, exhibiting excellent stability, durability over 1000 cycles, and a long retention period exceeding 10 years. Additionally, the performance of the artificial neural network is evaluated for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 92.28%. Our study showcases the development of highly stable, dynamically reconfigurable artificial synaptic transistors capable of emulating complex neural functions, providing a foundation for emerging neuromorphic computing systems and AI technologies.},

Although these applications are dependent on the optical performance, the origin of the optical absorption in electrochromic oxides is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the electrochromism of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides can be described by a combination of polaron and bipolaron hopping. Based on the valences of the metallic constituents, we model experimental optical absorption spectra by polaron theory and assign two prominent absorption peaks to polaronic and bipolaronic charge transfer excitations. However, in the special case of V 2 O 5 , three peaks were necessary to fit the optical spectra. The activation energies of polaronic and bipolaronic hopping were remarkably similar for all the cathodic oxides studied. Within the framework of polaron absorption, V 2 O 5 would be categorized as a cathodic oxide, rather than as a mixed anodic/cathodic material as in the conventional picture. We emphasize that our findings here not only offer a profound understanding of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides but also pave the way for exploring electrochromic oxides with dual-band modulations.},

Furthermore, our observations and characterizations of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in the respective phases of the VO 2 film offer valuable insight into their electron structures.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials with multiple degrees of freedom, including spin, valleys, and orbitals, open up an exciting avenue for engineering multifunctional devices. Beyond spintronics, these degrees of freedom can lead to novel quantum effects such as valley-dependent Hall effects and orbital magnetism, which could revolutionize next-generation electronics. However, achieving independent control over valley polarization and orbital magnetism has been a challenge due to the need for large electric fields. A recent breakthrough involving pentalayer rhombohedral graphene has demonstrated the ability to individually manipulate anomalous Hall signals and orbital magnetic hysteresis, forming what is known as a valley-magnetic quartet. Here, we leverage the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity of pentalayer rhombohedral graphene to develop nonvolatile memory and in-memory computation applications. We propose an architecture for a dense, scalable, and selector-less nonvolatile memory array that harnesses the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity. In our designed array architecture, nondestructive read and write operations are conducted by sensing the valley state through two different pairs of terminals, allowing for independent optimization of read/write peripheral circuits. The power consumption of our PRG-based array is remarkably low, with only ∼6 nW required per write operation and ∼2.3 nW per read operation per cell. This consumption is orders of magnitude lower than that of the majority of state-of-the-art cryogenic memories. Additionally, we engineer in-memory computation by implementing majority logic operations within our proposed nonvolatile memory array without modifying the peripheral circuitry. Our framework presents a promising pathway toward achieving ultra-dense cryogenic memory and in-memory computation capabilities.},

Apart from overcoming issues of fluidic damping and electrical interfaces, there is a great challenge of bringing microanalytes to these devices with the required precision and scaling for high throughput sensing. Herein, we address the above challenges by proposing a self-excited localized acoustic manipulation methodology based on a piezoelectric micromechanical diaphragm resonator (PMDR). Such a PMDR integrates acoustofluidics and mass sensing functions in tandem on a single device. Particle enrichment is realized within tens of seconds and the limit of detection is enhanced by mitigating common issues such as low capture rate and non-uniform distribution. The developed PMDR is versatile in its applicability to a range of particle sizes and densities for both acoustofluidic actuation and in situ mass sensing. This work addresses long-term technical challenges of inaccurate and inefficient measurement of liquid phase resonance mass sensing with great application potentials in biochemical detection and environmental monitoring.},

The complexities of several metamaterial architectures are discussed.

Several types of acoustic metamaterials architectures, such as perforated and micro-perforated panels, acoustic foams, resonators, various geometrical paths, and piezoelectric patches, are also discussed. The fundamental acoustic mechanisms of these classes of metamaterials are identified and commented on. The paper also describes the main measurement techniques used for acoustic metamaterials and the physical quantities evaluated, providing a guide to characterize and assess their performance.

The efficiency of light-emitting materials has been improved significantly through the understanding of their emission mechanisms. However, the correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the operating voltage in OLEDs remains unclear, because OLEDs require a complex multilayer configuration that includes many materials other than the emitter. It is difficult to investigate the exact energy diagram for OLEDs, which have many interfaces, and many uncertainties remain regarding the mechanisms of charge injection and recombination. In this review, we introduce both the charge injection and recombination mechanisms in OLEDs and the interface control technology effective for lowering their operating voltage. We explain the electron injection mechanism at organic/cathode interfaces, which is clarified by using organic bases as the electron injection layers. The hole injection mechanism in OLEDs, which is clarified by investigating the correlation between the characteristics of OLEDs and the actual energy levels at organic/anode interfaces, is also introduced. With the elucidation of the charge injection mechanism, holes and electrons can now be injected into various organic materials. These charge injection techniques minimize the voltage required for charge recombination. The correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the minimum voltage required for OLED operation is clarified by controlling the energy levels at organic/organic interfaces. Understanding this correlation enables the design of molecules for ultralow-voltage OLEDs, thereby realizing blue OLEDs with an extremely low turn-on voltage of about 1.5 V.},

Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light–matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations—such as electrons, excitons, and photons—in low-dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Raman spectroscopy, which enables simultaneous detection of multi-gas components, is considered a valuable tool for gas analysis. However, the weak Raman scattering effect limits its application in the field of high-sensitivity gas detection. In this article, we summarize the principles and characteristics of existing techniques for improving the detection of Raman spectra, from both the perspectives of signal enhancement and noise suppression. Regarding signal enhancement techniques, the main methods include multi-pass cavity enhancement, resonant cavity enhancement, and hollow-core fiber enhancement. As for noise suppression methods, the primary approaches include spatial filtering, shifted excitation Raman difference spectroscopy, polarized Raman spectroscopy, and internal standard correction. Finally, we present and outlook on how to further enhance the sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy based on existing techniques, which can lay the foundation for the future development of robust and easy-to-use gas analysis instruments.},

  abstract     = {Smart biomaterials have significantly impacted human healthcare by advancing the development of medical devices designed to function within human tissue, mimicking the behavior of natural tissues. While the intelligence of biomaterials has evolved from inert to active over the past few decades, smart biomaterials take this a step further by making their surfaces or bulk respond based on interactions with surrounding tissues, imparting outcomes similar to natural tissue functions. This interaction with the surrounding tissue helps in creating stimuli-responsive biomaterials, which can be useful in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, autonomous drug delivery, orthopedics, and much more. Traditionally, material engineering focused on refining the static properties of biomaterials to accommodate them within the body without evoking an immune response, which was a major obstacle to their unrestricted operation. This review highlights and explains various engineering approaches currently under research for developing stimuli-responsive biomaterials that tune their outcomes based on responses to bodily factors like temperature, pH, and ion concentration or external factors like magnetism, light, and conductivity. Applications in soft and hard tissue engineering, 4D printing, and scaffold design are also discussed. The advanced application of microfluidics, like organ-on-a-chip models, extensively benefits from the intrinsic smart properties of biomaterials, which are also discussed below. The review further elaborates on how smart biomaterial engineering could revolutionize biosensor applications, thereby improving patient care quality. We delineate the limitations and key challenges associated with biomaterials, providing insights into the path forward and outlining future directions for developing next-generation biomaterials that will facilitate clinical translation.},

Recent advancements in both direct and indirect 3D bioprinting offer promising solutions to construct complex vascular networks by allowing precise control over cell and extracellular matrix placement. The process from shape printing of microvasculature to function formation involves dynamic shift of bioink mechanical properties, mechanical microenvironments, and mechanobiology of endothelial and supporting cells. This review explores how biomechanical and mechanobiological principles are integrated into the bioprinting process to develop functional microvascular networks. Before printing, a top-level design approach based on these principles focuses on the interactions among biomaterials, cell behaviors, and mechanical environments to guide microvascular network fabrication. During printing, biomechanical design of bioinks for different bioprinting techniques, along with optimized biomechanical factors of bioprinting process, ensures accurate microvascular structure reproduction while maintaining cell viability. After printing, the emphasis is on creating a suitable mechanical environment to modulate the mechanobiology of multiple steps of neovascularization, including initiation, morphogenesis, lumen formation, stabilization, and maturation of functional microvasculature. Finally, we discuss future developments based on biomechanical and mechanobiological design to drive the bioprinting of functionalized microvascular networks.},

  abstract     = {The advent of artificial intelligence—deep neural networks (DNNs) in particular—has transformed traditional research methods across many disciplines. DNNs are data driven systems that use large quantities of data to learn patterns that are fundamental to a process. In the realm of artificial electromagnetic materials (AEMs), a common goal is to discover the connection between the AEM&#39;s geometry and material properties to predict the resulting scattered electromagnetic fields. To achieve this goal, DNNs usually utilize computational electromagnetic simulations to act as ground truth data for the training process, and numerous successful results have been shown. Although DNNs have many demonstrated successes, they are limited by their requirement for large quantities of data and their lack of interpretability. The latter results because DNNs are black-box models, and therefore, it is unknown how or why they work. A promising approach which may help to mitigate the aforementioned limitations is to use physics to guide the development and operation of DNNs. Indeed, this physics-informed learning (PHIL) approach has seen rapid development in the last few years with some success in addressing limitations of conventional DNNs. We overview the field of PHIL and discuss the benefits of incorporating knowledge into the deep learning process and introduce a taxonomy that enables us to categorize various types of approaches. We also summarize deep learning principles which are critical to PHIL understanding and the Appendix covers some of the physics of AEMs. A few specific PHIL works are highlighted and serve as examples of various approaches. Finally, we provide an outlook detailing where the field is currently and what we can expect in the future.},

Na 1+ x Zr 2 Si x P 3− x O 12 (NaSICON) SEs have recently regained attention for applications in both solid-state and aqueous redox flow batteries due to their improved electrochemical and mechanical properties, along with their inherent electrochemical stability, air robustness, and low manufacturing cost. Recent improvements in NaSICON have primarily targeted macroscopic property enhancements and synthesis techniques. To enable further breakthroughs in the performance of NaSICON SEs, future efforts should focus on understanding how modified synthesis conditions influence atomic and microscopic-scale features, such as conduction channels, electronic structures, phase distributions, and grain boundaries. These features ultimately control ion conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability of NaSICON and its interfaces. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure-chemistry-property relationships of NaSICON SEs, focusing on atomic and microscopic levels. First, we introduce the proposed ionic conduction mechanisms in NaSICON crystallites. Then, we explore experimental investigations at phase and grain boundaries to assess ionic conduction and interfacial stability. We also examine strategies to address interfacial challenges such as high resistance and chemical reactions between SEs and electrodes, highlighting the difficulties in analyzing interfaces at the nano/atomic scale.

  abstract     = {Nuclear energy emerges as a promising and environmentally friendly solution to counter the escalating levels of greenhouse gases resulting from excessive fossil fuel usage. Essential to harnessing this energy are nuclear batteries, devices designed to generate electric power by capturing the energy emitted during nuclear decay, including α or β particles and γ radiation. The allure of nuclear batteries lies in their potential for extended lifespan, high energy density, and adaptability in harsh environments where refueling or battery replacement may not be feasible. In this review, we narrow our focus to nuclear batteries utilizing non-thermal converters such as α- or β-voltaics, as well as those employing scintillation intermediates. Recent advancements in state-of-the-art direct radiation detectors and scintillators based on metal perovskite halides (MPHs) and chalcogenides (MCs) are compared to traditional detectors based on silicon and III-V materials, and scintillators based on inorganic lanthanide crystals. Notable achievements in MPH and MC detectors and scintillators, such as nano-Gy sensitivity, 100 photons/keV light yield, and radiation hardness, are highlighted. Additionally, limitations including energy conversion efficiency, power density, and shelf-life due to radiation damage in detectors and scintillators are discussed. Leveraging novel MPH and MC materials has the potential to propel nuclear batteries from their current size and power limitations to miniaturization, heightened efficiency, and increased power density. Furthermore, exploring niche applications for nuclear batteries beyond wireless sensors, low-power electronics, oil well monitoring, and medical fields presents enticing opportunities for future research and development.},

These perturbations locally disturb the entire symmetry of crystals, resulting in symmetry breaking. Oxides, in particular, exhibit intriguing properties when subjected to defects, which can lead to significant modifications in their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Such defects in non-magnetic oxides can induce magnetic symmetry breaking, leading to the formation of emergent magnetic domains and orderings.

The advantages and disadvantages of various bottom-up and top-down methods explored to realize the nanostructures and the wet (solution-processable) and dry printing and assembly methods to print the nanostructures on flexible substrates, are discussed along with their suitability for various applications. This discussion is supported by a comparative analysis of printed PDs in terms of key performance metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, I Light /I Dark ratio, response speed, and external quantum efficiency.

  abstract     = {Quantum states of light, such as fixed photon number (Fock) states, entangled states, and squeezed states, offer important advantages with respect to classical states of light, such as coherent states and thermal states, in different areas: they enable secure communication and distribution of encryption keys, enable realization of sensors with higher sensitivity and resolution, and are considered candidates for quantum computing and simulation applications. To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing. As a result, nonlinear metamaterials were recently used to directly shape the spatial and spectral correlations of quantum light that is generated in SPDC. The paper covers the theoretical background and the design and fabrication methods of bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generating quantum light, as well as a series of demonstrations of the use of metamaterials in quantum optical applications.},

  abstract     = {Graphene has been one of the most investigated materials in the last decade. Its unique optoelectronic properties have indeed raised it to an ideal and revolutionary candidate for the development of entirely novel technologies across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from the microwaves to the x-rays, even crossing domain of intense application relevance, as terahertz (THz) frequencies. Owing to its exceptionally high tensile strength, electrical conductivity, transparency, ultra-fast carrier dynamics, nonlinear optical response to intense fields, electrical tunability, and ease of integration with semiconductor materials, graphene is a key disruptor for the engineering of generation, manipulation, and detection technologies with ad hoc properties, conceived from scratch. In this review, we elucidate the fundamental properties of graphene, with an emphasis on its transport, electronic, ultrafast and nonlinear interactions, and explore its enormous technological potential of integration with a diverse array of material platforms. We start with a concise introduction to graphene physics, followed by the most remarkable technological developments of graphene-based photodetectors, modulators, and sources in the 1–10 THz frequency range. As such, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for a broad audience, ranging from novices to experts, who are keen to explore graphene physics for conceiving and realizing microscale and nanoscale devices and systems in the far infrared. This would allow addressing the present challenging application needs in quantum science, wireless communications, ultrafast science, plasmonics, and nanophotonics.},

Consequently, various strategies aimed at enhancing sensing performance have emerged, with the introduction of morphological structures into the active layer being the most effective. In light of this, capacitive tactile sensors based on morphological structure designs have gained favor among researchers, gradually forming a “hundred schools of thought contend” trend. Nevertheless, the processes and applicability of morphological structures have yet to form a complete system, and the development and intelligence of morphological-engineering-based capacitive tactile sensors have reached a bottleneck stage, requiring a comprehensive and systematic review to provide inspiration for breakthroughs. This review delves deeply into the impact of various morphological structure designs on device performance and provides a comprehensive overview of the applicability, advantages, and disadvantages of morphological structure fabrication technologies derived from these structures.

Theoretical modeling methodologies, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), efficiently assess electrochemical reaction mechanisms and electrocatalyst performance at atomic and molecular levels. However, its intrinsic algorithm limitations and high computational costs for large-scale systems generate gaps between experimental observations and calculation simulation, restricting the accuracy and efficiency of electrocatalyst design. Combining machine learning (ML) is a promising strategy to accelerate the development of electrocatalysts.

The ML-based methods also accelerate the solution of MD and DFT. Moreover, integrating ML and experiment characterization techniques represents a cutting-edge approach to providing insights into the structural, electronic, and chemical changes under working conditions.

So, to realize these devices, an extensive study, from fundamental physics to practical applications, becomes essential. In this article, we present an exhaustive review of the advancements in understanding the fundamental physics behind magnetic skyrmions and the novel data storage and computing technologies based on them. We begin with an in-depth discussion of fundamental concepts such as topological protection, stability, statics, and dynamics essential for understanding skyrmions, henceforth the foundation of skyrmion technologies. For the realization of CMOS-compatible skyrmion functional devices, the writing and reading of the skyrmions are crucial. We discuss the developments in different writing schemes such as STT, SOT, and VCMA. The reading of skyrmions is predominantly achieved via two mechanisms: the magnetoresistive tunnel junction TMR effect and topological resistivity. So, a thorough investigation into the skyrmion Hall effect, topological properties, and emergent fields is also provided, concluding the discussion on skyrmion reading developments. Based on the writing and reading schemes, we discuss the applications of the skyrmions in conventional logic, unconventional logic, memory applications, and neuromorphic computing, including a model of a skyrmion-based SNN architecture achieving over 90% accuracy on MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets. Furthermore, we outline the potential of skyrmion-hosting Majorana zero modes in emerging topological quantum computation and helicity-dependent skyrmion qubits.},

Among these materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely investigated in CO 2 reduction and water splitting to produce chemical fuels. However, pure LDHs suffer from sluggish charge-carrier transport, a great electron–hole recombination rate as well as tend to cause agglomeration. Due to the aforementioned bottlenecks, numerous modification techniques have been considerably explored to enhance the potential of LDHs toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction. Therefore, this article presents a thorough review of developments made for the construction and modification of LDH photocatalyst properties aiming to enhance water splitting and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The review starts with the techniques adopted to synthesize LDH-based structures toward enhanced structure and morphology. The key semiconducting, optical, and electronic properties are studied to understand the conduct of LDH materials toward excellent photocatalytic material. The study then deliberates the techniques such as morphological engineering, hybridization with conducting and semiconducting materials, vacancy creation and defect engineering, components tuning, photothermal catalysis, heterojunction, and heterostructural engineering employed for the enrichment of photocatalytic properties. The study also discusses the steps taken to enhance the adsorption of LDHs and coupling of computational and operando techniques toward semiconducting, structural, and optical properties to investigate the best-performing photocatalysts. The study also reviews the recent advancements of LDH for applications toward water splitting and CO 2 conversion.},

Conventional analytical methods often fall short in comprehensive EV molecular profiling, necessitating innovative approaches for enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. This review focuses on the utilization of nanoplasmonic structures for optical signal detection of EVs, exploring advancements, challenges, and future prospects toward single EV molecular profiling. Nanoplasmonic structures offer enhanced optical readout capabilities, leveraging light iridescence, and plasmonic amplification suitable for the size range and complexity of the EVs. We delve into the research and implications of on-chip methods, shedding light on EVs&#39; role in health and disease. Despite notable progress, opportunities still exist to further develop nanoplasmonic arrays, customizing them for bioanalytes of interest, crucial for both label-free and labeled techniques to attain the objectives of their EV profiling. One such example is the use of specific antibodies for surface functionalization in nanoplasmonic arrays. Other approaches involve tailoring the design of platforms to the physical properties of target EVs, thereby enhancing characterization capabilities. The subsequent sections will cover a curated selection of relevant studies. We later discuss EV analysis through plasmonic nanoarrays in clinical sample scenarios. While patterning methods, such as colloidal self-assembly and e-beam lithography, enable integration with microfluidic systems, facilitating future investigations, few technologies have entered clinical trials. This roadblock highlights the need for further development of cost-effective, detailed molecular profiling methods. Moreover, we discuss avenues like single EV profiling and machine learning to address challenges related to heterogeneity of EVs as liquid biopsy biomarkers. Finally, we discuss future opportunities in developing nanoplasmonic-assisted EV profiling and studied their driving advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic realms, such as customizable nanoplasmonic structures coupled with artificial intelligence analysis modules, as a path forward for precise EV molecular profiling, which may enable personalized therapeutic interventions.},

Among the various piezoelectric materials, ferroelectric relaxor-PbTiO 3 (PT) single crystals have been used extensively as piezoelectric constituents because of their ultrahigh piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Furthermore, the domain structure and crystal orientation of the relaxor-PT single crystals exhibit extraordinarily large piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Owing to these multifunctional properties, relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites have been widely used for studying direct and converse ME couplings in ME composites in recent years. Relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites show excellent ME coupling, e.g., the highest ME voltage coefficient, equivalent magnetic noise, and output power of 7000 V cm − 1 Oe − 1 @ 23.23 kHz, 6 pT/√Hz @1 Hz, and 19 mW @ 60 Hz, respectively, which are one of the best-reported values in ME composites so far. Considering the vast research on relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites, we present a detailed review of the recent progress, challenges, and perspectives of ME composites and ME devices based on relaxor-PT single crystals.},

  abstract     = {Developing reliable and efficient single-photon sources is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, relying on nonlinear frequency conversion or spontaneous emission from individual quantum emitters. While different types of single-photon sources excel in specific applications, none meet all criteria for an “ideal” source: exceptional brightness, high purity, and indistinguishability. To address this challenge, coupling single-photon emitters with designer nanostructures can significantly enhance emission performance, a pivotal area in quantum nanophotonics. This review summarizes recent advancements over the past decade in generating and manipulating single photons, emphasizing the pivotal role of nanostructure coupling. Single-photon emission systems—such as nonlinear crystals, solid-state defects, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and two-dimensional materials—are categorized quantitatively based on their ability to achieve high purity, indistinguishability, and brightness, presented in a three-dimensional technology map. Furthermore, nanostructure engineering is showcased for manipulating properties such as emission direction, polarization, chirality, and entanglement of single photons. By elucidating these critical aspects, this review aims to advance understanding of how advancements in nanostructured environments promise to shape the future of single-photon generation and manipulation within quantum nanophotonics.},

  abstract     = {Phase transitions are fundamental phenomena in physics that have been extensively studied owing to their applications across diverse industrial sectors, including energy, power, healthcare, and the environment. An example of such applications in the energy sector is thermal energy storage using phase change materials. In such systems, and indeed in many other thermal systems, an emerging and promising approach involves the use of nanoparticles, which have been extensively studied for their potential to enhance the performance of thermal systems. However, conducting thermodynamic analyses of thermal systems in the presence of nanoparticles proves to be complex and resource-consuming because of the involvement of many parameters, including (i) temperature, molecular structure, and composition of the host fluid in which nanoparticles are either dispersed or in physical contact; (ii) nanoparticle morphology, size, type, and concentration; and (iii) complex interactions between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. This article reviews recent studies on the role of nanoparticles in phase transition processes such as freezing, melting, boiling, evaporation, and condensation. It begins with an overview of phase transition phenomena without nanoparticles, emphasizing the most important controlling parameters, and then examines the underlying physics of nanoparticle-involved phase transitions, critically examining their impact on process speed (transport rates). The article also explores physical phenomena, such as Brownian motion, thermophoresis, microconvection, and nanoparticle agglomeration, and considers their contribution to rate control (enhancement or reduction). Finally, the article presents challenges, research gaps, and suggestions for future exploration, aimed at offering a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between the presence of nanoparticles and the phase transition processes.},

  abstract     = {Droplet microfluidics has emerged as highly relevant technology in diverse fields such as nanomaterials synthesis, photonics, drug delivery, regenerative medicine, food science, cosmetics, and agriculture. While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying droplet generation in microchannels and in fabricating devices to produce droplets with varied functionality and high throughput, challenges persist along two important directions. On one side, the generalization of numerical results obtained by computational fluid dynamics would be important to deepen the comprehension of complex physical phenomena in droplet microfluidics, as well as the capability of predicting the device behavior. Conversely, truly three-dimensional architectures would enhance microfluidic platforms in terms of tailoring and enhancing droplet and flow properties. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing (AM) promise unequaled opportunities for simulating fluid behavior, precisely tracking individual droplets, and exploring innovative device designs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in applying AI and AM to droplet microfluidics. The basic physical properties of multiphase flows and mechanisms for droplet production are discussed, and the current fabrication methods of related devices are introduced, together with their applications. Delving into the use of AI and AM technologies in droplet microfluidics, topics covered include AI-assisted simulations of droplet behavior, real-time tracking of droplets within microfluidic systems, and AM-fabrication of three-dimensional systems. The synergistic combination of AI and AM is expected to deepen the understanding of complex fluid dynamics and active matter behavior, expediting the transition toward fully digital microfluidic systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrokinetic energy harvesting (EKEH) has emerged as a promising renewable and carbon-neutral energy source for small and large-scale applications, reducing the reliance on conventional fossil fuels and providing innovative solutions for remote, off-grid applications. The underlying mechanism of EKEH relies on the movement of dissolved electrolytes over charged fluid–solid interfaces through confinements resulting in the generation of useful power. The low energy conversion efficiency typically observed in larger (micrometer) confinements can be substantially mitigated by shifting to nanometer and sub-nanometer regimes. This down-scaling unlocks high selectivity and provides unique opportunities to potentially harness Angstrom-scale interactions to maintain and elevate fluid permeability. However, EKEH at sub-nanometric scales remains fraught with considerable challenges in fabrication, economic viability, scaling of power, and maintenance, significantly impeding its advancement. In this review, we detail the electrokinetic processes that drive energy conversion in the presence of pressure, concentration, and temperature gradients. We examine the key factors affecting conversion efficiency and explore the innovative solutions in the recent literature addressing associated challenges. Additionally, we highlight the role of novel nanomaterials and specialized geometries along with new fabrication techniques that enable high permeation without sacrificing selectivity in nanometer and sub-nanometer confinements. Finally, we delve into the major obstacles that EKEH currently faces to reach its full potential of extracting clean and affordable energy and conclude by offering insight into future developmental directions and potential breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.},

Normally, it has been utilized for its insulation properties, for example, in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. However, it also can be considered as a wide bandgap semiconductor possessing very large electrical resistivity. The conductivity of various silica films has been studied since the mid-nineteenth century, usually assuming the presence of ionic conductivity. However, in the sense of a wide bandgap semiconductor, the temperature dependence of the resistivity, which ranges over more than four orders of magnitude, can be accurately explained by normal semiconductor behavior under the presumed presence of a deep electron trap/donor residing ∼2.3 eV below the conduction band edge. That is, the conductance is determined by electron motion and not by ions. Experiments have studied the transport of injected electrons (and holes) which are consistent with this viewpoint.},

In recent years, there has been a surge in research on polarization-sensitive photodetectors that utilize anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials. The essence of these 2D polarization-sensitive photodetectors is rooted in the anisotropic characteristics that arise from the asymmetric crystal lattice of the 2D materials in question. This anisotropy is manifested in both optical and electrical behaviors due to the asymmetrical nature of the crystal structure. This article systematically categorizes anisotropic 2D materials and offers an insightful overview of their crystal structures. It also introduces various optical and electrical characterization techniques designed to elucidate the anisotropic properties of these materials. The focus of the article then shifts to detailing the current state of research in the realm of anisotropic 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors. It provides a comprehensive description of the working principles behind polarization-sensitive photodetectors with different structural designs, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that enable their polarization sensitivity. In conclusion, the article summarizes the findings of this review, highlighting the advancements and challenges in the field.

  abstract = {Mnemonic networks are cyclic catalytic networks of monomeric enzymes that exhibit kinetic cooperativity as departures of the mean velocity from the hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten-like response. In addition, such networks admit a hysteretic response when conformational fluctuations are slow compared to the catalytic rate. Here, we show how these fluctuation-driven effects emerge from the underlying stochasticity in the network. We use the chemical master equation to study the stochastic kinetics of mnemonic networks, which, in their minimal form, include a pair of conformers and triangular reaction pathways. We introduce statistical measures that are conditional on the turnovers to comprehensively analyze molecular fluctuations in the transient and stationary states of these networks. In the transient state, temporal correlations between enzyme turnovers lead to an inequivalence between number and temporal fluctuations, yielding a hysteretic response of the mean velocity to substrates. The transient relaxes to a stationary state with independent and identically distributed turnovers and equality between number and temporal fluctuations. This state is a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) when the Kolmogorov loop criterion is not satisfied, leading to the emergence of kinetic cooperativity. The symmetry of the number correlation functions allows us to distinguish between the absence of cooperativity in equilibrium and the accidental vanishing of cooperativity in a NESS. We conclude that memory and hysteresis are transient effects while kinetic cooperativity emerges as the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic irreversibility of the NESS in a network with cyclic reaction pathways.},

  abstract = {We used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical response of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by applying various forces. We used the helical rise and helical twist, as well as a newly defined helical diameter, to characterize the stretching and twisting of dsRNA. The results indicate that dsRNA unwinds when stretched, accompanied by a linear increase in helical rise and helical diameter. Then, we utilized the normal modes, which are linear combinations of helical modes, to elucidate the underlying mechanism of dsRNA unwinding from an energetic perspective. On the other hand, we employed a stiffness matrix based on a rigid base pair model to examine the base-pair dependence of twist elasticity for dsRNA, as well as stretch elasticities with respect to the helical rise and helical diameter. The results show that the force induces variations in the local elasticities and their couplings of dsRNA, which are closely related to the distributions of base pairs. The mean stretch and twist elasticities can be considered as constants within the measurement uncertainties; however, their couplings demonstrate a slight linear dependency on applied force.},

  abstract = {Dimerization and subsequent aggregation of polymers and biopolymers often occur under nonequilibrium conditions. When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed, or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here, we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory, where the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d 0 . Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization, and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d 0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, d c , the polymer collapse precedes dimerization , and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competitions, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration R G ( t ) of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a center-to-center of mass distance parameter R MM , and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q ( t ) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking the contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using the dynamical disorder model.},

  abstract = {Buoyancy-driven convection currents arise from temperature gradients in thermal frontal polymerization (FP) when the spatially localized polymerization reaction travels perpendicularly to the gravity field. We propose a theoretical study of the system dynamics under adiabatic conditions. The polymer and the reactant mixture are considered to be in the same liquid phase, but the viscosity can increase with the degree of polymerization. We find that the reaction zone propagates as a hot spot-like pattern with a broken symmetry in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Furthermore, the system can reach an asymptotic dynamics characterized by a front with a steady shape that propagates at constant speed with a steady vortex surrounding it. As the strength of the vortex is increased, either by decreasing the reactants’ viscosity or by increasing the layer’s thickness, we observe a transition between (i) a passive regime predicted by pure reaction–diffusion and hydrodynamic models and (ii) an active chemo-hydrodynamic regime where such models separately break down. In the active regime (ii), the front speed decreases as convection intensifies. By means of a scaling analysis, we explain how hydrodynamic currents might lower the velocity of a polymerization wave. As the viscosity of the polymer is enlarged, the flow is shifted ahead of the reaction zone and becomes more symmetrical with respect to the middle of the system, as recently observed in solid–liquid FP experiments [Y.

An extensive study has been performed to analyze the possible conformations that the polymeric strand can adopt in its crystalline form, leading to 60 initial crystalline structures. Due to thermal motion, which cannot be easily tackled with the ab initio methodology, and small inaccuracies, which are intrinsic to this calculation method, the theoretical unit cell dimensions can slightly differ from those obtained in the crystallization experiments. Thus, a structural refinement method has been employed to overcome these discrepancies and procure a crystalline structure whose x-ray diffraction pattern is consistent with the experimental one. For the proposed crystalline structure of PBF, both the powder diffraction pattern and the fiber diffraction diagram show a remarkable agreement with those available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.},

  abstract = {Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors have garnered significant attention due to their high power and energy densities, as well as the abundance of sodium reserves. However, the mismatch between anode and cathode dynamics is the biggest barrier to improving their performance. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for the preparation of porous MXene by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-controlled etching to solve the capacity degradation and ion diffusion limitation, which are caused by van der Waals forces between MXene nanosheets. This approach facilitates the realization of three-dimensional ion channels with both vertical and horizontal pathways, significantly enhancing the availability of active sites and improving the ion diffusion rate. By adjusting the amount of oxidant, porous MXene (P-MXene-2) with an optimal pore size range was obtained. The assembled half-cell has a capacity of 180 mAh g −1 at a rate of 0.05 A g −1 . Furthermore, by combining a porous carbon cathode with porous MXene and electrolyte screening, a SIHC with a high energy density of 110.6 Wh kg −1 at 1000 W kg −1 and 71.1 Wh kg −1 at 20 kW kg −1 was successfully constructed. This study provides useful insights into the design and preparation of porous MXene electrodes and their energy storage applications.},

The key gas-sensing characteristics concerning chemiresistive (CR) and field-effect transistor (FET) gas sensing have been thoroughly explored. The results show that Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N can work as either CR or FET gas-sensing materials for detecting H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 O, whereas B-C 2 N can work as a disposable gas sensor for O 2 , H 2 O, and NH 3 . Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N are the most selective toward O 2 and NH 3 , followed by CO and H 2 O in an oxygen- and ammonia-free environment, while B-C 2 N is the most selective toward H 2 O and NH 3 . More importantly, the adsorption strength of target molecule plays a critical role in gas-sensing mechanism as well as selectivity, recovery time, and sensitivity. This study offers theoretical perspectives on 2D hybrid carbon-based nanomaterials for efficient gas sensing.},

Highly polarized spin probes were produced in situ by the addition of muonium to the aromatic anions, and the muon and methylene proton hyperfine coupling constants (hfccs) of these radical anions were determined from the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonance fields in the ALC- μ SR spectra. The motionally averaged dipolar muon hfccs, | D μ ‖ | ⁠ , were determined from the width and amplitude of the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonances and used to estimate the extent of reorientational motion. The results are consistent with the counterions being electrostatically trapped near the oil/water interface of the surfactant bilayer and undergoing large amplitude anisotropic motion. This motion is generally more restricted in DODMAC bilayers compared with DHTAC, which is likely related to the relative flexibility of the headgroups to which the counterions are loosely bound. The motion of the ortho isomers is generally more restricted than the para isomers, while there is no obvious trend regarding the ethyl, chloro, and hydroxy substituents.},

  abstract = {Radical scavenging reaction rate constants were measured by monitoring the free induction decay (FID) of the unpaired electron of radicals by using laser-synchronized pulsed-EPR. This method probes large electron spin magnetization arisen from dynamic electron spin polarization (DEP), which remarkably enhances the EPR signal. DEP decays with the longitudinal spin relaxation time, which was observed by using the FID detection method. In the presence of a radical scavenger, the DEP decay time depends on both spin-lattice relaxation and the chemical reaction with the scavenger, the latter of which reduces radical concentration. The plots of DEP decay rates against the radical scavenger concentrations gave the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for various radicals. This procedure was applied to determine the radical scavenging reaction rate constants of hydroxycyclohexyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, diphenylphosphinoyl, and α,α-dimethoxybenzyl radicals. The measured rate constants show good agreement with the previously reported values determined by using another method monitoring electron spin echo (ESE) decays of the radicals. We discussed the advantageous and disadvantageous characters of the FID detection method with respect to the existing ESE method in the viewpoints of signal intensity, selectivity of radicals, the simpleness of the measurements, and so on.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we investigate the thermal conductivity ( κ ) of different core–shell nanowires using molecular dynamics simulation and Green–Kubo (EMD), imposing a temperature gradient (NEMD) and Müller-Plathe (rNEMD) approaches. We show that in GaAs@InAs nanowires, the interface effect becomes more significant than the nanowire cross-sectional geometry. In particular, κ decreases as the interface area increases, reaching a minimum, and then increases when the interface strain relaxes. This is particularly important for thermoelectric applications, where minimization of κ is desired. In particular, the different methods can predict minima at different core diameters without special considerations. In addition, the NEMD approach and, to a lesser extent, rNEMD tend to overestimate the κ values, which cannot be corrected with the methods available in the literature. By analyzing the temperature and length dependence, (I) we show that interfacial scattering primarily involves phonon–phonon interactions, which mainly affect low-energy modes, a mechanism that effectively reduces κ at low temperatures. (II) The Langevin thermostat tends to pump low-energy modes in the NEMD approach, but this effect decreases with longer nanowires. (III) Energy exchanges in rNEMD stimulate high-energy phonons, derived from the saturation of κ at a much shorter nanowire length than NEMD. These findings highlight the challenges of accurately determining κ of ultrathin core–shell nanowires, where only the EMD approach provides precise results. With the recognition of non-equilibrium contributions to the overestimation of κ by NEMD and rNEMD, these methods can still provide valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying thermal transport mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We investigate fundamental aspects concerning selectivity in hydrogenation reactions for Solid Catalyst with Ionic Liquid Layer (SCILL)-type systems. Some of us recently reported that the adsorption behavior of 1,3-butadiene and 1-butene on Pt(111) can be tuned with ultrathin layers of the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 1 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]): Increasing the IL coverage leads to increased blocking of olefin adsorption sites. Notably, a smaller IL amount is needed to prevent 1-butene adsorption as compared to 1,3-butadiene adsorption, leading to a selectivity window, in which 1,3-butadiene still can be adsorbed while 1-butene cannot. With the aim to evaluate whether this is a general behavior, we study an IL with a longer alkyl chain at the cation, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]), and an IL with a different anion, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 8 C 1 Im][PF 6 ]). Indeed, we observe a selectivity window for all ILs and thus demonstrate that this concept also applies for other ILs with different chain lengths and anions. Nevertheless, there are pronounced differences for the three ILs in terms of the IL coverages required for full blocking and the width of the selectivity window. Different explanations are discussed, e.g., the structure of the IL layer and the interaction strengths of olefins and ILs with the substrate.},

  abstract = {Aluminum (Al) is a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low volume expansibility. However, scalable fabrication of nanostructured Al still faces a great challenge. In addition, the lithium storage performance of Al anode materials always encounters a severe strike within a dozen discharge/charge cycles, and such an abnormal behavior of the Al anode material remains enigmatic. Herein, a mechanochemistry method without using any solvent is developed to achieve scalable production of Al nanoparticles and the morphology of the obtained Al nanoparticles could be regulated using Ketjen black (KB). KB with a chain-like structure could regulate the Al crystal growth process and the aggregation of Al nanoparticles during the solid-phase reaction, shortening the electron transfer path among Al crystals, ultimately activating the lithium storage behavior of nanostructured Al. Initial discharge/charge capacities of 630.6 and 402.0 mA h g −1 were achieved at 50 mA g −1 ; unfortunately, the nanostructured Al still suffered from rapid deterioration of lithium storage performance. Comprehensive analysis demonstrated that the raised energy barrier of LiAl formation and the slow lithium diffusion kinetics in the Al matrix may be the main factors destroying the lithium storage performance of the Al anode material. This work provided more evidence for illustrating the lithium storage behavior of the Al anode.},

  abstract = {Quantifying thermodynamics, structural, and dynamical properties of brine confined in clay pores is critical for a variety of geo-energy applications, including underground hydrogen storage (UHS) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are applied here to study aqueous NaCl brines within 10-Å kaolinite slit pores. NaCl concentrations are chosen at 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt. %, all below the solubility limit and high enough to provide statistically relevant information. The distribution of the ions within the nanopores is found not to be homogeneous. Explicitly, Na + cations, preferentially attracted to the siloxane surface, accumulate in regions with low water density, whereas Cl − anions, attracted to the gibbsite surface of kaolinite, are found within the hydration layers. Confinement affects the properties of ions, with ion pairing being more pronounced within the pore than in bulk aqueous solutions at similar temperatures, pressures, and compositions. Conversely, the ions affect the properties of confined water. For example, the lifetime of water–water hydrogen bonds in confinement is shortened within the hydration shells; increasing salinity from 5 to 12.5 wt. % reduces the likelihood of water density fluctuations near the kaolinite surfaces, although when the NaCl concentration rises from 12.5 to 15 wt. %, Cl − anions enhance the likelihood of density fluctuations for the hydration layer near the gibbsite surface. The simulated molecular trajectories are studied further to extract diffusion coefficients. While confinement in the kaolinite nanopore reduces the mobility of all species, non-monotonic trends are observed as a function of salt concentration. The trends seem associated with the likelihood of ion pairing. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients for the cations are predicted to be higher than those for the anions, which is contrary to what is typically observed in bulk brines. Because density fluctuations are correlated with properties such as the solubility of gases in confined water, our observations may have important implications for geo-energy applications such as UHS and CCS.},

The traditional Boltzmann transport equation method is highly accurate but limited by the low-order phonon scattering model, which makes it difficult to resolve the high-order scattering effects of low symmetry layered materials. The classical molecular dynamics calculation is efficient but lacks accuracy due to the missing multi-component potential function. In this study, we develop a strategy to predict the thermal conductivity of K 0.8 Li 0.27 Ti 1.73 O 4 (KLTO), a model of layered oxides by machine-learning using a deep neural network model to acquire the interatomic potential of KLTO. The deep learning potential (DLP) is in excellent agreement with density functional theory in predicting atomic force, energy, and elastic properties. In addition, the calculated out-of-plane thermal conductivity values based on the DLP (0.37 W m −1 K −1 ) are close to experimental results (0.28 W m −1 K −1 ). This machine-learning framework for constructing interatomic potentials can be extended to other layered materials, offering a promising approach for advancing the theoretical study of such systems.},

  abstract = {Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) is a toxic chemical that poses significant risks to human health and the environment; therefore, its level must be accurately monitored. Herein, the adsorption of CNCl by transition metal-doped fluorinated diamanes (F-diamanes) has been extensively studied via first-principles calculations. Key parameters such as adsorption energies, charge transfer amounts, bandgaps, sensitivity, densities of states, projected density of states, charge density differences, and recovery time were systematically analyzed. Results reveal that monometallic doping significantly enhances CNCl adsorption, with increases in adsorption energy by 164%–368% and charge transfer by 1234%–1571%, particularly in the AuFD-CNCl, AgFD-CNCl, and CuFD-CNCl systems, which demonstrated improved sensing performances. Similarly, bimetallic co-doping further strengthened adsorption, with energy enhancements of 277%–309% and charge transfer increases of 1238%–1505%. Au-CuFD-CNCl, Au-AgFD-CNCl, and Cu-AgFD-CNCl systems also showed superior sensing performances. Meanwhile, the recovery time of CNCl molecules on the AuFD, AgFD, Au-CuFD, and Au-AgFD surfaces was drastically reduced to acceptable levels at 279–412 K, leading to their desorption. Therefore, these four systems exhibited excellent reversibility properties, suggesting their applicability in gas-sensing applications. This work can facilitate the applications of doped F-diamanes in environmental conservation, energy storage, and chemical engineering.},

  abstract = {In this study, a solution system of KCl–NH 4 Cl–NH 3 –H 2 O with different mass fractions was prepared at room temperature using x-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. From x-ray scattering, it was obtained that the peak near Q = 2.50 Å −1 in the F ( Q ) function changed from a flat-topped blunt peak to a bimodal peak as the concentration of ammonia increased. This change indicated that increased ammonia altered the hydrogen bonding network within the mixed solution. In the G ( r ) function, the peak near 3.25 Å enhances with the increase in ammonia concentration, suggesting a higher occurrence of N(NH 4 + )–N(NH 3 ) interactions. Raman spectroscopy findings demonstrated that in the KCl–NH 4 Cl aqueous mixture, the area of DDAA-type hydrogen bonds increased as KCl concentration decreased and NH 4 Cl concentration increased. This suggests that KCl disrupts DDAA-type hydrogen bonds more significantly than NH 4 Cl. The situation was reversed when ammonia was added to the system, implying that KCl damages the DDAA-type hydrogen bonding structure less than NH 4 Cl when NH 3 is present in the solution. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the coordination number of K–Cl increases with ammonia concentration, as ammonia’s lone pair of electrons can bind to NH 4 + to stabilize the [NH 4 (H 2 O) m−n (NH 3 ) n ] + complex. This study elucidates the underlying microscopic mechanisms behind the decrease in KCl solubility and the increase in NH 4 Cl solubility upon increased ammonia.},

  abstract = {Two main frameworks are commonly used to describe electrolyte solutions: the non-primitive model, which rigorously accounts for all interactions between ions and solvent molecules; and the primitive model, which treats the solvent as a dielectric continuum, only describing ion–ion interactions explicitly. The primitive model offers simple Helmholtz energy expressions, including the Debye–Hückel (DH) equation, the primitive mean spherical approximation (MSA), and the Born theory of solvation. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of primitive model approaches by comparing their Helmholtz energies with data from molecular simulations obtained for non-primitive model electrolyte solutions. We model electrolyte solutions as mixtures of equally sized, charged, and (non-polarizable) dipolar Lennard-Jones particles. Using thermodynamic integration, we isolate the Helmholtz energy contributions related to solvent–solvent, ion–solvent, and ion–ion interactions. Molecular simulations are performed across two temperatures and two densities, a range of charges, dipole moments, and ion mole fractions (0.005 ≤ x ions ≤ 0.05). Our results show that while the primitive model expressions provide a qualitatively reasonable description of electrolyte solutions, they systematically underestimate the Helmholtz energy contributions associated with ion–solvent and ion–ion interactions. Achieving quantitative agreement requires empirical adjustments to the Born radius. Notably, the optimized Born radii are significantly larger than the actual ion sizes used in the molecular simulations, questioning the primitive model’s applicability. This work presents rigorous benchmarks for the use of MSA, DH, and Born theories, along with molecular simulation data for non-primitive model electrolytes. These benchmarks provide insights for refining existing models and advancing the development of new equations of state for electrolyte solutions.},

To advance the understanding of their melt processing and glass forming ability, we report the atomic structure of molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 over 1770–2630 K, which spans the equilibrium and supercooled liquid regimes. The melt density at T m = 2283 K is 5.50 g cm −3 , measured via silhouette imaging of electrostatically levitated drops over 1010–2420 K. Four separate structure measurements were made with aerodynamically levitated melts using x-ray and neutron diffraction with isotope substitution of Yb ( 172 Yb, 174 Yb, or nat Yb). Empirical potential structure refinement models were developed, which are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Coordination environments for Al–O are predominantly 4- and 5-coordinate, with a mean coordination of n AlO = 4.43(8), while Yb–O environments mostly range from 5- to 8-coordinate, with n YbO = 6.26(8). The cation–oxygen polyhedra are connected primarily by corner-sharing, with edge-sharing constituting up to ∼1/3 of the connectivity among polyhedra with Yb or higher-coordinated Al–O. Structurally, the –Al–O– network in molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 appears conducive to glass formation: n OAl = 1.85(3), there are 1.86 AlO x –AlO x connections per Al atom (e.g., a mixture of Q 3 and Q 4 units), and the modal ring size is six cations. These characterize a network that is somewhat less constrained compared to SiO 2 glass, yet Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 cannot be quenched into crystal-free glass. Aluminum garnet compositions with larger rare earth cations do form glass, so these characterizations help reveal the structural characteristics corresponding to the limit of glass forming ability in rare earth aluminates.},

  abstract = {The ultrafast excited-state dynamics of the E and Z isomers of a push–pull nitroazobenzene containing an octupolar bis(4′-tert-butylbiphenyl-4-yl)aminophenyl electron donor group were studied with transient absorption (TA) and TA anisotropy. A comprehensive study with two excitation wavelengths and a broadband white-light continuum probe (400–1400 nm) has determined that a torsional isomerization mechanism is the most probable for both isomers. This has shed light on the excited state behavior of the elusive push–pull Z isomer, which has its properties mostly predicted by simulations and systematically lacks experimental observations. Meanwhile, another unproductive relaxation pathway, associated with a symmetric bending motion, was found only for the E isomer. When relaxing through this pathway, the molecule encounters a potential barrier in the ground state, which requires significant structural reorganization before full relaxation. This local minimum can be more general than expected and may be behind unsolved issues in the literature of azobenzenes.},

  abstract = {An uncertainty-driven active learning strategy was employed to achieve efficient point sampling for full-dimension potential energy surface constructions. Model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network models, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added to the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. A reference potential energy surface (PES) of the 6-D H 2 O–He system was constructed first by the MLRNet model with a weighted Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.028 cm −1 . The full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method. The current sampling method is reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, where the single precision model achieves a test set RMSE of 0.3253 cm −1 with 472 fitting points and the double precision model is 0.0710 cm −1 with only 613 points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy. However, the MLRNet, with fewer parameters, shows lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles, indicating its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to validate the accuracy of PESs. The energy levels of the double precision LS-FI-NN showed great agreement with the reference PES’s results, with only 0.0161 and 0.0044 cm −1 average errors for vibrational levels and the band origin shifts.},

  abstract = {In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the coalescence-induced jumping behavior of moving and stationary droplets at the nanoscale on superhydrophobic surfaces. The results show that the initial velocity of the droplets significantly influences the coalescence time and jumping characteristics. As the initial velocity increases, the coalescence time decreases, and the horizontal velocity increases, suggesting that controlling the initial velocity can adjust droplet motion behavior. In terms of energy conversion, the total energy conversion rate remains relatively constant at lower initial velocities but increases significantly as the velocity rises. This is primarily due to the reduced coalescence time and viscous dissipation caused by the increased initial kinetic energy, allowing more energy to be converted into the kinetic energy of jumping. The energy conversion rate in the horizontal direction increases with initial velocity, while in the vertical direction, it tends to decrease. This study deepens the understanding of coalescence-induced jumping phenomena at the nanoscale and provides a theoretical basis for engineering applications, showing that droplet behavior can be effectively modulated by controlling the initial velocity.},

Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to I ( P 3 / 2 2 ) and I * ( P 1 / 2 2 ) products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump–probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states. By accounting for internal rotation, the kinetic energies of individual fragments in bromoiodomethane align well with experimental results.

The priority focus in area-selective ALD is to achieve the desired selectivity; thus, most studies to date have been concentrated on the reaction mechanism of ALD on growth/nongrowth substrates or the development of novel methodologies to resolve the challenges associated with its implementation in high-volume manufacturing. In this study, we performed area-selective ALD of SiO 2 on SiO 2 , where SiO 2 was not grown on SiN x , and suggested area-selective ALD approaches that could simultaneously enhance selectivity and film quality. An NH 3 plasma treatment was applied to functionalize the SiN x surface with more Si–NH bonds, which exhibited low reactivity toward Si precursors. Although the SiO 2 surface was also functionalized with Si–NH bonds, it was not fully converted into Si–NH because of its thermodynamic nature at low temperatures. Consequently, the results showed that NH 3 plasma pretreatment was effective in increasing selectivity. Therefore, we performed a layer-by-layer NH 3 plasma treatment during the ALD of SiO 2 to deposit high-quality films without losing selectivity. The SiO 2 film was densified, as confirmed by x-ray reflection spectra without nitrogen impurity incorporation. Electrical property measurements of metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors confirmed that this approach enabled simultaneous selectivity and SiO 2 film-quality enhancement.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction almost three decades ago, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has evolved into a mature and powerful technique to reveal the inner workings of quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution. In general, this technique can isolate different contributions to the nonlinear response and provides access to different dynamical quantum pathways of the system evolution. Such isolation of pathways can be achieved in different experimental geometries. In its original, fully noncollinear implementation, directional phase matching allows for such signal isolation, while in the modern commonly employed pump–probe geometry, experimentally challenging phase-cycling schemes are employed. Here, we show how rephasing, non-rephasing, and zero- and double-quantum 2DES signals can be isolated in the pump–probe geometry without a need for phase-cycling. For this, we utilize established causality restrictions of the nonlinear response, allowing us to separate the different contributions in the spectral domain. We demonstrate this using data recorded for a molecular J-aggregate, acting as an effective three-level system. This approach bridges the gap between the capabilities of shaper-based and fully noncollinear 2DES and experimentally simpler implementations, such as those based on birefringent common-path interferometers.},

Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighboring spins (the spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However, in the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique appears ineffective at low mobility values. These findings provide valuable insights into nucleation phenomena at low temperatures, contributing to theoretical and experimental understanding.},

We find that only one vibrational entropy approximation—the one proposed by Truhlar in 2011—which is used in only ∼2% of cases, is stable in the low-lying frequency region and does not exhibit this problem. Accordingly, this approximation shows the best accuracy and robustness on a diverse set of experimental complexation energies and can be somewhat improved even further.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In Paper I [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in Paper II [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.},

It argues that, due to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, the justification for using equilibrium thermostats for nonequilibrium simulations is inherited only by cases in which the perturbation is small enough for the perturbed system to behave like the unperturbed equilibrium system. In the process, this paper categorizes models of external perturbations in molecular dynamics as either responsive—i.e., perturbations that impose a force—or directive—i.e., perturbations that impose a trajectory. Since directive perturbations have not been studied enough in the literature but are becoming more relevant, their effects on simple perturbed thermostatted systems are considered. Finally, using a perturbed two-point harmonic oscillator as well as a driven particle immersed in a simple Lennard-Jones fluid, it gives an approximation for the limit of justified equilibrium thermostat use for perturbed systems. This paper hopes to inspire further research in the fields of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been extensively studied as T 2 contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The theory of nuclear magnetic relaxation induced by superparamagnetic nanoparticles has been validated by numerous experimental studies in the case of spherical particles. Recently, several studies focused on the synthesis of cubic nanoparticles. Some of them reported significantly higher relaxivities compared to their spherical counterpart and attributed this increase to their specific shapes. This work investigates the impact of cube-shaped nanoparticles on nuclear magnetic relaxation through Monte Carlo methods. Transverse relaxation at high static magnetic field is simulated by modeling the proton diffusion in the magnetic field generated by a cubic or a spherical nanoparticle. The results indicate that, in the case of magnetite nanoparticles, there is no significant difference between both shapes for sizes above 30 nm when particles are compared at equal volumes and magnetization. Below this size, a −40%–15% variation of the relaxation rates is predicted for the cubic case compared to the spherical case. These results are explained using general relaxation models that incorporate the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the nanoparticles. The simulation predictions are compared to some experimental results from the literature, revealing that, in some cases, the magnetic field specific to the nanoparticle shape alone cannot explain the observed increase in the relaxation rate of cubic nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion in graphene nanochannels is pivotal for applications such as gas sensing and membrane separation, where nanoscale confinement introduces unique transport phenomena. Unlike bulk-phases, diffusion in graphene nanochannels is significantly influenced by adsorption, which modifies density distributions and alters diffusivity behavior. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are combined with a theoretical framework to comprehensively investigate gas diffusion under varying pressures and channel heights. A modified Chapman–Enskog model, derived from atomistic Lennard-Jones potential parameters, is proposed to account for the effects of confinement. Simulation results reveal that gas diffusivity decreases with increasing gas-phase pressure and decreasing channel height due to enhanced density in the nanochannels. Interestingly, for ultra-narrow channels ( h ≲ 0.7 nm), the diffusivity correction factor exhibits non-monotonic behavior, initially decreasing but subsequently increasing due to overlapping repulsive potential fields. The proposed model integrates adsorption effects through density predictions based on the Boltzmann distribution and effectively predicts gas diffusivities with relative errors of less than 13%, even under strong confinement. These findings highlight the critical interplay between adsorption and confinement in shaping gas transport within graphene nanochannels. The theoretical model provides a predictive tool for designing graphene-based gas separation and sensing devices, offering fundamental insights for optimizing their performance.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer processes are ubiquitous in nature and intensely investigated. The investigations concentrate on the transfer of small to intermediate sized energies. Here, we pose the question of whether the transfer of large energies, where relativistic effects play a central role, can be efficient. At large energies, the process leads to ionization of the environment, i.e., it is the interatomic (or intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) process. To that end, we derive asymptotic expressions for the ICD amplitude by employing the Dirac–Breit Hamiltonian and expanding the frequency dependent Coulomb–Breit interaction between the electrons of the donor and those of the acceptor in powers of the inverse distance between their centers of mass. Expressions are separately derived for the two popular Feynman and Coulomb gauges. At long range, the two expressions have a different appearance but are proven to be equivalent. The derived energy transfer rate at long range shows that when the donor is embedded in an environment, the transfer can be highly efficient. A key is that the radiative lifetime of the donor is extremely short (it can be in the attosecond, 10 −18 s, regime), and the x-ray emission typically dominates by far Auger decay (also called Auger–Meitner decay), and the ICD can quench this emission. This contrasts with the situation at small to intermediate sized energies, where the radiative lifetime is much smaller and Auger decay (if the channel is open) dominates. In these cases, the major contribution to ICD comes from the neighbors nearby.},

  abstract = {Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl 3 in water.},

To test the reliability of the theoretical development, we form three sets of non-covalent complexes from the literature with a total of fifty-one systems. The former set of complexes includes many different types of non-covalent interactions, the second set consists of prototypical non-covalent complexes and three biologically relevant interactions between DNA base pairs, and the third set comprises halogen bonding complexes. We determined the charge-transfer energy contributions and the total interaction energies of all these complexes. The calculated charge-transfer energies are in very good agreement with the ones calculated using the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology, which has been proven to be reliable. Nevertheless, the new procedure relies on the molecular dipole moment, which is observable, while the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology relies on a definition of a population analysis.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell–Schrödinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. In addition, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach—an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.},

  abstract = {Introducing heavy atoms, or replacing atoms with heavier ones, is a routine approach for accelerating spin-flipping photophysical processes. However, predicting its impact on phosphorescence efficiency is not straightforward. Herein, we report an unexpected consequence of bromine-to-iodine substitution in a bromothienyl diketone derivative, TIPS-BrTn , that exhibits outstanding room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in cyclohexane solution. Contrary to our expectation, the iodo-congener TIPS-ITn exhibited feeble photoluminescence, which we confirmed as RTP by ultrafast spectroscopy. Further experimental and theoretical studies revealed that, in the T 1 state, an excited-state symmetry breaking occurred on TIPS-ITn while TIPS-BrTn preserved the centrosymmetric geometry. We identified the driving force for the symmetry breaking as an intramolecular two-center three-electron bonding interaction between iodine and carbonyl oxygen in the (n,π*) excited state. Consequently, while the direct T 1 –S 0 spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in TIPS-BrTn is symmetry-forbidden and zero, that of TIPS-ITn is non-zero due to the loss of centrosymmetry, thereby accelerating nonradiative T 1 –S 0 decay to diminish the RTP. Importantly, the phosphorescence rate constant is not solely dictated by the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC; instead, it can be rationalized by the intensity borrowing from higher singlet states. Thus, our work highlights the importance of controlling molecular symmetry, which could suppress the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC and lead to a preferential acceleration of radiative decay over nonradiative decay for achieving efficient RTP.},

Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. In addition, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules.

The use of two strategies of spin labeling of mRNAs allowed us to study for the first time the effect of the structure and location of spin labels on the measured interspin distances in human ribosome complexes. Experiments using dipolar EPR spectroscopy, supported by molecular dynamics calculations, demonstrated that labels introduced at nucleotide bases provide a higher resolution between mRNA conformations in the ribosome mRNA channel, compared to labels introduced at the ribose-phosphate backbone. Although ribose-phosphate labeling turned out to be less informative on its own for studying mRNA conformations in the ribosome than the previously used base labeling, it can find application in other complex studies of the structure of RNAs and their complexes.},

  abstract = {The elasticity of phospholipid membranes as a function of hydration was investigated using coarse-grained molecular simulations. Multilamellar membranes consist of two or more lipid bilayers separated by a thin layer of water, a system commonly found in cell membranes that provides surface tension in the alveoli of the lungs and on cartilaginous surfaces of synovial joints. The objective was to quantify the response of such systems to compression in the direction perpendicular to the membranes as a function of the amount of water between the bilayers or hydration of the system. The present study investigated a variety of phospholipids with six levels of hydration found in multilamellar bilayers in biological systems. Our simulations support the existence of a universal behavior of the increase in surface area per lipid as a function of the normal pressure difference, the difference between the pressure applied in the direction normal to the membrane and the pressure applied in the directions parallel to the membrane. Normalizing the surface area per lipid and the pressure difference by their respective values at rupture yields a composite function of two linear regimes for all the hydration levels under investigation. Where possible, a physics-based interpretation of the normalization scales was provided. Although some parameters of the model are determined empirically, the model represents a promising step in continuum modeling of the response of multilamellar lipid membranes as a function of mechanical stress and hydration.},

  abstract = {The localization of biomolecular condensates to intracellular membrane surfaces has emerged as an important feature of sub-cellular organization. In this work, we study the wetting behavior of biomolecular condensates on various substrates. We use confocal microscopy to measure the contact angles of model condensates formed by intrinsically disordered protein Ddx4 N . We show the importance of taking optical aberrations into account, as these impact apparent contact angle measurements. Ddx4 N condensates are seen to partially dry (contact angles above 90°) a model membrane, with little dependence on the magnitude of charge on, or tyrosine content of, Ddx4 N . Further contact angle measurements on surfaces of varying hydrophilicity reveal a preference of Ddx4 N condensates for hydrophobic surfaces, suggesting an intrinsic repulsion between protein condensates and hydrophilic membrane surfaces. This observation is in line with previous studies relating protein adsorption to surface hydrophilicity. Our work advances the understanding of the molecular details governing the localization of biomolecular condensates.},

Adjusting for differences in mean active force reveals nearly identical behavior across models, even across varying filament configurations and bending rigidities.

A rich array of ordered structures can be formed from XLCMs, driven by the competition between the interactions between the chemically distinct blocks and the molecular connectivity. Here, we report a theoretical study on the phase behavior of XLCMs with symmetric and asymmetric side blocks by using the self-consistent field theory (SCFT). A large number of ordered structures, including smectic phases, simple and giant polygons, are obtained as solutions of the SCFT equations. Phase diagrams of XLCMs as a function of the total length and asymmetric ratio of the side chains are constructed. For XLCMs with symmetric side blocks, the theoretically predicted phase transition sequence is in good agreement with experiments. For XLCMs with a fixed total side chain length, transitions between layered structure to polygonal phases, as well as between different polygonal phases, could be induced by varying the asymmetry of the side chains. The free energy density, domain size, side chain stretching, and molecular orientation are analyzed to elucidate mechanisms stabilizing the different ordered phases.},

S086 has two crystalline forms (α and ξ) with the same molecular composition, but only the crystal structure of the latter has been disclosed. Using the carboxylic group (COO − ) and the amide group (CONH) as structural probes, the core structures and local dynamics of the Ca 2+ coordination complex in the unit cell of the two cocrystals were examined by ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. A notable variation in the molar ratio of bidentate to bridging binding types of COO − groups that bind to Ca 2+ was first identified between the two crystal forms by linear IR spectroscopy. This variation is accompanied by greater local structural rigidity of the α-crystal compared to that of the ξ-crystal, as evidenced by a greater residual amplitude in the spectral diffusion dynamics extracted from the time-dependent 2D IR spectroscopy. Vibrational energy transfer between the bidentate and tridentate COO − groups in the α-crystal was found to be faster than that in the ξ-crystal, suggesting shorter intermolecular distances between EXP3174 and sacubitril in the former. These findings provide dynamical structural parameters that help to understand the stability and releasing mechanisms of the drug molecules.},

We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize the dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.},

To address this problem, this study pioneers the application of deep operator networks to effectively model the time-dependent piezoionic effect. By leveraging a data-driven approach, our model significantly reduces computational time compared to traditional finite element analysis (FEA). In particular, we trained a DeepONet using a comprehensive dataset generated through FEA calibrated to experimental data. Through rigorous testing with step responses, slow-changing forces, and dynamic-changing forces, we show that the model captures the intricate temporal dynamics of the piezoionic effect in both the horizontal and vertical planes. This capability offers a powerful tool for real-time analysis of piezoionic phenomena, contributing to simplifying the design of tactile interfaces and potentially complementing existing tactile imaging technologies.},

  abstract = {Condensed phase explosives typically contain defects such as voids, bubbles, and pores; this heterogeneity facilitates the formation of hot spots and triggers decomposition reaction at low densities. The study of the thermal decomposition mechanisms of explosives at different densities has thus attracted considerable research interest. Gaining a deeper insight into these mechanisms would be helpful for elucidating the detonation processes of explosives. In this work, we developed an ab initio neural network potential for the FOX-7 system using machine learning method. Extensive large-scale (1008 atoms) and long-duration (nanosecond timescale) deep potential molecular dynamics simulations at different densities were performed to investigate the effect of the density on the thermal decomposition mechanism. The results indicate that the initial reaction pathway of the FOX-7 explosives is the cleavage of the C–NO 2 bond at different densities, while the frequency of C–NO 2 bond cleavage decreases at higher density. Increasing the initial density of FOX-7 significantly increases the reaction rate during the initial decomposition and the formation of final products. However, it leads to a decrease in released heat and has minimal impact on the decomposition temperature. In addition, by analyzing the molecular dynamics trajectories and conducting quantum chemical calculations, we identified two lower-barrier production pathways to produce the CO 2 and N 2 .},

  abstract = {The most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently developed using antisolvent-based fabrication technology. Despite extensive analysis of various aspects of the antisolvent method—such as the type of antisolvent, dropping time, and precursor compatibility—some antisolvents still produce uneven film surface morphology on centimeter-scale substrates. The decoupling of the relationship between local structural characteristics, such as grain boundaries and defects, and the optoelectronic performance of PSCs is currently one of the most highly regarded research issues in the field. In this study, we utilized high-resolution white light interferometry to characterize the morphological distributions of perovskite films from the center to edge, using anisole as an example of the antisolvent. We observed that macro cracks at the center of the film typically exhibit dense ridge morphology, while cracks toward the edges display a concave morphology. We analyze the stress mechanism by using EDS mapping and AFM in detail, attributing this phenomenon to the competitive attachment of 2D islands and boundaries for adatoms, which are influenced by changes in grain size. The devices at different locations were fabricated and their performance analyzed. Our findings indicate that these protruding cracks do not significantly affect the current and voltage of the photovoltaic device; however, concave cracks lead to a decrease in the device fill factor. We attribute this decrease to enhanced carrier recombination at the interface due to this morphology. This study provides valuable insights into the formation of perovskite film morphology under antisolvent treatment and the relationship between film local morphology and PSCs performance.},

  abstract = {The traditional Gouy–Chapman–Stern theory has been effective in explaining the behavior of dilute electrolytes in the electrical double layer but falls short when it comes to describing how ions behave at the metal/electrolyte interface. This is because it overlooks key factors such as the molecular structure of water at the interface and the effects of electron screening in the metal. To address these gaps, we revisit ion adsorption at the metal/electrolyte interface. The approach combines the method of images with a field-theoretic framework for dilute electrolytes and metals described by the Thomas–Fermi model. Nonlocal polarization correlations in water are described by a first-order gradient expansion in the Landau free energy functional. Unlike earlier approaches that relied on the “specular reflection approximation,” our method provides a less constrained way to handle the complex electrostatic boundary conditions at the interface. Analyzing the behavior of a test charge near the interface, an electrostatic energy minimum is found. This minimum depends on the metal’s screening properties and the overall potential drop across the double layer. In addition, the alignment of water dipoles at the interface creates an asymmetry in the energy experienced by positively and negatively charged ions. Finally, we derived an expression for the electrosorption isotherm by describing both the distribution of the electrostatic potential and the lateral interactions between charges along the interface. Our findings highlight how the structure of interfacial water can drive processes such as underpotential deposition by creating favorable electrostatic conditions for ion adsorption.},

The solid state route is adopted to prepare these dilute weight% ( x = 1, 3, and 5) ferrite based composites. The incorporation of ferrite phase improves the interfacial tensile strain and grain boundary volume fraction in the said composite. The incommensurate to commensurate magnetic transition (T N2 ) of YBaCuFeO 5 is shifted to a high temperature by 10 K with the lowest concentration and indistinguishable in higher concentrations due to the magnetic dominance of ferrites. The irreversibility of magnetization due to the field history mostly stems from the uncompensated spins and a competitive interaction among the magnetic phases at the interface. The magnetic isotherms show unusual negative exchange bias phenomena in the said system, and a large room temperature spontaneous exchange bias (∼1 kOe) is achieved with a dilute incorporation x = 5. The exchange bias field and coercive fields (H C ) are, however, contrary to each other with temperature (and concentration) explained with a schematic model on the basis of dominating irreversible spins at high temperatures. In a field of ±50 kOe, the exchange bias field is dropped, while H C is increased, which might be due to the dominance of Zeeman energy over the uniaxial anisotropy. The non-collinear magnetic phase transition of YBaCuFeO 5 at T ≤ 175 K plays a pivotal role in reducing the exchange bias compared to its collinear phase (300 K). Moreover, the extent of this bias field (∼1 kOe) can be considered a useful component in efficient device fabrication.},

We find that the hopping-site energy distributions inferred from the amorphous structures deviate from the Gaussian distribution, especially in their low-energy tails. Mostly for this reason, the effect of disorder on charge-carrier mobility is much weaker than predicted by the lattice/Gaussian models and dependent on system density. The lattice models of electron–hole recombination in disordered systems, which assume a Gaussian site energy distribution, are found to be more accurate than those of charge-carrier transport. This is explained by the strong Coulomb trapping of electron–hole pairs before recombination, which makes the role of hopping-site energy disorder less significant.},

Validation of this relation was structured at different levels, taking into account various ingredients as the apolar–polar character, macromolecular structure, the presence of hydrogen bonds, or complex structure and dynamics. The results reclaim the suitability of dielectric spectroscopy to echo the primary structural relaxation of glass-forming systems, demonstrating that the dielectric response effectively captures the structural relaxation by reliably correlating with entropy fluctuations. The correlation with entropy fluctuations holds even when the dielectric strength of the systems is high and the dielectric response is narrow and dominated by cross correlations, proving that dipolar intermolecular interactions are fundamental to the structural relaxation and not a particularity of the dielectric probe. This one-to-one correspondence between structural and dielectric α relaxation does not support the existence of a generic spectral shape for the primary structural relaxation valid for all kinds of susceptibility functions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the pressure-dependent dielectric properties of water is crucial for a wide range of scientific and practical applications. In this study, we employ a deep neural network trained on density functional theory data to investigate the dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature across a pressure range of 0.1–1000 MPa. We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant ɛ 0 with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in ɛ 0 is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in ɛ 0 , our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor G K with increasing pressure. This decrease in G K is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.},

The size of the central ring is systematically varied, as is the inherent level of disorder in the surrounding network (as controlled by the Monte Carlo “temperature” and characterized by the fraction of six-membered rings). The effect of the central ring on the overall network topology is analyzed in terms of both topological and geometric distances. For larger central rings, the first topological shell becomes exclusively populated by four- and five-membered rings, which leads to an effective upper limit on the size of the central ring that can effectively be accommodated. The topological shells are found to show ordering at significant distances away from the central ring. The effective correlation lengths are determined as a function of both central ring size and level of network disorder, which allows for an understanding of the potential density of large rings that may be accommodated.},

  abstract = {Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are environmentally friendly green solvents and hold great promise in the pharmaceutical industry. The secondary structure of a protein, lysozyme, follows a non-monotonous behavior in aqueous glyceline (choline chloride + glycerol) as the wt. % of water is increased. However, it is unclear how the hydration affects the stability of the protein in a non-linear way. In this work, we have performed all-atom molecular dynamic simulations for 1 μ s with the lysozyme protein in an aqueous glyceline deep eutectic solvent (DES) by varying the wt. % of water. The simulated radius of gyration, R g , values can qualitatively reproduce the protein behavior such that the R g increases initially with an increase in wt. % of water, reaches the peak at 40 wt. %, and then gradually decreases with dilution. Several other properties, including root mean square deviation, root-mean square fluctuation, secondary structure of the protein, and solvent accessible surface area, are examined to explore the NADES effect on the protein structure. Next, we analyze the hydrogen bond profile of intra-protein and among various interspecies, e.g., protein–DES, DES–DES, protein–water, and water–water. The variation in protein–protein hydrogen bonds with concentrations can qualitatively explain the non-linear conformational dependence of the protein. The radial distribution function analyses show various microscopic structures formed due to the DES and water interaction, which play a critical role in protein behavior. This study indicates that at lower wt. % of water, the protein is constrained in a strong hydrogen bond network formed by glycerol and water molecules, resulting in a lower R g . As the wt. % of water increases, the protein–water interaction drives the protein to expand, reflecting an increasing R g . At sufficiently higher wt. % of water, the DES constituent and the water molecules interact strongly with the protein, resulting in a decrease in R g . Overall, the investigation offers a microscopic insight into the protein conformation in DES.},

We find that such networks self-organize to a marginally stable state, in which the barrier for local activations becomes vanishingly small. The model provides unique access to both local and global properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure pseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging fluctuations under shear. Crucially, the dynamics are dominated by a small population of bonds that are locally unstable, which give rise to quasi-localized, low-frequency vibrational modes and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a correction to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche statistics based on diverging length fluctuations. Our model combines a coarse-grained view with a continuous, real-space implementation, providing novel insights to a wide class of amorphous solids.},

Interestingly, while the supramolecular gelator significantly alters the macroscopic behavior of the solvent at concentrations of 0.3 and 0.5 wt. %, it does not affect the hydrogen bond network at the microscopic level. In contrast, the addition of PCM at 5 wt. %, which does not change the macroscopic properties, modifies the structural dynamics of water–ethanol mixtures at length scales commensurate with and below the PCM–PCM correlation length in the mixture. This study reveals the intricate interplay between solute, solvent, and gel interactions, demonstrating a lack of direct correlation between macroscopic and microscopic properties in such complex systems.},

  abstract = {The lack of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration has long hindered a comprehensive atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties. The Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) approach, which involves diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of potential energy in instantaneous liquid configurations, has emerged as a promising framework in this direction. However, several conceptual challenges remain, particularly related to the approach’s inability to capture anharmonic effects. In this study, we present a set of “experimental facts” through a comprehensive INM analysis of simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N 2 , CS 2 , Ga, and Pb, across a wide temperature range from the solid to gas phase. First, we examine the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the DOS obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. We then analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS in search of potential universal behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between INMs and other properties of liquids, including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. In addition, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperatures as the system approaches the solid phase, revealing a significant fraction of unstable modes even in crystalline solids. Finally, we confirm the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and uncover its complex temperature-dependent behavior, challenging current theoretical models.},

To understand this unusual feature, we have measured the responses to high amplitude ac and dc electric fields at the fundamental frequency. The static limits of these results are entered into a model aimed at reproducing nonlinear dielectric susceptibility spectra using the concept of a fictive electric field. This model reproduces the “hump” in the third-harmonic response and its seeming disappearance. It is revealed that the “hump” is predominantly the result of reduced time constants, a consequence of the energy the sample absorbs from the electric field. At elevated temperatures, the “hump” only appears to vanish because its reduced amplitude submerges below the extraordinarily high level of polarization saturation of this liquid.},

  abstract = {This study delves into the fragmentation mechanisms of the oxazolone form (OXA) of protonated cyclo-di-glycine using chemical dynamics simulations at multiple internal energies. While we focus our in-depth analyses on a representative total energy of 178 kcal/mol, we also performed simulations over the 127–187 kcal/mol range. This broader energy sampling reveals how the population of states evolves with increasing internal energy, enabling us to compute rate constants and then effective energy thresholds using a previously introduced three-state model [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. By transforming molecular geometries into graph representations, we systematically analyze fragmentation processes and identify key intermediates and ion–molecule complexes (IMCs) that play a crucial role in fragmentation dynamics. The study highlights the distinct isomerization landscapes of OXA, driven by IMC formation, which contrasts with the previously reported behavior of cyclic and linear forms [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. The resulting fragmentation channels are characterized by their unique energetic thresholds and branching ratios and can provide a molecular explanation of what was observed experimentally. Thanks to an accurate analysis of the trajectories using our graph-theory-based tools, it was possible to point out the particular behavior of OXA fragmentation, which is different from other isomers. In particular, the important role of IMCs is shown, which has an impact on populating different isomeric structures.},

Then, the templating synthon approach is used to improve the accuracy of structures optimized by a hybrid density functional paired with a double zeta basis set, leveraging chemical similarity to cluster different molecular environments and refine bond lengths and valence angles. A set of prototypical biomolecular building blocks is used to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve spectroscopic accuracy for molecular systems too large to be treated by state-of-the-art composite wavefunction methods.

  abstract = {Complete datasets of rate coefficients for the vibrational quenching of molecular nitrogen by collision with electronically excited atomic oxygen O( 1 D) over a wide temperature range are calculated for the first time. Such data are important ingredients in the modeling of non-local thermal equilibrium conditions that characterize the atmosphere, media of astronomical interest, and cold and hot plasmas, where O( 1 D), also formed when O 2 molecules break, represents a significant fraction of the gas mixture. To this end, we developed analytical potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the 1 Π and 1 Δ electronic states of the N 2 –O( 1 D) system to accurately describe the interaction in the long, medium, and first repulsive range of intermolecular distances, the most effective regions in inelastic collisions under a variety of conditions of interest. The derived PESs are used to calculate the vibration-to-translation (V–T) and vibration-to-electronic (V–E) energy transfer rates by mixed quantum–classical dynamics and by the Landau–Zener formulation, respectively. In addition, the datasets are extended to cover the entire N 2 vibrational ladder by using the Gaussian process regression. The results show that at low temperatures, where V–E relaxation dominates, N 2 vibrational quenching by O( 1 D) collisions is faster than by O( 3 P) collisions.},

  abstract = {The nature of argentophilic interaction in the 2,2′-bipyridine-coordinated silver complex, which manifests counterintuitive cation–cation “attraction,” is attributed to ligand stacking and solvation effects in the present article. While charged closed-shell transition metal complexes aggregating spontaneously to form oligomers has long been observed experimentally, the interpretation of the nature of so-called metallophilicity is still ongoing. For the dimer [(2,2′-bpy) 2 Ag] 2 2+ , qualitative electrostatic potential, non-covalent interaction, atoms-in-molecules analyses, and quantitative energy decomposition analysis calculations indicate that the electrostatic repulsion between two like formal charges at silver centers can be overcome by long-range dispersion attraction and short-range electronic correlation from ligands. In addition, delocalizing the net charges on silvers over the whole ligands can decrease electrostatic repulsion of metal centers to stabilize oligomers. The vital role of the screening effect of solvent has also been realized in the bound binding of the title system. Overall, this research highlights the importance of ligand stacking to argentophilicity, while d 10 –d 10 attraction of silver centers presents quite little contribution.},

In this work, high level, state-of-the-art computations at the finite temperature density functional theory and highly correlated CCSD(T) levels indicate that a syn -periplanar conformation of the H–C–O–H bonds, in which the C–H and O–H bonds eclipse each other, is a three-fold global minimum in the potential energy surface for internal rotation of the O–H bond. We show that vicinal hyperconjugation between the orbitals in the C–H bonds and in the oxygen atom is responsible for this puzzling conformational preference. The transition state for the rotation yields an ≈ 0.6 kcal/mol rotational barrier, which matches the thermal energy at room conditions and, therefore, renders the O–H bond a free rotor. The molecular wave function has a moderate multireference character with the oxygen atom acting as the preferred spot for static correlation.},

Our group recently synthesized a series of end-to-end bent perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophanes, whose degree of bending is adjustable by modifying the internal alkyl tethers. Herein, we subjected these bent PBI derivatives to theoretical calculations and time-resolved spectroscopy. The current study has offered rational explanations for several unique photophysical characteristics of bent PBIs: (1) the redshifts of the S 0 –S 1 transitions, (2) the decrease in extinction coefficients, (3) the broadening of spectral shapes, and (4) the suppression of nonradiative decay processes. Furthermore, the investigation of the S 1 states and radical anions has revealed that structural bending also substantially alters the energy levels of upper molecular orbitals such as LUMO+2.},

The binary cluster features a linear B 3 chain along its C 3 axis, as well as three lateral Zn–Zn dimers, in which a central B atom is sandwiched by two quasi-planar BZn 3 units in an eclipsed form. Chemical bonding analyses show that the B 3 chain motif has Lewis-type B–B σ single bonds and a pair of orthogonal three-center two-electron (3c-2e) π bonds, collectively leading to a B–B bond order of two. Stabilizing a boron single chain is scarce in the literature, as is observing a series of double B=B bonds in a monoatomic chain fashion. The triangular pyramid BZn 3 units are each in a unique triplet σ 2 σ* 1 σ* 1 configuration, thus rendering σ aromaticity to the cluster according to the reversed 4 n Hückel rule. It is proposed that the alloy cluster can be rationalized using the concept of electronic transmutation, wherein a close chemical analogy to the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) molecule is established.},

In this study, indium-doped silicon clusters (InSi n −/0 , n = 3–11) were investigated using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations. It is found that InSi n − anions exhibit geometrical and electronic structures resembling their Si n+1 counterparts, with the substitution of one silicon atom by an indium atom leading to exohedral doping and multiple coordination characteristics. The exohedral configuration is attributed to a weak In–Si bond and the limited atomic valence of indium, while the multiple coordination arises from the joint contributions of three orthogonal 5 p orbitals of indium atom. Electronic structure similarities between InSi n − anions and Si n+1 clusters are confirmed by their identical valence molecular orbitals. The valence p -type orbitals of InSi n − primarily contribute to chemical bonding, whereas the valence s -type orbitals predominantly hold electron lone pairs, as demonstrated by the electron localization function and localized molecular orbital analysis. These results provide insights into the structural and electronic properties of indium-doped silicon clusters.},

  abstract = {Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flips, and magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange–correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn–Sham (KS) and generalized KS (GKS) orbitals, the KS potentials, and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze seven standard exchange–correlation functionals and find two main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, as well as the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential, when using the optimized effective potential method within the KS scheme. When calculations are performed using the GKS approach, no jumps are observed, as expected. Moreover, we demonstrate that for high-spin systems, a full three-dimensional treatment is crucial; the spherical approximation commonly used in atoms causes a qualitative deviation. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.},

The porphyrins contain central elements from three distinct groups in the Periodic Table with different oxidation states, types, and numbers of axial ligands, as well as different peripheral substituents on the porphyrin ring. Shortly after photoexcitation, in all cases, the primary multiplet polarization of the porphyrin triplet state evolves into long-lived net polarization whose lifetime is determined by the lifetime of the triplet state. The zero-field splitting parameters and sign of the multiplet polarization vary significantly among the porphyrins, but the transient EPR spectra taken at later times are remarkably similar. The development of long-lived net polarization is proposed to involve the dynamic Jahn–Teller effect, in which hopping between the two lowest triplet states occurs.},

Recently, the pursuit of this goal has been aided by machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which provide energies and forces at quantum mechanical accuracy but at a fraction of the cost of the reference quantum mechanical calculations. Assembling the training set of relevant configurations is key to building the MLIP. Here, we demonstrate two approaches to training reactive MLIPs based on reaction pathway information. One approach exploits reaction datasets containing reactant, product, and transition state structures. Using an S N 2 reaction dataset, we accurately locate reaction pathways and transition state geometries of up to 170 unseen reactions. In another approach, which does not depend on data availability, we present an efficient active learning procedure that yields an accurate MLIP and converged minimum energy path given only the reaction end point structures, avoiding quantum mechanics driven reaction pathway search at any stage of training set construction. We demonstrate this procedure on an S N 2 reaction in the gas phase and with a small number of solvating water molecules, predicting reaction barriers within 20 meV of the reference quantum chemistry method. We then apply the active learning procedure on a more complex reaction involving a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and proton transfer, comparing the results against the reactive ReaxFF force field. Our active learning procedure, in addition to rapidly finding reaction paths for individual reactions, provides an approach to building large reaction path databases for training transferable reactive machine learning potentials.},

In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: neural spline flows, conditional flow matching, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) neural spline flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) conditional flow matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) denoising diffusion probabilistic models appear the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib 9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation.

Modern machine-learning (ML) potentials provide the most precise representation compared to electronic structure calculations, while traditional potentials provide a less precise but computationally much faster representation and, thus, allow simulations of larger systems. We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential into a multi-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with an optimum of performance and precision in large, complex atomistic systems. The required precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and updated automatically during simulation. We use copper as demonstrator material with an embedded atom model as classical force field and an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as ML potential, but, in principle, a broader class of potential combinations can be coupled by this method. The approach is developed for the molecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent problems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed adaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces with a precision of 10 me V/Å and the ACE-energy exactly for the precisely calculated atoms in a nanoindentation of 4 × 10 6 atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a speedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.},

While significant effort has been made in this field over the last decade, data-driven approaches generally rely on the paradigm of imposing a fixed base of library functions. In order to promote sparsity, finding the optimal set of basis functions is a necessary condition but a challenging task to guess in advance. Here, we propose an alternative approach that consists of optimizing the very library of functions while imposing sparsity. The robustness of our results is not only evaluated by the quality of the fit of the discovered model but also by the statistical distribution of the residuals with respect to the original noise in the data. In order to avoid choosing one metric over the other, we would rather rely on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for systematically generating a subset of optimal models sorted in a Pareto front. We illustrate how this method can be used as a tool to derive microkinetic equations from experimental data.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is finding increasingly more applications in quantum chemistry, particularly to simulate electronic structure and molecular properties of simple systems. The transformation of a molecular Hamiltonian from the fermionic space to the qubit space results in a series of Pauli strings. Calculating the energy then involves evaluating the expectation values of each of these strings, which presents a significant bottleneck for applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) in quantum chemistry. Unlike fermionic Hamiltonians, the terms in a qubit Hamiltonian are additive. This work leverages this property to introduce a novel method for extracting information from the partial qubit Hamiltonian, thereby enhancing the efficiency of VQEs. This work introduces the SHARC-VQE (Simplified Hamiltonian Approximation, Refinement, and Correction-VQE) method, where the full molecular Hamiltonian is partitioned into two parts based on the ease of quantum execution. The easy-to-execute part constitutes the partial Hamiltonian, and the remaining part, while more complex to execute, is generally less significant. The latter is approximated by a refined operator and added up as a correction into the partial Hamiltonian. SHARC-VQE significantly reduces computational costs for molecular simulations. The cost of a single energy measurement can be reduced from O ( N 4 ϵ 2 ) to O ( 1 ϵ 2 ) for a system of N qubits and accuracy ϵ , while the overall cost of VQE can be reduced from O ( N 7 ϵ 2 ) to O ( N 3 ϵ 2 ) ⁠ . Furthermore, measurement outcomes using SHARC-VQE are less prone to errors induced by noise from quantum circuits, reducing the errors from 20%–40% to 5%–10% without any additional error correction or mitigation technique. In addition, the SHARC-VQE is demonstrated as an initialization technique, where the simplified partial Hamiltonian is used to identify an optimal starting point for a complex problem. Overall, this method improves the efficiency of VQEs and enhances the accuracy and reliability of quantum simulations by mitigating noise and overcoming computational challenges.},

  abstract = {High-resolution techniques capable of manipulating from single molecules to millions of cells are combined with three-dimensional modeling followed by simulation to comprehend the specific aspects of chromosomes. From the theoretical perspective, the energy landscape theory from protein folding inspired the development of the minimal chromatin model (MiChroM). In this work, two biologically relevant MiChroM energy terms were minimized under different conditions, revealing a competition between loci compartmentalization and motor-driven activity mechanisms in chromatin folding. Enhancing the motor activity energy baseline increased the lengthwise compaction and reduced the polymer entanglement. Concomitantly, decreasing compartmentalization-related interactions reduced the overall polymer collapse, although compartmentalization given by the microphase separation remained almost intact. For multiple chromosome simulations, increased motorization intensified the territory formation of the different chains and reduced compartmentalization strength lowered the probability of contact formation of different loci between multiple chains, approximating to the experimental inter-contacts of the human chromosomes. These findings have direct implications for experimental data-driven chromosome modeling, specially those involving multiple chromosomes. The interplay between phase-separation and territory formation mechanisms should be properly implemented in order to recover the genome architecture and dynamics, features that might play critical roles in regulating nuclear functions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of complex biomolecules requires simplified models that not only make computations feasible but also reveal fundamental mechanisms. Coarse-graining (CG) achieves this by grouping atoms into beads, whose stochastic dynamics can be derived using the Mori–Zwanzig formalism, capturing both reversible and irreversible interactions. In liquid, the dissipative bead–bead interactions have so far been restricted to hydrodynamic couplings. However, friction does not only arise from the solvent but, notably, from the internal degrees of freedom missing in the CG beads. This leads to an additional “internal friction” whose relevance is studied in this contribution. By comparing with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), we neatly show that in order to accurately reproduce the dynamics of a globular protein in water using a CG model, not only a precise determination of elastic couplings and the Stokesian self-friction of each bead is required. Critically, the inclusion of internal friction between beads is also necessary for a faithful representation of protein dynamics. We propose to optimize the parameters of the CG model through a self-averaging method that integrates the CG dynamics with an evolution equation for the CG parameters. This approach ensures that selected quantities, such as the radial distribution function and the time correlation of bead velocities, match the corresponding MD values.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy experiments have examined photoprotective mechanisms in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex, showing that exciton transfer pathways change significantly depending on the environmental redox conditions. Higgins et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 118 (11), e2018240118 (2021)] have theoretically linked these observations to changes in a quantum vibronic coupling, whereby onsite energies are altered under oxidizing conditions such that exciton energy gaps are detuned from a specific vibrational motion of the bacteriochlorophyll a . These arguments rely on an analysis of exciton transfer rates within Redfield theory, which is known to provide an inaccurate description of the influence of the vibrational environment on the exciton dynamics in the FMO complex. Here, we use a memory kernel formulation of the hierarchical equations of motion to obtain non-perturbative estimations of exciton transfer rates, which yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate that onsite energy shifts alone do not reproduce the reported rate changes in the oxidative environment. We systematically examine a model that includes combined changes in both site energies and the frequency of a local vibration in the oxidized complex while maintaining consistency with absorption spectra and achieving qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the measured changes in transfer rates. Our analysis points to potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian, which was originally derived by fitting spectra to perturbative theories. Overall, our work suggests that further experimental and theoretical analyses may be needed to understand the variations of exciton dynamics under different redox conditions.},

  abstract = {In light of the recent discrepancies reported between fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo and local natural orbital coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large molecular systems [Al-Hamdani et al. , Nat. Commun. 12 , 3927 (2021)], the applicability of CCSD(T) is assessed using a model framework. The use of the semi-empirical π -space only Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) model for studying large molecules is critically examined and is shown to recover both bandgap closure as system size increases and long range dispersive behavior of r −6 with increasing separation between monomers. Since bandgap closure in systems with long-range Coulomb interactions is problematic for perturbative methods, such as CCSD(T), this model, therefore, serves as a testing ground for such methods, enabling them to be benchmarked with high-order CC methods, which are not possible with ab initio Hamiltonians. Using the PPP model, coupled cluster methodologies, CCSDTQ and CCSDT(Q), are then used to benchmark CCSDT and CCSD(T) methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large one- and two-dimensional molecular systems up to the dibenzocoronene dimer. We show that CCSD(T) demonstrates no signs of overestimating the interaction energy for these systems. Furthermore, by examining the Hartree–Fock HOMO–LUMO gap of these large molecules, the perturbative treatment of the triples contribution in CCSD(T) is not expected to cause problems for accurately capturing the interaction energy for system sizes up to at least circumcoronene.},

Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a δ -function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for the exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. In addition, we present simulation results that replicate previously reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signals, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneities.},

Extensive validation across diverse interface geometries and evaporation flux magnitudes demonstrates high accuracy, with errors below 5% for unit density ratios. For density contrasts, the method remains robust in the limit of smaller evaporation flux magnitudes and density ratios.

The structure of the state space could be quite complicated for quantum many-body systems, and the systematic decomposition of the state space is normally involved. Recently, a modular tensor diagram approach was proposed to reorganize the state space hierarchically based on a modular basis. Here, we review the construction of spin eigenfunctions for multiple exciton systems and further develop modular tensor diagrams to exemplify the hierarchical symmetry of the state space. The newly constructed spin eigenfunctions for quadruple excitons, along with the results for triple excitons, are used to demonstrate the effective decomposition of the state space into hierarchical tensorial structures. A universal recursive relation is derived to determine the coefficients of spin eigenfunctions exhibiting transformation symmetry between different classes of elementary modules for an arbitrary number of exciton units. Interestingly, different coupling schemes mapped to quantum many-body interactions lead to different spin adapted basis states, which may correspond to different realistic systems upon the breakdown of spin degeneracy. This work highlights the hierarchical symmetry of the tensorial structure of quantum many-body systems, which may facilitate a better understanding of the structure property relationship toward the object-oriented materials design.},

  abstract = {Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be surmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling (going from exponential to possibly a very high-ordered polynomial) and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for the path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This technique can be used for simulation of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium correlation functions and is demonstrated here using examples from both. We show that the cost becomes constant with the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators, which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be instrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for very large systems.},

  abstract = {Solvation free energy is a driving force that plays an important role in the stability of biomolecular conformations. Currently, the implicit solvent model is widely used to calculate solvation energies of biomolecules such as proteins. However, for proteins, the implicit solvent calculation does not provide much detailed information since a protein is highly inhomogeneous on its surface. In this study, we develop an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which allows us to investigate detailed site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, including the role of counter ions and intra-protein interactions. This approach facilitates the analysis of specific residue interactions with solvent molecules, extending the understanding of protein solubility to the energetic impacts of site-specific residue–solvent interactions. Our study showed that specific residue–solvent interactions are strongly influenced by the electrostatic environment created by its nearby residues, especially charged residues. In particular, charged residues on the protein surface are mainly responsible for the heterogeneity of the electrostatic environment of the protein surface, and they significantly affect the local distribution of water. In addition, counter ions change the local electrostatic environment and alter specific residue–water interactions. Neutral residues also interact with water, with polar residues being more prominent than nonpolar ones but contributing less to solvation energy than charged residues. This study illustrates an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which gives residue-specific contributions to protein solvation and provides detailed information on site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity.},

  abstract = {A multidimensional version of the modification to vibrational perturbation theory is developed in this article. The modifications to the action are of two types: one is by shifting the energy scale with the VPT2 zero point energy E 0 (mVPT2) and the other is by shifting the action by a constant VPT2-based action Δ S and is denoted mYF. These modifications give a continuous “modified” action over the whole energy range. The multidimensional versions of the mVPT2 and mYF theories have been applied to the collinear H + H 2 and D + H 2 reactions to calculate thermal reaction rates. The results show that the rates computed using the mVPT2 theory are marginally better than those computed by the mYF theory. The corresponding kinetic isotopic effects have also been computed. Both the theories account for the correct ℏ 2 limit at high temperature and not the parabolic barrier limit as in various other theories. The mVPT2 and mYF theories also improve upon the thermal rates in the low temperature limit due to the shifting of the action by the zero point energy shift E 0 . The resulting theory is more accurate than the ring polymer molecular dynamics based approximation over the whole temperature range probed. The results presented here indicate that the multidimensional version of the modified VPT2 theory may be the recommended method for computing thermal tunneling rates in multidimensional systems.},

  abstract = {Mixed halide inorganic perovskites exhibit exceptional stability and photovoltaic performance and are considered to be promising photovoltaic materials. However, the chemical diversity of these materials presents a vast screening space, making it challenging to efficiently identify high-performance materials solely through theoretical calculations or experiments. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a multidimensional high-throughput screening strategy that combines machine learning with first-principles calculations, specifically designed to identify MHIPs with optimal bandgap and light absorption properties. The bandgap and light absorption models have achieved determination coefficients (r 2 ) of 0.9896 and 0.9833, with root mean square errors of 0.1890 eV and 0.2190 10 5 eV · cm −1 , respectively, demonstrating the high precision and reliability of the models. In the present work, the generation of 306 521 candidate materials through mixed B-site elements is reported, leading to the successful identification of 295 materials with ideal characteristics for MHIPs via screening. Subsequently, an in-depth density functional theory validation is conducted on 20 of these materials. The research results demonstrate that Cs 2 AgBi 0.5 Sb 0.25 Ir 0.25 I 6 and CsSn 0.75 Ge 0.25 I 3 exhibit outstanding performance, making them the most promising candidate materials for practical applications. These results fully confirm the scientific validity and effectiveness of our screening strategy, laying a solid foundation for the exploration and optimization of high-performance perovskite solar cell materials.},

  abstract = {Hydrated electrons are anionic species that are formed when an excess electron is introduced into liquid water. Building an understanding of how hydrated electrons behave in solution has been a long-standing effort of simulation methods, of which density functional theory (DFT) has come to the fore in recent years. The ability of DFT to model the reactive chemistry of hydrated electrons is an attractive advantage over semi-classical methodologies; however, relatively few density functional approximations (DFAs) have been used for the hydrated electron simulations presented in the literature. Here, we simulate hydrated electron systems using a series of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals spanning Jacob’s ladder. We calculate a variety of experimental and other observables of the hydrated electron and compare the XC functional dependence for each quantity. We find that the formation of a stable localized hydrated electron is not necessarily limited to hybrid XC functionals and that some hybrid functionals produce delocalized hydrated electrons or electrons that react with the surrounding water at an unphysically fast rate. We further characterize how different DFAs impact the solvent structure and predicted spectroscopy of the hydrated electron, considering several methods for calculating the hydrated electron’s absorption spectrum for the best comparison between structures generated using different density functionals. None of the dozen or so DFAs that we investigated are able to correctly predict the hydrated electron’s spectroscopy, vertical detachment energy, or molar solvation volume.},

Perturbations around physiological pH conditions can lead to changes in the protonation states of titratable histone residues, impacting nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and interactions. However, the effects of proton uptake or release of histone ionizable groups on nucleosome–partner protein interactions and higher-order chromatin structures remain largely unexplored. Here, we conducted comprehensive analyses of histone titratable residue pKa values in various nucleosome contexts, utilizing 96 experimentally determined complex structures. We revealed that pH-induced changes in histone residue protonation states modulated nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and significantly influenced nucleosome–partner protein interactions. Furthermore, we observed that proton uptake or release often accompanied nucleosome–partner protein interactions, facilitating their binding processes. In addition, our findings suggest that alterations in histone protonation can also regulate nucleosome self-association, thereby modulating the organization and dynamics of higher-order chromatin structure. This study advances our understanding of nucleosome–chromatin factor interactions and how chromatin organization is regulated at the molecular level.},

Here, we consider the effect of surface polarization on electrolytes in a slab geometry by combining the MR approach to polarization with Poisson–Boltzmann theory. Due to the coupling of bulk and surface fields, not only is the electrostatics modified by polarization, but maybe even more importantly, vice versa: a finite polarization at the wall is sufficient to generate a finite electrostatic potential even in the absence of net charges on the wall. We determine the polarization and electrostatic potential profiles and the free energy of the system. Our results show that the presence of surface polarization alone suffices to imprint the bulk structural properties on the electrostatic field in an electrolyte.},

Although the FSC observations have provided new information on the crystallization kinetics and evolution of the crystals, the molecular details on the chain exchange events between the ordered and disordered domains of crystals have remained elusive. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the detailed chain dynamics and thermodynamics of polyamide 6 (PA6) system under two heating treatments: (i) quenching PA6 melt deeply below the melting temperature T m and (ii) annealing the resulting quenched system to a temperature close to T m . We categorized the chains into mobile amorphous fraction (MAF) and rigid amorphous fraction (RAF), based on the length of consecutive chain’s bond angles in the trans state. In the deep quenched system close to the glass transition temperature T g , the mobility of the MAF chains is strongly suppressed and they remain in the glassy state. However, upon rising the temperature close to melting temperature, the system undergoes recrystallization, leading to the coexistence of RAF and supercooled liquid MAF chains. The highly mobile unentangled MAF chains explore the interphase domains, and during the late-stage of crystallization, they are thermally translocated into the lamella by reducing the fold number of RAF chains. The chain mobility in the annealed system could potentially lead to improved biodegradation in semi-crystalline chains.},

Differently from our previous work adopting a strategy of ligand engineering [see Wu et al. , Adv. Opt. Mater. 12 , 2400583 (2024)], we here implement an alternative strategy of element doping to regulate the LST and DBS states in the Ag + -doped CdSe nanosystem. It is observed that the hole spin-flip lifetime is shortened when the Ag + -doping level is elevated, demonstrating that the hole–DBS exchange interaction can effectively compete against the coexisting hole–LST trapping interaction, mainly due to the doping-induced increase in the density of the DBS state. Markedly, this observation is contrary to that in the ligand-engineering case, where the hole-trapping interaction plays a predominant role due to the strong ligand/CdSe orbital hybridization. This work elucidates the interplay between the two surface effects and enriches the understanding about the subtle DBS-related effect, providing valuable mechanistic information for rational design and optimization of spintronic applications based on colloidal nanostructures.},

The aim of the present study is to provide some insight into the elementary mechanisms of diffusion of Ag + ions through silica with the objective of proposing control strategies. Thanks to the development of interaction potentials based on neural networks, the diffusion processes were studied via molecular dynamics simulations. Silver diffusion was found to be anomalous and sub-diffusive, the origin of which could be attributed to deceleration and temporal anti-correlations. This sub-diffusion has been attributed primarily to the disordered nature of the silica matrix. Furthermore, it is magnified by the presence of coordination defects within the silica matrix. These defects, in particular the under-coordinated oxygen atoms, act as traps for Ag + by forming O–Ag bonds, thereby limiting the jump length and retaining the ion for long duration. By comparison with existing diffusion models, the diffusion mechanism in the absence of defects appears to be of the fractional Brownian motion type, substantially modified by the presence of defects. Two possible approaches have emerged to tune the release of Ag + ions through the silica layer: the monitoring of the number of defects and the opening/closing of diffusion paths via, e.g., a modification of the silica density.},

We identify four novel Ca–Xe compounds P m 3 ̄ m -CaXe, P 4/ mmm -CaXe 2 , I 4/ m -Ca 3 Xe, and P 4/ mmm -Ca 2 Xe 3 that demonstrate stability over a wide pressure range from 37.5 to 150 GPa. All these compounds exhibit metallic properties and are dynamically stable, as indicated by the absence of imaginary frequencies in their phonon dispersion spectra. Ionic bonding between Ca and Xe is observed due to electron transfer from Ca to Xe. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that P m 3 ̄ m -CaXe, P 4/ mmm -CaXe 2 , and P 4/ mmm -Ca 2 Xe 3 remain solid up to pressures of 135 GPa and temperatures of 4000 K. In contrast, I 4/ m -Ca 3 Xe undergoes a transition from solid to liquid at temperatures above 3500 K due to weakened Ca–Xe bonds. The findings suggest that these Ca–Xe compounds could potentially be synthesized experimentally under high-pressure conditions. The results offer theoretical guidance for discovering new high-pressure Xe compounds and provide valuable insights into Xe chemistry.},

Upon non-hydrostatic pressurization, CuInP 2 Se 6 experienced two successive phase transitions at 5.4 and 14.1 GPa originating from the rapid compression of van der Waals gaps and the local structure variation of Se–P–Se bonds, followed by a metallization at 25.1 GPa. Furthermore, a ∼2.0 GPa pressure hysteresis was detected for the emergence of electronic transformation in CuInP 2 Se 6 under hydrostatic conditions owing to the influence of hydrostaticity. Upon decompression, the phase transition of CuInP 2 Se 6 was demonstrated to be reversible with considerable pressure hysteresis under different hydrostatic environments. In addition, the positive sinusoidal voltage-dependent electrical current relations with the nonlinearity factors of ∼1.0 manifested the Ohmic response of CuInP 2 Se 6 under high pressure conditions. Meantime, the disappearance of the P 1 Raman peak and the discontinuities in Raman shifts and full width at half-maximums offered robust evidence on the occurrence of ferroelectric crossover in CuInP 2 Se 6 . It is the first time that the phase boundary from the mixed antiferroelectric and ferroelectric (FE) orderings into the FE state of CuInP 2 Se 6 is well established [i.e., T C (K) = 165.5 P (GPa) + 292.1] under the conditions of 298–873 K and 0.4–40.3 GPa.

  abstract = {The ladder-type population transfer of the HF molecule steered by four-color harmonic laser pulses (HLPs) is investigated using the time-dependent quantum wave packet method. It is found that although there exist large background excitations and many (resonant) transition pathways during the driving, nearly 100% of the population could be transferred to the target state. In particular, such a process could be coherently controlled by changing the phases of the four HLPs, especially the phases of the fundamental and second HLPs, which can be accounted for in large part by the combined effects of the corresponding transition pathways and the maximal amplitude of the total electric field. However, for manipulating the phases of the third and fourth HLPs, both the changes in the maximal electric field amplitude and the asymmetry size fail to guide the variation of the target-state population because of the correlated effects of all these transition pathways, particularly the ones that do not contain the third and fourth HLP excitations. Importantly, our results also denote that the variation of the maximal electric field amplitude may give a well qualitative prediction about the phase-controlled population when the manipulated phase is directly related to all the transition pathways, which is the general case in the widely used two-color scheme. In addition, the maximal amplitude of the total electric field tends to play a more important role than its asymmetry size in the phase-controlled population transfer process.},

  abstract = {Manganese is one of the most intriguing elements showing multiple magnetic phases. In order to shed some light on the complex behavior, the manganese dimer has been the focus of extensive interest in theoretical research. Various quantum techniques have been utilized to comprehend the characteristics of the Mn dimer. Several approaches and functionals have been employed that suggest that the ferromagnetic (FM) state is its lowest energy configuration. Nevertheless, these findings are inconsistent with the experimental results showing that Mn 2 has an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Σ g + 1 configuration at an interatomic Mn–Mn distance of d Mn–Mn = 3.40 Å. This work presents a comparative assessment of outcomes obtained through several levels of the exchange–correlation functional: generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, GGA+ U , and the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06), the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 0, and the Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr. The results of our investigation are discussed based on previous theoretical and experimental reports. We found that the best description is obtained with the hybrid HSE06 functional. The Mn 2 has a FM coupling at short distances and the characteristic AFM Σ g + 1 state at d Mn–Mn = 3.27 Å. Furthermore, we obtained a magnetic moment ( μ ) per Mn atom of μ = 4.527 μ B , a stretching frequency of ω = 80 cm −1 , and a binding energy of E b = −195 meV, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.},

By means of dedicated annealing procedures, relative concentration dependencies, and a specialized dual inlet deposition procedure enabling complexation between specific isotopically substituted subunits, the present work identifies the intramolecular vibrational transitions experimentally for these three isotopologues of the binary complex and the most stable cyclic conformations of selectively deuterated mixed (HCl) m (H 2 O) n ( m + n ≤ 4) cluster molecules embedded in inert neon “quantum matrices” at 4 K. The vibrational assignments up to mixed ternary cluster molecules are supported by harmonic CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12 frequency predictions in conjunction with anharmonic corrections employing second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. While the assigned O–H and O–D stretching transitions in neon are systematically spectrally redshifted by 0.2%–0.5% relative to previously reported observations in supersonic jets, the assigned H–Cl and D–Cl stretching transitions all reveal anomalous excessive spectral redshifts in neon increasing with the size of the cluster molecules. These cluster-size dependent excessive H–Cl/D–Cl spectral redshifts in neon indicate that the extent of charge transfer is enhanced strongly with the complexation of an increasing number of H 2 O molecules as predicted by quantum chemical models for more than a decade.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging are well-established techniques to acquire diverse molecular information, while their potential applications remain limited due to low sensitivity. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) is one of the promising methods to solve this issue, and numerous studies have been conducted to understand its physical mechanism using a particular combination of a dye and a quencher of interest. However, the research across multiple dye–quencher combinations remains largely unexplored. Here, we explore plenty of dye–quencher combinations and reveal that not only the electron transfer process but also the optimal value of the g -value difference (Δ g ), considerably affected by the escape process of a radical pair, plays a key role in maximizing the enhancement of the NMR signal by photo-CIDNP. The combinations of 115 quenchers with several dyes were experimentally investigated, and 36 photo-CIDNP active quenchers were revealed. Exploration of many different dye–quencher combinations with four dyes revealed that molecular diffusion significantly affects the Δ g dependence of photo-CIDNP enhancement of each dye. These findings provide important insights into pioneering new dye–quencher combinations suitable for biological and medical applications.},

  abstract = {In the present work, an analytical full-dimensional potential energy surface, PES-2024, was developed for the first time, describing the polyatomic OH + CH 3 SH gas-phase reaction. This reaction presents some intrinsic difficulties, such as 18 degrees of freedom; two possible reactive channels; methyl- and thiol-H abstraction reactions, (R1) and (R2), respectively; and the presence of intermediate complexes in the entrance and exit channels. In the valence bond-molecular mechanics, VB-MM, framework, we have developed this potential based on a reduced number of high-level ab initio calculations, the input data. The new PES has been subjected to a series of stringent tests. PES-2024 simultaneously describes both (R1) and (R2) reaction paths, forming the water molecule and describing reasonably the topology of the reaction: high exothermicities, low barriers, and the presence of intermediate complexes. Based on this surface, quasi-classical trajectory calculations were performed at room temperature for both paths, with special emphasis on the H 2 O(v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ) product stretching (v 1 and v 3 modes) and bending (v 2 mode) vibrational excitations, comparing the results with the recent experimental evidence. The available energy was mostly deposited as water vibrational energy, 44% and 47%, respectively, simulating the experimental evidence. These detailed state-to-state results lend confidence to the new surface.},

Lett. 13 , 10912 (2022)] using Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) techniques. Our calculations utilize a highly accurate full-dimensional H 2 + He interaction potential with diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction appropriate for HD and D 2 isotopomers. The results show that rotational quenching of HD from j = 2 → j ′ = 0 in v = 2, j = 2 → j ′ = 1 in v = 2 and v = 4, and j = 4 → j ′ = 3 in v = 4 is dominated by an l = 1 shape resonance located between 0.1 and 1.0 cm −1 . For collision energies less than 0.1 cm −1 , isotropic scattering prevails. An l = 1 resonance centered around 0.02 cm −1 is also found to dominate the j = 2 → j ′ = 0 and j = 4 → j ′ = 2 transitions in v = 4 for He–D 2 collisions consistent with our prior studies of Δ j = −2 transition in He + D 2 ( v = 2, j = 2) collisions. Our analysis does not support the hypothesis of Perreault et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 13 , 10912 (2022)] that a strong l = 2 resonance controls the angular distribution for Δ j = −2 transition for both systems. Despite improvements in the development of the potential energy surface, a good agreement with SARP experiments for v = 2 is achieved only when contributions from collision energies less than 1.0 cm −1 were excluded in the computation of velocity averaged differential rate coefficients for both systems. This could be due to some uncertainties in the velocity spread in the experiment that employs co-propagation of the collision partners and possibly, the neglect of transverse velocities in the simulation of the experiment.},

Our analysis includes not only electronic populations but also additional electronic and nuclear properties in position and momentum space. For both DMABN and fulvene, the recently developed CCTTSH algorithm successfully resolves the internal inconsistencies of coupled-trajectory Tully surface hopping. Instead, we find that DMABN highlights a significant weakness of CTMQC, which arises when the trajectories remain for a long time in the vicinity of a region of strong nonadiabaticity.},

We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long-times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. We identify an exceptional point that indicates the onset of broken symmetry between an unsynchronized and synchronized dynamical phase of the system as correlations within the environment are increased. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.},

We present here a numerically stable formulation of the Resonating Hartree–Fock (ResHF) method that uses the matrix adjugate to remove numerical instabilities arising from nearly orthogonal orbitals, and as a result, we demonstrate improvements to ResHF wavefunction optimization. We then benchmark the performance of ResHF against complete active space self-consistent field in the avoided crossing of LiF, the torsional rotation of ethene, and the singlet–triplet energy gaps of a selection of small molecules. ResHF is a promising excited state method because it incorporates the orbital relaxation of state-specific methods, while retaining the correct state crossings of state-averaged approaches. Our open-source ResHF implementation, yucca, is available on GitLab.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of polymer properties using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations requires a properly relaxed starting structure. Polymer models built from scratch by specialized algorithms (self-avoiding random walk, Monte Carlo, etc.) are far from relaxed and, moreover, often possess a large number of structural defects: close contacts between atoms, wrong bond distances, voids, unfavorable molecular conformations or packing, etc. This is especially problematic for ring-containing polymers whose initial structures also include ring spearing (bonds passing through cycles, including benzene rings). All these defects must be eliminated before running an MD simulation to correctly predict polymer properties. Short MD simulations can be enough to remove close contacts; however, ring spearing elimination and general structure relaxation cannot be achieved this way. In this work, we propose α-Replica Exchange MD (α-REMD)–a Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD protocol that reliably eliminates ring spearing defects and performs a general relaxation of the system. Its efficiency is demonstrated on five polyethersulfones whose initial geometries contained numerous ring intersections that were completely removed by α-REMD.},

We extend a number of physical concepts at the core of Kohn–Sham DFT, such as density representability, to the matrix density functional. In this work, we establish the existence of the universal matrix functional for many states as a proper generalization of the Lieb universal functional for the ground state. Consequently, the variation principle of MSDFT can be rigorously defined within an appropriate domain of matrix densities, thereby providing a solid framework for DFT of both the ground state and excited states. We further show that the analytical structure of the Hamiltonian matrix functional is considerably constrained by the subspace symmetry and invariance properties, requiring and ensuring that all elements of the Hamiltonian matrix functional are variationally optimized in a coherent manner until the Hamiltonian matrix within the subspace spanned by the lowest eigenstates is obtained. This work solidifies the theoretical foundation to treat multiple electronic states using density functional theory.},

The effects are shown for propane and diethyl ether as representative examples of potential hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, but the findings of this work are equally applicable to other multispin systems in the liquid or gas phase. These results are relevant to both adiabatic longitudinal transport after dissociation engenders net alignment (ALTADENA) experiments (where 1 H nuclei are polarized) and MFC protocols used to transfer parahydrogen spin order to a heteronucleus such as 13 C. The investigated effects should be incorporated for a correct evaluation of both the maximum possible NMR signal enhancement and the pairwise selectivity, which are useful in the context of mechanistic studies in the field of catalytic hydrogenation. Among signal enhancement damping factors in ALTADENA, such as T 1 relaxation and insufficient adiabaticity of a field sweep, the inherent loss of net magnetization in spin systems containing magnetically equivalent protons (especially in PHIP systems commonly used for mechanistic studies such as propene or propane) has not been thoroughly considered and needs to be clarified. The maximum possible net magnetization in ALTADENA for diethyl ether and propane was shown to be ∑|⟨I iz ⟩| ≈ 0.56 for diethyl ether and ∑|⟨I iz ⟩| ≈ 0.45 for propane, respectively. The inherent loss of net heteronuclear magnetization of the same order of magnitude with an increase in the number of magnetically equivalent protons was also demonstrated for A m M n X-type spin systems.},

  abstract = {Membrane protein folding in the viscous microenvironment of a lipid bilayer is an inherently slow process that challenges experiments and computational efforts alike. The folding kinetics is moreover associated with topological modulations of the biological milieu. Studying such structural changes in membrane-embedded proteins and understanding the associated topological signatures in membrane leaflets, therefore, remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we first aim to estimate the free energy barrier and the minimum free energy path (MFEP) connecting the membrane-embedded fully and partially inserted states of the bacteriorhodopsin fragment. To achieve this, we have considered independent sets of simulations from membrane-mimicking and membrane-embedded environments, respectively. An autoencoder model is used to elicit state-distinguishable collective variables for the system utilizing membrane-mimicking simulations. Our in-house Expectation Maximized Molecular Dynamics algorithm is initially used to deduce the barrier height between the two membrane-embedded states. Next, we develop the Geometry Optimized Local Direction search as a post-processing algorithm to identify the MFEP and the corresponding peptide conformations from the autoencoder-projected trajectories. Finally, we apply a graph attention neural network (GAT) model to learn the membrane surface topology as a function of the associated peptide structure, supervised by the membrane-embedded simulations. The resultant GAT model is then utilized to predict the membrane leaflet topology for the peptide structures along MFEP, obtained from membrane-mimicking simulations.

  abstract = {Intermolecular charge-transfer (xCT) excited states important for various practical applications are challenging for many standard computational methods. It is highly desirable to have an affordable method that can treat xCT states accurately. In the present work, we extend our self-consistent perturbation methods, named one-body second-order Møller–Plesset and its spin-opposite scaling variant (O2BMP2), for excited states without additional costs to the ground state. We then assessed their performance for the prediction of xCT excitation energies. Thanks to self-consistency, our methods yield small errors relative to high-level coupled cluster methods and outperform other same scaling ( N 5 ) methods, such as CC2 and ADC(2). In particular, O2BMP2, whose scaling can be reduced to N 4 , can even reach the accuracy of CC3 ( N 7 ) with errors less than 0.1 eV. This method is thus highly promising for treating xCT states in large compounds vital for applications.},

This method improves the quality of configuration space than other Langevin dynamics methods. However, it encounters issues in pressure evaluation due to inaccuracies in momentum space. In particular, the conventional approach for calculating kinetic temperature using the full-time step momentum introduces errors proportional to the square of the time step (Δ t 2 ), leading to unreliable results when employing a large time step under isothermal–isobaric conditions. By calculating kinetic energy using the half-time step momentum in pressure evaluation, we can reduce the numerical errors. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using our refined pressure evaluation and improved accuracy and stability in the isothermal–isobaric MD simulations even with a long time step (Δ t = 5 fs).},

  abstract = {The presence of spin and spatial symmetry breaking upon variational optimization of mean-field wavefunctions is known to be an indicator of nondynamical electron correlation. However, a single mean-field wavefunction may not have sufficient flexibility to flag the correlated orbital space where there are multiple correlation mechanisms present. In such situations, there are multiple nearly degenerate self-consistent field solutions that describe different correlation mechanisms, but it is often not possible to know a priori when such situations will occur or if sufficient solutions have been obtained. In this work, we examine the role of spin and spatial symmetries of nonorthogonal multiconfigurational self-consistent field (NOMCSCF) calculations in revealing correlation mechanisms. We provide details of the theory for optimization of NOMCSCF wavefunctions with desired symmetries, establish which types of symmetries recover the most correlation energy when the symmetry constraints are relaxed, and discuss how the different-orbitals for different-configuration wavefunctions reveal the different correlation mechanisms present.},

  abstract = {Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is a powerful polymer field-theoretic simulation tool that plays a crucial role in the study of block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly. However, the computational cost of implementing SCFT simulations is comparatively high, particularly in computationally demanding applications where repeated forward simulations are needed. Herein, we propose a deep learning-based method to accelerate the SCFT simulations. By directly mapping early SCFT results to equilibrium structures using a deep neural network (DNN), this method bypasses most of the time-consuming SCFT iterations, significantly reducing the simulation time. We first applied this method to two- and three-dimensional large-cell bulk system simulations. Both results demonstrate that a DNN can be trained to predict equilibrium states based on early iteration outputs accurately. The number of early SCFT iterations can be tailored to optimize the trade-off between computational speed and predictive accuracy. The effect of training set size on DNN performance was also examined, offering guidance on minimizing dataset generation costs. Furthermore, we applied this method to the more computationally demanding inverse directed self-assembly-lithography problem. A covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy-based inverse design method was proposed. By replacing the forward simulation model in this method with a trained DNN, we were able to determine the guiding template shapes that direct the BCP to self-assemble into the target structure with certain constraints, eliminating the need for any SCFT simulations. This improved the inverse design efficiency by a factor of 100, and the computational cost for training the network can be easily averaged out over repeated tasks.},

By applying the present theory to the C–N stretching vibrations of several nitrile compounds, our estimated frequency fluctuation scale and bandwidth shift by changing solvent kinds reproduced the experimental data. Furthermore, we regard the standard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random variables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the dominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the vibrational axis. In addition, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential become spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with the solute. The development of the solvation field confirms that the nonuniformity of the electrostatic field is crucial to the frequency fluctuations.},

  abstract = {We consider an open one-dimensional spin-crossover chain, in which each site can be in either a low spin (LS) or a high spin (HS) state. The sites interact elastically through nearest neighbor (nn) and next-nearest neighbor (nnn) springs with local equilibrium distances depending on the spin states. The system’s Hamiltonian is solved numerically using the Monte Carlo method, applied on both spin states and atomic displacements. This study focuses on the investigations of the isothermal relaxation of a photoinduced HS metastable chain, by analyzing the interplay between the electronic and structural properties along this process. The obtained results indicate that the nucleation and growth mechanisms of LS domains during relaxation are significantly influenced by the amplitude of the intermolecular interactions. Thus, increasing the latter reduces the number of HS/LS clusters due to the high cost of stored elastic energy at HS/LS interfaces. In the second part, we inject an elastic frustration between the equilibrium nn and nnn bond lengths, resulting in the emergence of two distinct relaxation regimes, which depend on the frustration rate, ξ . A detailed analysis of the effect of ξ on the isothermal HS to LS relaxation reveals the stabilization of rich intermediate self-organized electronic structures with long lifetime along this process. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate that the shape of the relaxation curves transforms from a continuous to a two-step behavior, which is reminiscent of the thermal dependence of the order parameters of such models in equilibrium thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls—mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material—that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. In addition, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.},

  abstract = {Semi-flexible polymers, such as actin filaments, can deform the shape of membrane when confined in a membrane vesicle, playing an important role in biological processes. Here, we use dynamic Monte Carlo simulations to study an active polymer chain confined in a membrane vesicle. For flexible polymer chains, the membrane shape is governed by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and polymer activity. Stiff membrane is unaffected by small active forces, but moderate forces cause the polymer to alternate between stretched and disordered configurations, increasing the asphericity of both the polymer and the vesicle. For semi-flexible polymer chains, their stiffness can significantly impact both the vesicle and polymer shapes. We identify distinct classes of configurations that emerge as a function of polymer stiffness, membrane bending rigidity, and polymer activity. A weak polymer activity can cause the polymer to align along its contour, effectively increasing its stiffness. However, a moderate polymer activity softens the polymer chain. For membranes with low bending rigidities κ , large-scale deformations, such as wormlike or tadpole-shaped vesicles, appear at a weak polymer activity and high polymer stiffness. In the wormlike configuration, the polymer chain adopts a hairpin configuration to minimize the polymer bending energy. As the polymer stiffness increases, a tadpole-like vesicle forms, with part of the polymer deforming the membrane into a protrusion while the rest remaining confined in a bud-like structure. For stiffer membranes, we observe oblate vesicles containing toroidal polymer chains, resulting from the high cost of membrane bending energy. A moderate polymer activity causes the softening of the polymer chain, leading to a nearly spherical vesicle with slight shape fluctuation. We further characterize the order parameter of toroidal polymer chains in oblate vesicles and reveal that a slight increase in polymer activity leads to a more ordered helical structure of polymer chains.},

In this study, we employ a combined approach of density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green’s function methods to analyze the influence of an external bias on the properties of water adsorbed on Au(111) and Pd(111) metallic electrodes. Our results demonstrate that while both Au and Pd-electrodes induce qualitatively similar structural responses in adsorbed water molecules, the quantitative differences are substantial, driven by the distinct nature of water–metal bonding. Our findings underscore the necessity of quantum-mechanical modeling for accurately describing electrochemical interfaces.},

  abstract = {2D porous material supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) have demonstrated great potential for CO 2 separation and purification, outperforming the original porous material. However, the working mechanism behind their enhanced CO 2 selectivity remains unclear. In this study, we have conducted molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the CO 2 /N 2 separation performance and the underlying mechanism of SILMs taking 2D rhombic N-graphdiyne (r-N-GDY) with intrinsic high thermal stability and porous structure covered with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the representative SILM model. We found that the increase in the SILM thickness can decrease the permeance of CO 2 and N 2 but can effectively increase the CO 2 /N 2 selectivity. The optimal SILM thickness is found to be 0.6 nm with the permeance reaching 5.7 × 10 5 GPU for CO 2 and the selectivity being up to 25.8, which is 15 times higher than the 1.7 of bare r-N-GDY. This is because CO 2 encounters a much lower transmembrane energy barrier than N 2 . At the molecular level, it is fascinating to observe a cation-gating mechanism, where IL cations play a determinative role in CO 2 selectivity. More specifically, the IL cations normally bind at the pore site, like a closed gate for gas. When a CO 2 molecule approaches the pore, the IL cation moves away; thus, the gate is opened for CO 2 translocation. In contrast, N 2 molecules are incapable of opening the cation gate. Such a cation-gating process guarantees the high selectivity of SILMs. This study offers insight into enhanced CO 2 selectivity and provides theoretical guidance for designing nanocomposite membranes for gas or water treatment.},

  abstract = {Random ternary polymerization is a strategy for tuning the energy levels and improving the batch-to-batch reproducibility of polymer semiconductors for the application in polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, the influence of third component incorporation on exciton properties and charge photogeneration processes in terpolymer-based solar cells is still unclear. In this work, time-resolved spectroscopies were employed to study exciton properties and charge photogeneration processes in PSCs based on a series of terpolymers, PM1 and PM2, which have 20% and 50% of thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) building blocks on the PM6 backbone, respectively. For neat terpolymer films, we found that the small amount (20%) of TTz incorporation in PM6 slightly reduces the exciton diffusion coefficient, but the exciton lifetime is significantly increased, resulting in a significant increase in exciton diffusion length. However, further increasing the TTz component (50%) in the PM6 backbone decreases exciton lifetime, the diffusion coefficient, and consequently exciton diffusion length. We found that a small amount of acceptor (Y6) addition can efficiently dissociate terpolymer excitons due to the weak molecular stacking of terpolymers in the blend films. For terpolymer:Y6-based blend films, we find that the small amount of TTz incorporation (PM1) could reduce the phase size of the donor and suppress bimolecular carrier recombination in blend films. Furthermore, we find that the energy level offset plays a critical role in charge photogeneration processes, and a HOMO energy level offset of 0.06 eV can dissociate acceptor excitons in terpolymer-based organic solar cells effectively.},

  abstract = {Ionic current rectification (ICR) induced by electroosmotic flow (EOF) under concentration gradients can find many applications in micro/nanofluidic sensing and ionic circuits. Here, we focused on the cases with micropores of moderate length–diameter ratios. Through experimental research and systematic simulations, the EOF-induced ICR was found to exhibit voltage-dependent ratios. In the considered cases with a weak EOF or strong ionic diffusion, a large deviation appears between the ion concentration inside the micropore and the bulk value, which fails the prediction by solution conductivity gradients. Based on our simulation results, effective equations were developed for the theoretical description of ion concentration distributions along the micropore axis under a coupled concentration gradient and electric field. With the predicted ion distributions inside micropores, the ICR ratio can be conveniently calculated using the derived electrical resistance of the microfluidic system, which applies to micropores of 200–1000 nm in diameter. Because the surface charge density is the only unknown input parameter, our developed equations can be used to evaluate the surface charge density of micropores using the measured EOF-induced ICR ratio under concentration gradients.},

  abstract = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable performance advancements over the past decade. In inverted p–i–n PSCs, commonly utilized electron transport layers (ETL), such as C 60 and PCBM, are associated with notable stability challenges and high production costs. This study reports on a novel and highly stable perovskite solar cell that employs iron-doped zinc oxide (FZO) nanoparticles as the ETL and nickel oxide (NiO x ) as the hole transport layer, demonstrating a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼12%. In comparison with PSCs that utilize zinc oxide (ZnO) as the ETL, those incorporating FZO demonstrated a maximum PCE enhancement of 18.3%. The incorporation of iron doping mitigates the basicity of the ZnO ETL, thereby reducing the deprotonation at the FZO/perovskite interface and enhancing the stability of the PSCs. The unpackaged FZO device maintained an initial PCE of 90% after 400 h at a relative humidity of 45% ± 5%. (2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid and 2-phenylethylamine hydroiodide were used to passivate the NiO x /perovskite and perovskite/ZnO(FZO) interfaces, respectively, which further improved the PSC performance. Ultimately, FZO-based PSCs with a PCE of 13.65%, an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.04 V, a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of 20.79, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.1% were obtained, and the PCE demonstrated a notable increase of over 35% compared to pristine ZnO-based devices. Results indicate that high device performance, low fabrication costs, and excellent stability can be attained through the use of simple chemically synthesized oxides as inorganic selective charge transport layers in PSCs.},

The accuracy with which these parameters can be determined from the static spectra [CsAlH 4 ( o ): C Q = (1.42 ± 0.01) MHz, η = (0.62 ± 0.01) and CsAlH 4 ( t ): C Q = (1.43 ± 0.02) MHz, η &lt; 0.03] seems to be slightly higher than via the MAS approach. The experimentally determined parameters ( δ iso , C Q , and η ) are compared with those obtained from DFT-GIPAW (density functional theory—gauge-including projected augmented wave) calculations. When using DFT-optimized structures, the magnitude of the quadrupole coupling constant is overestimated by about 45% for both polymorphs. Further calculations in which the geometry of the AlH 4 tetrahedra is varied show a high sensitivity of C Q to the H–Al–H angles. Modest changes in the angles on the order of one to three degrees are sufficient to achieve a near-perfect agreement between GIPAW calculations and experiments. The deviations found for the DFT-optimized structures are explained with the neglect of thermal motion, which typically leads to a reduction in the distortion of the AlH 4 tetrahedra. From a broader perspective, the uncertainty in the positions of the hydrogen atoms renders the accurate reproduction or prediction of quadrupole coupling constants for aluminum hydrides challenging.},

Here, we present an analysis of both shear and bulk viscosity, calculated from molecular dynamics simulations via the Green–Kubo relations, for over 140 small molecular Newtonian liquids from the Virtual Chemistry database.

The physical explanation of this phenomenon stems from the emergence of gradients in the tangential pressure due to the presence of a confining surface. The microscopic origin of the effect has recently been elucidated in the framework of linear response theory. Here, by use of conservation laws, we provide an explicit solution of the equations governing the fluid flow at stationarity in slab geometry, expressing the thermo-osmotic coefficient as the integrated mass current–heat current correlation function (which vanishes in the bulk). A very simple expression for the pressure gradient in terms of equilibrium properties is also derived. To test the theoretical predictions in a controlled setting, we performed extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions. Few simple models of wall–particle interactions are examined, and the resulting pressure drop and velocity profile are compared with the theoretical predictions both in the liquid regime and in the gas regime.},

While most previous studies have focused on single-mode photonic or plasmonic cavities, here we investigate the effect of hybrid metallodielectric cavities on photoisomerization reactions. Hybrid cavities, which support both photonic and plasmonic modes, offer unique opportunities that arise from the interplay between these two distinct types of modes. In particular, we demonstrate that interference in the spectral density due to a narrow photonic mode and a broad plasmonic mode that are coupled to each other enables hybrid cavities to provide an energy-selective Purcell effect. This effect enhances electronic relaxation only to the desired molecular geometry, providing the ability to increase the yield of photoisomerization reactions. As a test case, we study the asymmetric proton transfer reaction in the electronically excited state of 3-aminoacrolein. Our results, which are robust for a range of realistic cavity parameters, highlight the advantages of hybrid cavities in cavity-induced photochemical processes.},

In this work, an integrated theoretical–computational, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and vibrational characterization of both bis-TCH and bis-CH anions in a non-protic solvent (dimethylsulfoxide) is presented to better elucidate their properties. Their protonic NMR spectra underline the presence of cis – trans , EE isomers, characterized by a significant conformational freedom at room temperature. The presence of oxygen or sulfur heteroatoms can tune the molecular conformational dynamics driving a different interaction with the solvent, as highlighted by density functional theory calculations and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that a quantitative agreement with the NMR and Raman signals is achieved only when an explicit solvent description is included.

  abstract = {Free-jet atomic, cluster, and molecular sources are typically used to produce beams of low-energy, neutral particles and find application in a wide array of technologies, from neutral atom microscopes to instruments for surface processing. We present a simple analytical theory that is applicable to many of these sources, when (i) the nozzle-skimmer distance is such that free molecular flow is achieved and (ii) there is negligible interference within the skimmer itself. The utility of the model is demonstrated by comparing experimental data with calculations performed using the theory. In particular, we show that skimmer interference is negligible compared to attenuation by “background” gas for room-temperature beams. Our treatment does not depend on any free parameters and obviates the complexity of previous theories. As a result, we are able to devise a number of design recommendations to minimize interference in sources operating with cryogenic-temperature beams.},

  abstract = {The nanoscale host–guest interactions between a symmetry broken carbonaceous nanohoop TP-[11]cycloparaphenylene (TP-[11]CPP) and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) C 82 Gd were explored by using density functional theory calculations. The geometry mutual-matching between TP-[11]CPP and C 82 Gd is perfect, and the two main configurations of TP-[11]CPP@C 82 Gd host–guest complexes could be formed spontaneously with high binding energies. Interestingly, the position of the Gd atom in the C 82 cage can be adjusted by its external host molecule. The binding strength depends on the structure of the host, but the binding thermodynamics is decided by the structure of the fullerene cage. The selective binding of empty cage C 82 from its mixture with EMF C 82 Gd is discussed by using a standard Boltzmann expression of statistical thermodynamics. In addition, the FT-IR and UV–visible spectra are simulated, host–guest noncovalent interaction regions are investigated based on the electron density and reduced density gradient, and magnetic susceptibility is preliminarily investigated, which may be helpful for a deep understanding of the present host–guest systems in the future. It is anticipated that such a theoretical calculation regarding to carbonaceous nanosize host–guest structures would be a driven force for the developments of novel nanohoop@EMF systems in functional materials, nonchromatographic separation and even nano single molecular electret devices.},

  abstract = {Chiral transfer and chiral switch in the bilayer of achiral vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) on Cd(0001) have been investigated with low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In the monolayer regime, the VOPc molecules form a self-assembled layer consisting of periodic chiral voids. Further deposition of VOPc leads to the bilayer formation with an O-up top layer and an O-down bottom layer. High-resolution STM images demonstrate that not only single-molecule chirality but also organizational chirality is transferred from the underlying chiral voids to the top layer. The organizational chirality of the top layer manifests as chiral windmill protrusions, distinct from the chiral voids of the bottom layer. After annealing the bilayer to 310 K, strain is relaxed in the form of a mass density wave (MDW). In particular, the organizational chirality inside MDW domains is opposite to that outside the domains, indicating a chiral switch takes place after the strain relaxation.},

Recent studies have extensively investigated triplet states to circumvent limitations imposed by spin statistics in organic light-emitting diodes. Room-temperature electrophosphorescence and electrofluorescence have previously been observed in thienyl-substituted phenazines without heavy metals; however, phosphorescence was absent when spin density was localized on the thiophene units, despite the expected heavy-atom effect from the sulfur atom. In this study, we investigate the spin dynamics of thiophene-fused π-systems lacking phenazine units to enable the effective utilization of triplet states in thiophene-containing π-systems. This investigation reveals delayed emission in the excited dimers of fused thiophenes, likely associated with triplet–triplet annihilation. Optical and EPR measurements, together with quantum chemical calculations, indicate that the fused thiophenes form head-to-tail dimers in both the ground and excited states.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel signal enhancement technique, termed steadyDFS, for quadrupolar solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It can substantially increase the performance of double frequency sweeps (DFSs) for all half-integer quadrupolar spins ( I = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2, and 9/2). In steadyDFS, the DFS and readout pulse are repeated multiple times with a repetition time of T R,DFS to generate a steady state that provides substantial sensitivity enhancement. Using a series of simulations, we show that steadyDFS can outperform conventional DFS methods, and enhancements per unit time of ∼5 to 21 can be achieved depending on the value of I . The sensitivity of steadyDFS is robust toward changes in repetition times and quadrupolar relaxation rates of the system. Moreover, steadyDFS is highly modular and can be combined with quadrupolar Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (QCPMG) detection. Using 39 K ( I = 3/2), 17 O ( I = 5/2), and 49 Ti ( I = 7/2) as representative challenging nuclei, we show that enhancements up to 46× can be realized experimentally via steadyDFS-QCPMG, translating to a 20× enhancement per unit time. We applied steadyDFS-QCPMG to protonated and deprotonated samples, as well as to samples with a diverse range of transverse relaxation times (i.e., T 2 / T 2 *), where steadyDFS-QCPMG can provide an enhancement per unit time of at least 7. For samples that are not amendable to QCPMG, we explored the use of steady-state free precession (SSFP). Although SSFP is fundamentally incompatible with steadyDFS, we show that beneficial results can be obtained when DFSs are combined with SSFP in an interruptive manner.},

A pulsed helium Laval nozzle with a Mach number of 6 was employed, achieving a temperature of 23 ± 3 K and a density of (2.0 ± 0.4) × 10 16 molecule cm −3 . The second-order rate coefficient for the reaction between the methylidyne radical (CH) and propene (C 3 H 6 ) at 23(3) K was determined to be (3.4 ± 0.6) × 10 −10 cm 3 molecule −1 s −1 using LIF kinetics measurements. VUV (118.27 nm) photoionization ReTOFMS detected a dominant product channel, CH + C 3 H 6 → C 4 H 6 + H, without isomer identification. Another less intense mass peak at m/z 53 was also observed, which could either result from the dissociative ionization of the energized C 4 H 6 primary products or indicate another product channel, C 4 H 5 + H 2 . Given the presence of CH and C 3 H 6 in cold molecular clouds (e.g., TMC-1, Lupus-1a, L1495B, L1521F, and Serpens South 1a), it is predicted that these products can exist in low-temperature interstellar environments.},

  abstract = {We introduce an approach to describe fractional charging of molecules interacting non-covalently with their environment. The formalism is based on dividing the full orbital space into orbitals localized to the molecule and orbitals localized to the environment. This enables a separation of the full electronic Hamiltonian into terms referencing only molecule, environment, or interaction terms. The interaction terms are divided into particle-conserving interactions and particle-non-conserving (particle-breaking) interactions. The particle-conserving interactions are dominant and may be included using standard embedding schemes. The particle-breaking terms are responsible for inducing fractional charging, and we show that the local orbital space approach provides a convenient framework for different types of perturbative treatments. In the local orbital basis, we generate a basis of many-electron states for the composite system, in which a specific molecular charge may label each state. This basis is used to construct a projection operator acting on the Liouville–von Neumann equation for the composite system to yield an equation for the reduced density matrix for the molecule. The diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix represent populations of different molecular charge states and determine the fractional charging. The projected Liouville–von Neumann equation is the starting point for two perturbative treatments: damped response theory and Redfield theory. The damped response framework introduces energy broadening of electronic states. Phenomenological broadening is also introduced into the Redfield equation. We illustrate the presented formalism by considering benzene physisorbed on a finite graphene sheet as a toy model.},

We apply three types of energy terms for this purpose: short-range potentials are derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of wildtype and methylated chromatosomes, which revealed subtle local changes; medium-range potentials are derived by incorporating contacts between HP1 and nucleosomes modified by H3K9me3, to incorporate experimental results of enhanced contacts for short chromatin fibers (12 nucleosomes); for long-range interactions we identify H3K9me3- and H3K27me3-associated contacts based on Hi-C maps with a machine learning approach. These combined multiscale effects can model methylation as a first approximation in our mesoscale chromatin model, and applications to gene systems offer new insights into the epigenetic regulation of genomes mediated by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.},

Through a comparative analysis of excitation energy calculations across a diverse set of molecules and wavefunction methods, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of the third-order CPS(D) model, CPS(D-3), in calculating excitation energies.

This leads to analytical path integral expressions for the Dicke model, as well as its extensions that incorporate effects of static disorder and coupling to intramolecular vibrational degrees of freedom. The hierarchical equations of motion are then derived to simulate polariton dynamics and absorption spectra. By further taking advantage of the harmonic nature of both the system and the effective bath, an efficient exact diagonalization method is also obtained. Similar results are also obtained for the Tavis–Cummings model, the rotating-wave approximation of the Dicke model. Utilizing these theoretical findings, we simulate the polariton dynamics and absorption spectra and analyze the critical coupling strength for the superradiant transition in the presence of static disorder and coupling to intramolecular vibrational motion.},

Electronic structure calculations are done using correlation consistent basis sets with multi-reference configuration interaction to map all the molecular electronic states below the ion-dissociation limit as a function of the distance between the reacting species. Our electronic structure calculations have been significantly improved from our previous work [Liu et al. , J. Chem.

Non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements are calculated with the three-point central difference method near each avoided crossing to estimate the exact crossing point R x and coupling parameter H if , which are inputs to the multi-channel Landau–Zener theory to calculate the electron transition probability. Our approach is applied to estimate the mutual neutralization rate constants for the following ion pairs: Ar + –Cl − , Ar + –Br − , Ar + –I − at ∼133 Pa. Our predictions are compared against the experimental data reported by Shuman et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 140 , 044304 (2014)].

We find that modern DFT functionals can provide highly accurate charge densities, particularly in case of meta-generalized gradient approximations and hybrid functionals. In connection with Gaussian basis sets, it is necessary to use the largest basis sets available to obtain densities that are nearly free of basis set errors. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate computational methods for generating high-precision charge densities, which are, for instance, needed to generate reference data for training modern machine learned potentials.},

These electronic structure models yield two distinct classes of excited-state reaction pathways, with different quantum yields for the isomerization. This illustrates the significance of the potential energy surfaces when simulating photoexcited dynamics. The nature of the two reaction pathways is related to topographical features on the surfaces, suggesting potential “design rules” for chemical modification via substituent groups.

We benchmark ppRPA using various exchange-correlation functionals for 21 molecular systems and two point defect systems. Our results show that ppRPA with functionals containing appropriate amounts of exact exchange provides accuracy comparable to high-level wave function methods such as CCSDT and CASPT2, with significantly reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of ppRPA starting from an excited ( N − 2)-electron state calculated by ΔSCF for the first time, as well as its application to double excitations in bulk periodic systems. These findings suggest that ppRPA is a promising tool for the efficient calculation of double and partial double excitation energies in both molecular and bulk systems.},

  abstract = {In computational physics, chemistry, and biology, the implementation of new techniques in shared and open-source software lowers barriers to entry and promotes rapid scientific progress. However, effectively training new software users presents several challenges. Common methods like direct knowledge transfer and in-person workshops are limited in reach and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the benefits of online training, traditional online tutorials can quickly become outdated and may not cover all the software’s functionalities. To address these issues, here we introduce “PLUMED Tutorials,” a collaborative model for developing, sharing, and updating online tutorials. This initiative utilizes repository management and continuous integration to ensure compatibility with software updates. Moreover, the tutorials are interconnected to form a structured learning path and are enriched with automatic annotations to provide broader context. This paper illustrates the development, features, and advantages of PLUMED Tutorials, aiming to foster an open community for creating and sharing educational resources.},

Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact KS potential without resorting to the KS orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.},

  abstract = {The exact quantum dynamics of lattice models can be computationally intensive, especially when aiming for large system sizes and extended simulation times necessary to converge transport coefficients. By leveraging finite memory times to access long-time dynamics using only short-time data, generalized master equations can offer a route to simulating the dynamics of lattice problems efficiently. However, such simulations are limited to small lattices whose dynamics exhibit finite-size artifacts that contaminate transport coefficient predictions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel approach that exploits finite memory in both time and space to efficiently predict the many-body dynamics of dissipative lattice problems involving short-range interactions. This advance enables one to leverage the short-time dynamics of small lattices to nonperturbatively and exactly simulate arbitrarily large systems over long times. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by focusing on nonequilibrium polaron relaxation and transport in the dispersive Holstein model, successfully simulating lattice dynamics in one and two dimensions free from finite-size effects, thereby reducing the computational expense of such simulations by multiple orders of magnitude. Our method is broadly applicable and provides an accurate and efficient means to investigate nonequilibrium relaxation with microscopic resolution over mesoscopic length and time scales that are relevant to experiments.},

  abstract = {Magnesium atoms in liquid helium have been hypothesized to form a metastable foam structure, in which a layer of helium atoms surrounds each magnesium atom, inhibiting their coalescence into a compact cluster. This conjecture is based on the weak interaction between the magnesium atoms themselves and with the helium atoms and was used to explain observations in femtosecond two-photon ionization experiments by different groups. However, this theory is incongruent with previous infrared spectroscopic observations, indicating the formation of tightly bound clusters when different atoms and molecules combine inside liquid helium. In this paper, we report the spectra (from 210 to 2210 nm) of magnesium-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets at different averaged droplet sizes and number of dopants. The measured spectra in this study are consistent with the formation of compact magnesium clusters rather than the metastable foam structure.},

  abstract = {A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e., broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become “lumped” onto the same observable “state” or when introducing “reaction coordinates” to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this Perspective, we highlight why, in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.},

More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with δ -function potentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point interaction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first eigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first eigenvalue function , by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly and uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we also generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville problems to measure differential equations with non-trivial positive integrable weights, which provide the possibility of the further study of inverse spectral problems for more general measure differential equations.},

In particular, under the assumption of spatial translation invariance, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the von Neumann entropy for large subsystem lengths and prove that its leading order density is, in general, nonvanishing and displays the signature of a mixture of the independent thermal species underlying the right mover/left mover system. As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states.

The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when q is interpreted as an entropic parameter.

  abstract     = {We present a study of shearfree gravitational collapse using cylindrically symmetric spacetimes whose interior is a non-rotating dissipative fluid bounded by a cylindrical hypersurface beyond which is an Einstein–Rosen vacuum exterior. We consider three different pressure configurations: axially, azimuthally, and radially directed, for which we find new exact interior solutions of the field equations. We show that the matching conditions cannot be satisfied by the fluid with radial pressure, while the axial and azimuthal cases with a lapse function depending only on the time coordinate do satisfy these constraints. We derive, for both cases, a sufficient condition for an emission of gravitational radiation from the interior toward the exterior, Therefore we show that, at variance with what happens for spherical symmetry, in the simplified picture of an infinite cylinder of anisotropic shearfree matter, gravitational waves can be emitted during collapsing motion.},

  abstract     = {We investigate suitable, physically motivated conditions on spacetimes containing certain submanifolds - the so-called weakly trapped submanifolds - that ensure, in a set of neighboring metrics with respect to a convenient topology, that the phenomenon of nonspacelike geodesic incompleteness (i.e., the existence of singularities) is generic in a precise sense. We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold M , in the spirit of Lerner’s [Commun. Math. Phys. 32 , 19 (1973)], and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold Σ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite “large” in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when Σ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension. The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione’s [Indiana Univ. Math. J. 58 (4), 1797 (2009)] to obtain a true genericity of null geodesic incompleteness around suitable initial data sets containing MOTS.},

  abstract     = {We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel Φ is divisible, i.e., that there exists a non-trivial factorization Φ = Φ 1 Φ 2 . The idea is to first define an “elementary” channel Φ 2 and then to analyze when Φ Φ 2 − 1 is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way—which even yields an explicit factorization of Φ—is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors x , x ⊥ such that 〈 x ⊥ | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = 〈 x | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = { 0 } where K Φ is the Kraus subspace of Φ and K Φ ⊥ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application—if possible—results in a factorization of Φ into in some sense “simple” channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.},

Attention is focused on the interface between two intrinsic direct-gap semiconductors, especially when the gap is narrow. The motion of electrons in the semiconductors is analyzed in the framework of the Kane two-band theory. Conditions are formulated for the envelope wave functions of the electrons on the contact plane. They generalize the Ben Daniel–Duke boundary condition which was formerly derived in a different manner. (Ben Daniel and Duke used the standard Schrödinger equation as an equation of the second order while our conditions can concern an equation of the n -th order, with the possibility that n tends to infinity.)},

Bridging the gap between the general Cantor G C and Smith-Volterra-Cantor S V C systems, this novel potential offers a fresh perspective on Cantor-like potential systems within quantum mechanics that unify fractal and non-fractal potentials. Utilizing the Super Periodic Potential formalism, we derive the close form expression of the transmission probability T G ( k ). Notably, the system exhibits exceptionally sharp transmission resonances, a characteristic that distinguishes it from other quantum systems. Furthermore, the multifaceted transmission attributes of the SVC ρ , n are found to be critically dependent on both parameters, ρ and n , offering an intricate interplay that warrants deeper exploration. Our findings highlight a pronounced scaling behavior of reflection probability with k , which is underpinned by analytical derivations.},
