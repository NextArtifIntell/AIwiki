  abstract     = {Let k ∈ ( L 1 + L ∞ ) ( R n ) , where, as usual, L 1 ( R n ) denotes the class of Lebesgue-integrable functions on R n and L ∞ ( R n ) denotes the class of functions on R n that are Lebesgue-measurable and bounded almost everywhere. Given f ∈ ( L 1 ∩ L ∞ ) ( R n ) , set ( T k f ) ( x ) = ∫ R n k ( x − y ) f ( y ) d y , x ∈ R n . We study inequalities of the form ρ ( T k f ) ≤ C σ ( f ) , in which C &gt; 0 is independent of f ∈ ( L 1 ∩ L ∞ ) ( R n ) . The functionals ρ and σ are so-called rearrangement-invariant (r.i.) norms on M + ( R n ) , the class of nonnegative measurable functions on R n . Results first proved in the general context of r.i. norms are both specialized and expanded upon in the special case of Orlicz norms.},

  abstract     = {In this note, we present an abstract approach to study asymptotic orders for adaptive approximations with respect to a monotone set function J defined on dyadic cubes. We determine the exact upper order in terms of the critical value of the corresponding J -partition function, and we are able to provide upper and lower bounds in terms of fractal-geometric quantities. With properly chosen J , our new approach has applications in many different areas of mathematics, including the spectral theory of Kreĭn–Feller operators, quantisation dimensions of compactly supported probability measures, and the exact asymptotic order for Kolmogorov, Gel&#39;fand and linear widths for Sobolev embeddings into the Lebesgue space L ν p .},

  abstract     = {We investigate the close relation between certain weighted Sobolev spaces (Kondratiev spaces) and refined localization spaces from Triebel (2006), Triebel (2008). In particular, using a characterization for refined localization spaces from Scharf (2014), we considerably improve an embedding from Hansen (2013). This embedding is of special interest in connection with convergence rates for adaptive approximation schemes.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the point process 1 Z n ∏ 1 ≤ j &lt; k ≤ n | e i θ j + e i θ k | β ∏ j = 1 n d θ j , θ 1 , … , θ n ∈ ( − π , π ] , β &gt; 0 , where Z n is the normalization constant. This point process is attractive : it involves n dependent, uniformly distributed random variables on the unit circle that attract each other. (For comparison, the well-studied C β E involves n uniformly distributed random variables on the unit circle that repel each other.) We consider linear statistics of the form ∑ j = 1 n g ( θ j ) as n → ∞ , where g ∈ C 1 , q and 2 π -periodic. We prove that the leading order fluctuations around the mean are of order n and given by ( g ( U ) − ∫ − π π g ( θ ) d θ 2 π ) n , where U ∼ Uniform ( − π , π ] . We also prove that the subleading fluctuations around the mean are of order n and of the form N R ( 0 , 4 g ′ ( U ) 2 / β ) n , i.e. that the subleading fluctuations are given by a Gaussian random variable that itself has a random variance. Our proof uses techniques developed by McKay and Isaev (McKay, 1990; Isaev and McKay, 2018) to obtain asymptotics of related n -fold integrals.},
