  abstract     = {Collaborative strikes by unmanned aerial vehicle clusters (UAVCs) is becoming a key focus in the future air warfare, which can significantly enhance warfare effectiveness and reduce costs. To exactly describe the real battlefield scenarios, various heterogeneous strike-targets should be embedded. However, it will significantly increase the complexity of multi-constraint combinatorial optimization problem, thus the traditional genetic algorithm (GA) is difficult to solve efficiently due to its unchanged gene operator. In this paper, a dynamic parameters genetic algorithm has been proposed for UAVCs collaborative task allocation towards heterogeneous targets. Firstly, according to the differences of type, value, combat and defense, the heterogeneous strike-targets have been abstracted into strike target points and the UAVCs have been formulated into a set. Secondly, an innovative multiple unmanned aerial vehicles duplicate tasks orienteering problem (MUDTOP) model has been built to achieve multiple strikes on certain targets. Finally, the new triple-chromosome encoding and duplicate gene segments have been designed, and a novel genetic algorithm called DPGA-TEDG has been presented through dynamic gene operator. Experimental comparison results across various battlefield scales demonstrate that the outcomes of the proposed DPGA-TEDG algorithm not only meet practical requirements, but also outperform that of the other three algorithms in both optimality and robustness. Especially, in the battlefield scale environment of 180 km* 180 km, the average objective value of DPGA-TEDG is better than that of traditional genetic algorithm (GA-TEDG), simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) about 2.71 %, 6.58 % and 20.49 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores finite-time stabilization methods for a specific class of neural networks with fractional-order dynamics and time-varying delays. The first contribution involves introducing a generalized inequality, an extension of the existing one, to analyze the finite-time stabilization behavior of the addressed model. This extension has successfully addressed numerous limitations and challenges present in existing works. Additionally, an explicit formula for calculating the finite-time stabilization duration is provided. Subsequently, two types of controllers—delay-independent and delay-dependent feedback controllers—are developed to achieve finite-time stabilization for the neural networks under consideration. The conditions for stability, dependent on both the delay and the order, are formulated as linear matrix inequalities using inequality techniques, Lyapunov stability theory, and the newly proposed finite-time stability inequality. These conditions ensure that the fractional-order neural network model is stabilized in finite-time. The efficacy of the suggested design approach is demonstrated through two numerical case studies.},

  abstract     = {The metaheuristic optimization algorithm(MHS) is a global optimization method inspired by natural phenomena, demonstrating superior performance in specific application scenarios. Traditional optimization algorithms utilize two main concepts: exploration, to expand the search range, and exploitation, to enhance solution accuracy. However, as problem complexity and application scenarios increase, MHS struggles to balance exploration and exploitation to find the optimal solution. Therefore, this paper introduces innovative characteristics of individual thinking and proposes a new Thinking Innovation Strategy (TIS). TIS does not aim for an optimal solution but seeks global optimization based on successful individuals, enhancing algorithm performance through survival of the fittest. This paper applies TIS strategies to improve various MHS algorithms and evaluates their performance on 57 engineering problems and the IEEE CEC2020 benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the TIS-enhanced algorithms outperform the original versions across 57 engineering problems, according to Friedman ranking and Wilcoxon rank-sum test results. Some algorithms show significant improvement, demonstrating the feasibility and practicality of TIS for optimization problems.

To address this, a performance-driven multi-stage KNN (PMKNN) approach is proposed in this paper. Given a set of alternative K values, the traditional KNN algorithm is initially employed in the PMKNN approach to identify the optimal K values for all known samples. A convex optimization model is then constructed based on the least squares loss function to learn the correlation between known samples and query samples. After the learned correlation is used to evaluate the performances of all candidate K values in classifying query samples, a weighted majority voting process is designed to generate the final classification results. Unlike existing KNN approaches, the proposed PMKNN approach considers multiple optimal K values for each query sample, enhancing classification stability and reliability. The proposed approach also reduces the negative impact of inappropriate K values on classification performance. An experimental study is conducted using twenty real-world classification datasets collected from two public data repositories to assess the effectiveness of the proposed PMKNN approach. The relevant results highlight the high classification performance of the proposed PMKNN approach compared to seven state-of-the-art KNN methods and underscore its predictive stability compared to the traditional KNN algorithm using all possible K values.},

  abstract     = {Cuckoo Search (CS) stands as a highly efficient meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. Existing literature showcases the ability of CS in multi-objective scenarios, delineated by the three fundamental rules. However, the first rule of the algorithm incurs the cost of a generation to update a single nest, while the third rule necessitates hit-and-trial methods for parameter adjustment. To address these concerns, a multi-objective cuckoo search algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm builds upon a generalized concept of Lèvy Flight for generating new solutions. Problem-specific, constraint-based strategies for identifying the best nest and dissimilar eggs are also introduced. The algorithm is further applied to solve multispectral remote sensing image thresholding problem. Prior studies have underscored the efficiency of entropy and clustering-based thresholding methods over other techniques. Nevertheless, most entropy-based approaches entail converting color images to grayscale before segmentation, potentially sacrificing crucial spectral information and consequently degrading segmentation algorithm’s performance. To avoid these limitations, this research introduces an entropy-based thresholding method to segment a color image without converting it to grayscale. The experiments are carried out using very high resolution (VHR) and coarse resolution (CR) multispectral (MS) images from the satellite sensors Pl’eidas-1B and Sentinel-2b, respectively. The proposed methods undergo validation against four state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark functions and six clustering indexes, respectively.},

Cancelable biometric scheme is an effective remedy when many unprotected biometric templates are compromised. We propose a cancelable binary biometric template generation scheme based on the partial Walsh transformation and the MinHash algorithm to improve recognition accuracy and generation efficiency. Firstly, the partial Walsh matrix transforms the high-dimensional original biometric feature into a low-dimensional space. Then, protected cancelable binary biometric templates are generated based on the proposed sliding window grouping minimum hash algorithm SWG-MinHash. Our scheme demonstrates superior recognition accuracy and generation efficiency on fingerprint and face databases compared to existing schemes. Meanwhile, our scheme satisfies the properties of non-invertibility, revocability, and unlinkability, and is resistant to common security and privacy attacks. Therefore, our scheme effectively mitigates the problem of balancing recognition accuracy, security, and generation efficiency of cancelable biometric schemes and is more practical for biometric systems.

However, many existing multi-label feature selection models either ignore the intrinsic spatial structure of samples or have no restrictions on the predicted label values. To solve the above problems, a sample self-representation multi-label feature selection method based on fuzzy decision is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a self-representation coefficient matrix of samples is proposed, which not only retains the original data structure information, but also reflects the distribution structure of data. Then, a fuzzy decision function is introduced to fuzzy prediction labels which well represents the membership of a sample to a class and is more consistent with the real label distribution. The L 2 , 1 -norm is imposed on the feature weight matrix to ensure sparsity and the F -norm is introduced into the self-expression matrix to weaken the effects of redundancy and anomalous samples. Finally, the gradient descent method is used to optimize the objective function. Experimental results on 12 multi-label datasets show that the proposed method performs better than other state-of-the-art multi-label feature selection methods, and obtain a significant increase in classification accuracy of about 2%–3% over all the compared approaches.},

  abstract     = {Gradient Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in handling optimization problems. However, applying GNNs to multi-constrained optimization problems, particularly those with those involving multi-set constraints, poses several challenges. These challenges arise from the complexity of the derivations and the increasing number of constraints. As the number of constraints increases, the optimization problem becomes more complex, making it more challenging for GNN-based methods to effectively identify the optimal solution. Motivated by these challenges, the Finite-Time Gradient Projection Neural Network (FT-GPNN) is introduced for tackling Multi-set Constrained Optimization (MCO). This innovative solution incorporates an Enhanced Sign-Bi-Power (ESBP) activation function and simplifies the design tailored explicitly for MCO. Furthermore, within the Lyapunov stability framework, the theoretical foundation of this model is strengthened by rigorous proof of local convergence. Building upon this foundation, we further establish that our model can achieve convergence within a finite time. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we present empirical results from numerical experiments conducted under consistent conditions. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that the model using the ESBP activation function outperforms others in terms of finite-time convergence.},

To address this limitation, we propose the Multiple Time Series Pattern Representation Network(MTS-PRNet), a unified framework consisting of two modules to forecast multiple time series from diverse sources. The first is the intra-series correlation learning module, which explicitly learns the temporal dependencies of time series. The second is the inter-series discriminative representation learning module that learns shapelets as discriminative representations to capture shared features among series. By integrating the covariates map generated by the second module, both intra and inter-series characteristics are captured to provide transferable guidance for increasing predictability. Experiments conducted on 9 datasets verify that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we carry out an ablation study to validate the effectiveness of discriminative representations.},

  abstract     = {The limited driving range and short battery life are obstacles to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in urban logistics. This study proposes an electric vehicle routing problem with time window, mobile charging, and nonlinear battery degradation. Mobile charging vehicles (MCVs) can be flexibly scheduled to charge the electric delivery vehicles (EDVs) at customer locations, reducing the electricity consumption caused by the detours to the charging stations. The proposed problem is formulated into an arc-based model that incorporates nonlinear battery degradation costs associated with State of Charge (SOC) and charging strategies, thereby enhancing the complexity of the spatio-temporal synchronization mechanism. Constraining a lower SOC can mitigate the battery degradation of EDVs, but it leads to increased charging demands and makes searching for feasible routing solutions more challenging due to the interdependence between MCVs and EDVs. A hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic algorithm is developed. Dynamic programming is embedded in the algorithm framework to devise charging schemes considering nonlinear battery degradation for the given EDVs’ routes. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to select the combination of labels with continuous charging decisions and design MCVs’ routes. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the proposed model and algorithm. Experimental results indicate considering battery degradation in the objectives significantly improves the total system costs by optimizing the SOC and charging quantity. Mobile charging can be an alternative for constructing fixed charging facilities due to the charging flexibility of MCVs. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated through both large-scale instances and a real-world case study on urban logistics.},
