  abstract     = {We concern with the intelligent perception control of a mechanical arm dynamic system with unknown initial state values, parameter perturbations, and external disturbances. Unlike existing prescribed performance control (PPC) methodologies which fail to preset convergence time via parameter setting, we propose a new type of PPC with predefined convergence time to impose prescribed behaviors on angle tracking errors. To accomplish such aim, we firstly define a predefined time stability criterion with an upper bound of convergence time that can be set in advance, and then we further convert the actual tracking error variable into a new variable with an initial value of zero by utilizing the error conversion function. Furthermore, a boundary amplitude intelligent extension algorithm is designed based on tracking error for performance constraint function (PCF), and meanwhile the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is adopted to approximate the mechanical arm system model. On this basis, a new PPC approach guaranteeing predefined convergence time is addressed for the mechanical arm system. Finally, the obtained simulation results reveal that the angle tracking error always evolves inside the extended boundary of the PCF, to satisfy better prescribed transient and steady-state properties in comparison with existing technics.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a self-folding gravity compensation mechanism (SF-GCM) for supplementary folding robot arms to assist the worker. The foldable mechanism of SF-GCM consists of multiple links, torsional springs, pulleys, and cables to counter the moment due to the arm&#39;s weight and payload. The SF-GCM mechanism can fold and unfold according to the arm length and remotely provide a significant gravity compensation force. The design parameters of the robot arm are formulated, and a model of the equivalent stiffness model is proposed and analyzed. Analyzing the model was helpful to calculate the approximate stiffness values for designing the customized self-folding gravity compensation mechanism for foldable robots. A prototype of the SF-GCM mechanism was developed and its performance was evaluated experimentally for the payloads of 0.1 kg and 0.5 kg. It turns out that SF-GCM could compensate for the end-effector payload during arm extension and contraction.},

  abstract     = {Today robots must be safe, versatile, and user-friendly to operate in unstructured and human-populated environments. Dynamical system-based imitation learning enables robots to perform complex tasks stably and without explicit programming, greatly simplifying their real-world deployment. To exploit the full potential of these systems it is crucial to implement closed loops that use visual feedback. Vision permits to cope with environmental changes, but is complex to handle due to the high dimension of the image space. This study introduces a dynamical system-based imitation learning for direct visual servoing. It leverages off-the-shelf deep learning-based perception modules to extract robust features from the raw input image, and an imitation learning strategy to execute sophisticated robot motions. The learning blocks are integrated using the large projection task priority formulation. As demonstrated through extensive experimental analysis, the proposed method realizes complex tasks with a robotic manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Social Robots need to be safe and reliable to share their space with humans. This paper reports on the first results of a research project that aims to create more safe and reliable, intelligent autonomous robots by investigating the implications and interactions between cybersecurity and safety. We propose creating a robotic intrusion prevention system (RIPS) that follows a novel approach to detect and mitigate intrusions in cognitive social robot systems and other cyber–physical systems. The RIPS detects threats at the robotic communication level and enables mitigation of the cyber–physical threats by using System Modes to define what part of the robotic system reduces or limits its functionality while the system is compromised. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by applying it to a cognitive architecture running in a real social robot that preserves the privacy and safety of humans while facing several cyber attack situations.},
