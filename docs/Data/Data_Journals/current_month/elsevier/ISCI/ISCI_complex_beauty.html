  abstract     = {In this paper, a modified structure of the classical Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) named Double context layered with output self-weighted feedback loop Elman recurrent neural network (DCLOSWFLERNN) is proposed. It consists of two additional components (as compared to the ERNN model): one extra context layer and an adjustable weighted feedback loop in the output layer. This has resulted in the model&#39;s ability to approximate the underlying unknown mathematical relationship relating to the input-output data (obtained from any complex dynamical plant). The second emphasis of this paper pertains to the stability component, wherein the Lyapunov stability is utilized to develop a stable Back-propagation (BP) based weight update rule. Lastly, an adjustable learning rate is also suggested, which contributes to improving the learning algorithm&#39;s overall performance. The simulation results reveal that the proposed model has given better modeling accuracy as compared to the other considered neural models. This can be observed from the values obtained of the error-based indicators such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Average Error (MSE). The values of RMSE and MAE obtained from the proposed model during the modeling procedure are 0.0028 and 0.0035 which are the least among the obtained with other neural models.},

As a result, most differential equation discovery algorithms try to recover the coefficients for a known fixed form of the equation. In this paper, we, using the initial guess obtained automatically, modify the structure space instead of imposing rigid constraints so that specific terms appear more likely within the cross-over and mutation operators. In this way, we mimic expertly chosen terms while preserving the possibility of obtaining any form of differential equation. The paper shows that the extraction and use of knowledge allow it to outperform the SINDy algorithm in terms of search stability and robustness.

More recently, effects of syntax-based models, applying graph convolution operation over dependency trees, are highlighted due to their superiority. However, these methods still have deficiencies. For one thing, little aspect-specific information is considered during semantic modeling of contextual words, which introduces irrelevant noise toward the aspect. For another, current syntax-based approaches either ignore the syntactic constituent knowledge, or fail to maintain the syntactic information from the reconstructed constituent tree. As such, no relation among words, phrases and clauses is built. In this work, a Semantic Enhanced Bi-Syntax Graph Convolutional Network (SEBS-GCN) is proposed to enhance semantics of context to the aspect, and capture the sentiment relevance among words, phrases and clauses. Specifically, we devise an aspect-aware gated mechanism to obtain the aspect-aware feature, based on the semantic correlations between the specific aspect and its contexts. Furthermore, the syntax information of the constituent tree is sufficiently exploited to analyze the hierarchical structure and the logical relation among words, phrases and clauses, based on which to capture the sentiment clues of the aspect.},

However, accurate capturing of spatial-temporal features in traffic systems faces certain challenges, such as long-range correlations and node heterogeneity. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a novel traffic flow prediction model that incorporates spatial-temporal heterogeneous attention, allowing for dynamic perception of similar nodes. In the proposed model, a filter network dynamic parameter memory generator is used for real-time parameter adjustment, which assigns greater weights to nodes with higher similarity to mitigate spatial-temporal heterogeneity. In addition, a similarity-based node computation method, which uses the Wasserstein distance, is introduced to construct a spatial-temporal association matrix, allowing for the dynamic capturing of long-range correlations between nodes. The model&#39;s efficacy is validated through experiments on four publicly available traffic datasets. Results show that the proposed model consistently outperforms the best baselines in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, this study examines factors such as training data size, dimensionality, the number of attention heads, and the threshold of the spatial-temporal association matrix, and includes an ablation study to evaluate the model&#39;s overall performance.},

The finite-time safe optimal controller is derived from the solution to the transformed Nash equilibrium condition.

  abstract     = {Multimodal multi-objective optimization aims to balance the diversity and the convergence to obtain multiple complete and uniform Pareto optimal solution sets. In recent years, using machine learning models to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms has become a hot topic. However, few studies utilize machine learning models to solve the imbalance problem between the diversity and the convergence in multimodal multi-objective optimization. Therefore, this paper proposes a multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm driven by variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), which can reproduce diversified offspring with good convergence by reconstructing the parent population. In reproduction, the parent population is constructed into graph data, and the VGAE is adopted to map the graph data to the latent space, obtaining the distribution information represented by the low-dimensional vector. By sampling the distribution, the VGAE can generate the offspring with the similar distribution to the parent, which can fill the less dense regions in the decision space and improve the exploitation ability. In archive updating, the convergence state based on the inverted generation distance between the non-dominated solutions and the worst dominated solutions is defined, and the state information of the convergence archive is transferred to the diversity archive to determine the dynamic niche. This niche comprehensively considers the distribution state and convergence degree of solutions in the diversity and convergence archives, which is employed to calculate the local convergence quality, retaining more promising solutions. The results of 48 benchmark problems and a practical application show that the proposed algorithm outperforms eight competitive algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In partial multi-label learning (PML), each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, which contains multiple relevant labels and noisy labels. The disambiguation-based strategy has been widely adopted by most existing PML methods, i.e., recovering the information of real labels from the set of candidate labels. To achieve this goal, these methods usually assume that global label correlations among different categories are applicable to all the instances, but local label correlations are seldom considered. In this paper, we propose a novel PML method to address this issue, termed Partial Multi-Label Learning with Label and Classifier Correlations (PML-LC), where both global and local label correlations are taken into consideration. Specifically, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) technique is employed to obtain the global manifold structure information of the feature space, which is then transformed into the label space, acting as global label correlations. Moreover, a local label manifold regularizer is introduced to capture local label correlations. Besides, a covariance regularizer is also adopted to model classifier correlations when learning the mapping matrix. Experimental results on thirteen PML datasets demonstrate its superior performance over several state-of-the-art PML approaches.},

To address these challenges, we propose Multi-ITI, a multi-modal learning framework to learn molecular biological and network topological features for ingredients and targets from multi-modal herbal data, including ingredient SMILES sequences, target protein sequences, ingredient SMILES sequence similarity, target protein sequence similarity, and ingredient-target interactions. Multi-ITI consists of a biological feature learning module and a heterogeneous graph learning module. The biological feature learning module integrates pre-trained models to build deep feature representations for ingredients and targets, while the heterogeneous graph learning module leverages a heterogeneous graph neural network with dynamic attention mechanisms to capture ingredient-target network interactions and mitigate the impact of noisy connections. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that Multi-ITI outperforms six state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of Multi-ITI through molecular docking simulations and comparisons with recent studies, further highlighting its superior predictive performance and practical applicability.},

However, less researches were done on SCNs-based classification models for concept-drifting data streams. The so-called drifts refer to data distributions changing over time that may degrade the classification performance of SCNs trained on historical data. The previous drift adaptation approach is to discard all the hidden nodes of SCNs, and then learn a new model with new instances, in which the valuable historical information cannot be fully utilized. In addition, labeling all newly-arrived instances is time-consuming and impractical. To address these issues, an adaptive stochastic configuration network embedding online active learning is proposed. Crucially, a query strategy is developed to select representative instances for labeling based on the change degree of instances density and their uncertainty. An online update mechanism is employed to incrementally update the network&#39;s output parameters instance by instance. To rationally forget the outdated information and learn new concepts, a dynamic adjustment mechanism adaptively adds or prunes nodes in the SCN model.

The fundamental principle of multi-task learning is the transfer of information between tasks. Nevertheless where data is limited in quantity, effectively modeling inter-task correlations is a significant challenge. We propose a novel method, semi-supervised manifold regularized multi-task learning with privileged information (MSMTL-PI), that effectively leverages the intrinsic geometric structure of data by enforcing manifold regularization and subspace learning techniques. Specifically, a similarity graph is constructed over both labeled and unlabeled samples, ensuring the preservation of local geometric relationships between data points, and manifold regularization is applied as a constraint. Concurrently, information sharing on low-dimensional subspace makes the relationship modeling between tasks more reasonable. Furthermore, a significant amount of privileged information is incorporated into the training phase, thereby optimizing the decision boundary and reducing the impact of insufficient labeled samples on the model. There is substantial experimental evidence that MSMTL-PI markedly enhances the performance of image and text classification tasks, achieving superior classification accuracy with minimal labeled data. Across 15 benchmark datasets, MSMTL-PI consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving an average F1-scores improvement of 1.92% compared to the best baseline, with a maximum gain of 4.17%.},

  abstract     = {Collecting a sufficient amount of labeled data is challenging in practice. To deal with this challenge, active learning, which selects informative instances for annotation, has been studied. However, for time series, the dataset quality is often quite poor, and its multi-modality makes it unsuited to conventional active learning methods. Existing time series active learning methods have limitations, such as redundancy among selected instances, unrealistic assumptions on datasets, and inefficient calculations. We propose a batch active learning method for time series (BALT), which efficiently selects a batch of informative samples. BALT performs efficient clustering and picks one instance with the maximum informativeness score from each cluster. Using this score, we consider in-batch diversity explicitly so as to effectively handle multi-modality by exploring unknown regions, even under an extreme lack of labeled data. We also apply an adaptive weighting strategy to emphasize exploration in the early stage of the algorithm but shift to exploitation as the algorithm proceeds. Through experiments on several time-series datasets under various scenarios, we demonstrate the efficacy of BALT in achieving superior classification performance with less computation time under a predetermined budget, compared to existing time-series active learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic forecasting is vital for optimizing intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet existing models often struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal patterns of urban traffic. We present GAPDE (Graph Attention Partial Differential Equation), a novel framework that integrates Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and advanced attention mechanisms. GAPDE enables continuous-time spatio-temporal modeling and dynamically prioritizes critical features through attention-driven traffic forecasting. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including PEMS-BAY, METR-LA, and various PeMS collections (PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, PeMS08, PeMSD7M, and PeMSD7L), demonstrate GAPDE&#39;s superior performance over state-of-the-art models such as RGDAN, SGODE-RNN, and STD-MAE. GAPDE achieves up to 9.2 percent lower RMSE and 10.4 percent lower MAE, outperforming baselines in both short- and long-term prediction tasks. It demonstrates strong robustness to missing data, high scalability for large-scale networks, and enhanced interpretability through spatial and temporal attention visualizations. Comprehensive comparative evaluations and an in-depth ablation study further validate the effectiveness of GAPDE&#39;s components, including the GPDE block and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms. By combining PDEs, GCNs, and attention mechanisms in a scalable and efficient design, GAPDE offers a robust solution for real-time traffic forecasting in complex urban environments.},

  abstract     = {The AIE-D algorithm (Adjacent Information Entropy-D algorithm) is proposed to recognize the importance of nodes in the urban rail transit network (URTN) weighted by passenger flow, which considers passenger flow, topological characteristics of nodes in the URTN, and the influence of neighboring nodes. The travel impedance is determined by using travel time, the D algorithm is used to search the k-short paths, and the weight value of each edge is the passenger flow cross-section of the corresponding line. Then, the detail AIE calculation steps are introduced. Next, a numerical study and comparison study are conducted by using the weighted topology of network. Compared with other commonly used algorithms, AIE-D has lower time complexity with faster calculation speed, and higher recognition accuracy. Finally, a real-world case study is conducted by using URTN of Chengdu Metro Network as the background. Weighted by passenger flow has greater impact on the operation of urban rail transit. The nodes are categorized into three classes according to the ranking of node importance, which includes Classification VI, Classification I and Classification GI. We conduct random attacks and deliberate attacks on the network, and analyze the network efficiency and maximum connectivity subgraph rate after the attacks.},

We employ the mean squared error from the fitted clustering results as a criterion to guide partition optimization, which not only ensures rapid convergence of the algorithm to a stable solution but also yields desirable theoretical results. Meanwhile, we also suggest a difference-based threshold ridge ratio criterion to consistently determine the number of clusters.

  abstract     = {Kolmogorov complexity measures the compressibility of real numbers. We provide a refined characterization of the hypercomputational power of analog, evolving, and stochastic neural networks based on the Kolmogorov complexity of their real weights, evolving weights, and real probabilities, respectively. First, we retrieve the infinite hierarchy of complexity classes of analog networks, defined in terms of the Kolmogorov complexity of their real weights. This hierarchy lies between the complexity classes P and P / poly . Next, using a natural identification between real numbers and infinite sequences of bits, we generalize this result to evolving networks, obtaining a similar hierarchy of complexity classes within the same bounds. Finally, we extend these results to stochastic networks that employ real probabilities as randomness, deriving a new infinite hierarchy of complexity classes situated between BPP and BPP / lo g ⁎ . Beyond providing examples of such hierarchies, we describe a generic method for constructing them based on classes of functions of increasing complexity. As a practical application, we show that the predictive capabilities of recurrent neural networks are strongly impacted by the quantization applied to their weights. Overall, these results highlight the relationship between the computational power of neural networks and the intrinsic information contained by their parameters.},

  abstract     = {Classification is one of the very important areas in data mining. In real-life problems, developed methods for modeling with the classification problem generally perform well on datasets where the class distribution is balanced. On the other hand, the data sets are often imbalanced and it is important to develop algorithms to solve the classification problem on imbalanced data sets. Imbalanced datasets are more difficult to classify than balanced datasets because learning a class with underrepresentation is difficult. Most real life problems are imbalanced. The class with the least number of data usually corresponds to rare cases and is more important. Learning these classes is critical accordingly. One of the most commonly used solution methods to solve this problem is to oversample the minor class. When oversampling, too many repetitions in the dataset can cause overfitting. For this reason, it is very important to ensure data diversity when oversampling. Therefore, this paper proposes a new oversampling methods (the incremental SMOTE) combining the incremental k-means algorithm and Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The original dataset is clustered with the incremental k-means algorithm and the clusters are filtered to determine the safe clusters. The number of points to be produced from the safe clusters is determined, and then new instances are produced with the improved SMOTE algorithm. In the incremental SMOTE, diversity in the dataset is achieved by generating with incremental rate. In order to evaluate the performance of the incremental SMOTE algorithm, classification was performed on imbalanced datasets, balanced datasets obtained by the random oversampling, SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE and SVM SMOTE methods. Comparisons for 10 datasets showed that the performance of the proposed method improves as the imbalance ratio of the dataset increases.},

  abstract     = {In the production of hot-rolled strip steal, the use of physical models frequently leads to inaccurate predictions of rolling force because some parameters are determined empirically. Further, purely data-driven models may not necessarily conform to the rolling principles, significantly restricting the applicability of machine learning in practical scenarios. Consequently, this study proposes an innovative modelling approach for predicting rolling force, utilizing a deep stochastic configuration network (DeepSCN) integrated with physical knowledge. Considering the many empirical parameters in existing physical models, an improved dung beetle optimizer (IDBO) is developed to optimize these parameters, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the physical models and acquiring more reasonable physical features. Subsequently, those physical features are utilized as deep inputs for the DeepSCN model to achieve the fusion of physical knowledge and data-driven approaches. The results suggest that the proposed model outperforms both physical and pure data-driven models. This work is able to demonstrate that the proposed fusion model conforms to the existing rolling theories and is suitable for various working conditions.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) networks necessitates more efficient and intelligent methods for managing social interactions and service recommendations. This paper introduces a novel approach to improving the process of selecting SIoT friendship paths based on real-time recommendations leveraging a collaborative caching Multi-Agent Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (MAFDRL) framework. This process involves using recommendation algorithms to predict and select optimal friendship connections, enhancing navigability and interaction efficiency within SIoT environments. The proposed model incorporates both the social relationships and resource-sharing dynamics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to optimize recommendation accuracy and network performance. By combining Federated Learning (FL) principles with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), the MAFDRL framework allows multiple agents to collaboratively train models without compromising privacy, ensuring scalability across distributed networks. Additionally, the integration of cache-driven techniques enhances computational efficiency, reducing latency and cost in friendship path discovery and improving real-time decision-making. Our experiments, conducted with the Waze and MovieLens-1 M datasets, reveal that the introduced framework achieves an average 30 % reduction in system and delay expenses. It also improves cache hit efficiency, with expenses reduced by approximately 25 % and around a 35 % increase in the accuracy of personalized recommendations.},
