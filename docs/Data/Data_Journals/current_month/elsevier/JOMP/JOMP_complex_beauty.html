  abstract     = {Studying metacognition, the introspection of one&#39;s own decisions, can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the decisions. Here we show that observers’ uncertainty about their decisions incorporates both the entropy of the stimuli and the entropy of their response probabilities across the psychometric function. Describing uncertainty data with a functional form permits the measurement of internal parameters not measurable from the decision responses alone. To test and demonstrate the utility of this novel model, we measured uncertainty in 11 participants as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in several experiments employing implicit bias or attentional cues. The entropy model enabled an otherwise intractable quantitative analysis of participants’ uncertainty, which in one case distinguished two comparative judgments that produced nearly identical psychometric functions. In contrast, comparative and equality judgments with different behavioral reports yielded uncertainty reports that were not significantly different. The entropy model was able to successfully account for uncertainty in these two different types of decisions that resulted in differently shaped psychometric functions, and the entropy contribution from the stimuli, which were identical across experiments, was consistent. An observer&#39;s uncertainty could therefore be measured as the total entropy of the inputs and outputs of the stimulus-response system, i.e. the entropy of the stimuli plus the entropy of the observer&#39;s responses.},

  abstract     = {Procedural knowledge space theory aims to evaluate problem-solving skills using a formal representation of a problem space. Stefanutti et al. (2021) introduced the concept of the “shortest path space” to characterize optimal problem spaces when a task requires reaching a solution in the minimum number of moves. This paper takes that idea further. It expands the shortest-path space concept to include a wider range of optimization problems, where each move can be weighted by a real number representing its “value”. Depending on the application, the “value” could be a cost, waiting time, route length, etc. This new model, named the optimizing path space, comprises all the globally best solutions. Additionally, it sets the stage for evaluating human problem-solving skills in various areas, like cognitive and neuropsychological tests, experimental studies, and puzzles, where globally optimal solutions are required.},

  abstract     = {One of cognitive science’s core challenges is reconciling the success of probabilistic models in explaining human cognition with the observed fallacies in human probability judgments. This tutorial delves into models that address this discrepancy, shedding light on probabilistic fallacies. It encompasses earlier accounts like heuristics and averaging models, as well as contemporary, comprehensive models like quantum probability, the Probability Plus Noise model, and the Bayesian Sampler. The tutorial concludes by introducing the most recent accounts that integrate probability judgments with choice and response time, and highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.},

  abstract     = {Invariance and symmetry principles have played a fundamental if not essential role in the theoretical development of the physical and mathematical sciences. More recently, Generalized Invariance Structure Theory (GIST; Vigo, 2013, 2015; Vigo et al., 2022) has extended this methodological trajectory with respect to the study and formal modeling of human cognition. Indeed, GIST is the first systematic and extensively tested mathematical and computational theory of concept learning and categorization behavior (i.e., human generalization) based on such principles. The theory introduces an original mathematical and computational framework, with novel, more appropriate, and more natural characterizations, constructs, and measures of invariance and symmetry with respect to cognition than existing ones in the mathematical sciences and physics. These have proven effective in predicting and explaining empirically tested behavior in the domains of perception, concept learning, categorization, similarity assessment, aesthetic judgments, and decision making, among others. GIST has its roots in a precursor theory known as Categorical Invariance Theory (CIT; Vigo, 2009). This paper gives a basic introduction to two different notions of human invariance detection proposed by GIST and its precursor CIT: namely, a notion based on a cognitive mechanism of dimensional suppression, rapid attention shifting, and partial similarity assessment referred to as binding ( s -invariance) and a perturbation notion based on perturbations of the values of the dimensions on which categories of object stimuli are defined ( p -invariance). This is followed by the first simple formal proof of the invariance equivalence principle from GIST which asserts that the two notions are equivalent under a set of strict conditions on categories. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how GIST, unlike CIT, may be used to model probabilistic process accounts of categorization, and how it naturally and directly applies to the learning of sequential categories and to multiset-based concept learning.},
