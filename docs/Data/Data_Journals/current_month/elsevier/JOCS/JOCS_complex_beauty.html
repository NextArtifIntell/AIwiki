  abstract     = {Monitoring disease development in arteries, which supply oxygen and nutrients to the body, is crucial and can be assessed using hemodynamic metrics. Hemodynamic metrics can be calculated via computational fluid dynamic simulation of patient-specific geometries. These simulations are known to be heavily influenced by boundary conditions, such as time-dependent inlet flow. However, the effects of inlet flow profiles have not previously been quantified or understood. Here we quantify the effects of modulating temporal arterial waveforms on hemodynamic metrics. Building on our previous work that identified the minimum number of points of interest needed to characterize a left coronary artery inlet waveform, here, we extend this approach to pulmonary and carotid artery waveforms, pinpointing critical points of interest on these waveforms. Using a systematic variation of these points, we quantify the effects on hemodynamic metrics such as wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index, and relative residence time. We simulate using 1D Navier–Stokes and 3D lattice Boltzmann simulation approaches conducted on high performance compute clusters. The results pinpoint parts of the waveform that are most susceptible to perturbations and measurement error. The impacts of this work include the construction of a method that can be applied to other fluid simulations with pulsatile inlet conditions and the ability to distinguish the vital parts of a pulsatile inlet condition for computational fluid dynamic simulations and clinical metrics. This work is an extension of work published at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS-2024), (Geddes et al., 2024).},

The method combines the characteristic method with a stabilized mixed finite element method that uses the lowest equal-order pair for the velocity and pressure. The stabilization term is based on two local Gauss integrations for the velocity. Moreover, we obtain that the approximation of the pressure u is optimal in the L 2 -norm and H 1 -norm, the approximation of the velocity p is suboptimal in the L 2 -norm. Finally, numerical experiments in 2D and 3D are presented to verify the theoretical results.},

To improve the learning capacity of the PINN, we incorporate the energy dissipation property of the Allen–Cahn equation as a penalty term into the loss function of the network. To facilitate the learning process of random initials, we employ a continuous analogue of the initial random condition by utilizing the Fourier series expansion. Adaptive methods from traditional numerical analysis are also integrated to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed PINN.

In addition, the CFD model showed higher pressure and shear stress values than the FSI model, and the maximum velocity of the FSI models was higher than that of the CFD model.

Traditional methods, such as discrete velocity and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), demand intensive memory and computation, especially for microflows in non-convex domains. Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) emerged as a meshless and adaptable alternative for solving non-linear partial differential equations. We trained a PINN using a limited number of DSMC-generated rarefied gas microflows in the transition regime ( 0.1 &lt; Kn &lt; 3 ) , incorporating continuity and Cauchy momentum exchange equations in the loss function. The PINN achieved under 2 % error on these residuals and effectively filtered DSMC’s intrinsic statistical noise. Predictions remained strong for a tested flow field with Kn = 0.7 , and showed limited extrapolation performance on a flow field with Kn = 5 with a local overshoot of about 20 %, while maintaining physical consistency. Notably, each DSMC field required ∼ 20 hours on 4 graphics processing units (GPU), while the PINN training took &lt; 2 hours on one GPU, with evaluations under 2 seconds.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel zone-based flocking control approach suitable for dynamic multi-agent systems (MAS). Inspired by Reynolds behavioral rules for boids , flocking behavioral rules with the zones of repulsion, conflict, attraction, and surveillance are introduced. For each agent, using only bearing and distance measurements, behavioral contribution vectors quantify the local separation, local and global flock velocity alignment, local cohesion, obstacle avoidance and boundary conditions, and strategic separation for avoiding alien agents. The control strategy uses the local perception-based behavioral contribution vectors to guide each agent’s motion. Additionally, the control strategy incorporates a directionally aware obstacle avoidance mechanism that prioritizes obstacles in the agent’s forward path. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the model in creating flexible, adaptable, and scalable flocking behavior. Asymptotic stability and convergence to a stable flocking configuration for any initial conditions provided the interaction graph is a spanning tree are demonstrated. The flocking model’s reliance on locally sensed bearing and distance measurements ensures scalability and robustness, particularly in scenarios where communication is unreliable or resource-intensive. This makes it well-suited for real-world applications demanding seamless operation in highly dynamic and distributed environments.},

Analytical formulas are derived to compute the relationship between the volume of a voxel projected onto a detector pixel and its contribution to the line integral of attenuation recorded by that pixel. Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon’s algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon’s algorithm, tuned to achieve the same accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector. All algorithms are implemented in a GPU optimized open-source framework for algebraic reconstruction.},

The MTCN, comprised of parallel TCN channels and a Bi-LSTM, extracts and fuses multi-dimensional features from the sequence. The MHSA mechanism is incorporated to minimize feature loss during information transmission, capture dependencies within the sequence, and enhance the model’s expressiveness and generalization capability. To optimize the hyperparameters of the MTCN-MHSA model, an Improved Positional PID-based Search Algorithm (IPPSA) is proposed, which builds upon the PID-based Search Algorithm (PSA). IPPSA exhibits superior global optimization capabilities and convergence speed, effectively identifying the optimal hyperparameters. Extensive comparative modeling experiments utilizing KVLCC2 and KCS ship maneuvering data validate the notable effectiveness and superiority of the proposed IPPSA-MTCN-MHSA model in ship motion prediction.},

  abstract     = {Approaches to Automatic Text Summarization try to extract key information from one or more input texts and generate summaries whilst preserving content meaning. These strategies are separated into two groups, Extractive and Abstractive, which differ in their work. The extractive summarization extracts sentences from the document text directly, whereas the abstractive summarization creates a summary by interpreting the text and rewriting sentences, often with new words. It is important to assess and confirm how similar a summary is to the original text independently of the particular TS algorithm adopted. The literature proposes various metrics and scores for evaluating text summarization results, and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy of Gisting Evaluation) is the most used. In this study, our main objective is to evaluate how the ROUGE metric performs when applied to both Extractive and Abstractive summarization algorithms. We aim to understand its effectiveness and reliability as an independent and unbiased metric in assessing the quality of summaries generated by these different approaches. We conducted a first experiment to compare the metric efficiency (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L) for evaluating Abstractive (word2vec, doc2vec, and glove) v e r s u s Extractive Text Summarization algorithms (textRank, lsa, luhn, lexRank), and a second one to compare the obtained score for two different summary approaches: a simple execution of a summarization algorithm v e r s u s a multiple execution of different algorithms on the same text. Based on our study, evaluating the ROUGE metric for Abstractive and Extractive algorithms revealed that it reaches similar results for the Abstractive and Extractive algorithms. Moreover, our findings indicate that multiple executions, based on the running of two text summarization algorithms sequentially on the same text, generally outperform single executions of a single text summarization algorithm.},

Current FDA-approved tools for coronary intervention planning require days of preliminary processing and rely on conventional 2D displays for hemodynamic evaluation. Immersion offered by extended reality (XR) has been found to benefit intervention planning over traditional 2D displays. Building on our previous work (Tanade and Randles, 2024), we introduce HarVI, a coronary intervention planner that leverages machine learning for real-time hemodynamic analysis and extended reality for intuitive 3D user interaction. The framework uses a predefined set of 1D steady state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to perform one-shot training for our machine learning-based blood flow model. In a two-center cohort of 73 patients, 70 with focal lesions and 3 with serial lesions, we calculated fractional flow reserve — the gold standard biomarker of ischemia in coronary disease, flow rate, and wall shear stress using HarVI and 1D CFD models. HarVI was shown to almost perfectly recapitulate the results of 1D CFD simulations through continuous validation scores. In this study, we establish a machine learning-based process for virtual coronary treatment planning with an average turnaround time of just 62 min — around an order of magnitude improvement over literature standards, thus reducing the required time for one-shot training to less than one working day.},

We show the interpretable consistency of DKF with the classic KF when this is optimal, and its improvements against the KF with both linear and nonlinear models in general. Indeed, the DKF learns parameters of a quite general reference model, comprising: corrector gains, predictor model parameters and eventual unmodeled dynamics.

  abstract     = {The tensor–matrix multiplication (TTM) is a basic tensor operation required by various tensor methods such as the HOSVD. This paper presents flexible high-performance algorithms that compute the tensor–matrix product according to the Loops-over-GEMM (LOG) approach. The proposed algorithms can process dense tensors with any linear tensor layout, arbitrary tensor order and dimensions all of which can be runtime variable. The paper discusses two slicing methods with orthogonal parallelization strategies and propose four algorithms that call BLAS with subtensors or tensor slices. It also provides a simple heuristic which selects one of the four proposed algorithms at runtime. All algorithms have been evaluated on a large set of tensors with various tensor shapes and linear tensor layouts. In case of large tensor slices, our best-performing algorithm achieves a median performance of 2.47 TFLOPS on an Intel Xeon Gold 5318Y and 2.93 TFLOPS an AMD EPYC 9354. Furthermore, it outperforms batched GEMM implementation of Intel MKL by a factor of 2.57 with large tensor slices. Our runtime tests show that our best-performing algorithm is, on average, at least 6.21% and up to 334.31% faster than frameworks implementing state-of-the-art approaches, including actively developed libraries such as Libtorch and Eigen. For the majority of tensor shapes, it is on par with TBLIS which uses optimized kernels for the TTM computation. Our algorithm performs better than all other competing implementations for the majority of real world tensors from the SDRBench, reaching a speedup of 2x or more for some tensor instances.

The CORDIC algorithm is an iterative method of computing trigonometric functions and rotating vectors without using complex calculations. This paper presents two modified CORDIC algorithms for implementing a Givens rotator on FPGA, improving upon classic CORDIC methods. The first approach introduces a selective iteration scheme with an optimized scaling factor, while the second, not published in the original ICCS-2024 paper, leverages a scaling-free methodology for improved precision. Implemented on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA, these algorithms demonstrate a 50% accuracy improvement and a 15% reduction in latency compared to standard methods. These findings contribute to enhanced FPGA-based trigonometric computations, particularly benefiting real-time signal processing and numerical linear algebra applications.},

  abstract     = {We propose a fast temporal second-order compact finite difference method for solving a class of two-dimensional parabolic integro-differential equations with weakly singular kernel. The sum-of-exponentials approximation of the kernel function is combined with the product averaged integration rule to approximate the weakly singular integral term, and the fourth-order compact finite difference method is employed to discretize the spatial derivative operator. We use the discrete energy technique to rigorously prove that the proposed fast method is almost unconditionally stable and convergent. Compared with the direct method, the fast method significantly reduces storage and computational costs while maintaining the temporal second-order convergence and spatial fourth-order convergence for weakly singular solutions. Some comparisons with the fast method using the exponential-sum-approximation technique, the fast Runge–Kutta convolution quadrature method and the explicit fast method based on the sum-of-exponentials approximation are discussed. The numerical results confirm the results of theoretical analysis and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the fast method.},

  abstract     = {In the field of High Performance Computing (HPC), Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used and prevalent programming model. Only the low-level programming languages C, C++, and Fortran have bindings available in the standard. Although there are attempts to provide MPI bindings for other programming languages, these may be limited, which could lead to incompatibilities, performance overhead, and functional gaps. To address those problems, we present MPI4All, a brand-new tool designed to make the process of developing effective MPI bindings for any programming language more straightforward. Support for additional languages can be added with little difficulty, and MPI4All is independent of the MPI implementation. Programming language binding generators for Go and Java are included in the most recent version of MPI4All. We demonstrate their good performance results with respect to other state-of-the-art approaches. This work is an extended version of the ICCS-2024 conference paper (Piñeiro et al., 2024).},

  abstract     = {Hyperthermia is a cancer treatment method that uses controlled heat to induce tumor necrosis while preserving healthy tissue. This study uses computational simulations to investigate the effects of capillary network variability and blood flow dynamics on the thermal response during hyperthermia. A porous media bioheat model, coupled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques using Monte Carlo simulations, was developed to analyze the influence of capillary angles, blood velocity, and capillary density on temperature distribution in biological tissues. The model demonstrates that under a range of physiological uncertainties, tumor tissues consistently reach the critical damage threshold temperature of 4 3 ∘ C , while healthy tissues remain below 3 8 ∘ C , minimizing collateral damage. To address the computational intensity of solving three-dimensional heat transfer equations with UQ analysis, high-performance computing methods were employed. A parallel implementation using CUDA achieved a speedup exceeding 114 × compared to serial processing, while OpenMP achieved a 16 × speedup.},

  abstract     = {In astrometry, the determination of three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars based on observations from a space telescope suffers from the uncertainty of random and systematic errors. The systematic errors are introduced by imperfections of the telescope’s optics and detectors as well as in the pointing accuracy of the satellite. The fine art of astrometry consists of heuristically finding the best possible calibration model that will account for and remove these systematic errors. Since this is a process based on trial and error, appropriate software is needed that is efficient enough to solve the system of astrometric equations and reveal the astrometric parameters of stars for the given calibration model within a reasonable time. This paper is an extended version of the conference paper published and discussed at the International Conference on Computational Science 2024. In this work, we propose a novel software architecture and corresponding prototype of a direct solver optimized for running on supercomputers. The main advantages expected from this direct method over an iterative one are the numerical robustness, accuracy of the method, and the explicit calculation of the variance–covariance matrix for the estimation of the accuracy and correlation of the unknown parameters. This solver can handle astrometric systems with billions of equations within several hours. To reach the desired performance, we use state-of-the-art libraries and methods for hybrid parallel and vectorized computing. The calibration model based on Legendre polynomials is tested by generating synthetic observations on grid-shaped constellation with specified distortions. For these small-sized test data, the solver can recover perfectly the correct physical solution under the condition that the correct amount of eigenvalues is zeroed out. During the space mission, the calibration model should be carefully fine-tuned according to the real operating conditions. The developed solver is furthermore tested using mock science data related to the Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for Infrared Exploration. Up to 9.2 billion observations of 115 thousand stars can be processed in 8.5 h utilizing 5000 CPUs. A linear scaling with the number of CPUs and a quadratic scaling with the number of observations is demonstrated.},
