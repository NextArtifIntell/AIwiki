  abstract     = {Third-party cybersecurity providers in a software supply chain execute scanning jobs according to business policies and government regulations, tailoring responses to each node’s unique attributes and risks. Traditionally, providers might use various tools at different times without coordination, leading to resource bottlenecks. This study introduces a novel approach to scanning job scheduling, addressing the unique challenge where the marginal benefit of scanning time varies non-linearly, unlike traditional job scheduling problems. The findings reveal that upgrading a scanning strategy by one level can quantify the reduced loss, providing a foundation for efficient resource allocation in large-scale supply chains. A branch-and-bound algorithm is developed to generate the optimal schedules, serving as a benchmark for evaluating other metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, this study proposes an innovative genetic algorithm incorporating dynamic crossover or mutation rates, as well as mechanisms to prevent premature convergence and improve performance. This approach demonstrates practical scalability and efficiency in scheduling scanning jobs across 300 nodes, ensuring adaptability to real-world supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Train timetabling and rolling stock circulation planning are problems of crucial importance for integrated planning. Often, these problems are separately solved in a sequential way without consideration of periodic train schedule. However, a notable drawback of this layered planning process is poor coordination and efficiency between train and rolling stock timetables, as well as lack of regularity. To this end, we explore the joint optimization problem of periodic and aperiodic train timetabling and rolling stock circulation planning in this paper. To address this comprehensive problem, an integer programming model is initially established by incorporating rolling stock circulation into optimizing periodic and aperiodic train timetabling. Due to the model-solving complexity, a three-dimensional space–time-state network is constructed to reformulate this model. Within this three-dimensional network, states are used to represent trains served by rolling stocks. Subsequently, the problem is transformed into a minimum-cost multi-commodity network flow problem with incompatible arcs based on the space–time-state network. And an efficient Lagrangian relaxation decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve this network flow problem. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified through a series of case studies.},

  abstract     = {Sequential zone order picking systems frequently encounter blocking delays when a tote cannot proceed to the next zone because it is occupied, and starving delays when a tote remains unassigned to a zone. General approaches to minimize delays include balancing the total workload across zones, grouping the orders into batches, or optimizing the order release sequences. However, the issue of temporal workload imbalances caused by instantaneous differences in processing time between zones has not been addressed. Since temporal workload imbalances result in delays, this study proposes the decomposition of workloads into time slots and develops a temporal workload balancing model (TBM) that incorporates batching and sequencing based on time slot decomposition. We also develop an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic model to tackle large-scale practical problems of temporal workload imbalance. In simulation experiments, we compare the TBM model to alternative batching strategies in an order picking environment featuring consecutive batch windows. Our findings reveal that the TBM model yields an average reduction in makespan of 27.65% and 15.99% compared to random strategy and baseline method. We conclude that temporal workload balancing can minimize blocking and starving delays and maximize order picking productivity.},

  abstract     = {The aircraft routing problem has received extensive attention from researchers, prompting the utilization of diverse problem-solving approaches and the use of various metrics to inform decision-making. Despite the wealth of research, airline managers often rely heavily on their own experience when evaluating potential aircraft routing solutions. To bridge this gap and empower airline managers with a robust decision-making process, this paper proposes a novel modeling framework and decision support tool for solving the Multi-Objective Aircraft Routing Problem. Our methodological framework comprises 3 modules: (i) an efficient data handling and storage process to manage a large volume of data and ensure data tractability; (ii) a novel mixed-integer linear programming model to effectively solve the aircraft routing problem within 1 to 5 min of computation, even at large instances; (iii) a multi-objective algorithmic framework that effectively employs parallelization techniques to generate Pareto-optimal frontiers within 30 min of computation. The three components are integrated into an unified decision support tool that empowers airline managers to visualize and evaluate various aircraft routing solutions, considering multiple objectives simultaneously while leveraging the use of multi-criteria methods. To validate the proposed approach, historic data from AirAsia is used for testing. The results demonstrate the tool’s capability to generate high-quality solutions that strike a balance between conflicting objectives, affirming its practicality and effectiveness in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Health emergency due to the outbreak of a contagious virus augments the need for effective vaccine distribution strategies to control its spread. This paper suggests a two-phase strategy to solve this problem. Phase I constructs a Health Emergency Susceptibility Index for each region, considering the disease data and comorbidity situation. Phase II uses the HESI and proposes three versions of priority weights for different application scenarios. These are used as the priority weights to formulate a capacitated location problem with a multimodal network and multiple types of refrigerators. The model considers additional factors like storage capacity, locations, transportation distances (including air and ground options), costs (maintenance and transportation), and vehicle capacity. To solve the model for large networks, the paper suggests a solution approach using Benders Decomposition with extreme directions. To validate the models, we examine the case of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in India. To assess the impact of the Susceptibility Index on facility locations, proposed weightage versions are compared with a version that does not use the index. The results show that one of the three versions with weighting schemes based on the population-to-susceptibility ratio leads to the most cost-effective distribution strategy, ensuring coverage of all susceptible regions. Furthermore, the Decomposition-based solution significantly improves computational efficiency, solving the problem over fifty times faster than the commercial solver.},

  abstract     = {Car sharing is an efficient way to improve mobility, reduce the use of personal vehicles, and lessen the associated carbon emissions. Due to increasing environmental awareness of customers and government regulations, car sharing providers must be careful about the composition of their vehicle fleet to meet diverse customer demand through vehicle types with different carbon emission levels. In this study, for a car sharing company, we consider the problems of determining service regions and purchasing decisions with a mixed fleet of vehicles under budget and carbon emission constraints, and the deployment of these vehicles to service regions under uncertain one-way and round-trip rental requests over a multi-period planning horizon. We further introduce the concept of “substitution” to the car sharing operations that provides customers with alternative vehicle options when their preferred type is unavailable. To address this complex problem, we propose a novel two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program leveraging spatial–temporal networks and multicommodity flows to capture these strategic and operational decisions of this system over the planning horizon while allowing substitution in operations. We further prove that the corresponding second-stage problem of the proposed program has a totally unimodular constraint matrix. Taking advantage of this result, we develop a branch-and-cut-based decomposition algorithm with various computational enhancements. We present an extensive computational study that highlights the value of the proposed models from different perspectives and demonstrates the performance of the proposed solution algorithm with significant speedups. Our case study provides insights for region opening and fleet allocation plans under demand uncertainty and demonstrates the value of introducing substitution to car sharing operations and the importance of integrating strategic and operational decisions and obtaining stochastic solutions.},

We tested multiple instances of this case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the sample average approximation approach.

  abstract     = {The uncertainty stemming from hydrological variables and socio-economic parameters poses new challenges to river basin water resources allocation (RBWRA). Given the pressing need for efficient, environmentally friendly, and equitable solutions in RBWRA, a bi-level multi-objective interval two-stage robust stochastic programming (BLMOITRSP) model is proposed. This model aims to achieve the optimal balance among efficiency, eco-friendliness, and equity, collectively called the “3E”. A novel hierarchical mixed water allocation mechanism is introduced within this model. The basin authority pursues the “3E” objectives at the macro-control level through administrative water allocation. Conversely, sub-areas as followers prioritize economic interests, striving for economic benefit maximization through water market allocation. Furthermore, uncertain parameters (e.g., water demand) are treated as interval parameters, employing interval two-stage robust stochastic programming (ITRSP) to address uncertainty issues and control systemic risks in the model. To solve the BLMOITRSP model, we present a bi-level interactive global equilibrium optimization algorithm, fusing with the modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The bi-level algorithm provides solutions tailored to the preferences of different decision-makers. The proposed model and method are also applied to the Hanjiang River Basin in China to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. The results indicate that the proposed model effectively ensures the “3E” balance. The introduction of the hierarchical mixed water allocation mechanism proves conducive to promoting water distribution and enhancing economic benefits. ITRSP effectively controls the systemic risks of the model’s impact on the basin’s total economic benefit. The economic performance of each sub-area varies in response to different decision preferences under RBWRA schemes. Finally, the conclusions and future research directions are provided.},
