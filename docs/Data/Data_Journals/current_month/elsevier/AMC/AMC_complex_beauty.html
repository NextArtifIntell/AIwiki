  abstract     = {We present a strategy for image data sparsification based on a multiple multiresolution representation obtained through a structured tree of filterbanks, where both the filters and decimation matrices may vary with the decomposition level. As an extension of standard wavelet and wavelet-like approaches, our method also captures directional anisotropic information of the image while maintaining a controlled implementation complexity due to its filterbank structure and to the possibility of expressing the employed 2-D filters in an almost separable aspect. The focus of this work is on the transformation stage of image compression, emphasizing the sparsification of the transformed data. The proposed algorithm exploits the redundancy of the transformed image by applying an efficient sparse selection strategy, retaining a minimal yet representative subset of coefficients while preserving most of the energy of the data.},

  abstract     = {Cooperation plays a crucial role in addressing social dilemmas, yet inequality complicates the achievement of cooperation. This paper explores how environmental feedback mechanisms influence the evolution of cooperation within unequal groups. We construct a public goods game model that includes productivity and endowment inequalities and introduce a dynamic environmental feedback mechanism to study individual strategy choices in different environmental states. The results indicate that appropriate environmental feedback significantly improves cooperation levels. When there is only productivity inequality, appropriate environmental feedback increases the tendency of all individuals to cooperate, especially those with low productivity. In both productivity and endowment inequality, participants maintain a high level of cooperation when the initial endowment distribution falls within a certain range. Once the initial distribution of endowments exceeds this range, cooperative behavior quickly deteriorates. Our study provides a promising approach to enhancing the propensity for cooperation in unequal populations and highlights the significant role of adequate environmental feedback in promoting cooperation.},

  abstract     = {Statistical models are often structurally unidentifiable, because different sets of parameters can lead to equal model outcomes. To be useful for prediction and parameter inference from data, stochastic population models need to be identifiable, this meaning that model parameters can be uniquely inferred from a large number of model observations. In particular, precise estimation of feeding rates in consumer-resource dynamics is crucial, because consumer-resource processes are central in determining biomass transport across ecosystems. Model parameters are usually estimated at stationarity, because in that case model analyses are often easier. In this contribution we analyze the problem of parameter redundancy in a multi-resource consumer-resource model, showing that model identifiability depends on whether the dynamics have reached stationarity or not. To be precise, we: (i) Calculate the steady-state and out-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator&#39;s abundances analytically using generating functions, which allow us to unveil parameter redundancy and carry out proper maximum likelihood estimation. (ii) Conduct in silico experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that are either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum likelihood parameter estimation. (iii) Show that, when model observations are recorded out of equilibrium, feeding parameters are truly identifiable, whereas if sampling is done solely at stationarity, only ratios of rates can be inferred from data (i.e., parameters are redundant). We discuss the implications of our results when inferring parameters of general dynamical models.},

(2016) [1] , who determined the maximum number of maximal induced matchings in general and triangle-free graphs respectively, this paper extends their findings to connected graphs with n vertices. We establish a tight upper bound on the number of maximal and maximum induced matchings, as detailed below: { ( n 2 ) if 1 ≤ n ≤ 8 ; ( ⌊ n 2 ⌋ 2 ) ⋅ ( ⌈ n 2 ⌉ 2 ) − ( ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − 1 ) ⋅ ( ⌈ n 2 ⌉ − 1 ) + 1 if 9 ≤ n ≤ 13 ; 10 n − 1 5 + n + 144 30 ⋅ 6 n − 6 5 if 14 ≤ n ≤ 30 ; 10 n − 1 5 + n − 1 5 ⋅ 6 n − 6 5 if n ≥ 31 . This result not only provides a theoretical upper bound but also implies a practical algorithmic application: enumerating all maximal induced matchings of an n -vertex connected graph in time O ( 1.5849 n ) . Additionally, our work offers an estimate for the number of maximal dissociation sets in connected graphs with n vertices.}},

It turns out that the strong digraphs in Γ 1 consists in the circuit with 3 vertices and a family Λ of strong digraphs that contains complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs, regarded as digraphs. We also compute all distance ideals of some strong digraphs in the family Λ.

This study considers blood as an electrically conducting, non-Newtonian fluid (Jeffrey fluid) which contains magnetic nanoparticles. As blood conducts electricity, it exerts an electric force along the flow direction due to the induced magnetic force by an applied magnetic field which produces Lorentz force and influences the fluidity. Assuming that the pulsatile fluid flow is accelerated by a body force that has in slip velocity at the wall, a set of coupled nonlinear Navier–Stokes equation governing the flow networks is obtained. By employing Laplace and Hankel transforms on the partial equations, we obtain an exact solution for the velocity of flow pattern. Further, the evaluated axial velocity of both fluid and particle are used to find the physiological quantities such as shear stress, flow resistivity and volume of fluid flow. Their dependency on the Womersley parameter, Hartmann number, shape parameter, Jeffrey number and electrokinetic number are calculated numerically and explained graphically. Furthermore, the results are compared within slip and no slip velocities.},

Based on the adaptive law and the filter-gradient update law, an adaptive maneuvering controller is designed by the backstepping technique, which makes the closed-loop system is exponentially practically stable in mean square. Furthermore, both the path tracking error and the velocity assignment error converge to neighborhoods of zero, and the radius of these neighborhoods can be adjusted arbitrarily small by tuning independent parameters.

To conserve communication resources, we introduce an ETS into the reset observer-based containment controller. To avoid Zeno behavior, a trigger known as the “Zeno-free trigger” is introduced, which prevents Zeno behavior by setting a fixed triggering interval as the lower bound of the event-triggered interval. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed protocol is demonstrated through a case involving a formation of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). By comparing the reset observer with the Luenberger observer, the superior performance of the reset observer is demonstrated.},

Evolutionary game theory (EGT) emerges in this setting as a crucial paradigm to address this complex issue. In this study, an EGT-based Vicsek with a fixed number of neighbors is proposed. It assumed that the agent had a limited view and just considered a certain number of neighbors. Agents exhibit varying movement patterns depending on the strategies they choose. Each agent&#39;s payoff depends on balancing the benefits of group movement against the communication costs with selected neighbors. Using the Fermi rule, individuals adjust their strategies accordingly. The study indicates that agents achieve the highest levels of cooperation and the fastest convergence times in high-density environments. When density is constant, increasing the number of neighbors enhances the synchronization; when the number of neighbors remains unchanged, a lower density leads to better synchronization. Additionally, the results show that EGT could boost the synchronization and accelerate the convergence of self-propelled agents.},

Therefore, the design of network structure and network reliability evaluation are particularly significant. In recent years, connectivity, especially h -conditional restricted connectivity, has been widely discussed by scholars. In this paper, a family of composite network is constructed on the basis of complete graph K l ( l ≥ 3 is an odd integer), named conditional recursive networks (simply called CRNs). It contains the common network alternating group network ( A N m ) and some unknown networks. In order to further reflect the reliability of composite network CRNs, we determine connectivity and h -conditional restricted connectivity for 0 ≤ h ≤ l − 1 . As an application, we get the connectivity and h -conditional restricted connectivity of A N m directly.},
