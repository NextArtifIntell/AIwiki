We show how this connection reduces to G ( Ω ) , the group of transformations that preserve the positive cone Ω of the algebra V , and to A u t ( V ) , the group of Jordan automorphisms of the algebra. We present the cone Ω as a homogeneous space for the action of G ( Ω ) , therefore inducing a quotient Finsler metric and distance. With the techniques introduced, we prove the minimality of the one-parameter groups in Ω for any symmetric gauge norm in V . We establish that the two presentations of the Finsler metric in Ω give the same distance there, which helps us prove the minimality of certain paths in G ( Ω ) for its left-invariant Finsler metric.},

We apply the Nörlund sum, the Euler operator for derivative, ad the (inverse) Laplace transform to reach this aim. We also aim to prove a functional equation involving the Nörlund sum and the (inverse) Laplace transform. Moreover, by combining these operators with functional equations of the generating functions, we derive some new formulas for the Apostol type polynomials and k th moment of the geometric distribution. Finally, applying these operators, we not only find new the Riemann integral formulas, but also construct interpolation functions related to the Lerch zeta and the Hurwitz zeta functions for these polynomials.},

Inspired by the refined basic coupling method for autonomous systems, we establish exponential contractivity of solutions of non-autonomous SDEs, where the coefficients are non-uniformly dissipative, and the requirements of Lévy measure corresponding to the Lévy process are not harsh (only with a truncated α -stable component). Based on this, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of the random periodic solutions in distribution by the criterion of the existence and uniqueness of the periodic Markov process.

Each admissible transport network studied here is represented by a transport multi-path between measures, with a capacity constraint on each of its components. The associated transport cost is given by the sum of the M α -cost of each component. Using this new formulation, we prove the existence of an optimal solution and provide an upper bound on the number of components for the solution. Additionally, we conduct analytical examinations of the properties (e.g. “map-compatibility”, and “simple common-source property”) of each solution component and explore the interplay among components, particularly in the discrete case.},

We investigate in this paper the correspondence of structure-preserving maps between Hermitian spaces on the one hand and between the associated linear orthosets on the other hand. Our particular focus is on adjointable maps. We show that, under a mild assumption, adjointable maps between linear orthosets are induced by quasilinear maps between Hermitian spaces and if the latter are linear, they are adjointable as well. Specialised versions of this correlation lead to Wigner-type theorems; we see, for instance, that orthoisomorphisms between the orthosets associated with at least 3-dimensional Hermitian spaces are induced by quasiunitary maps. In addition, we point out that orthomodular spaces of dimension ⩾4 can be characterised as irreducible Fréchet orthosets such that the inclusion map of any subspace is adjointable. Together with a transitivity condition, we may in this way describe the infinite-dimensional classical Hilbert spaces.},
