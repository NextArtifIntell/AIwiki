  abstract     = {The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought new challenges in device identification. Accurately identifying IoT devices connected to a network is vital for effective resource management, network planning, security threat detection, and handling anomalous traffic. However, existing traffic-based device identification approaches have shortcomings in terms of accuracy, stability, identification granularity, etc. In this study, we introduce LFIoTDI, a lightweight and fine-grained device identification method leveraging machine learning to enhance IoT security. Based on an innovative feature set, LFIoTDI can accomplish device identification on resources-constraint IoT devices with just a single network-layer packet. Additionally, a key feature of LFIoTDI is its use of the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for real-time updates to the device identification model, greatly enhancing the model’s scalability. Extensive evaluation experiments on the CIC, UNSW, and SMPS datasets demonstrate LFIoTDI’s exceptional performance, achieving accuracies of 99.08%, 98.15%, and 95.28%, respectively, while maintaining minimal system overhead. These results highlight its broad effectiveness in the IoT environment.},

  abstract     = {In modern society, cloud computing has emerged as an indispensable infrastructure. Nevertheless, as the cloud ecosystem grows increasingly vast and complex, a series of novel security challenges have surfaced, among which artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered advanced malware has provided network attackers with even more stealthy and potent weapons. While existing malware detection technologies can still maintain a certain level of defense against traditional security threats, the instant detection and response to these sophisticated AI-crafted threats become exceedingly difficult, consuming substantial remediation time and security resources. To address the balance between control costs and effectiveness, recognizing the intricately intertwined and dynamically interactive nature of the offensive and defensive parties, this paper introduces the framework of differential game theory, delving into the strategies for controlling the propagation of advanced malware in cloud environments. Firstly, we construct an advanced malware propagation control model targeting each virtual machine. On this basis, we define the specific categories of strategy selection for both the offensive and defensive sides, as well as their respective cost-benefit relationships, and formulate an attack-defense game problem. Subsequently, we rigorously demonstrate, from a mathematical theoretical perspective, that the optimal solution (i.e., Nash equilibrium) to the attack-defense game problem is indeed attainable, and we devise a dedicated accelerated algorithm for its solution. Finally, we conduct comparative experiments on three real-world datasets using three distinct strategies, and the analysis results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The digitalization of Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) is becoming a key objective in modern society. The increasing complexity of contemporary WDSs, driven by urbanization, fluctuating consumer demand, and limited resources, makes their management particularly challenging, especially in large-scale scenarios. This paper proposes the SWI-FEED framework designed to facilitate the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) for enhanced monitoring and optimization of WDSs. The framework aims to investigate the utilization of massive IoT in monitoring and optimizing WDSs in different contexts, with a particular focus on four use cases such as optimal node activation, IoT gateways deployment, distributed leakage detection and water demand disaggregation. SWI-FEED has been tested with predefined network models available in the Open Water Analytics community public repository. Specifically, the four use cases are evaluated using a large network consisting of 4,419 sensor nodes, 3 tanks and 5,066 pipes. Overall, this comprehensive framework provides a holistic approach to address possible challenges of a WDS and optimize the efficiency of large-scale IoT deployments. It reduces the energy consumption of IoT devices within the WDS while enhancing leak detection and localization capabilities in real-world water networks. Our adopted theoretical methodology is based on graph theory, which allows IoT gateways to be strategically positioned to maximize network coverage and minimize infrastructure redundancy. This makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of gateways required and, consequently, the overall system energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {While 6G networks, reliant on software, promise significant advancements, the proliferation of diverse applications deployed closer to users poses considerable privacy challenges. To counter this, privacy-first software development, as advocated by DevPrivOps, becomes essential. While Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are frequently used, their limitations are well-documented. DevPrivOps strives to reinforce software privacy through prioritization, compliance, transparency, optimization, and informed decision-making. A promising alternative to PETs involves quantifying privacy to guide development and pinpoint potential threats, thus enhancing application privacy before deployment on OpenSlice network services. Privacy-centric malicious application detection, amongst other features, is a key component of this privacy quantification framework, serving to inform users of potential harm from such applications. In this study, we focus on privacy-centric malicious application detection. ASAP 2.0, an autonomous system, identifies these threats by scrutinizing requested application permissions. Building on its antecedent, ASAP 2.0 employs a tuned autoencoder trained via unsupervised learning. By analyzing reconstruction errors, it differentiates between potentially harmful and benign applications. A dynamically adjusted threshold assists in the decision-making process. Our model, validated on three public datasets, achieved an average Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.976, outperforming baseline models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.},

  abstract     = {Knowing the role of entities in a network undermines anonymity and facilitates the identification of their behavioral patterns. In many existing low-latency anonymity network structures, the creation and use of tunnels for packet transmission allow adversaries to discern the roles of entities. This paper explores the impact of identifying these tunnels, specifically how such identification can expose an entity’s role in relation to a particular message, potentially reducing the level of anonymity in the network. To explore this, we first discuss two key aspects of anonymity networks: the distribution of information and the homogeneity of roles. We then analyze several low-latency anonymity structures to assess vulnerabilities related to tunnel identification, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses based on the aforementioned aspects. In addition, we propose a novel network structure that addresses these vulnerabilities by eliminating the conventional tunnel mechanism, which typically requires a tunnel establishment message. This change prevents adversaries from identifying an entity’s role. In the proposed structure, the sender and intermediate relays work together to select distinct routes for each packet, removing the need for the sender to establish a dedicated data tunnel. To provide a deeper analysis, we will describe in detail the information an attacker can obtain by tracing tunneling messages and how this compromises anonymity by exposing the roles of entities. We will also evaluate how these changes affect the degree of anonymity based on the attacker’s knowledge. Our evaluation shows that the proposed technique effectively eliminates traffic patterns that would normally reveal the roles of entities, thus neutralizing the attacker’s ability to compromise anonymity. As a result, the average level of anonymity is significantly improved compared to previous structures. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed approach offers a more effective strategy for concealing the roles of entities compared to earlier methods.},
