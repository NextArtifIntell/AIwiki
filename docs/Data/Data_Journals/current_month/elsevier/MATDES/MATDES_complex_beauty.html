  abstract     = {This study investigates the effects of annealing temperature on the microstructural evolution, texture development, deformation behavior, and mechanical properties of hot-rolled pure Molybdenum (Mo) sheets. A comprehensive analysis was conducted through the combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine specimens annealed at temperatures ranging from 1000 K to 1600 K. The microstructural characterization revealed a progressive transformation from elongated grains to more equiaxed structures with increasing annealing temperature. The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis demonstrated significant texture evolution, with the &lt; 100&gt;//ND and &lt; 110&gt;//RD fiber texture showing remarkable temperature dependence. The MD simulations provided atomic-level insights into the orientation-dependent deformation mechanisms and dislocation evolution. Annealing at 1300 K optimized the mechanical properties, achieving a desirable synergy between strength (900 MPa) and ductility (22 %). This study provides valuable insights into the processing-structure–property relationships in hot-rolled Mo sheets, offering guidance for tailoring their properties for nuclear reactor applications.},

  abstract     = {Silicon carbide particle-reinforced aluminum matrix composites (SiC P /Al) represent a novel structural material. The performance differences between the SiC particles and the Al matrix result in a non-uniform distribution of residual stresses within the composite, which significantly affecting its mechanical properties. This study characterizes the residual stress distribution patterns within the SiC particles at the micron-scale using micro-Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It also analyzes the fracture behavior of these particles, considering the influence of residual stresses, through a combination of geometric phase analysis (GPA) and the Yoffe model. The interior of SiC particle experiences residual tensile stress, whereas the interface region is under compressive stress. Additionally, irregular SiC particle shapes contribute to fluctuations in residual stress. The fracture behavior is primarily influenced by a combination of factors, including residual stresses arising from thermal mismatch and externally induced loads. TEM observations confirm the presence of Mg-Si IMC at the interface of the composite material. These compounds form a coherent interface with both the Al matrix and SiC phase enhancing interfacial properties. A high dislocation density in the microstrain regions adjacent to the coherent interface is identified as the main contributor to residual stress at the interface of composite material.},

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), widely used in ultra-clean flow control due to its excellent corrosion resistance, is also susceptible to erosion under cavitation. This study investigates cavitation-induced erosion of PTFE using an ultrasonic cavitation test bench. A comprehensive characterization and analysis of the eroded surfaces and released particles were performed. Results revealed that PTFE particles exhibit two distinct morphologies—brittle and ductile—on the micrometer scale, corresponding to cavitation sites. Moreover, cavitation was found to decrease PTFE crystallinity, with evidence suggesting that particle release may be accompanied by chemical reactions. These findings provide valuable insights into PTFE behavior under cavitation conditions.},

Currently, Bistable symmetric curved beam structure (BCBS) mechanical metamaterial is promising route that can balance energy absorption performance and recoverability, but still remain the threat of excessive negative stiffness. Here, beyond BCBS metamaterial, we propose a novel mechanical metamaterial of elliptical sandwich curved beam structure (ESCBS), which utilize the stiffness complementarity of elliptical rings and curved beams. Besides, the ESCBS metamaterial has a self-filtering effect on the violently destructive high-frequency components of mechanical impacts due to its low natural frequency. Thus, the ESCBS metamaterial enhances the energy absorption performance (above 50 % decrease in impact peak) and recoverability(above 90 % structural integrity) under extreme strong mechanical impacts (up to 25000 g ). Further, to realize self-monitoring and alarming, an endogenous triboelectric self-powered sensor is constituted inside the ESCBS metamaterial via polyurethane foam penetration without any space or energy cost. Thus, the proposed ESCBS metamaterial can serve as a representative metamaterial for safe and intelligent vehicle personnel helmets and fuze systems, and is expected to have a broad commercial application in future.},

An ideal guided bone regeneration (GBR) membrane should inhibit bacterial infection initially and regulate immune cells subsequently to achieve desired bone repair. In this study, the polycaprolactone (PCL) membranes were coated with AgNPs via triple layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly (hereafter referred as “PCL-3Ag”). The fabrication process successfully endowed the PCL-3Ag membranes with excellent antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects due to the abundant release of Ag initially, and promoted lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages polarization to M2 phenotype due to the slower and steady release of Ag in the subsequent stage. The regulation of PCL-3Ag on macrophages promoted the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells in vitro . In vivo , superior bone regeneration with decreased number of CD86-positive cells and increased number of CD163-positive cells was observed in rat calvaria defects covered with PCL-3Ag membranes compared with defects covered with PCL membranes or uncovered defects. Overall, the LbL self-assembled antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory PCL-3Ag membrane presented here enhances tissue repair and shows excellent potential for application to bone tissue engineering.},

In this study, an Fe-W material library with 169 unique samples is sputter-deposited to investigate the amorphous-crystalline transition across the Fe – 9.4 to 45.5 at.% W range. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy techniques reveal trends in film microstructure and morphology that are intrinsically connected to alloy composition but further shown to be dependent on synthesis conditions by decoupling composition and thickness/deposition rate effects. Samples are classified into three distinct regimes: crystalline, mixed-mode, or X-ray amorphous. By deconvoluting and analyzing the interplay between composition and deposition rate, it is shown that growth kinetics can sufficiently alter phase formation to dominate compositionally driven mechanisms within a single material library. This observation is verified after heat-treatment to 750 °C on selected samples. Particularly within the mixed-mode regime, the relationship between solute content and deposition rate is quantified, thereby enabling the tailoring of materials libraries investigations of composition and growth rate effects. Overall, this work combines the expansive compositional space in a combinatorial library with sputtering science to identify microstructural and phase regime boundaries in the Fe-W system.},

However, additively manufactured H13 exhibits inferior mechanical properties, high residual stress, and high volume fraction of retained austenite, which limits its application. To solve this problem, our work aims to optimize the microstructure and mechanical properties of H13 steel using Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM) with different thermal compensation strategies. The microstructural evolution and mechanical property strengthening mechanism of SEBM-fabricated H13 steels were discussed. The results indicated that the microstructure of H13 steel is a mixture of bainite and martensite, achieving an optimal balance between strength of 1809 ± 11 MPa and plasticity of 10.48 % when the thermal compensation current was 40 mA. This can be attributed to adjustments in grain size, dislocation density, and precipitate phases during thermal compensation strategies. The synergistic strengthening effects of high density of dislocations, numerous fine V 8 C 7 precipitates, and refined grains result in mechanical properties that surpass those of other additive manufacturing and conventional methods. Therefore, controlled thermal compensation was an effective tool for regulating the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials, providing a valuable reference for the fabrication of high-performance H13 steel components.},

A three-dimensional digital twin model of the interfacial zone in OGFC-13 was developed using X-ray computed tomography (CT) and an enhanced U-Net deep learning algorithm. The model delineated a three-level dispersion system (TDS) within the interfacial zone, outlining the distribution ranges of each system. Furthermore, the distribution of each zone within the interfacial zone’s three-level dispersion system was validated through micro-mechanical, morphological analyses, elemental analyses, and theoretical calculations. The reliability of the enhanced U-Net deep learning algorithm in processing mesoscopic images was confirmed by segmenting asphalt mixture images. The digital twin model reveals that within the three-level dispersion system of the interfacial zone in OGFC-13, the pure asphalt area spans 8–25 µm, the asphalt mastic area ranges from 30 to 108 µm, and the asphalt mortar area extends from 300 to 1360 µm.

The model was applied to quantify the uncertainty in damage evolution and service lifetime of TBCs on rotating turbine blades. Meantime, the key factors influencing TBCs failure are also analyzed. The prediction results revealed that after 600 cycles, the failure probability of TBCs on the suction side tip and the pressure side middle region of the rotating blade reached 80 %. This indicates that the spallation of TBCs has occurred in these regions, with an area of about 9 %. The spallation position and area of the experimental results are relatively consistent with the predicted results. The thermal expansion coefficient of the thermally grown oxide and temperature were identified as the most critical factors influencing TBCs lifetime.},

Therefore, segmented APS-TBCs with channeled surface cracks is considered a superior coating system for improving the combustion efficiency of advanced engines. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for its enhanced strain tolerance and service durability compared to conventional ones have not yet been fully elucidated. This article reveals this mechanism by investigating the residual stress evolutions in segmented and conventional APS-TBCs. We fabricate both types of APS-TBC samples and conduct isothermal cyclic oxidation service on them. Then, we measure the residual stresses of YSZ TC and TGO using Raman spectroscopy (RS) method and Photoluminescence piezo-spectroscopy (PLPS) method, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the segmented sample exhibited 2.5 times of service durability compared to the conventional sample. Through detailed analysis, we find that the macro-compliance mechanisms played a crucial role in governing the enhanced service performance of segmented samples. This macro-compliance effect is achieved by lowering the residual stress at given stain level through surface cracks, and thus results in improved interfacial integrity compared to conventional ones. The discoveries in this study contribute towards comprehending microstructure design and selection of APS-TBCs.},

In this study, we aim to develop high performance and biocompatible NIR-II probes based on novel mechanism of the aggregation of NIR fluorephores. Using domain effect of liposomal nanostructures, the J-aggregated state of indocyanine (ICG) NIR-II nanoprobes were elaborately fabricated. Combined with molecular dynamics simulation, the molecular mechanism of the formation of J-aggregated state of ICG molecules was discovered. Results show that the engineered J-aggregated state of ICG with a concentration below 50 μg/mL can fine tune ICG interactions instead of ICG-intermolecular interactions within liposomal structure. The rational designed ICG cationic liposomes (IJA-CLPs) show 3-fold enhancement in NIR-II intensity compared to the conventional ICG liposomes (ICG-CLPs). Furthermore, for a mouse model of mammary tumors with lymph node metastasis, IF7 peptide-modified IJA-CLPs (IF7-IJA-CLPs) can successfully discriminate tumor cell-metastasized lymph nodes with more than 4-fold fluorescence signal improvement. Thus, it is expected to provide a new avenue for designing NIR-II fluorescent probes for enriching the clinical NIR imaging applications.},

With the rising prevalence of diabetes, the number of patients with diabetic wounds is also increasing. In this context, a novel fiber dressing for diabetic wounds has been developed using coaxial electrospinning combined with self-assembly coating technology. The uniform distribution of the TA (tannic acid) coating enhances the mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and cell adhesion of PLGA-PCL core–shell fibers while imparting anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant capabilities. The drug Cur (curcumin), loaded in the core layer of the coaxial electrospun fibers, promotes angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and cellular anti-senescence capacity, while the shell layer facilitates drug encapsulation and sustained release. In vivo experiments, the electrospun fibers serve as an active skin substitute, creating a favorable microenvironment for diabetic wound healing.

  abstract     = {Quantifying delamination energy is crucial for the reliability and longevity of thin films. In this work, the delamination energy in tungsten-silicon thin films is investigated through nanoindentation and nanoscratching. Nanoindentation was also employed to assess the mechanical properties of the coating through the use of substrate corrections. Energy methods were used to analyse the nanoindentation load displacement curves to quantify the delamination energy. Finite element modelling was used to further improve the accuracy of the calculated delamination energy. Nanoscratching was found to be highly sensitive to the scratch parameters used, and the effect of scratch parameters on the critical load and delamination energy was investigated. It was found that the presence of fragmentation event in nanoscratching led to higher delamination energy values as compared to nanoindentation. Nanoindentation was found to output values closer to that of literature and were additionally not parameter sensitive, making it a reliable method of evaluating thin film adhesion.},

  abstract     = {Bone is a hierarchically structured composite material, the basic building blocks are type I collagen, hydroxyapatite and water. Water has a major influence on load transfer by facilitating interface sliding. This has a considerable effect on the quasi-static mechanical properties. For this reason, bone must be characterized at quasi physiological conditions, in order to understand the mechanisms allowing inelastic deformation and causing fracture. In the current work, compression tests were performed on 419 ovine cortical bone micropillars at the lamellar length scale in axial and transverse fibril orientation. Experiments were carried out at varying strain rates (0.1 s −1 - 100s −1 ), temperatures (24°C − 60°C) and tissue water contents (3.1 – 8.3 wt%), allowing to study the influence of these crucial factors. The effect of temperature and water on the mechanical properties could be separated by applying a linear modeling approach. This results in a temperature related softening of 1.2 MPa/K and 33–111 MPa/wt.% water. The results of this study highlight the significance of temperature and tissue water content on the compressive strength of bone and are of value for future multiscale simulations of patient fracture risk allowing to take into account age and disease related decrease in bone water content.},

A hollow n-shaped TMS based on copper foil was developed, exhibiting two distinct resonance peaks between 0.3 and 1.4 THz. The formation mechanisms of resonance peaks were analyzed based on electric field and current distribution, while the sensing performance of the TMS was investigated. In the forward optimization stage, the n-shaped unit of TMS was converted into a data matrix, and the CNN was developed to predict the resonance frequency. In the inverse design stage, a predictive model for estimating the size of the TMS was developed by applying one-dimensional convolution to the transmission coefficients. The training dataset employed for forward optimization and inverse design achieved coefficients of determination (R 2 ) of 0.99 and 0.99, respectively, with corresponding mean absolute error (MAE) values of 3.90 and 1.04. The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurements of TMS. Experimental assessments were conducted on glucose solutions of varying concentrations to ascertain the sensing capabilities. The proposed method contributes to the efficient design and optimization of TMS.},

  abstract     = {Dense and fine-grained high entropy transition metal carbides are considered as one of the most promising materials with superior hardness, fracture toughness and electrical conductivity. However, the difficulty in preparing high-quality fine-grained samples limits their wide applications. In this work, fully dense and fine-grained (Ti 0.2 Zr 0.2 Nb 0.2 Hf 0.2 Ta 0.2 )C ceramics were prepared by high temperature and high pressure technique. Ultra-high pressure significantly accelerates the densification process and significantly lowers the sintering temperature due to the pressure-induced grain fusion and grain growth suppression effect. The monolith sintered at 1200 ℃ and 15 GPa exhibits a Vickers hardness of 27.9 GPa (9.8 N), and a high fracture toughness of 8.9 MPa·m 1/2 , both of which are the highest values for the reported high-entropy carbide ceramics. Advanced characterization demonstrates that high hardness and toughness are closely related to the high dislocation density, fine grain size, and the high relative density. Additionally, the sintering temperature is significantly reduced by applying pressure, which provides a general route for preparing advanced polycrystalline high-entropy carbide ceramics for more superior mechanical properties.},

The results show that compared with MoS 2 , WC remains disadvantaged in terms of heat competition in the molten pool. However, during MoS 2 thermal decomposition, the free Cr atoms in the pool are also captured, not only changing the type and morphology of the M x C y carbides and inhibiting WC heat damage but also resulting in a decreased content of M x C y carbides within the coating. When a significant amount of Cr x S y gathers on the coating surface, a stable and continuous lubricating film is formed, allowing the coating to balance the wear resistance with lubrication.},

  abstract     = {Architectured metamaterials typically comprise of unit cells with cubic stiffness tensors and this cubic symmetry greatly restricts the available design space of mechanical properties than can be attained. In this paper, this conventional design approach is challenged by creating metamaterials that have monoclinic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal symmetries, to provide additional design freedoms. The building block to these symmetry classes is a novel monoclinic unit cell, which is generated via the shape transformation of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS). The monoclinic TPMS-based unit cell exhibits the most extreme stiffness anisotropy of the four symmetry classes in addition to possessing normal−shear and shear−shear mechanical coupling. Although the monoclinic cells only have one internal plane of symmetry, the faces of the unit cells remain periodic, which enables periodic boundary conditions to be applied in finite element analysis (FEA) and the characterisation of the unit cell homogenised stiffness tensors. Next, a wide range of these TPMS-based metamaterials were additively manufactured in polylactic acid and tested under quasi-static compression. Both the FEA and experimental test results confirm that stiffness anisotropy and mechanical coupling can be controlled, revealing an expanded design space for the stiffness tailoring of additively manufactured metamaterials.},

In this study we have trained MLIP using moment tensor potentials to simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent β-Ti 94-x Nb x Zr 6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the β-Ti 94-x Nb x Zr 6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young’s modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.},

  abstract     = {Polylactic acid (PLA) holds great potentials in biomedical applications, but its inherent brittleness restricts its versatility to a considerable degree. This study proposed a novel and heterogeneous modifier-free approach to enhance PLA’s toughness by leveraging the stretching induced evolution of stereocomplex crystal (SC) microstructures in situ formed during microinjection molding. By incorporating 10 wt% poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) into poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) through combining melt compounding and microinjection molding featuring extremely intense shear, we achieved a remarkable 10-fold increase in elongation at break (from 8.7 % to 87.2 %) while maintaining tensile strength (∼67 MPa). The structural analyses revealed a transition from phase-separated sea-island morphologies to deformable stereocomplex crystal PLA phase domains, which could serve as the physical crosslinking points facilitating stress transfer, and can be transformed into microfibril and shish-kebab structures upon drawing. Such the phase structure evolution could efficiently distribute stress and hence enhance toughness without sacrificing biodegradability or biocompatibility. This work develops a streamlined approach in simplifying conventional stereocomplex reinforcement strategies and thus offers a scalable method for developing fully biodegradable, and high-performance PLA-based materials suitable for diverse biomedical applications, such as bone tissue reconstruction.},

However, existing works often prioritize high sensitivity at the expense of strain tolerance and require complex fabrication procedures. Herein, we present an environmentally friendly, low-cost, and nonionic fabrication approach for a 2H-phase molybdenum disulfide (2H-MoS 2 )-enhanced multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) strain sensor, developed via a systematically optimized vacuum-assisted filtration process. This study is the first to validate the dual enhancement effect of MoS 2 , leveraging its shear-exfoliation properties to simultaneously improve strain gauge performance and mechanical robustness. The resulting nacre-like layered hybrid nanocomposite achieves a remarkable gauge factor of 675.7 (R 2 ∼0.993) at low strain (∼0–4.5 %), representing a 3881.5 % improvement over pure MWCNT systems, alongside enhanced toughness (∼89.17 %) and strain tolerance (∼53.93 %). Meanwhile, the optimized composition ensures low rest-state resistance (∼13.1 Ω), minimal hysteresis (∼5.7 %), and robust durability over 5000 cycles at 10 % strain. As a result, the proposed sensor enables highly consistent, high-fidelity monitoring of various subtle-to-moderate biomotions. Integrated with a fine-tuned InceptionTime deep learning model, it achieves an F1-score of 98 % in classifying Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI)-standard swallowing activities, demonstrating its potential for AI-driven health monitoring applications.},

This paper proposes a multi-layer cylindric soft actuator with axial tensile stiffness variation, and pneumatic control is utilized to achieve axial elongation and resistance adjustment. The resistance is changed through the stick–slip friction of soft structure during tooth structures engagement and sliding, and the tensile stiffness of the soft actuator can be changed by 7.2 times with air pressure increased by only 20 kPa. Capacitive strain sensing is used to obtain elongation and stiffness feedback, and the closed-loop control errors for axial elongation and stiffness variation are only 2.02 % and 1.20 %, respectively.

The extensive accumulation of brittle Ti 2 Ni at the bottom of the weld pool leads to stress concentration and is the main cause of crack initiation. X-ray diffraction and phase diagrams revealed the solidification sequence of liquid metal in the joint, including L → N i T i , L + N i T i → Ti 2 N i , L → β T i + Ti 2 N i . Electron backscatter diffraction analysis showed that weld nugget grains exhibited random orientation, with stress concentration mainly within the Ti 2 Ni phase on the Ti6Al4V side and at the boundary between the NiTi and Ti 2 Ni phases, contributing to high susceptibility to deformation and cracking in these regions. Nanoindentation analysis further demonstrated that the welding process diminished the superelastic performance of NiTi, attributable to Ti 2 Ni phase, grain coarsening and the orientation deviation of B2 NiTi.},

In this context, hybrid specimens combining AM/CM subparts were produced, where AM subparts were created using DED, CM parts by hot forming, and the two were joined using laser welding. The material analysed is soft martensitic stainless steel. Mechanical characterisation was performed through tensile testing and hardness measurements and microstructure characterisation through EBSD, SEM, EDS, and light microscopy. The study reveals the presence of ultra-fine grains in the heat treated laser weld segments which suggests grain subdivision due to martensite deformation. As built hybrid specimens exhibited lower toughness due to the laser welds and lower strength due to the CM segments. The weakest point after the heat treatment was the HAZ of the CM segment. The best mechanical performance was observed in homogeneously heat-treated AM specimens. Moreover, the variability in grain size were examined but did not conform grain boundary strengthening, particularly after the heat treatment. This study highlights the critical influence of microstructural variations on the mechanical properties of hybrid welds, emphasizing the need for further investigation into strengthening mechanisms and individual heat treatments.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the microstructural changes and mechanical behavior of an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Sc-(V-Ni) alloy during hot compression, conducted at temperatures ranging from 340 to 460°C and strain rates from 0.01 to 10 s −1 . Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to examine dislocation evolution and mechanical behavior. The peak power dissipation values (ν) for the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Sc and Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Sc-V-Ni alloys were 35 % and 41 %, respectively, reflecting enhanced energy dissipation with V and Ni additions. The second-phase strengthening effects of Al 7 Cu 4 Ni (HCP-type) and Al 21 V 2 (FCC-type) significantly increased the high-temperature flow stress of alloy. During hot compression of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Sc-V-Ni alloy, typical (111)[110] and (111)[001] perfect dislocations were observed. The accumulation of dislocations facilitated diffusion pathways, accelerating the precipitation of the η-MgZn 2 phase. The addition of Sc, V, and Ni increased the number of 1/6 &lt; 112 &gt; Shockley partial dislocations and 1/2 &lt; 110 &gt; Perfect dislocations at elevated temperatures, thereby enhancing the alloy’s compression resistance.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the realm of crystalline materials has witnessed a surge in the development of generative models, predominantly aimed at the inverse design of crystals with tailored physical properties. However, spatial symmetry, which serves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the design process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry, potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and generation have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES. Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target the specific physical properties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot learning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of computational materials discovery.},

  abstract     = {The use of silver-coated copper powders (SCCPs) is a promising approach to reduce costs in the photovoltaic industry. However, the anti-oxidation performance of SCCPs directly determines their reliability in practical applications. This study aims to design an efficient approach for optimizing process parameters to enhance anti-oxidation performance of SCCPs. An innovative co-optimization strategy integrating response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to optimize process parameters. The effects of interactions between process parameters on the anti-oxidation performance of SCCPs were investigated using RSM. The optimal parameter combination (ascorbic acid concentration: 0.05 mol/L, pH: 7, and feeding rate: 15 mL/min) was determined, and the results were predicted using ANN. The strategy achieves superior optimization efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to individual methods by reducing experimental requirements, lowering error functions, and enhancing fitting precision. Experimental results demonstrated that the co-optimization strategy reduced the oxidation weight gain of SCCPs by 60 % under dynamic heating conditions in an atmospheric environment, with a prediction error of 2.45 %. The co-optimization strategy successfully enhanced both the antioxidant properties and powder quality of SCCPs.

This wave-focusing capability enhances the energy-harvesting performance of piezoelectric transducers and improves defect detection sensitivity in non-destructive evaluation (NDE) applications. While GRIN-PC lenses have been extensively studied for planar structures, their application to curved geometries remains limited, primarily due to the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding wave behavior in non-planar phononic crystal structures. In this work, we develop a conformal GRIN-PC theory to analyze elastic wave focusing in curved structures and propose a systematic design framework for implementing GRIN-PC lenses on non-planar surfaces. The proposed theory models wave propagation within conformal GRIN-PC lenses using ray trajectory analysis, accurately predicting the focal region. We validate this framework through numerical simulations of a conformal GRIN-PC lens applied to a steel pipe and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting focal points. Furthermore, the design framework is applied to fabricate a 3D-printed conical GRIN-PC lens, with numerical simulations and experimental results confirming its wave-focusing performance. This work establishes a foundation for expanding GRIN-PC applications to non-planar structural components widely found in mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering structures.},

The QZS feature is achieved by incorporating an additional arc segment, which serves as an elastic boundary, extending from the end of the cosine beam to the rigid walls. The matching mechanism between the arc segment and the cosine-shaped segment is analyzed through a static mechanical parametric analysis using the finite element method, while metastructures fabricated using 3D printing techniques are employed to experimentally validate the conceptual design. The relationships between the QZS features and the design parameters are established through a parametric analysis. A QZS isolator consisting of metastructures is designed, and its dynamic performances are verified by the experimental tests and an analytical model. The QZS isolator demonstrated a 70% reduction in peak transmissibility and a 25% lower beginning frequency of vibration compared to the nonlinear isolator lacking the QZS feature, highlighting the advantageous low-frequency vibration isolation capability of the QZS isolator. Moreover, the proposed QZS metastructure demonstrates a programmable capability by adjusting the number of units and beams.

In this work, triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are employed to generate graded porous structures, where the continuous porosity gradient is controlled by a mathematical function involving geometric parameters. A hybrid homogenization technique, combined with the transfer matrix method (TMM), is used to predict the normal incidence absorption coefficient of the graded TPMS structure. The porosity distribution along the thickness is then optimized using a global search method combined with a local gradient-based solver to maximize acoustic absorption within a target frequency range. The optimization results suggest that a combination of high- and low-porosity layers achieves broadband impedance matching conditions by shifting the so-called quarter-wavelength resonance frequencies. The design of the TPMS absorbers is validated through impedance tube measurements of 3D-printed samples.},

A GLPD-elongation curve, called numerical elongation calibration curve, is numerically constructed, revealing that the elongation of ESW105 changes around 22.1% when the GLPD changes from 3.98 to 5. A concept of cyber standard tensile test (CSTT) of the numerical specimen with a fixed GLPD of five, based on finite element method (FEM) with accurate flow functions, is proposed to improve the objectivity of tensile testing of circular specimens. The CSTT removes the effect of the gage length of the cylindrical tensile test on the tensile testing results.

However, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, their Curie temperature hardly exceeds room temperature.

Through the first-principles and Monte Carlo calculations, we design a family of 2D room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic half-metals Cr 2 X P ( X =S, Se, Te) with large magnetization, high Curie temperatures (&gt;660 K), sizable half-metallic gap and good structural stability. Their large magnetic moments ∼ 7µ B arise from the exchange splitting of Cr- d orbital in the D 4h crystal field, and the ferromagnetic coupling is derived from the Cr-P-Cr super-exchange interaction mediated by P atom, the origin of wide half-metallic gap (&gt;1.24 eV) is briefly from the exchange splitting of d xy and d xz / d yz orbitals. In addition, the Cr 2 SP and Cr 2 SeP show the out-of-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAEs) of 188.25 and 46.57 µeV/f.u., and the Cr 2 TeP possess an in-plane MAE of 329.01 µeV/f.u.

Features of inclusions, especially shape and size, affect the two-phase composites’ effective elastic moduli significantly. However, previous studies have not considered the coupling effects of the inclusion shape, size, and volume fraction. To address this problem, a new normalized theoretical model (modified three-point approximation TPA) is proposed to predict the coupling effects of these factors by introducing two parameters: sphericity and skewness. Then, this work considers the two-phase composite containing inclusions (non-spherical particles of different shapes) and the matrix. The non-spherical particle packing structures are created by the discrete element method. Based on the particulate structures, the reliability of the proposed modified TPA can be verified by the numerical simulation using the lattice model. The correction parameters for sphericity and skewness are 1.21 and −0.58, respectively. The new modified TPA demonstrates that the elastic moduli increase when the number of smaller particles decreases and the particle shape approaches the sphere. The newly proposed modified TPA is significant for designing and applying particulate composites.},

  abstract     = {Bivalves populate various marine environments and follow diverse lifestyles: attaching to substrates, burrowing into sediments or swimming in water. Their shells play a crucial role in the survival of organisms as they shield the soft tissue from external attacks and facilitate their respective lifestyles. Valve movement is controlled by one or two adductor muscles and the hinge. While the function and structure of adductor muscles can vary, the shell-muscle attachment develops the myostracum, a unique microstructural design. Sectioned parallel and perpendicular to the inner shell surface, we investigated myostracal and non-myostracal microstructures, textures and nanomechanical properties for three bivalve species: The burrowing Glycymeris pilosa , the sessile Chama arcana and the swimming Placopecten magellanicus . Analyses were conducted using electron backscatter diffraction measurements, laser confocal and backscatter electron imaging, nanoindentation testing and thermogravimetric analysis. We find that the myostracal microstructure is generated mainly through physical determinants, regardless of the bivalve lifestyle and adductor muscle structure. If aragonitic, we show that adjacent shell layers are used as templates for the formation of the myostracal microstructure and highlight how bivalves use the adjacent crystal arrangement to predetermine myostracal microstructure up to inner shell surfaces. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how myostracal layers exceed the hardness of the non-myostracal valves and that of geological aragonite, irrespective of grain size and morphology. Due to the anisotropy of aragonite, we show that aragonite c-axis orientation notably affects the hardness of crystals. The highest hardness is measured when indentation is normal to the shell surface in aragonite c-axes direction.},

However, current research exhibits limited diversity in topological interlocking designs, with many studies lacking detailed descriptions of the geometric profiles of the interlocking bricks and the resultant interlocking effects. This paper introduces a novel design methodology for generating planar and non-planar topological interlocking bricks with curved interfaces. The proposed approach focuses on designing flexible key curved interfaces, allowing for precise control over curvature and adaptability to various base polygon patterns. The method for planar bricks is firstly developed by selecting a base polygon and designing curved interfaces to shape the interlocking brick. This approach is then further developed for non-planar bricks by creating rotated curved interfaces in the circumferential direction, and trapezoidal curved interfaces in the longitudinal direction. Additionally, a parameter FlexiCurve is introduced to control the rate of curvature and the profile of interface. The effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed approach are validated through the demonstration of both planar and non-planar interlocking bricks with square, hexagonal, and octagonal base patterns, along with the investigation of the effect of FlexiCurve on the interface curvature.},

However, the risk of complications, such as inflammation, is significantly heightened by undesirable biofouling caused by biological substances, including protein adsorption, bacterial colonization, and cell adhesion. Although slippery lubricant-infused porous substrates (SLIPS) have demonstrated remarkable resistance to biofouling, concerns regarding the safety of their degradation by-products and the stability of lubricants in fluid environments limit their applicability. In this study, we present a novel ‘liquid-like’ coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brush-modified implantable microparticles that exhibit enhanced stability and durability against biofouling. Our design incorporates both physical nanospikes and chemical PDMS brushes on the surface of microparticles. This modification results in an increased hydrophobicity of the particles while promoting attractive interactions between the ‘liquid-like’ coated surfaces across different microparticle types. The presence of nanospikes facilitates a specific dispersion pattern among PDMS-modified spiky microparticles (PMSMP). The ‘liquid-like’ coating demonstrates reliable biocompatibility and significantly reduces adhesion rates for proteins (1/60), bacteria (1/56), and cells (1/20), maintaining its efficacy over extended periods (&gt;7 days).

Emerging therapeutic strategies employing co-transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and Schwann cells (SCs) have shown promise through dual mechanisms of cellular replacement and neurotrophic factor delivery. However, suboptimal cell survival, incomplete neuronal differentiation, and the lack of endogenous electrophysiological cues persistently undermine therapeutic outcomes. To address these limitations, we developed an innovative piezoelectric hydrogel-based platform integrating ultrasound-driven bioelectrical stimulation with three-dimensional cellular co-delivery. This system leverages the unique properties of piezoelectric hydrogels to generate localized electrical fields under non-invasive ultrasound actuation, while simultaneously serving as a biomimetic scaffold for NSCs/SCs co-culture. In vitro analyses revealed that the piezoelectric stimulation significantly enhanced neuronal differentiation efficiency and promoted robust remyelination. In murine models of complete spinal cord transection, the synergistic system demonstrated multifaceted therapeutic effects: 1) enhanced NSCs-derived neuron survival, 2) increased synaptic density, and 3) accelerated motor function recovery. These findings establish a paradigm-shifting approach that orchestrates biophysical (electrical) and biochemical (cellular) regulatory cues to reconstruct spinal cord circuitry, offering new insights into developing multimodal neuroregenerative therapies for SCI.},

  abstract     = {The surge in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation after acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is a key factor in making this injury irreversible. How to intervene effectively is the basis of therapeutic strategy design. In our study, we explored the potential of Prussian blue nanase, which has catalase and superoxide dismutase-like activity. However, given their high immunogenicity, we chose to leverage the low immunogenicity and biosafety of exosomes to enhance the delivery of these nanase. Recognizing the prevalence of M1 microglia in local inflammation, we used exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) as vectors. These exosomes are further modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) to form nanoplatforms (EXO/PB) that specifically target inflammation. HA binding enables EXO/PB to locate on M1 microglia, promoting ROS clearance and facilitating the transition from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype. Our results show that EXO/PB not only targets M1 microglia, but also leverages the ROS clearance capabilities of Prussian blue nanozymes to influence this phenotypic transition. Finally, EXO/PB provides a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic wounds are difficult to treat in nature due to their distinct pathophysiological characteristics, such as inflammation and/or oxidative stress, which offers an opportunity to employ nanozymes. However, nanozymes may cause safety concerns regarding the balance between enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity, as well as unclear metabolic pathways when used as free nanoparticles. To address this issue, we developed a Prussian blue nanohybrid hydrogel by pre-coupling of polymer materials and inorganic nanomaterials via covalent bond, improving the stability of the organic–inorganic interface as well as nanozymes within the nanohybrid hydrogel. The nanohybrid hydrogel retained the enzymatic activities of Prussian blue nanoparticles, and its enzymatic activities displayed temperature-dependent characteristics when in proximity to physiological temperature. In light of this, we combined graphene-based far-infrared photothermal therapy with nanohybrid hydrogel materials, in order to promote wound healing by thermal effects and improved enzymatic activity. Animal experiments demonstrated that this combination significantly accelerates diabetes wound healing, alleviating wound inflammatory responses, and promote collagen deposition and neovascularization. This innovative approach holds considerable promise for advancing the therapeutic potential of diabetic wound healing and offers new avenues for the development of next generation wound healing treatments.},

In the current work, Al–Zn–Mg alloys with Hf and Zr additions below 1 wt% were systematically studied with respect to the influence of the induced Hf–Zr-rich Al 3 X dispersoids on the Mg–Zn precipitation hardening response. A multiscale analysis was applied using correlative instrumented indentation, electron microscopy and atom probe tomography to derive the microstructure-property relationships in these alloys, with a focus on the precipitation behavior during the aging process. The results are compared to a reference dispersoid-free Al–Zn–Mg alloy subjected to the same aging treatment. A heterogeneous microstructure consisting of dispersoid-rich dendritic regions surrounded by dispersoid-free interdendritic regions was identified, with coarser Mg–Zn precipitation in the former. Via indentation mapping, we show that these local composition gradients correlate with spatial fluctuations in hardness. Related quantitative analysis indicates that the observed reduced macroscopic hardening potential during a 140 °C aging treatment of the dispersoid-modified alloys results from the coarser precipitates in the dispersoid-rich regions.},

Results showed that variation in localized microstructure is principally determined by the beam path length and the extent of melting-remelting cycles. Sporadic dislocation sub-structures were observed in scan strategies where thermal conditions were more turbulent than the reference raster scan, eventually leading to a different mechanical response despite their lower measured densities. Average yield strength and ultimate tensile strength surpassed the conventionally produced and subsequently annealed 316L; and were very close to the standards set forward for nuclear applications. This therefore opens up the possibility of using different scan strategies in an electron beam powder bed fusion system that can exploit the scan path design freedom and achieve localized microstructural and property differences.

Here, HAl66-6–3-2 alloy was subjected to EPT, and the results revealed that the EPT sample achieved an increase in plasticity without compromising the strength, with an elongation rate enhancement of 69.89 %. The changes in performance are mainly attributed to three aspects: grain refinement, slight decrease in dislocation density, and the formation of strong {632}&lt;223&gt; texture during the EPT. Unlike the untreated (UT) samples with entangled dislocations, under the coupling effect of Joule heating and non-thermal effect, the dislocations in EPT samples exhibited directionality, primarily composed of a series of parallel dislocation pairs. The formation of the strong {632}&lt;223&gt; texture primarily relied on grain boundary migration and grain rotation, with both Joule heating and non-thermal effect facilitating rapid grain boundary migration. At low-angle grain boundaries, the pulsed current facilitated grain rotation, transforming low-angle grain boundaries in the β phase into high-angle grain boundaries. The study demonstrates EPT can promote the movement of atoms and regulate the microstructure, which is of great significance for the subsequent control of alloy properties.},

Although the introduction of a third element into the interfacial metallurgical reaction has been explored before, it has been difficult to avoid the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds with poor mechanical properties. This study presents a groundbreaking method that, for the first time in published literature, leverages in-situ Ni alloying with a flexible laser-arc hybrid heat source to create an exceptionally high-performing nanoscale double solid solution interface between immiscible Mg and Fe alloys. This processing approach enables the high metallurgical reaction temperatures required for immiscible and nonreactive systems. The resulting lattice formation, driven by localized elemental diffusion at elevated interfacial temperatures, fosters adaptive coherent matching across the entire Mg-Fe interface. This process successfully transforms the non-coherent lattice that is generally observed at the Mg/Fe interface into a coherent double solid solution interface with the bulk matrix on both sides, significantly enhancing bonding efficiency and performance. This study provides detailed advanced characterization of the nanoscale double solid solution structures observed at the interfaces of these immiscible dissimilar metals which has been previously unexplored in the literature.},

To assess this, carbon blends of both grade 5 and grade 23 from 0.1-1.0 wt% C were prepared. Part printability using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was assessed by measuring the segregation, flowability, rheology, and spreadability of the powder. Blend quality was assessed chemically and visually via computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. Carbon blends above 0.25 wt% C produced significant segregation of carbon particles. Agglomerated carbon segregates acted as barriers to flow causing the reduction in dynamic flow by 40–60% compared to the virgin powders. High carbon contents also limited powder spreadability by promoting large streaks during powder spreading. Below 0.25 wt% C, the deleterious effects of segregation, flowability, and spreadability were reduced and the powder characteristics were comparable to the processable virgin powders. Printed parts exhibited very small effect of carbon blending on the density and micro-hardness of the material. The grade 23 powder is more suitable for carbon blending and offers the highest part densities and lowest variation in material hardness. This is attributed to lesser carbon agglomeration, better powder flow, and fewer interstitial elements.},

Additionally, polyethylene glycol succinimide succinate [PEG-(SS) 2 ]-human serum albumin (HSA) (Hp) hydrogel, known for its excellent biocompatibility and sustained drug release properties, was employed to encapsulate TA-III to exhibit a long-acting, sustained release profile. In vitro results demonstrated that the TA-III/Hp hydrogel upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and zonula occludens-1, while reducing the level of vascular endothelial growth factor A. We further observed a significant reduction in the levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α under high glucose conditions by using the TA-III/Hp hydrogel in retinal pigment epithelium cells. Notably, intravitreal delivery of TA-III/Hp hydrogel in the DR mouse model effectively increased retinal thickness and numbers of mature blood vessels, while inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory factor levels. In conclusion, intravitreal injection of TA-III/Hp hydrogel facilitates sustained release of TA-III, simultaneously providing anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and vascular remodeling effects in DR.},

However, their difficult processing, and limited ductility at ambient temperatures have hindered their widespread application. Here, we report fabrication of a Ti-43Al-9 V-0.3Y alloy with a novel lamellar-network two-scale structure comprising an inner α 2 /γ lamellar colony + outer β 0 /γ phases via semi-solid forging process. The formation of this lamellar-network two-scale structure is elucidated from the perspective of the solute diffusion and redistribution occurring, and occurs due to liquid segregation and a non-equilibrium transition of L → β(β 0 ) + α at late solidification. Compared to the as-cast alloy, the semi-solid forged alloy exhibits significant increases in elongation and tensile strength at room temperature and 800°C. The high density of dislocations and mechanical twins in the β 0 /γ phases and special α 2 /γ lamellae during tensile deformation effectively release the plastic deformation potential of the TiAl alloy at room temperature. Moreover, the abundant nano-twins in the β 0 /γ phase and γ dynamic recrystallization behavior at 800 ℃ significantly enhance the high-temperature plasticity. This approach and microstructure offer a promising solution to the engineering challenges posed by the low room-temperature ductility and limited hot-working ability of TiAl alloys.},

  abstract     = {This study explores high-power laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processing of Cu–Cr–Zr alloy, focusing on its high strain rate dynamic mechanical response and microstructural evolution. The alloy undergoes significant strain hardening during dynamic impact loading, primarily attributed to intensified dislocation interactions and multiplication. This is accompanied by thermal softening induced by adiabatic heating, therefore improving strain accommodation. As the strain rate increases from 4400 s −1 to 11300 s −1 , the ultimate compressive strength (UCS) enhances from 173 ± 8 MPa to 489 ± 14 MPa, demonstrating a high strain rate sensitivity (SRS) of ∼ 1. Microstructural examinations reveal that higher strain rates intensify the occurrence of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs), leading to severe localized plastic deformation. These ASBs generate localized stress concentrations, which in turn accelerate crack initiation and propagation through pore formation and coalescence within the ASBs. Despite this severe plastic deformation, texture analysis indicates that the crystallographic texture remains largely stable which suggests that the deformation mechanism is primarily governed by dislocation motion and interaction, rather than by crystal structure reorientation. Overall, the alloy balances strain hardening and strain accommodation at high strain rates, making it well-suited for applications requiring strength and resilience under dynamic impacts.},

The evolution of α ′ martensitic microstructure was analyzed by examining linear thermal expansion coefficients indicating direction dependency. During heating, the precipitation and stabilization of β provoke the formation and decomposition of the intermetallic phase, accompanied by a significant increase in hardness and an exothermic event. Additionally, the relaxation of residual stresses and transformation into the β phase determines the microstructural evolution. Thermal diffusivity of as-built Ti-6Al-4V propagates linearly up to 950 C ∘ . For powder, HotDisk measurements corroborate laser flash data obtained up to 850 C ∘ . Based on the LFA, the start of sintering is identified and attributed to a change in the heat transfer mechanism in AM powders. Specific heat capacity and effective thermal conductivity of AM Ti-6Al-4V are determined, highlighting the shortcomings of predicting AM powders&#39; conductivity based on solid materials.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many studies have increasingly focused on developing bio-inspired structures, leveraging their lightweight and high-energy absorption properties, which are crucial across many engineering fields. Structural optimization aiming for bio-inspired structures having superior energy absorption capability, however, has been considered a challenging problem. One of these challenges is that nonlinear material behaviors induced by external forces, such as buckling and self-contact of constituting ligaments, intervene in the energy absorption process. Such nonlinearities not only make the relationship between design changes and energy absorption nonlinear, but also exacerbate the difficulties of design, given the complexity of the ligament configurations. To address this, a novel design optimization method for bio-inspired cellular structures with high energy absorption is proposed. First, Voronoi tessellation is used to capture configurations of bio-inspired material, parameterized by geometric variables. Then, Bayesian optimization with Kriging efficiently updates the design, exploring the complex design space through high-fidelity nonlinear finite element analysis. The proposed design method is efficient in structural optimization as it combines a strategy to reduce the number of samples required for surrogate modeling of structural response and optimal search, but it also generates multiple design outcomes with similar advantages due to the intrinsic variance of the Voronoi structures.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials, with their intricately designed microstructures, exhibit properties that are superior to those of natural materials. Computational optimization, which uses finite element analysis of periodic microstructures, enables the design of architected microstructures to achieve desired macroscopic properties. Traditionally, unit cells are defined within cuboidal domains; however, this study extends the design to parallelepiped domains, significantly expanding design possibilities. This study investigates the influence of geometric design domains on the topology optimization of negative Poisson&#39;s ratio (NPR) metamaterials. Using the mathematical homogenization method, unit cells within parallelogram or parallelepiped domains are represented within square or cubic domains under misaligned periodic boundary conditions. This approach enables the manipulation of macroscopic elastic stiffness components while maintaining the solid volume fraction. A comparative analysis was performed to examine the geometric characteristics of optimized microstructures and the resulting macroscopic anisotropy under both standard and misaligned periodic boundary conditions. 3D-printed NPR metamaterials were tested to validate the design. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the computational design method in generating diverse microstructures with misalignment, opening new avenues for designing NPR metamaterials with enhanced properties.},

The influence of the pre-existing TiC interlayer on interfacial reaction behavior and compound evolution was analyzed, revealing the interfacial bonding and failure mechanisms of the Ti/steel composites. Results show that at annealing temperatures ≤900 °C, the pre-existing TiC layer effectively suppressed the interdiffusion between Fe and Ti, thereby preventing the formation of Fe-Ti phases. The interfacial layer consisted of nanoscale and submicron-scale TiC. During deformation and failure, microcracks were prone to initiate at the nanoscale TiC/steel interface and subsequently propagate towards the nanoscale TiC/submicron-scale TiC interface. At 950 °C, the pre-existing TiC layer at the interface dissolved, and the interfacial compound layer evolved into a mixture of nanoscale TiC, FeTi, and Fe 2 Ti. The FeTi/TiC + Fe 2 Ti and FeTi/Fe 2 Ti interfaces became the primary crack propagation paths, severely degrading the bonding quality of the Ti/steel composite. After annealing at 850 °C, the ductility and deformation compatibility of the Ti/steel composite plate were significantly enhanced, resulting in optimal overall mechanical properties. The ultimate tensile strength, shear strength, and elongation were 286 MPa, 127 MPa, and 44 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The strengthening mechanisms of ion implantation remain a challenge for the application on high-performance precision mechanical manufacturing. Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) method, the paper aims to explore the nanoscale mechanisms of the polycrystalline iron implanted by Cr ions. The microstructural evolution under implantation is analyzed, and the mechanical properties of different models under nanoindentation are studied. The results show that the ion implantation reduces surface roughness while enhancing both Young’s modulus and hardness. The increase in hardness arises from Cr atoms and interstitials obstructing dislocation propagation and the inverse Hall-Petch effect, which works by transforming the deformation from being grain boundary-dominated to dislocation-dominated. The role of grain boundaries (GBs) in ion implantation and deformation are analyzed by the molecular statics method and atomic displacement field. It is found that GB sites have lower point defect formation energy than the bulk and GB atoms first participate in plastic deformation. Additionally, the interactions between dislocations and GBs are investigated. This article provides an innovative research approach for exploring the nanoscale strengthening mechanisms of ion implantation by MD method.},

Layered and core-multiple shell structures are of particular interest as templates for biofabrication and cell growth. Traditional fabrication methods often rely on fixed coaxial, triaxial or quadaxial needles, which are costly and prone to clogging, particularly for smaller inner diameters. Here, we introduce a versatile system based on a 3D printed nozzle which combines two flows: an inner core- and an outer shell-flow. The outlet is fitted with a glass capillary, allowing control of the fiber diameter by adjusting the capillary. The design facilitates the modular “LEGO®-Brick” stacking of multiple nozzles, enabling the efficient fabrication of complex fibers. We demonstrate the production of alginate (Alg)-methyl cellulose (MC) composite fibers with variable diameters. Additionally, when the shell was filled with an oil phase and the core with a water phase, microdroplets with controlled diameters were effectively generated. The two-flow system also enables the extrusion of graphene oxide (GO)-based fibers and microbeads, which are widely-used structures in various applications. To demonstrate the capability of the designed nozzle for biofabrication, C2C12 cell-laden GO-based fibers and microbeads were fabricated, exhibiting excellent post-fabrication cell viability.},

  abstract     = {To be compatible with mainstream additive manufacturing techniques, plate lattices must be designed with embedded pores to eliminate closed cells and facilitate material removal. Interestingly, these pores also transform the plate lattices into effective acoustic absorbers, with structures resembling Helmholtz resonators. In this work, the sound absorption performance of plate lattices inspired by crystal structures was investigated, with small perforations at nodes introduced as a design feature to facilitate feedstock material removal and allow acoustic energy to penetrate the structure. Calibrated through numerous additively manufactured samples, a high-fidelity mathematical model, grounded in Helmholtz resonance principles and the Transfer Matrix Method, was developed to accurately predict the acoustic properties of plate lattices across a broad range of frequencies from 450 to 6300 Hz. The model not only effectively predicts sound absorption coefficient curves based on geometric parameters but also provides valuable insights into how these parameters influence acoustic performance. It is found that smaller cell sizes, higher relative densities, and reduced perforation sizes generally result in higher mean sound absorption coefficients. The frequency bands of peak absorption regions are then strongly affected by the perforation size relative to the cell size. Furthermore, an optimization framework leveraging the model generated heterogeneous plate lattice designs with superior broadband sound absorption at targeted frequency ranges. This work introduces a robust mathematical approach for predicting and optimizing the acoustic properties of perforated plate lattices while uncovering key structural-property relationships that drive their performance.},

Strain measurements of target vessels collected in-situ during initial operation with gas injection were used to study the gas injection effect on the structural response of targets to proton pulses. A significant strain reduction owing to gas injection was found by comparing the strain measurement data during operation with and without gas injection. The research presented here focuses on quantifying strain reductions in SNS targets and evaluating the effect of small-bubble gas injection by comparing different bubbler types and target designs. The strain measurement results show the gas injection significantly reduced strain in SNS target vessels; strain values decreased by 30% to 80% for targets operating with gas injection. Stress and strain responses of SNS targets were simulated to numerically evaluate the gas injection effect. Based on the predicted stresses with and without gas injection, the fatigue lifetimes of SNS jet-flow design target were estimated using fe-safe fatigue analysis software. The simulations show these reductions should improve the fatigue life of target vessels and allow SNS targets to meet their fatigue design goal.},

We conducted 576 finite element simulations on a half-scale model to optimize energy absorption and stiffness, leading to 66 optimized designs that met both low-speed and high-speed impact criteria. Two sub-scale optimized energy absorbers with different peak forces—both meeting low-speed impact requirements—were 3D printed and validated through drop-weight testing. The one with lower peak stress demonstrated a more compliant response, exhibiting approximately 90 % lower initial peak force and an increase in energy absorption of around 33 % (from 24 J to 32 J). Compared to the baseline triangular lattice, the optimized absorber increased energy absorption by 68 % from (19 J to 32 J) and reduced peak stress by 70 %.
