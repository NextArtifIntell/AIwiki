  abstract     = {In this paper, the author introduces a nonlocal perspective by incorporating the fractional Laplacian ( − Δ ) s , and considers the fractional mean field equation on a finite graph G = ( V , E ) , say ( − Δ ) s u = ρ ( h e u ∫ V h e u d μ − 1 | V | ) , ∀ x ∈ V , where s ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , ρ ∈ ( − ∞ , 0 ) ∪ ( 0 , + ∞ ) are some fixed parameters, h denotes a given real value function on V . Based on the sign of the prescribed function h , using various methods such as variational method, topological degree and two mean field type heat flows, the author obtains the existence of solutions for the above problem in three cases respectively. These results extend the relevant research of Lin-Yang (Calc. Var., 2021), Sun-Wang (Adv. Math., 2022) and Liu-Zhang (J. Math. Anal. Appl., 2023) in the case of s = 1 , and potentially broaden the understanding and application of fractional operators in discrete mathematical structures, emphasizing connections to both continuous and discrete theories.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we search the chaotic behavior in the set of generic points of ergodic measures (called the Birkhoff basin) and find several types of chaoticity stronger than Li-Yorke chaos. More precisely, we consider nonuniformly hyperbolic systems first. On one hand, the Birkhoff basin of every ergodic hyperbolic measure with positive metric entropy exhibits a type of distributional chaos property between DC1 and Li-Yorke chaos, called Banach DC1. On the other hand, the Birkhoff basin of every totally ergodic hyperbolic measure with nondegenerate support exhibits a type of distributional chaos property between DC1 and DC2, called almost DC1. For hyperbolic systems, the Birkhoff basin of every ergodic measure with nondegenerate support from an elementary part of an Axiom A system exhibits both almost DC1 and Banach DC1, and the Birkhoff basin of any trivial ergodic measure supported on some fixed point exhibits Banach DC1 but no almost DC1. In this process, Katok&#39;s shadowing and horseshoe approximation motivate us to obtain two types of weak specification property as useful techniques to reach our results. Such weak specifications are also valid to symbolic systems like sofic subshifts and β -shifts, so we put them as abstract frameworks in the proof part. Compared with Chen-Tian&#39;s result [1] considering the ergodic measures whose Birkhoff basin has a distal pair, we need to overcome general ergodic measures without the assumption of a distal pair and overcome the nonuniform difficulties from the weak specification property.},

Our results indicate that slow predator movement and short frequency of environmental periodic variations promote successful predator invasion. Conversely, reducing the predator mortality rate facilitates long-term coexistence of both populations. Additionally, we explore the asymptotic behaviors of positive periodic solutions when the diffusion coefficients are large or small, revealing the effects of diffusion on the invasion dynamics.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on two-time-scale stochastic functional differential equations (SFDEs). It features in inclusion of infinite delay and coupling of slow and fast components. The coupling is through the segment processes of the slow and fast processes. The main difficulties include infinite delay and the coupling of segment processes involving fast and slow motions. Concentrating on weak convergence, the tightness of the segment process is established on a space of continuous functions. In addition, the Hölder continuity and boundedness for the segment process of the slow component, uniform boundedness for the segment process of a fixed- x SFDE, exponential ergodicity, and continuous dependence on parameters are obtained to carry out the desired asymptotic analysis, and also as byproducts, which are interesting in their own right. Then using the martingale problem formulation, an average principle is established by a direct averaging, which involves detailed computations and subtle estimates. Finally, two classes of special SFDEs, stochastic integro-differential equations and stochastic delay differential equations with two-time scales are investigated.},

  abstract     = {The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation with the right Dirichlet control is small time, locally, exactly controllable for all non-critical lengths and its linearized system is not controllable for all critical lengths. In this paper, we give a definitive picture of the local controllability properties of this control problem for all critical lengths. In particular, we show that the unreachable space of the linearized system is always of dimension 1 and the KdV system with the right Dirichlet control is not locally null controllable in small time for any critical length. We also give a criterion to determine whether the system is locally exactly controllable in finite time or not locally null controllable in any positive time for all critical lengths. Consequently, we show that there exist critical lengths such that the system is not locally null controllable in small time but is locally exactly controllable in finite time.},

  abstract     = {A class of diffusive partial differential equations with strongly coupled time delays and diffusion is considered. The global boundedness of weak solutions of the equation is proved by an entropy method that was initially proposed for studying the global boundedness of reaction-diffusion equations with cross-diffusion. The presence of the time delays in the equation prevents the entropy method to be directly applied, and here we extend the entropy method to this class of diffusive partial differential equations with time delays by proving some key entropy inequalities, which further allows us to obtain the estimates of gradient of the solutions. The results can be used to show the global boundedness of solutions of population models with memory effect, which were recently proposed for describing the movement of highly-developed animal species. In addition, we show that the results are also applicable for the classic partial functional differential equations, where the time delays only appear in the reaction terms.},
