  abstract     = {For the white noise ξ on R 2 , an operator corresponding to a limit of − Δ + ξ ɛ + c ɛ as ɛ → 0 is realized as a self-adjoint operator, where, for each ɛ &gt; 0 , c ɛ is a constant, ξ ɛ is a smooth approximation of ξ defined by exp ( ɛ 2 Δ ) ξ , and Δ is the Laplacian. This result is a variant of results obtained by Allez and Chouk, Mouzard, and Ugurcan. The proof in this paper is based on the heat semigroup approach of the paracontrolled calculus, referring the proof by Mouzard. For the obtained operator, the spectral set is shown to be R .},

  abstract     = {We consider the multiparameter random simplicial complex on a vertex set { 1 , … , n } , which is parameterized by multiple connectivity probabilities. Our key results concern the topology of this complex of dimensions higher than the critical dimension. We show that the higher-dimensional Betti numbers satisfy strong laws of large numbers and central limit theorems. Moreover, lower tail large deviations for these Betti numbers are also discussed. Some of our results indicate an occurrence of phase transitions in terms of the scaling constants of the central limit theorem, and the exponentially decaying rate of convergence of lower tail large deviation probabilities.},

Consider the sequence { X n } of Δ o -valued random variables such that, given X 0 , … , X n , the conditional distribution of X n + 1 is G ( L n + 1 ) ( X n , ⋅ ) , where L n + 1 = 1 n + 1 ∑ i = 0 n δ X i . Under conditions on G we establish a large deviation principle for the sequence { L n } . As one application of this result we obtain large deviation asymptotics for the Aldous et al. (1988) approximation scheme for quasi-stationary distributions of finite state Markov chains. The conditions on G cover other models as well, including certain models with edge or vertex reinforcement.},

  abstract     = {For about three decades now, there is an increasing interest in study of multifractional processes/fields. The paradigmatic example of them is Multifractional Brownian Field (MBF) over R N , which is a Gaussian generalization with varying Hurst parameter (the Hurst function) of the well-known Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM). Harmonizable Multifractional Stable Field (HMSF) is a very natural (and maybe the most natural) extension of MBF to the framework of heavy-tailed Symmetric α -Stable (S α S) distributions. Many methods related with Gaussian fields fail to work in such a non-Gaussian framework, this is what makes study of HMSF to be difficult. In our article we construct wavelet type random series representations for the S α S stochastic field generating HMSF and for related fields. Then, under weakened versions of the usual Hölder condition on the Hurst function, we obtain sharp results on sample path behavior of HMSF: optimal global and pointwise moduli of continuity, quasi-optimal pointwise modulus of continuity on a universal event of probability 1 not depending on the location, and an estimate of the behavior at infinity which is optimal when the Hurst function has a limit at infinity to which it converges at a logarithmic rate.},
