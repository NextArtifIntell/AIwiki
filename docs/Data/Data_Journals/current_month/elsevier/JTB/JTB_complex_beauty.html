  abstract     = {Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, is a serious concern in developing and underdeveloped areas. A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to foresee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models. The mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease transmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is essential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks to furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics followed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify critical parameters that illustrate the disease’s dynamics using partial rank correlation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction number as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore, forward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf bifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as societal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine learning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into autoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks. We forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the proposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert that integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance the capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism can significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This evolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and respond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable and adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In the course of epidemics, the pathogen may mutate to acquire a higher fitness. At the same time, such a mutant is automatically in an unfavorable position because the resident virus has a head start in accessing the pool of susceptible individuals. We considered a class of tunable small-world networks, where a parameter, p (the rewiring probability), characterizes the prevalence of non-local connections, and we asked, whether the underlying network can influence the fate of a mutant virus. Under an SIR model, we considered two measures of mutant success: the expected height of the peak of mutant infected individuals, and the total number of recovered from mutant individuals at the end of the epidemic. Using these measures, we have found the existence of an optimal (for an advantageous mutant virus) rewiring probability that promotes a larger infected maximum and a larger total recovered population corresponding to the advantageous pathogen strain. This optimal rewiring probability decreases as mean degree and the infectivity of the wild type are increased, and it increases with the mutant advantage. The non-monotonic behavior of the advantageous mutant as a function of rewiring probability may shed light into some of the complex patterns in the size of mutant peaks experienced by different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract     = {Ecologists have shown considerable interest in the spatial patterns of organism distribution and the processes responsible for their formation and maintenance. The phytophagous insects typically use chemicals in plants as host-finding cues. Because nonvolatile chemicals remain near the source, the spatial structure of plant community determines the local distribution of insects. In addition, the plant chemical accumulation due to plant–plant interaction also influences the distribution of insects. In Rumex obtusifolius , for example, the production of phenolics is mediated by conspecific interaction. Rumex plants with high phenolic concentrations are preferred by the leaf beetle Gastrophysa atrocyanea , resulting in its spatial aggregation. Although this preference of beetles for nonvolatile chemicals should be beneficial in finding host plants, there is also a cost in terms of intraspecific competition among the beetles due to aggregation on certain chemical-rich hosts. To investigate the evolutionary significance of preference for nonvolatile chemicals and the ecological consequence of spatial distribution in leaf beetles, we constructed a mathematical model for the joint evolution of two preferences for plant size and chemical condition. In the model, beetles choose a resource based on the size and chemical concentrations of plants and are exposed to resource competition. Host plants accumulate the chemicals when they interact with neighboring conspecifics, and hence the level of chemical accumulation varies depending on the species composition and spatial distribution of the plant community. As a result, beetles became more sensitive to chemicals when the host species was rare and sparsely distributed in the community. The evolution of high chemical preference caused the aggregation of beetles and hence population size declined. We proposed a potential mechanism that underlies aggregated distribution in phytophagous insects, driven by the evolution of chemical preferences in response to plant community structure.},

  abstract     = {While a tree grows over many years, somatic mutations accumulate and form genetic variation among branches within an individual. Trees can transmit such mutations to subsequent generations, potentially enhancing the genetic diversity of the population. We study a mathematical model to understand the relationship between within-individual genetic variation and branching architecture. We generate branching architecture by repeatedly adding two new branches (main and lateral daughter branches) to each terminal branch (mother branch). The architecture is characterized by two key parameters: main-lateral ratio (ML) and daughter-mother ratio (DM). During branch elongation, somatic mutations accumulate in the stem cells of a shoot apical meristem (SAM) at the tip of each branch. In branching, all the stem cells are passed on from the mother to the main daughter branch, but only one stem cell is chosen for the lateral daughter branch. We evaluate genetic variation by Z ¯ , the mean genetic differences between all pairs of branches of a tree, and examine how Z ¯ varies with DM and ML while keeping the total branch length constant. As a result, (1) Z ¯ increases monotonically with ML; (2) Z ¯ attains the maximum for an intermediate DM, when stem cells in a SAM are genetically homogeneous; (3) Z ¯ decreases monotonically with DM when stem cells are heterogeneous. The effect of branching architecture varies significantly depending on the genetic heterogeneity within a SAM, which results from the behavior of stem cells during growth. Our study sheds light on the overlooked role of branching architecture in storing genetic diversity.},

Identifying the mechanisms that are at the origin of food web structure is useful, e.g., for restoration purposes. We investigated the extent to which trait-matching, which contributes to defining the strength of trophic interactions, can cause the emergence of food webs with a non-trivial, multi-trophic, hierarchical structure. We compared for that purpose the structural properties of food webs simulated by four food web model variants, depending whether trait-matching was linear or nonlinear and whether population dynamics and evolution were accounted for (dynamical model) or not (static model). Nonlinear trait-matching can restrict interactions in phenotypic space so as to obtain localized interactions (i.e., each species interact with a small subset of species), which is a key element for food web formation. In the static case, nonlinear trait-matching allowed for the emergence of food webs, at a relatively low connectance as with random graphs. In the dynamical case, nonlinear trait-matching combined with population dynamics and evolution allowed for the formation of groups of phenotypically close species, resulting in food webs with a multi-trophic, hierarchical structure.},

  abstract     = {Language contact refers to a situation in which speakers of different languages meet and interact. There are three consequences of language contact. The first one is language shift, where one language is replaced by another. The second one is language maintenance, where languages coexist without any language change. The question of how language shift takes place and under what conditions coexistence of languages is possible has drawn wide attention of linguists as well as of theoretical researchers in other disciplines. Most of the previous mathematical studies of language dynamics have shown that there is majority advantage in the competition and that the population eventually becomes dominated by a single language that was spoken by a majority when the competition started. However, it is known that the contact of different languages could lead to the third consequence: the emergence of a new language, such as creole languages. Our study aims to model the spread of creole languages by using evolutionary game theory and determine the factors that drive the spread of creoles in the population. We consider an evolutionary game with individuals who speak either one of two ancestral languages or the creole that resulted from language contact between those two ancestral languages. Due to the formation process of creole, the creole speakers can communicate with speakers of other languages to some, but not full, extent. We assume that their frequencies change according to their payoffs that reflect how well they can communicate with others. Under this basic assumption, we varied (i) the population size and (ii) the difficulty of language change, to see their effects on the spread of the creole. Results show that the creole is more likely to spread if the population size is small enough for random drift to work well and/or if two ancestral languages are linguistically distant. We also find that finiteness of the population can either favor or disfavor the spread of creole depending on detailed conditions. Our results suggest that the contact between two distant languages and random drift drive the spread of creoles. It is known that many creole languages appeared in plantations where European owners brought labor forces from Africa as slaves. Our results match the homestead phase of these plantations, where European languages are distant from African ones, and where the population size was small.},

  abstract     = {Humans often cooperate in groups with friends and family members with varying degrees of genetic relatedness. Past kin selection can also be relevant to interactions between strangers, explaining how the cooperation first arose in the ancestral population. However, modelling the effects of relatedness is difficult when the benefits of cooperation scale nonlinearly with the number of cooperators (e.g., economies of scale). Here, we present a direct fitness method for rigorously accounting for kin selection in n -player interactions with m discrete strategies, where a genetically homophilic group-formation model is used to calculate the necessary higher-order relatedness coefficients. Our approach allows us to properly account for non-additive fitness effects between relatives (synergy). Analytical expressions for dynamics are obtained, and they can be solved numerically for modestly sized groups and numbers of strategies. We illustrate with an example where group members can verbally agree (cheap talk) to contribute to a public good with a sigmoidal benefit function, and we find that such coordinated cooperation is favoured by kin selection. As interactions switched from family to strangers, in order for coordinated cooperation to persist and for the population to resist invasion by liars, either some level of homophily must be maintained or following through on the agreement must be in the self-interests of contributors. Our approach is useful for scenarios where fitness effects are non-additive and the strategies are best modelled in a discrete way, such as behaviours that require a cognitive ‘leap’ of insight into the situation (e.g., shared intentionality, punishment).},

  abstract     = {Organisms invariably experience trade-offs in their capacities for interacting with their environments. In resource competition, this often means that an organism’s ability to acquire one resource can only come at the cost of less ability with others. If the traits governing resource acquisition are under selection and heritable, this will induce eco-evolutionary dynamics along the trade-off. For Lotka–Volterra models derived from MacArthur resource competition models and for explicit resource models with two resources, the shape and dimensionality of trade-offs has seen substantial study. However, how the joint effects of trade-off shapes and the number of resources under competition affect eco-evolutionary outcomes has seen relatively little. For example, is diversification through evolutionary branching more or less likely when the number of resources increases? Here, we will present techniques complementary to existing ones for recasting trade-offs in an implicit form. Combining adaptive dynamics and resource-competition theory, we derive expressions for directional and stabilizing/disruptive selection. We apply our techniques to two models of resource competition and investigate how the number of resources and trade-off shapes affect the stability characteristics of the generalist strategy, and how diverse a community of consumers can be assembled through successive evolutionary branching. We find that even for these simple and highly symmetric models, outcomes are surprisingly complex and idiosyncratic. Taken together, our results deepen our understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of resource competition for multiple resources.},

  abstract     = {Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is increasingly used to prevent the transmission of H.I.V. in at-risk populations. However, PrEP users may discontinue use of the medicine due to side effects, lower perceived risk, or other reasons. The usage metrics of 594 individuals was tracked over 350 days using the Wisepill electronic monitoring system. We model the PrEP drug adherence level using an absorbing Markov chain with a unique absorbing state. The transition matrix T obtained from the Wisepill data will have a trivial eigenvector (eigendistribution) associated with the first (i.e., largest) eigenvalue 1. The 2nd eigenvalue(s) then become important in determining the asymptotic behavior of the Markov chain, dictating how fast the Markov chain decays to the absorbing state. Under a fairly general assumption, we prove that the second positive eigenvalue is unique and the corresponding eigenvector will have nonnegative entries with exceptions at absorbing states. In addition, we define the asymptotic half life of the absorbing Markov chain directly from the 2nd eigenvalue. We then determine the 2nd eigenvalue of T and the asymptotic half life of the Markov chain, which turns out to be very close to the real half life of the Markov chain. Finally, we interpret the 2nd eigenvector as the relative probability distribution of X ∞ with respect to the decay rate of the 2nd eigenvalue. By applying these methods to the Wisepill data, we estimate the half-life of population adherence to be 46 weeks. The bi-weekly decay rate observed in these data from 90 to 100 % adherence is 3 %. This work produces an estimate at which adherence falls over time, given no external intervention is applied. These results suggest an eigenvector-based approach to estimate adherence trends, as well as the timing of interventions to improve adherence.},

  abstract     = {Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) pose increasing threats under future climate change scenarios and an understanding of mosquito population dynamics is pivotal to predicting future risk of MBDs. Most models that describe mosquito population dynamics often assume that adult life-history is independent of adult age and yet mosquito senescence is known to affect mosquito mortality, fecundity and other key biological traits. Despite this, little is known about the effects of adult age at the level of the mosquito population, especially under varying temperature scenarios. We develop a stage-structured delayed differential equations (DDEs) model incorporating the effects of the abiotic environment and adult age to shed light on the complex interactions between age, temperature, and mosquito population dynamics. Taking Culex pipiens , a major vector of West Nile Virus, as our study species our results show that failing to consider mosquito senescence can lead to underestimates of future mosquito abundances predicted under climate change scenarios. We also find that the age-dependent mechanisms combined with the effects of density-dependent mortality on the immature stages can result in mosquito abundances decreasing at extreme temperatures. With our work, we underscore the need for more studies to consider the effects of mosquito age. Not accounting for senescence can compromise the accuracy of abundance estimates and has implications for predicting the risk of future MBD outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the biochemistry and pharmacodynamics of chronic wounds is of key importance, due to the millions of people in the UK affected and the significant cost to the NHS. Chronic wounds are characterised by elevated concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that destroy the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). However, fibroblasts can produce tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) in order to regulate wound healing. Therefore, the role of TIMPs in both acute and chronic wounds needs to be properly understood in order to develop therapeutic treatments. In this work, we propose a reaction-diffusion system of four partial differential equations that describe the interaction of the ECM, fibroblasts, MMPs, and TIMPs in a wound. We observe that, subject to parameter sets corresponding to both acute and chronic wound healing, this mathematical model gives rise to travelling wave solutions. Using bifurcation analysis, we demonstrate that excessive degradation of the ECM results in the emergence of chronic wounds, and the reversal of these chronic wounds is prohibited for lower TIMP production values. These results are replicated within a simplified model obtained via a parameter sensitivity analysis. This model is further extended to more realistic spatial domains where we demonstrate the effectiveness of a therapeutic hydrogel containing TIMPs as a treatment for chronic wounds.},

  abstract     = {Astrocytes have an important role in the indirect regulation of neuronal excitability. The abnormalities of their ion channels cause neurons to discharge abnormally, which may induce seizures. The inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1 channel) and the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) of an astrocyte play important roles in maintaining the homeostasis of these potassium and calcium ions, and have been found to be associated with seizures. However, the underlying mechanisms by which they induce seizures remain unclear. This paper established a neuron-astrocyte network model, which is a model consisting of a neuron and an astrocyte, to explore some mechanisms of epileptic seizures. Through a series of simulations based on this model, the results showed that low conductance of Kir4.1 channel can induce spontaneous periodic epileptic activity (SPEA) whereas higher conductance results in spontaneous periodic bursting event (SPBE) and high-frequency tonic discharges (HFTD). The abnormalities of VGCC also lead to the generation of SPEA and SPBE. As the changes of potassium concentration in the largest nearby reservoir which is analogous to a bath solution that contains a specific concentration of potassium, SPEA can undergo a process from appearance to disappearance. Thus, the research findings showed that the transitions of seizure-like discharges provide further theoretical analyses to clarify the complex mechanism of seizures.},

  abstract     = {Microalgae cultivation has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various fields. However, achieving high productivity in these bioprocesses requires efficient process control. The dynamics of growth models typically comprise both known and unknown components due to mismatches between the nonlinear dynamics and their mathematical representations. Additionally, microalgal culture is subject to external disturbances. To address these issues, a classical proportional-derivative (PD) providing the feedback error, assisted by a time-varying gain extended state observer (ESO), maintaining the structure of an Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), was implemented. The formulation is aided by a time-varying gain extended state observer to avoid high-peaking estimation values. The optimal operating conditions were identified using the GEKKO Python package. The proposed controller was applied to the growth model of the microalga Isochrysis galbana , and numerical results demonstrated the effectiveness of the control strategy in eliminating steady-state error and ensuring asymptotic convergence to the optimal equilibrium despite unknown disturbances. A detailed analysis of the photobioreactor model, including stability under steady-state conditions, was also conducted. The results indicated that the model exhibits one, two, or no stable steady-state solutions when the dilution rate ( D ( t ) ) is manipulated.},

  abstract     = {Vertical transmission is widely predicted to select for reduced virulence of pathogens. Recent theory cast doubt on this prediction by showing that the evolutionary response of the host to vertical transmission can lead to severe disease outcomes. That theory, however, takes a simplified view of host population dynamics by assuming pathogen-induced mortality alone inhibits host population growth. The assumption limits our ability to uncover benign co-evolutionary outcomes characterized by low levels of pathogen-induced mortality. Here, we revisit the role of vertical transmission using a model that assumes host population growth is self-regulated. Our model tracks the co-evolution of pathogen-induced mortality and host recovery until both have reached an evolutionarily stable level. For any given set of model conditions, we could identify as many as two distinct pairs of stable mortality-recovery traits. Mortality and recovery were higher for one of the pairs (the ‘escalated’ one) and lower for the other of the pairs (the ‘de-escalated’ one). As the rate of vertical transmission rose, stable expression of the pathogen-induced mortality trait always decreased, while stable expression of the host-recovery trait increased for ‘escalated’ pairs and decreased for ‘de-escalated’ ones. In addition, (i) increasing the intrinsic rate of host population growth, (ii) increasing the cost of host recovery, and (iii) decreasing the efficiency of horizontal disease transmission all led to lower levels of stable trait expression for both pathogen and host. Factors (i)-(iii) also led to lower virulence, more frequent occurrence of the de-escalated (almost commensal) stable outcome, and greater disease prevalence. We conclude that (i)-(iii) promote the co-evolution of more benign interactions in keeping with previous findings. However, our new insight is that the benign nature of the host-pathogen interaction can now be understood as the more frequent occurrence of the de-escalated outcome. We discuss our findings in light of previous theory and experimental work.},

We identify two primary degrees of freedom in epidemic control, namely the maximum intensity of control measures and their duration. In the absence of travellers, a lower (higher) maximum intensity requires a longer (shorter) duration to achieve similar control outcomes. However, uncontrollable external factors, like the importation of undetected infectives, significantly constrain these degrees of freedom so that the optimal strategy results to be one with low/moderate intensity but prolonged in time. These findings underscore the necessity for resilient health systems and coordinated global responses in preparedness plans.},

Mathematical modelling is an important mechanism for predicting and optimising plant growth in agriculture, and Thornley’s mathematical model (Thornley, 1997) is one of the most widely used models describing carbon and nitrogen allocation in plants. However, a formal mathematical analysis of the model’s behaviour has not been performed. Our analysis of the model provides new insights into how and why the model can be inappropriate. By varying the values of some model parameters, we identify non-physical and even quite chaotic behaviour. In response, we modify Thornley’s model by including additional litter terms, resulting in the elimination of these non-physical behaviours.},

  abstract     = {Measurement of mechanical forces of cell–cell interactions is important for studying the emergence of diverse three-dimensional morphologies of multicellular organisms. We previously reported an image-based statistical method for inferring effective pairwise forces of cell–cell interactions (i.e., attractive/repulsive forces), where a cell particle model was fitted to cell tracking data acquired by live imaging. However, because the particle model is a coarse-grained model, it remains unclear how the pairwise forces relates to sub-cellular mechanical components including cell–cell adhesive forces. Here we applied our inference method to cell tracking data generated by vertex models that assumed sub-cellular components. Through this approach, we investigated the relationship between the effective pairwise forces and various sub-cellular components: cell–cell adhesion forces, cell surface tensions, cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, traction forces between cells and ECM, cell growth, etc. We found that the cell–cell adhesion forces were attractive, and both the cell surface tensions and cell–ECM adhesive forces were repulsive, etc. These results indicate that sub-cellular mechanical components can contribute to the effective attractive/repulsive forces of cell–cell interactions. This comprehensive analysis provides theoretical bases for linking the pairwise forces to the sub-cellular mechanical components: this showcase is useful for speculating the sub-cellular mechanical components from the information of cell positions, and for interpreting simulation results based on particle models.},

  abstract     = {Rhythmic motor behaviors controlled by neuromechanical systems, consisting of central neural circuitry, biomechanics, and sensory feedback, show efficiency in energy expenditure. The biomechanical elements (e.g., muscles) are modulated by peripheral neuromodulation which may improve their strength and speed properties. However, there are relatively few studies on neuromodulatory control of muscle function and metabolic mechanical efficiency in neuromechanical systems. To investigate the role of neuromodulation on the system’s mechanical efficiency, we consider a neuromuscular model of motor patterns for feeding in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica . By incorporating muscle energetics and neuromodulatory effects into the model, we demonstrate tradeoffs in the energy efficiency of Aplysia ’s rhythmic swallowing behavior as a function of the level of neuromodulation. A robust efficiency optimum arises from an intermediate level of neuromodulation, and excessive neuromodulation may be inefficient and disadvantageous to an animal’s metabolism. This optimum emerges from physiological constraints imposed upon serotonergic modulation trajectories on the energy efficiency landscape. Our results may lead to experimentally testable hypotheses of the role of neuromodulation in rhythmic motor control.},
