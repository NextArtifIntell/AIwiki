  abstract     = {The automatic differentiation (AD) in the vanilla physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is the computational bottleneck for the high-efficiency analysis. The concept of derivative discretization in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can provide an accelerated training method for PINNs. In this paper, smoothing kernel physics-informed neural networks (SK-PINNs) are established, which solve differential equations using smoothing kernel discretization. It is a robust framework capable of solving problems in the computational mechanics of complex domains. When the number of collocation points gradually increases, the training speed of SK-PINNs significantly surpasses that of vanilla PINNs. In cases involving large collocation point sets or higher-order problems, SK-PINN training can be up to tens of times faster than vanilla PINN. Additionally, analysis using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory shows that the convergence rates of SK-PINNs are consistent with those of vanilla PINNs. The superior performance of SK-PINNs is demonstrated through various examples, including regular and complex domains, as well as forward and inverse problems in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.},

  abstract     = {A new paradigm for hybrid reliability-based design optimization (HRBDO) is proposed. The key innovation lies in expanding the traditional β -circle into a β -cylinder along the interval dimensions, integrating both random and interval dimensional information. Building upon this theoretical foundation, a novel interval-based dimensional expansion β -cylinder active learning (IBAL) method is proposed, transforming the complex double-loop reliability calculation into an efficient single-loop process. The method employs Kriging models to replace expensive physical responses. Unlike traditional sampling techniques, the IBAL method focuses exclusively on predicted means and deviations on the β -cylinder to guide the Kriging models of performance functions, efficiently identifying the Most Probable Point (MPP). This approach effectively addresses challenges including interval dimensions nonlinearity, multiple extreme points, and multiple MPPs. In HRBDO, the method incorporates an active constraint screening (ACS) mechanism and an MPP objective function isosurface active learning (MIAL) method to enhance computational efficiency and avoid convergence to local optima. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through four mathematical examples and one engineering case study.},

  abstract     = {The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.},

  abstract     = {Hourglass modes, characterized by zigzag particle and stress distributions, are a common numerical instability encountered when simulating solid materials with updated Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ULSPH). While recent solutions have effectively addressed this issue in elastic materials using an essentially non-hourglass formulation, extending these solutions to plastic materials with more complex constitutive equations has proven challenging due to the need to express shear forces in the form of a velocity Laplacian. To address this, a generalized non-hourglass formulation is proposed within the ULSPH framework, suitable for both elastic and plastic materials. Specifically, a penalty force is introduced into the momentum equation to resolve the disparity between the linearly predicted and actual velocity differences of neighboring particle pairs, thereby mitigating the hourglass issue. The stability, convergence, and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through a series of classical elastic and plastic cases, with a dual-criterion time-stepping scheme to improve computational efficiency. The results show that the present method not only matches or even surpasses the performance of the recent essentially non-hourglass formulation in elastic cases but also performs well in plastic scenarios.},

Notably, the ill-posed nature of large-scale parameter identification from refined models has become a critical technical challenge. Regularization methods are widely employed to mitigate ill-posedness and control the complexity of identification problems. Traditional regularization methods often penalize imbalances in damage parameters, leading to errors and suboptimal convergence, failing to accurately reflect actual damage conditions. To address these challenges, an information entropy regularization term is introduced to capture the distribution of structural damage location and severity. By integrating regularization term with an adjoint sensitivity optimization algorithm, a refined iterative approach is developed to manage large-scale damage parameter identification from detailed finite element models. Numerical analyses on a 2D stress plate and a 3D wing, along with experimental validation on impact damage of clamped plates, demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Microstructural evolution, particularly grain growth, plays a critical role in shaping the physical, optical, and electronic properties of materials. Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase-field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan–Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input–output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.},

However, accurately and efficiently estimating the structural response in the face of random measurement errors, structural uncertainty, and nonlinear effects remains a challenge. In this study, a novel key conditional quotient (KCQ) theory has been presented to tackle this challenge. By extracting key conditions from measurement data and applying the principle of probability conservation, the KCQ theory provides an precise quotient-form expression, i.e., KCQ, for estimating the structural response considering random measurement errors, structural uncertainty, and nonlinearity. To effectively extract key measurement conditions, this study also proposes two innovative methods: the strong correlation measurement points method, and the covariance matrix of measurement errors method. To accurately and efficiently estimating the KCQ, a numerical method by combining the generalized quasi-Monte Carlo method based on the generalized center discrepancy and an offline-online coupling computational strategy is proposed. Five numerical examples are provided to verify the precision, efficiency, and robustness against measurement errors of the proposed KCQ theory and numerical method.},

  abstract     = {The current Bayesian FFT algorithm relies on direct differentiation to obtain the posterior covariance matrix (PCM), which is time-consuming, memory-intensive, and hard to code, especially for the multi-setup operational modal analysis (OMA). Aiming at accelerating the uncertainty quantification in multi-setup OMA, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithm is proposed by reformulating the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function (NLLF) as a sum of simplified components corresponding to the complete-data NLLF. Matrix calculus is employed to derive these components in a compact manner, resulting in expressions similar to those in the single-setup case. This similarity allows for the reuse of existing Bayesian single-setup OMA codes, simplifying implementation. The singularity caused by mode shape norm constraints is addressed through null space projection, eliminating potential numerical errors from the conventional pseudoinverse operation. A sparse assembly strategy is further adopted, avoiding unnecessary calculations and storage of predominant zero elements in the Hessian matrix. The proposed method is then validated through a comprehensive parametric study and applied to a multi-setup OMA of a high-rise building. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently calculates the PCM within seconds, even for cases with hundreds of parameters. This represents an efficiency improvement of at least one order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art method. Such performance paves the way for a real-time modal identification of large-scale structures, including those with closely-spaced modes.},

To further apply the NCDDAM for seismic dynamic analysis, this paper introduces five boundary conditions: viscous boundary, viscoelasticity boundary, seismic input boundary, free field boundary, and static-dynamic unified boundary. Several numerical examples are conduced to validate the enriched NCDDAM. The numerical results demonstrate the capacity of the enriched NCDDAM for seismic dynamic analysis of rock masses. The nonreflecting boundaries applied in NCDDAM can effectively absorb wave energy and avoid fictitious scattered waves, while the free field boundary applied in NCDDAM effectively simulates wave propagation in a semi-infinite domain. Based on the static-dynamic unified boundary, the seamless transition of boundary condition settings between the quasi-static and dynamic stages can be achieved. The entire evolution process of earthquake-induced disasters, including initiation, movement, run-out, and deposition can be effectively simulated within a unified framework using the enriched NCDDAM.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for accurate material behaviour data in engineering simulations has exposed the limitations of traditional constitutive models. Although recent advances in full-field measurement techniques provide more detailed material characterization, conventional approaches still heavily rely on explicit assumptions and labour-intensive experimentation. This paper revisits the indirect training methodology introduced by the authors [1] , which integrates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Gated-Recurrent Units (GRUs) and the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to model material behaviour without labelled data. The earlier study demonstrated the feasibility of training a GRU-based RNN using only global force and strain data through the VFM. Building on those findings, this work presents a more robust approach featuring an improved network architecture, with residual connections to enhance gradient flow and training stability, while also incorporating physics-based constraints. Extensive hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the model and a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of the virtual fields on the accuracy and training dynamics. The models were validated using additional heterogeneous mechanical tests and the Reconstructed Axial Force Ratio (RAFR), as a key performance indicator, to further assess the physical correctness. The results show enhanced predictive accuracy and improved force reconstruction when larger sets of virtual fields are employed. Additionally, normalizing the VFM loss contributed to more consistent predictions and force reconstruction across all time stages. Stress contour plots further confirm the model’s ability to accurately predict stress distributions, which are in good agreement with the reference, with low median and average absolute errors.},

We demonstrate that Augmented Riemann solvers can be incorporated into the PINN framework with straightforward adjustments to the hyperparameters, providing a promising alternative to automatic differentiation (AD), especially in cases where the solution exhibits strong nonlinearities and physical constraints are required. Benefits of the proposed RoePINN compared with the vanilla PINN based in AD are twofold: on the one hand, this hybrid approach employs numerical differentiation by means of support points in the surroundings of the collocation points, hence the robustness, generalization capacity and tunability of the PINNs are, in most cases, largely enhanced. On the other hand, the RoePINN incorporates the numerical solver, hence it is also capable of capturing sharp discontinuities with an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy compared with the vanilla version.},

  abstract     = {Shallow water equations (SWE) are fundamental nonlinear hyperbolic PDE-based models in fluid dynamics that are essential for studying a wide range of geophysical and engineering phenomena. Therefore, stable and accurate numerical methods for SWE are needed. Although some algorithms are well studied for deterministic SWE, more effort should be devoted to handling the SWE with uncertainty. In this paper, we incorporate uncertainty through a stochastic Galerkin (SG) framework, and building on an existing hyperbolicity-preserving SG formulation for 2D SWE, we construct the corresponding entropy flux pair, and develop structure-preserving, well-balanced, second-order energy conservative and energy stable finite volume schemes for the SG formulation of the two-dimensional shallow water system. We demonstrate the efficacy, applicability, and robustness of these structure-preserving algorithms through several challenging numerical experiments.},

However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF – dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) – which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the ‘conditional Gaussian’ update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for two canonical systems in data assimilation: the Lorenz-96 system and a double well potential system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), as a novel neural network model, is known for its strong interpretability and generalization capabilities, making it widely used in surrogate models and various engineering scenarios. While traditional PINN has achieved good results in simple geometric scenarios, there is limited research on its application to complex geometric structures. Additionally, PINN integrates boundary conditions into the loss function, requiring retraining model when boundary conditions change. To address these issues, we propose a new Physics-Informed Graph Ordinary Differential Equation (PIGODE) model for constructing surrogate models in complex geometric structures. The Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO) is extended to a PIGODE which is defined on graph data structure, and a PDDO-based message passing layer is developed to replace automatic differentiation (AD). This method precomputes Peridynamic weights, thereby avoiding additional computational overhead during model training. Furthermore, boundary conditions are embedded into the model input to address the need for dynamically modifying boundary conditions in surrogate models. Through comparative studies with existing PINN solvers, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, demonstrating its superior performance on complex geometric structures. Additionally, this model is applied to practical engineering scenarios, specifically constructing a temperature field surrogate model for the conical picks of a tunnel boring machine. The research results indicate that the proposed PIGODE model not only enhances the interpretability and efficiency of surrogate models but also extends their applicability to complex geometric structures in engineering.},

Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick–slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.},

After validating the finite element modeling method, an extensive stochastic finite element analysis is conducted to construct a comprehensive capacity database. The hyperparameters for the DNN architecture are initially determined, balancing accuracy with model complexity to finalize the surrogate capacity models. However, due to the strong nonlinearity in deformation-related surrogate models, lower accuracies are observed, which are further improved by applying a logarithmic transformation and the more advanced Transformer model. Despite these enhancements, the accuracy achieved by standard DNNs remains the most optimal, indicating their suitability for this task. Considering uncertainties in input features and neural network hyperparameters, fragility estimates for example RCFs are rapidly predicted using the surrogate capacity models.

  abstract     = {Numerical simulation of the collision dynamics in thin-walled structures under oblique load involves complex spatiotemporal processes, including material, geometric, and contact nonlinearities, which often require significant computational resources and time. Moreover, predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal responses remains a challenge for most surrogate-based models. This paper proposes a deep learning framework based on manifold learning for spatiotemporal modeling of collision dynamics in thin-walled structures under oblique load. The framework leverages multiple deep learning models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Radial Basis Function Interpolation (RBFI), and regression Residual Network (ResNet18), to capture the complex nonlinearities inherent in structural deformation, stress distribution, and crush force, enabling continuous prediction of multimodal spatiotemporal responses. Using a rectangular thin-walled tube under oblique load as an example, the models are validated with simulation data, yielding average prediction errors of 5.80 % for structural deformation, 6.01 % for Energy Absorption (EA), 10.66 % for Peak Crush Force (PCF), and 16.66 % for crush force. Compared to traditional finite element (FE) simulations, prediction time is reduced by 98.6 % for structural deformation and stress distribution, and 97.4 % for crush force. Additionally, the method demonstrates stability and broad applicability across different design parameters and structural configurations, including rectangular and double-cell tubes. This work underscores the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance computational efficiency and predictive accuracy in the crashworthiness design of thin-walled structures.},

  abstract     = {Finite-thickness interphases between different constituents in heterogeneous materials are often replaced by a zero-thickness interface model. Due to increasing area-to-volume ratio with decreasing size of microstructures, interfaces introduce a physical length into the effective response at the macroscale. The most commonly studied interface models are the cohesive interface model and the elastic interface model . The cohesive interface model allows for a displacement jump across the interface, in contrast to the elastic interface model that requires displacement continuity across the interface. The classical general interface model assumes that the interface displacement itself must coincide with the displacement average across the interface. The recently proposed extended general interface model defines the interface displacement kinematically via the weighted average of displacement across the interface. Here, we propose a canonical interface model based on a variationally consistent approach, which encompasses all previous interface models. We implement our model with the finite element method and illustrate its consequences through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, variationally consistent homogenization is employed to upscale an elastic composite with particles surrounded by a canonical interface and embedded in a matrix. The numerical results highlight the significance of the canonical interface model on the overall response of composites, at times leading to counter-intuitive behavior at the macroscale.},

The proposed method employs a novel information-theoretic criterion to measure the relative importance of dimensionless quantities, whereas the existing methodologies rely on sensitivity/derivative-based measures. This entropy-based measure provides two significant advantages: (1) invariance (objectivity) with respect to reparametrizations of variables, and (2) robustness against outliers. Numerical results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in these aspects, and enables identifying dominant dimensionless quantities.

The necessity for robust solvers for junctions in networks is evident from the extensive literature and the variety of proposed methods. While multidimensional coupled approaches that model junctions as two-dimensional spaces have shown success, they lack the computational efficiency of pure 1D methods that treat junctions as singular points. In this context, existing JRP-based methods have primarily been limited to subcritical flow regimes. For the first time, this paper demonstrates that the Junction Riemann Problem can be effectively used as an internal boundary condition across all flow regimes representing a junction of channels. The proposed JRP solution is both simple and robust, accommodating various flow regimes and an arbitrary number of channels without requiring additional information. Furthermore, it is shown that the JRP can be solved efficiently at internal boundaries and integrated with a standard first-order Godunov scheme to yield accurate results. The validation of this method is confirmed through a series of test cases, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling free-surface flows.},

The hexagonal quadrature scheme is fitted to correctly integrate the stored energy density within the nonlocal finite-sized neighborhood of a continuum point subject to affine expansion. Our proposed hexagonal quadrature scheme is grid-independent by relying on appropriate interpolation of pertinent quantities from collocation to quadrature points. In this contribution, we discuss linear and quadratic interpolations and compare our novel hexagonal quadrature scheme to common grid-dependent quadrature schemes. For this, we consider both, tetragonal and hexagonal discretizations of the domain. The accuracy of the presented quadrature schemes is first evaluated and compared by computing the stored energy density of various prescribed affine deformations within the nonlocal neighborhood. Furthermore, we perform three different boundary value problems, where we measure the effective Poisson’s ratio resulting from each quadrature scheme and evaluate the deformation of a unit square under extension and beam bending. Key findings of our studies are: The Poisson’s test is a good indicator for the convergence behavior of quadrature schemes with respect to the grid density. The accuracy of quadrature schemes depends, as expected, on their ability to appropriately capture the deformation within the nonlocal neighborhood. Our novel hexagonal quadrature scheme, rendering the correct effective Poisson’s ratio of 1 / 3 for small deformations, together with quadratic interpolation consequently yields the most accurate results for the studies presented in this contribution, thereby effectively reducing the computational cost.},

We then propose a slight modification that makes the ESFEM inherently applicable to negative-Jacobian Q4 elements without requiring any ad hoc stabilization. For the ESFEM, a smoothing cell (SC) attached to negative-Jacobian Q4 element is rebuilt on the midpoint of the shorter diagonal of the damaged element. Thus, the SC has a positive area that accounts correctly for inertial effects of transient problems. Such a treatment is compatible with the regular procedure for constructing an edge-based SC in normal Q4 elements. The mesh insensitivity of the ESFEM is highlighted by solving fluid–structure interaction on negative-Jacobian Q4 elements. Importantly, the present scheme can be generalized to other linear n -sided elements which are more likely to be badly distorted in complex moving-domain problems.},

This approach explores the use of non-planar layers, leveraging the increased manufacturing flexibility provided by robotic arms. Additionally, our method allows for the concurrent optimization of the structural layout and corresponding fabrication sequence. We employ the inherent strain method as a simplified process simulation model to predict residual stresses and distortions.

  abstract     = {Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are critically needed for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications, particularly in digital twin contexts. Recent research on hybrid approaches combining numerical methods and machine learning in end-to-end training has shown significant improvements over either approach alone. However, using neural networks as surrogate models generally exhibits limitations in generalizability over different settings and in capturing the evolution of solution discontinuities. In this work, we develop a model-constrained discontinuous Galerkin Network ( DGNet ) approach, a significant extension to our previous work (Nguyen and Bui-Thanh, 2022), for compressible Euler equations with out-of-distribution generalization. The core of DGNet is the synergy of several key strategies: (i) leveraging time integration schemes to capture temporal correlation and taking advantage of neural network speed for computation time reduction. This is the key to the temporal discretization-invariant property of DGNet ; (ii) employing a model-constrained approach to ensure the learned tangent slope satisfies governing equations; (iii) utilizing a DG-inspired architecture for GNN where edges represent Riemann solver surrogate models and nodes represent volume integration correction surrogate models, enabling capturing discontinuity capability, aliasing error reduction, and mesh discretization generalizability. Such a design allows DGNet to learn the DG spatial discretization accurately; (iv) developing an input normalization strategy that allows surrogate models to generalize across different initial conditions, geometries, meshes, boundary conditions, and solution orders. In fact, the normalization is the key to spatial discretization-invariance for DGNet ; and (v) incorporating a data randomization technique that not only implicitly promotes agreement between surrogate models and true numerical models up to second-order derivatives, ensuring long-term stability and prediction capacity, but also serves as a data generation engine during training, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen data. To validate the theoretical results, effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of our novel DGNet approach, we present comprehensive numerical results for 1D and 2D compressible Euler equation problems, including Sod Shock Tube, Lax Shock Tube, Isentropic Vortex, Forward Facing Step, Scramjet, Airfoil, Euler Benchmarks, Double Mach Reflection, and a Hypersonic Sphere Cone benchmark.},

  abstract     = {We present a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian method for the direct simulation of three-dimensional, heterogeneous, active, and self-propelling structures made of soft fibers and operating in incompressible viscous flows. Fiber-based organization of matter is pervasive in nature and engineering, from biological architectures made of cilia, hair, muscles or bones to polymers, composite materials or soft robots. In nature, many such structures are adapted to manipulate flows for feeding, swimming or energy harvesting, through mechanisms that are often not fully understood. While simulations can support the analysis (and subsequent translational engineering) of these systems, extreme fibers’ aspect-ratios, large elastic deformations, two-way coupling with three-dimensional flows, and self-propulsion all render the problem numerically challenging. To address this, we couple Cosserat rod theory, where fibers’ dynamics is accurately captured in one-dimensional fashion, with the velocity–vorticity formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations, through a virtual boundary technique. The favorable properties of the resultant hydroelastic solver are demonstrated against a battery of benchmarks, and further showcased in a range of multi-physics scenarios, involving magnetic actuation, viscous streaming, biomechanics, multi-body interaction, and untethered swimming.},

  abstract     = {The Parrot Optimization Algorithm (PO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm developed based on the social and adaptive behaviors of Pyrrhura molinae parrots. PO demonstrates robust optimization performance by balancing exploration and exploitation, mimicking foraging and cooperative activities. However, as the algorithm progresses through iterations, it faces critical challenges in maintaining search diversity and movement efficiency diminishes, leading to premature convergence and a reduced ability to find optimal solutions in complex search space. To address these limitations, this work introduces the Dynamic Turbulent-based Parrot Optimization Algorithm (DTPO), which represents a significant advancement over the original PO by incorporating three novel strategies: a novel Differential Mutation (DM), Dynamic Opposite Learning (DOL), and Turbulent Operator (TO). The DM Strategy enhances exploration by introducing controlled variations in the population, allowing DTPO to escape local optima. Also, the DOL Strategy dynamically generates opposite solutions to refresh stagnated populations, expanding the search space and maintaining adaptability. Finally, the TO strategy simulates chaotic movements inspired by turbulence, ensuring a thorough local search while preserving population diversity. Together, these strategies improve the algorithm&#39;s ability to explore, exploit, and converge efficiently. Furthermore, the DTPO&#39;s performance was rigorously evaluated on benchmark functions from CEC2017 and CEC2022, comparing it against 23 state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate DTPO&#39;s superior convergence speed, search efficiency, and optimization accuracy. Additionally, DTPO was tested on seven engineering design problems, achieving significant improvements over the original PO algorithm, with superior performance gains compared to other algorithms in real-world scenarios. Particularly, DTPO outperformed competing algorithms in 37 out of 41 benchmark functions, achieving an overall success rate of 90.24%. Moreover, DTPO obtained the best Friedman ranks across all comparisons, with values ranging from 3.03 to 1.18, demonstrating its superiority over classical, advanced, and recent algorithms. These results validate the proposed enhancements and highlight DTPO&#39;s robustness and effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Recently, several topology optimization methods in the Lagrangian or Eulerian description has accepted a wide of discussions, which have been applied to several design problems. In the current work, the primary intention is to propose the Particle Flow Topology Optimization (PFTO) approach in a Lagrangian-Eulerian description, which can sufficiently unify their unique characteristics and superiorities for the optimization with a higher effectiveness. Firstly, an Isogeometric Material Points Method (I-MPM) is applied to develop the numerical analysis framework for particles to solve the static equilibrium equation, which can maintain the consistency of geometrical model and analysis model using the same NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) basis functions. Secondly, a Lagrangian-Eulerian particle flow model is proposed for representing structural topology in the optimization, which consists of several critical components, namely the mappings of physical information (P2C: Particles to Control points, C2G: Control points to Gauss quadrature points), the inverse mappings of sensitivity information (G2C and C2P). Thirdly, the mathematical formulation for the maximization of structural loading-capability is developed using the PFTO approach, in which physical positions and material consumptions of particles are design variables to drive the evolvement of structural topology. The sensitivity analysis of the objective and constraint functions with respect to design variables at particles, namely physical information is derived in detail. Finally, several numerical design examples in 2D and 3D are performed to demonstrate the validity, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed PFTO approach, and the indispensability of particles movement for the optimization is also sufficiently studied.},

  abstract     = {In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. Leveraging scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques, the framework effectively identifies Pareto-optimal solutions that balance these conflicting objectives while accounting for the complexities of plastic material behaviour. Importantly, the approach also prevents problematic densification, ensuring structural integrity during impact. The results not only demonstrate the framework’s ability to outperform the NSGA-II algorithm but also highlight its potential for wider applications in structural and material optimisation. The framework’s adaptability to various design requirements underscores its capability to address complex, multi-objective optimisation challenges associated with real-world conditions.},

  abstract     = {In engineering systems, a digital twin serves as a digital replica encompassing both physical assets and their associated processes, such as manufacturing and certification. The implementation of digital twins offers substantial potential for various applications, including improved design, enhanced collaboration, effective energy management, risk mitigation, lifecycle management, and predictive maintenance. However, existing definitions of a “twin” are often ambiguous and lack a structured approach for developing digital twins, particularly for systems with unknown inputs. This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a clear definition and a robust methodology for building digital twins. Our methodology integrates projection-based model order reduction, a rapid approach for identifying unknown inputs, and a non-parametric probabilistic method for modeling and quantifying model-form uncertainty. Additionally, it incorporates a probabilistic learning approach for performing stochastic model updating. The effectiveness of this digital twinning methodology is illustrated through a case study involving an elevated truss footbridge located at the Autodesk Research facility at Pier 9 in San Francisco with unknown inputs. This case study underscores the importance of accurately modeling uncertainty to enhance the performance and reliability of digital twins in real-world engineering applications.},

Our novel approach, the “hierarchical unit-cell template method,” is an interpretable machine-learning approach that uncovers global unit-cell shape/topology patterns corresponding to predefined band-gap objectives. A scale-separation effect is observed where the coarse-scale band-gap objective is mostly unaffected by the fine-scale features despite the closeness of their length scales, thus enabling an efficient hierarchical algorithm. Moreover, the hierarchical patterns revealed are not predefined or self-similar hierarchies as common in current hierarchical phononic materials.

To overcome the limitation of traditional fatigue life prediction models, a multi-fidelity physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework is proposed. In this framework, the uncertainty quantification of fatigue performance and the fitting low-fidelity fatigue data with physical consistency are achieved through a physics-guided Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). The introduced concept of transfer learning allows training a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) using multi-fidelity fatigue data during the training process. Embedding the effect of manufacturing defects on fatigue performance as physical constraints can ensure the physical consistency of the overall multi-fidelity framework. Compared with traditional neural network (NN) and PiNN, the multi-fidelity framework has significant advantages in strong prediction performance, generalization ability and effectiveness.

  abstract     = {The real microstructures of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) play a crucial role in determining their damage behavior. However, considering the real microstructure within the high-fidelity numerical simulation usually leads to expensive computational costs. In this study, an end-to-end deep-learning (DL) framework is proposed to predict the evolution of damage fields for CMCs from their real microstructures, which are characterized through computed tomography (CT). Three sub-networks, including the microstructure processing network (MPN), elastic deformation prediction network (EPN), and damage sequence prediction network (DPN), are used to construct a two-stage DL model. In the first stage, the geometrical characteristics of real microstructure are precisely captured by the MPN with over 92 % precision for the yarns and matrix. In the second stage, the elastic deformation predicted by the EPN is taken as the intermediate variable to motivate the damage prediction of DPN with the MPN-predicted microstructure as input. The damage evolution of real microstructure is finally predicted with a mean relative error of 10.8 % for the primary damage variable fields. The high-damage regions in the microstructure can also be accurately captured with a mean precision of 87.9 %. The proposed model is further validated by the in-situ tensile experiment. The micro-cracks are proven to initiate and propagate in the high-damage regions. Compared with the high-fidelity numerical methods, this DL-based method can predict the damage evolution on the fly, avoiding time-consuming computation and poor convergence during the damage analysis.},

  abstract     = {Embedded boundary methods (EBMs) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and nonlinear fluid–structure interaction (FSI) – also known as immersed boundary methods, Cartesian methods, or fictitious domain methods – are the most robust methods for the solution of flow problems past obstacles that undergo large relative motions, significant deformations, large shape modifications, and/or surface topology changes. They can also introduce a high degree of automation in the task of grid generation and significant flexibility in the gridding of complex geometries. However, just like in the case of their counterpart body-fitted methods, their application to parametric flow computations at high Reynolds numbers remains today impractical in most engineering environments. For body-fitted CFD, the state of the art of projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) has significantly advanced during the last decade and demonstrated a remarkable success at reducing the dimensionality and wall-clock time of high Reynolds number models, while maintaining a desirable level of accuracy. For non-body-fitted CFD however, PMOR is still in its infancy, primarily because EBMs dynamically partition the computational fluid domain into real and ghost subdomains, which complicates the collection of solution snapshots and their compression into a reduced-order basis. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper presents a robust computational framework for PMOR in the context of high Reynolds number flows and in the EBM setting of CFD/FSI (PMOR-EBM). The framework incorporates a hyperreduction approach based on the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method to accelerate the evaluation of the repeated projections arising in nonlinear implicit computations; and a piecewise-affine approach for constructing a nonlinear low-dimensional approximation of the solution to mitigate the Kolmogorov n -width barrier to the reducibility of transport models. The paper also assesses the performance of the proposed computational framework PMOR-EBM for two unsteady turbulent flow problems whose predictions necessitate or benefit from the application of an EBM; and two shape-parametric steady-state studies of the academic type but of relevance to design analysis and optimization.},

To this end, we implement and evaluate different methods aiming at balancing the contributions of multiple terms of the PINN’s loss function and their gradients. After reviewing three existing loss scaling approaches (Learning Rate Annealing, GradNorm and SoftAdapt), we propose a novel self-adaptive loss balancing scheme for PINNs named ReLoBRaLo (Relative Loss Balancing with Random Lookback). We extensively evaluate the performance of the aforementioned balancing schemes by solving both forward as well as inverse problems on three benchmark PDEs for PINNs: Burgers’ equation, Kirchhoff’s plate bending equation, Helmholtz’s equation and over 20 PDEs from the ”PINNacle” collection. The results show that ReLoBRaLo is able to consistently outperform the baseline of existing scaling methods in terms of accuracy while also inducing significantly less computational overhead for a variety of PDE classes.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the multiphysical coupling between a deformable structural body and the forces imposed on that body from a surrounding fluid can be a challenging and computationally expensive task, especially when the structure, fluid, or both exhibit nonlinear behavior. Consequently, there exists a need for novel reduced-order static aeroelasticity analysis techniques that make efficient use of high-fidelity computational models, especially for preliminary design of next-generation aerostructures with high-aspect ratio lifting surfaces exhibiting large deformations or in situ geometric reconfigurations driven by nonlinear mechanisms. This work presents the compositional static aeroelastic analysis method: an embarrassingly parallelizable data-driven modeling technique that seeks to construct a system-level aeroelastic surrogate model representing the function composition of high-fidelity structural and fluid models in terms of shape parameters characterizing a reduced-order geometric description of the deformed fluid–structure interface. By formulating the static aeroelasticity problem as a fixed point problem, the proposed reduced-order modeling framework removes the need for a reduced-order representation of the traction field acting on the structure, unlike previous data-driven methods that independently train separate fluid and structural surrogate models. Additionally, by replacing the iterative exchange of full-order aeroelastic coupling variables with a statistical exploration of a reduced-order shape parameter space, the minimum computational time for approximating a static aeroelastic response is equivalent to one set of high-fidelity fluid and structural model evaluations. The following work presents the theoretical development of the proposed compositional method and demonstrates its use in two case studies, one of which involves a cantilevered baffle comprised of linear and nonlinear material with large deformations exceeding 35%. Numerical results show close agreement with a conventional partitioned analysis scheme, where tip displacement error is less than 1% in both material cases. It is also demonstrated how traction field information can be reused when considering structural modifications to circumvent the need for additional computationally expensive fluid model evaluations.},

  abstract     = {A computational framework for microstructure evolution in metallic polycrystals is achieved by coupling large deformation Cosserat isotropic hyperelasticity with a phase-field model to take into account grain boundary formation and motion. Each material point has an associated crystal lattice orientation described by the Cosserat microrotation, which can evolve due to deformation or grain boundary migration. The analysis is restricted to transformations in the solid state. The numerical treatment of the proposed model requires some consideration. Discretization by finite elements leads to a strongly nonlinear, coupled system. The microrotation is parametrized to facilitate the numerical treatment of incremental updates of the Cosserat degrees of freedom. In order to reduce computation time and effort, a parallel computing mechanism based on domain decomposition is adopted together with an iterative staggered scheme to avoid the ill-conditioning inherent to the monolithic coupled system of equations.},

The traditional homogenization method may face challenge due to extremely expensive computational cost, when the non-linear effective viscosities on all the directions of Particle Reinforced Thermoplastics (PRT) are demanded. This paper approaches this challenge with the FEM-Cluster based reduced order Analysis (FCA) method [1]. The governing equations are solved by minimizing a cluster-based dual formulation of the dissipating energy, where the cluster-wise Admissible Shear Stress (ASS) set is obtained by FCA together with a Spectrum Analysis Algorithm (SAA). In addition, considering the fact that there is a lack of effective method for determining the proper number of clusters, a cluster metric is developed, which relates the given number of clusters and the prediction accuracy of FCA method. This metric can be easily used in the offline stage to pre-estimate the applicability of the obtained clusters on the given loading conditions with a small amount of additional computation.},

The framework is validated through four numerical test cases, including simulations of a hinged flag, an inverted flag, a membrane airfoil, and an air-supported membrane structure.

  abstract     = {Allen–Cahn equation is a reaction–diffusion equation and is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen–Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives, and the large system size required by the space–time approach. To overcome these challenges, we propose solving the L 2 gradient flow of the Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional, which is equivalent to the Allen–Cahn equation, thereby avoiding the second-order spatial derivatives associated with the Allen–Cahn equation. A minimizing movement scheme is employed to solve the gradient flow problem, eliminating the complexities of a space–time approach. We utilize a separable neural network that efficiently represents the phase field through low-rank tensor decomposition. As we use the minimizing movement scheme to numerically solve the gradient flow problem, we thus, refer to the proposed method as the Separable Deep Minimizing Movement (SDMM) method. The evaluation of the functional in the minimizing movement scheme using the Gauss quadrature technique bypasses the inaccuracies associated with collocation techniques traditionally used to solve partial differential equations. A hyperbolic tangent transformation is introduced on the phase field prior to the evaluation of the functional to ensure that it remains strictly bounded within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that this transformation helps to improve the accuracy and efficiency significantly. The proposed method resolves the challenges faced by state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, outperforming them in both accuracy and efficiency. It is also the first machine learning method to achieve an order of magnitude speed improvement over the finite element method. In addition to its formulation and computational implementation, several case studies illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. 1},

The key innovation is the direct computation of the Jacobian matrix within the time-marching algorithm used to obtain periodic orbits, including both the monodromy matrix and derivatives with respect to the continuation parameter. For smooth problems, the resulting Jacobian matrix is algorithmically exact: while the equations of motion are approximated using a user-selected time-integration scheme, the differentiation of the computed solution is performed exactly. This approach eliminates the need for numerical differentiation, significantly improving both the efficiency and robustness of the path-following process. Although the theoretical framework assumes differentiability, the method effectively handles piecewise smooth problems as well. Numerical tests demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to traditional techniques that rely on numerical differentiation. To further validate its effectiveness and versatility, we present numerical examples involving the Finite Element discretization of three-dimensional problems, including shell structures.},

The local adaptive refinement is driven by a recovery-based error estimator. Truncated hierarchical NURBS (TH-NURBS) are utilized for local adaptive mesh refinement due to their excellent properties, such as linear independence, partition-of-unity, and exact description of complex geometry. Multi-patch technique is applied to model complex structures, with Nitsche’s method as the coupling strategy. The computational accuracy of the proposed model is verified through several 3D numerical examples.

  abstract     = {Surrogate modeling plays an increasingly important role in engineering design. The present work develops a novel surrogate model, region-optimal Gaussian process (roGP), to accurately emulate cold-flow and combustion fields in a significantly short time period. The model leverages an advanced statistical approach, Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model, to partition the entire spatial domain of concern into discrete subregions in a physics-informed manner. Each subregion contains the common features embedded in the collected dataset and is modeled by a Gaussian process (GP) with shared hyperparameters. Additionally, an active learning strategy iteratively refines the training dataset by prioritizing high-uncertainty regions, further enhancing predictive accuracy. The roGP model is evaluated on three representative cases of increasing complexity, consistently outperforming conventional GP-based surrogates. Results show that roGP effectively mitigates overfitting in independent GP models and reduces information loss in proper-orthogonal-decomposition GP models. In all test cases, roGP achieves superior spatial prediction accuracy, with relative root mean square errors below 5.5 %. A unique characteristic of the roGP model is that the DP-optimized subregions of roGP connect physics-alike coordinates among sampling design points. The entire pressure field in cold-flow case is effectively described by five subregions, while physical fields in two combustion cases require the elevated number of subregions due to their increased complexity. roGP achieves substantial acceleration in prediction time, up to eight orders of magnitude faster than numerical simulations. The developed surrogate model can be implemented to emulate a range of high-dimensional engineering applications with high accuracy and efficiency.},

In this work, we developed a multiscale PD framework for modeling thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviors of FRP composites for the first time. The whole cure process is modeled by a macroscale thermo-chemical coupling behavior of the FRP specimen followed by a microscale thermo-chemo-mechanical coupling process of the representative volume element (RVE) taken from the macro specimen. After the multiscale cure modeling, the resulted residual stress distribution is maintained when applying the mechanical loading. The proposed PD framework was validated by examining the temperature and degree of cure histories and the stress-strain curves against experimental data. The effects of periodic boundary condition (PBC) treatments, fiber content, fiber distribution and chemical shrinkage are explored. Cure-induced residual stress can amplify the local stress concentration and damage in the fiber‒matrix interfaces. Results show that PBC treatments have negligible influence on the final damage distribution while the fiber content and distribution can pose huge impact on the strain and stress history of the RVE. In addition, chemical shrinkage can complicate the stress state and impact the mechanical response of composites. This model can serve as a potential tool for predicting the process-induced residual stress and damage and contributes to improved composites designs.},

This approach, coined compatible FEINNs, has been used to accurately approximate the H ( curl ) inner product. We numerically observe that the trained network outperforms finite element solutions by several orders of magnitude for smooth analytical solutions. Furthermore, to showcase the versatility of the method, we demonstrate that compatible FEINNs achieve high accuracy in solving surface PDEs such as the Darcy equation on a sphere. Additionally, the framework can integrate adaptive mesh refinements to effectively solve problems with localised features. We use an adaptive training strategy to train the network on a sequence of progressively adapted meshes. Finally, we compare compatible FEINNs with the adjoint neural network method for solving inverse problems. We consider a one-loop algorithm that trains the neural networks for unknowns and missing parameters using a loss function that includes PDE residual and data misfit terms. The algorithm is applied to identify space-varying physical parameters for the H ( curl ) model problem from partial, noisy, or boundary observations.

KANs have already been integrated into various architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, and their potential has been assessed for predicting physical quantities. However, the combination of KANs with point-cloud-based neural networks (e.g., PointNet) for computational physics has not yet been explored. To address this, we present Kolmogorov–Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared KANs in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Furthermore, we examine the robustness of KA-PointNet in the presence of noisy training data and missing points in the point clouds of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared MLPs. It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs. Moreover, KA-PointNet predicts the pressure and velocity distributions along the surface of cylinders more accurately, resulting in more precise computations of lift and drag.},

  abstract     = {Effectively estimating output probability distributions in stochastic static and dynamic systems with a limited number of simulations is a significant challenge, especially for complex distributions with multi-modality and heavy tails. To address this challenge, this work explores the potential of the Laplace Transform (LT) and its inversion. First, the statistical information embedded in the derivatives of the LT is analysed, establishing the theoretical foundation for recovering output probability distributions. Subsequently, a novel analytical expression for the response probability density function (PDF) is derived by decomposing its inverse LT (ILT) using Euler’s formula. Building on the numerically estimated LT, a non-parametric numerical solution, termed the Numerical Decomposed ILT (NDILT) algorithm, is developed to flexibly estimate the main body of complex PDFs with limited samples. Second, the Taylor expansion of the real component of LT (RCLT) reveals its rich statistical content. Exploiting this property, another parametric method, the LT-based Maximum Entropy Method (LT-MEM), is proposed, incorporating estimated RCLT as constraints of the maximum entropy principle. By solving an optimization problem, LT-MEM can effectively reconstruct complex PDFs across their entire distribution domain using a small sample size. The proposed methods rediscover and harness the power of the LT and ILT to reconstruct complex-shaped probability distributions, offering a valuable alternative. Parameter selection strategies for NDILT and LT-MEM are provided, and their robust accuracy is validated through analytical and numerical examples across various challenging distributions.},

  abstract     = {Spatial truss structures represent a robust, cost-effective, and efficient lightweight design, especially when isotropic materials are substituted with lightweight materials such as composites. During early design phases, truss structures are often subject to optimisations. In order to achieve this in an efficient manner, it is essential to employ a precise yet cost-effective computational model. The most common methodology for the analysis of spatial truss structures employs hinged joints in conjunction with struts that are only subject to tension or compression. However, this approach does not account for the bending and coupling effects inherent to struts manufactured from composite materials. In particular, when employing asymmetric laminates, these effects can no longer be ignored. In order to incorporate these effects, it is common practice to use Finite Element Analysis tools. Particularly for large spatial truss structures comprising struts with slender and thin-walled cross-sections, a large number of solid or shell elements is required, which results in time-consuming simulations. This contribution presents a fully analytical thin-walled composite beam element, applicable to an arbitrarily shaped, closed cross-section. The beam model incorporates two distinct composite material models, namely the Classical Laminate Plate Theory and the First Order Shear Deformation Theory. Moreover, it is capable of simulating asymmetric laminates and modelling the coupling effects within these laminates. Utilising the exact third-order solution of a composite Timoshenko - Ehrenfest beam enables the locking-free representation of an individual strut with a single beam element. In comparison to the conventional shell / solid Finite Element Analysis, this approach results in a substantial reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, by a factor of several orders of magnitude. As a result, the required computational time is significantly reduced. In the case of a single strut, the computational time is reduced by a factor between 160 and 430. For an exemplary truss structure comprising 64 struts, a reduction in computational time of approximately 100 000 times is reached. The numerical comparisons presented in this contribution demonstrate that the model is highly accurate, particularly for tubular and elliptical cross-sections including symmetric and asymmetric laminates.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a Virtual Element formulation (VE) for shear-deformable elastic plates. In particular, the Hybrid Virtual Element Method (HVEM) is adopted, which assumes a self-equilibrated stress interpolation and an energy-based projection, eliminating the need for stabilization terms. This choice, together with a cubic linked interpolation for displacement and rotations, makes the approach free from locking, even for very thin plates and highly distorted element geometries. These features enable the proposed VE to achieve high accuracy even for coarse meshes, yielding low errors when compared to analytical solutions and providing a smooth reconstruction of all the stress field components. Furthermore, low error in both the displacement and stress fields are obtained in the challenging case of single element polygonal discretization. The same performance are guaranteed in presence of bulk loads, thanks to a consistent treatment within the projection operation that a-priori assumes equilibrium for the stress field interpolation. A random-based benchmark is proposed for assessing numerically the absence of spurious modes in concave and convex distorted elements. The proposed HVEM for plate is validated in classical benchmark problems, demonstrating the superior accuracy of polygonal meshes compared to the quadrilateral ones, for an equivalent number of degrees of freedom. This result is relevant in all the applications where polygonal element shapes are necessary. In addition, it opens up the way to new modeling scenarios where polygonal meshes are preferred not only for their versatility but also for their enhanced accuracy.},

Increasing the number of linear bases in the reduction method for substructures does not affect the number of nonlinear equations, unlike in component mode synthesis techniques. The performance of the method is evaluated through three case studies: a lumped parameter system with cubic nonlinearity, bars with a small gap (normal contact), and a plate with a couple of nonlinear energy sinks.

  abstract     = {The optimization design of the microstructures and their macro distribution in porous composite structures (PCS) offers significant potential for achieving both lightweight and functional performance. This paper proposes a novel optimization design framework for PCS with varying densities and multiple microstructures. Initially, components topology optimization (TO-Components) using ordered SIMP interpolation is applied to determine the type and density distribution of void, solid and porous materials. Following this, element stress state analysis calculates the stress-to-density ratio ( s e ) for each porous material element. A two-level k-means++ clustering method, based on s e and density, then replaces the widely used manual partitioning, enabling optimal subregion division for the specified number of microstructure types. This approach identifies representative unit cells (RUCs) for the subsequent topology optimization of RUCs (TO-RUCs). The TO-RUCs process designs the microstructures of each RUC using homogenization theory to minimize strain energy. Three benchmark numerical examples take only 1 to 2 min to complete the full-scale design. Additionally, the scalability of the design for both uniform and variable density PCS is explored. The comparison examples demonstrate that the proposed method reduces optimization time by an order of magnitude while maintaining consistent full-scale compliance, using the same material quantity, compared to existing methods. Finally, additive manufacturing and mechanical testing of the optimized structures confirm the performance benefits.},

Exploiting the VEs substantial insensitivity to mesh distortion, the propagating cohesive crack is accommodated within existing self-stabilized first-order quadrilateral VEs by simply adding new edges separated by a cohesive interface. The added edges make however the VE unstable and a new procedure for the stabilization of initially stable VE is developed. The method is formulated within a recently proposed Hu–Washizu variational framework, allowing for a higher order, independent modeling of stresses. In this way, a more accurate estimate of the stress at the tip of the cohesive process zone can be achieved allowing for a more accurate assessment of crack propagation conditions and direction.

Diblock copolymers, composed of two distinct polymer blocks, are capable of forming nanostructured domains with applications in nanoelectronics, photonics, and advanced membranes. Current simulation techniques face challenges in capturing the multiscale dynamics of polymer systems and are often limited by computational inefficiencies. Our approach combines a phase-field model with FSM for spatial discretization and leverages a PD-based diffusion operator to overcome the stability restrictions of explicit time-stepping schemes. This integration allows for larger time steps, ensuring both stability and computational efficiency. The method’s scalability is enhanced through parallel implementation using C++ and OpenMP, optimized for multi-core CPUs. Validation through phase diagrams of copolymer melts and simulations of evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) processes demonstrates the capability of the proposed method to accurately capture large-scale, dynamic morphologies. Our approach provides a versatile framework and was found in certain examples to improve computational efficiency by more than a factor of 6 compared to forward-Euler FSM approach.},

  abstract     = {Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress, stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics) in hyperelastic, two-dimensional, microporous materials. Predicting these pattern transformations means predicting the displacement field. To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E ( n ) -equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E ( n ) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, we introduce a varying-order (VO) NURBS discretization method to enhance the performance of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) technique for solving three-dimensional (3D) large deformation frictional contact problems involving two deformable bodies. Building on the promising results obtained from the previous work on the 2D isogeometric contact analysis (Agrawal and Gautam, 2020), this work extends the method’s capability for tri-variate NURBS-based discretization. The proposed method allows for independent, user-defined application of higher-order NURBS functions to discretize the contact surface while employing the minimum order NURBS for the remaining volume of the elastic solid. This flexible strategy enables the possibility to refine a NURBS-constructed solid at a fixed mesh with the controllable order elevation-based approach while preserving the original volume parametrization. The advantages of the method are twofold. First, employing higher-order NURBS for contact integral evaluations considerably enhances the accuracy of the contact responses at a fixed mesh, fully exploiting the advantage of higher-order NURBS specifically for contact computations. Second, the minimum order NURBS for the computations in the remaining bulk volume substantially reduces the computational cost inherently associated with the standard uniform order NURBS-based isogeometric contact analyses. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated using various contact problems between elastic solids with or without considering friction. The results with the standard uniform order of tri-variate NURBS-based discretizations are also included to provide a comprehensive comparative assessment. We show that to attain results of similar accuracy, the varying-order NURBS discretization uses a much coarser mesh resolution than the standard uniform-order NURBS-based discretization, hence leading to a major gain in computational efficiency for isogeometric contact analysis. The convergence study demonstrates the consistent performance of the method for efficient IGA of 3D frictional contact problems. Furthermore, the simplicity of the method facilitates its direct integration into the existing 3D NURBS-based IGA framework with only a few minor modifications.},

  abstract     = {This contribution investigates sources of insufficiencies observed with the Capriccio method for concurrent continuum-particle coupling using a novel comparison technique. This approach maps the deformation states of three-dimensional (3D) coupled domains into a concise one-dimensional (1D) representation, which allows for a separate evaluation of the domain strains in a unified representation, enabling facile comparisons of the domain states during deformation. For the investigation, we employ both a 1D coupled system resembling the most relevant features of the full 3D Capriccio method as well as a corresponding 3D setup. Our analysis explores interactions between different material models in finite element (FE) and molecular dynamics (MD) domains. Based on various load cases studied in the 1D setup, we identify a resistance of the coupling region to spatial movement as the fundamental cause of strain convergence problems when applying the staggered solution scheme. Using the developed mapping approach, examination of the corresponding 3D setup reveals that these strain inconsistencies are even exacerbated by adverse relaxation effects in viscous MD models, particularly when coupled to a corresponding viscoelastic–viscoplastic FE model, leading to divergence from optimal strain. Our findings confirm that smaller strain increments in combination with larger load step numbers significantly improve strain convergence in all domains. Overall, this indicates the need for detailed sensitivity analysis of coupling parameter influences to reduce the identified motion resistance of the coupling region. Based on promising results in 1D, we further recommend exploring monolithic solving schemes for 3D systems to achieve optimal strain convergence for all types of Capriccio-based coupled particle and continuum material models. Moreover, our systematic approach of system definition and interdimensional comparison may serve as a model to assess other domain-decomposition coupling techniques.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the discrete nature of solid structures is crucial, particularly in situations where system behavior relies on material discontinuities, such as fracture and wear, along with their subsequent effects. It is not only essential to investigate when failure or discontinuity occurs within a material, but also how it unfolds and impacts its surroundings. While numerical methods serve as effective tools for analyzing structural behavior, continuum-based approaches may not provide a comprehensive view when dealing with discontinuities in a material. Discrete models provide the capability to simulate these discontinuities by bonding discrete elements (particles) together, thereby also simulating continuum behavior. However, the challenge lies in packing these particles within a complex-shaped structure. The dynamic packing approach excels in generating a tightly packed, randomly arranged bonded-particle structure with consistent mechanical behavior. However, it struggles when it comes to generating complex geometries. Conversely, the geometric approach is proficient at generating complex structures but lacks the reliability needed to simulate engineering materials. The method outlined in this paper represents the first attempt to dynamically pack particles within a complex geometry while maintaining all the necessary mechanical properties to accurately model isotropic engineering materials. Such precision in structure and methodology is vital for calibrating the bonds, ensuring that the bonded-particle structure behaves similarly to real materials. As an example, several bonded-particle structures are generated and tested to demonstrate the complexity of their shapes and their realistic mechanical behavior.},
