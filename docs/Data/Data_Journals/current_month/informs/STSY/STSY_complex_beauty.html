  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide explicit upper bounds on some distances between the (law of the) output of a random Gaussian neural network and (the law of) a random Gaussian vector. Our main results concern deep random Gaussian neural networks with a rather general activation function. The upper bounds show how the widths of the layers, the activation function, and other architecture parameters affect the Gaussian approximation of the output. Our techniques, relying on Stein’s method and integration by parts formulas for the Gaussian law, yield estimates on distances that are indeed integral probability metrics and include the convex distance. This latter metric is defined by testing against indicator functions of measurable convex sets and so allows for accurate estimates of the probability that the output is localized in some region of the space, which is an aspect of a significant interest both from a practitioner’s and a theorist’s perspective. We illustrated our results by some numerical examples.

  abstract     = {We construct a fast exact algorithm for the simulation of the first-passage time, jointly with the undershoot and overshoot, of a tempered stable subordinator over an arbitrary, nonincreasing, absolutely continuous function. We prove that the running time of our algorithm has finite exponential moments and provide bounds on its expected running time, with explicit dependence on the characteristics of the process and the initial value of the function. The expected running time grows most cubically in the stability parameter (as it approaches either 0 or 1) and is linear in the tempering parameter and the initial value of the function. Numerical performance, based on the implementation in the dedicated GitHub repository, exhibits a good agreement with our theoretical bounds. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the performance of our algorithm in Monte Carlo estimation. Funding: J. I. González Cázares and A.

  abstract     = {The basic adjoint relationship (BAR) approach is an analysis technique based on the stationary equation of a Markov process. This approach was introduced to study heavy-traffic, steady-state convergence of generalized Jackson networks in which each service station has a single job class. We extend it to multiclass queueing networks operating under static-buffer-priority (SBP) service disciplines. Our extension makes a connection with Palm distributions that allows one to attack a difficulty arising from queue-length truncation, which appears to be unavoidable in the multiclass setting. For multiclass queueing networks operating under SBP service disciplines, our BAR approach provides an alternative to the “interchange of limits” approach that has dominated the literature in the last twenty years. The BAR approach can produce sharp results and allows one to establish steady-state convergence under three additional conditions: stability, state space collapse (SSC) and a certain matrix being “tight.” These three conditions do not appear to depend on the interarrival and service-time distributions beyond their means, and their verification can be studied as three separate modules. In particular, they can be studied in a simpler, continuous-time Markov chain setting when all distributions are exponential. As an example, these three conditions are shown to hold in reentrant lines operating under last-buffer-first-serve discipline. In a two-station, five-class reentrant line, under the heavy-traffic condition, the tight-matrix condition implies both the stability condition and the SSC condition. Whether such a relationship holds generally is an open problem.},
