  abstract     = {Decision trees are a widely used tool for interpretable machine learning. Multivariate decision trees employ hyperplanes at the branch nodes to route datapoints throughout the tree and yield more compact models than univariate trees. Recently, mixed-integer programming (MIP) has been applied to formulate the optimal decision tree problem. A key component of most MIP formulations is a specification of how to route datapoints in the tree from the root to the leaves. Our goal is to provide polyhedral characterizations of realizable routings, that is, routings that can be realized using multivariate branching rules. We first focus on shattering inequalities, a class of valid inequalities that can be used to strengthen almost any MIP formulation and that have been shown to be computationally effective. We prove that if all the feature vectors are in general position, then the shattering inequalities defined for the root of the tree are facet defining for the convex hull of the realizable routings. We then show that every facet-defining inequality of a depth one tree involving at least two variables is also facet defining for trees of arbitrary depth. Finally, we show that facet-defining inequalities characterizing realizable routings are also facet-defining for a complete MIP formulation. We validate our theoretical results by performing numerical experiments that specifically exploit shattering inequalities defined at the root node and we observe an improvement in performance for both numerical and categorical data sets, especially for decision trees of intermediate size.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the geometric landscape connection of the widely studied manifold and factorization formulations in low-rank positive semidefinite (PSD) and general matrix optimization. We establish a sandwich relation on the spectrum of Riemannian and Euclidean Hessians at first-order stationary points (FOSPs). As a result of that, we obtain an equivalence on the set of FOSPs, second-order stationary points, and strict saddles between the manifold and factorization formulations. In addition, we show that the sandwich relation can be used to transfer more quantitative geometric properties from one formulation to another. Similarities and differences in the landscape connection under the PSD case and the general case are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first geometric landscape connection between the manifold and factorization formulations for handling rank constraints, and it provides a geometric explanation for the similar empirical performance of factorization and manifold approaches in low-rank matrix optimization observed in the literature. In the general low-rank matrix optimization, the landscape connection of two factorization formulations (unregularized and regularized ones) is also provided. By applying these geometric landscape connections (in particular, the sandwich relation), we are able to solve unanswered questions in the literature and establish stronger results in the applications on geometric analysis of phase retrieval, well-conditioned low-rank matrix optimization, and the role of regularization in factorization arising from machine learning and signal processing.

  abstract     = {We study the problem of online resource allocation, where customers arrive sequentially, and the seller must irrevocably allocate resources to each incoming customer while also facing a prespecified procurement cost function over the total allocation. The objective is to maximize the reward obtained from fulfilling the customers’ requests sans the cumulative procurement cost. We analyze the competitive ratio of a primal-dual algorithm in this setting and develop an optimization framework for designing a surrogate function for the procurement cost to be used by the algorithm to improve the competitive ratio of the primal-dual algorithm. We use the optimal surrogate function for polynomial procurement cost functions to improve on previous bounds. For general procurement cost functions, our design method uses quasiconvex optimization to find optimal design parameters. We then implement the design techniques and show the improved performance of the algorithm in numerical examples. Finally, we extend the analysis by devising a posted pricing mechanism in which the algorithm does not require the customers’ preferences to be revealed. Funding: M.

  abstract     = {In a fixed-budget ranking and selection (R&amp;S) problem, one aims to identify the best design among a finite number of candidates by efficiently allocating the given computing budget to evaluate design performance. Classical methods for R&amp;S usually assume the distribution of the randomness in the system is exactly known. In this paper, we consider the practical scenario where the true distribution is unknown but can be estimated from streaming input data that arrive in batches over time. We formulate the R&amp;S problem in this dynamic setting as a multistage problem where we adopt the Bayesian approach to estimate the distribution, and we formulate a stagewise optimization problem to allocate the computing budget. We characterize the optimality conditions for the stagewise problem by applying the large deviations theory to maximize the decay rate of the probability of false selection. Based on the optimality conditions and combined with the updating of distribution estimates, we design two sequential budget allocation procedures for R&amp;S under streaming input data. We theoretically guarantee the consistency and asymptotic optimality of the proposed procedures. We demonstrate the practical efficiency through numerical experiments in comparison with the equal allocation policy and an extension of the optimal computing budget allocation algorithm.
