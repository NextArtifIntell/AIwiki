  abstract     = {Travel virtual communities have reshaped trip planning and experience-sharing amid COVID-19. Postpandemic, information technology in tourism must adjust to changes in traveler behavior, including online booking trends and risk perceptions. Based on the online platform Trivago, the research objectives of this study seek to explore the relationships among electronic service quality, perceived severity of negative publicity, perceived risk, and consumers’ advocacy intention to embrace after the impact of Trivago’s negative publicity. Further, this study aims to explore the moderating effects of electronic service quality and mediating effects of perceived risk. This research collected a total of 468 valid responses and verified the hypothesis by regression analysis and Sobel test. The research results are summarized as follows: the perceived severity of negative publicity negatively affects advocacy intention and positively affects perceived risk, which also negatively affects advocacy intention. These effects are all moderated by e-service quality, which negatively affects perceived risk; perceived risk is the mediator between perceived severity of negative publicity and advocacy intention. The results enrich literature on online hotel websites, offering valuable insights into how managers can effectively use online travel agencies to enhance their online presence and increase revenue.

  abstract     = {Generating sales leads for auto dealers is the core business to auto vertical media platforms (VMPs). However, in recent years, many auto VMPs have started directly selling vehicles to consumers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the primary purpose of auto VMPs’ business-to-consumer (B2C) endeavors is not solely B2C profitability, but rather the acquisition of sales data to calculate the leads-to-sales conversion ratio. This ratio is crucial in determining the pricing strategy for sales leads. To understand this, we consider an asymmetric information game in which the auto dealer possesses information about the leads-to-sales conversion ratio, whereas the VMP does not. We find that, when the VMP solely focuses on profiting from the sales lead business, if the market potential is large, the auto dealer prefers the cost-per-lead scheme, whereas the VMP always tends to the cost-per-sale scheme. However, when the VMP encroaches on the consumer market as a reseller, this divergence in contract-type preference can potentially be resolved. We recognize that VMPs need to conduct a comprehensive assessment of factors such as market potential, fixed cost related to market encroachment, and the correlation between market uncertainty and leads-to-sales conversion ratio when encroachment. Moreover, the encroachment of the VMP has the potential to create a win–win outcome. It is essential to highlight that engaging in B2C business enables the VMP to expand its market sample, thereby enhancing the value of leveraging information technology to optimize the leads-to-sales ratio and achieve superior performance.

  abstract     = {Extensive research has investigated the buffering effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) when firms have poor financial performance. However, few studies have examined the possible consequences of this effect. By analyzing data on listed firms in China from 2010 to 2018, this study investigates the buffering effect of CSR under conditions of earnings pressure, and then discusses its impact on CSR disclosure impression management behavior. The results show that CSR can buffer the negative impact of earnings pressure on stock prices, chief executive officer stability, and top management team stability. This buffering effect is mainly exerted by technical CSR. Moreover, earnings pressure leads to CSR disclosure impression management without resulting in improved CSR performance. These findings have implications for cultivating CSR buffering awareness among firms and managers. The results also have practical implications for future research on the antecedents and motivations of CSR disclosure impression management.

  abstract     = {There are disparities in access to livers based on transplant patients’ height, which disproportionately affects Hispanics, Asians, and women (across all ethnicities), because short patients can receive transplants from a smaller pool of available deceased donors for medical reasons. Reduced likelihood of transplantation leads to higher mortality rates and longer waiting times. We analyze fairness within the current U.S. liver allocation system where patients receive priority dynamically, based on their model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, which reflect the severity of liver disease. We propose a simple adjustment, providing additional (exception) points based on height and MELD score, that can be easily implemented in practice, which materially reduces the disparity without sacrificing overall efficiency. We model the liver allocation system as a multiclass fluid model of overloaded queues with heterogeneous servers. We impose explicit equity constraints for all static patient classes, that is, height. We characterize the optimal solution under the objective of minimizing pretransplant mortality. The discretized version of the optimal policy is numerically solved using estimates from clinical data and a detailed simulation study demonstrates its effectiveness. The optimal policy, called the equity adjusted mortality risk policy, advocates ranking patients based on their short-term mortality risk adjusted for equity among height classes. Interpretation of the shadow prices of equity constraints in the optimal control problem as MELD exception points is novel in the transplant context since they can be seamlessly mapped into the existing system. Our simulations show that for women, the disparity can be almost completely eliminated. Hispanics and Asians greatly benefit from receiving these MELD exception points also. Our work provides a remedy to reduce the disparities in access to liver transplantation within the MELD-based allocation. Our approach can help the on-going analysis of the continuous distribution model for livers because it also considers aspects of candidate biology, notably height and body surface area. Funding: M.
