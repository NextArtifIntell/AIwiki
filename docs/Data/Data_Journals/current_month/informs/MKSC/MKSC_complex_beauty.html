  abstract     = {Marketing interventions usually affect multiple outcomes of interest. However, finding an intervention that improves all desired outcomes is often rare, creating a trade-off for managers and decision makers. In this paper, we develop a multiobjective personalization framework that identifies personalized policies to balance multiple objectives at the individual level. We apply our framework to a canonical example of multiobjective conflict between sponsored and organic content consumption outcomes. Partnering with vdo.ai , we conduct a field experiment and randomly assign users to the skippable/long and nonskippable/short versions of the same ad. We document substantial substitution between sponsored and organic content consumption; the version that increases sponsored consumption reduces organic consumption. We find that multiobjective personalized policies can significantly improve both sponsored and organic consumption outcomes over single-objective policies. We show that compared with a single-objective policy optimized for organic consumption, there exists a multiobjective policy that increases sponsored consumption by 61% at the expense of only a 4% decrease in organic consumption. Similarly, compared with the single-objective policy optimized for sponsored consumption, there is a multiobjective policy that increases organic consumption by 53% while decreasing sponsored consumption by just 15%.

It provides a framework that makes precise how parallel experimentation affects the experiment’s value: while ignoring parallel experimentation yields an estimate of the average effect of advertising in place, which has limited value in decision making in an environment with variable advertising competition, accounting for parallel experimentation captures the actual uncertainty advertisers face due to competitive actions. It then implements an experimental design that enables the estimation of these effects on JD.com, a large e-commerce platform that is also a publisher of digital ads. Using traditional and kernel-based estimators, it shows that not accounting for competitive actions can result in the advertiser inaccurately estimating the advertising lift by a factor of two or higher, which can be consequential for decision making.

  abstract     = {Grocery retailers cannot engage in inventory-based pricing without physically auditing their shelves because their inventory records are inaccurate and incomplete. In particular, inventory data do not reflect actual, real-time quantity on the shelf, and standard Universal Product Code barcodes do not contain expiration dates. We argue that these inventory information frictions are much more powerful in explaining price rigidity in perishable groceries than physical menu costs are. We build our argument in two steps. First, we add inventory shrink, deteriorating product quality, and menu costs to [Gallego G, Van Ryzin G (1994) Optimal dynamic pricing of inventories with stochastic demand over finite horizons. Management Sci. 40(8):999–1020] classic revenue-management model, and we derive the model’s optimal pricing policy when the price setter can and cannot condition on real-time inventory information. Within the model, reducing a representative product’s physical menu cost by 90% increases its price-updating frequency by at least 300% more when pricing managers also have real-time inventory information than when they do not. Second, we provide proof of concept for our theory with data from two industry pilots: a UK grocery store that installed electronic shelf labels (ESLs)—a technology that reduces physical menu costs—and an EU grocery store that installed both ESLs and expanded barcodes—the latter being a technology that reduces inventory information frictions. Consistent with our theory, the technology upgrade increased price-updating frequency by 54% in the first pilot and by 853% in the second pilot. Our theory can explain the lack of widespread dynamic pricing of perishable groceries, which has significant consequences for profits, consumer surplus, and food waste.

  abstract     = {We study an advertiser’s targeting strategy and its effects on consumer data privacy choices, both of which determine the advertiser’s targeting accuracy. Targeted ads, serving as implicit recommendations when consumer preferences are uncertain, not only influence the consumer’s beliefs and purchasing decisions, but also amplify the advertiser’s temptation toward strategic mistargeting: sending ads to poorly matched consumers. Our analysis reveals that advertisers may, paradoxically, choose less precise targeting as accuracy improves. Even if prediction is perfect, the advertiser still targets the wrong consumers, leading to strategic mistargeting. Nevertheless, consumer surplus can remain positive because of improved identification of well-matched consumers, thereby reducing the incentive for consumers to withhold information. However, the scenario shifts with endogenous pricing; better prediction leads to more precise targeting although mistargeting persists. To exploit the recommendation effect of advertising, the advertiser raises prices instead of diluting recommendation power, lowering consumer welfare and prompting consumers to opt out of data collection. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of consumer data opt-out decisions under varying privacy policy defaults (opt in versus opt out). These decisions significantly affect equilibrium outcomes, influencing both the advertiser’s targeting strategies and consumer welfare. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between targeting accuracy, privacy choices, and advertisers’ incentives. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Firms must often decide whether to disclose private information regarding their costs to other market participants. Although extant literature has explored firms’ incentives to disclose exogenous and uncertain costs, little is known about when their endogenous costs should be disclosed. This paper studies the cost-disclosure strategies of competing firms whose inputs are sourced from and endogenously priced by upstream suppliers. We find, first, that cost disclosure affects not only market competition but also the motivations of suppliers in setting their input prices. As such, firms can strategize their disclosure decisions to optimize their procurement costs. Second, we find that firms’ disclosure decisions vary depending on both the nature of the competition and the market structure at hand. That is, when competing firms source from the same supplier or compete on price, they never disclose their costs; in such a case, nondisclosure is strictly better for consumers and welfare compared with disclosure. When competing firms source from different suppliers and compete on quantity, they always disclose; in such a case, disclosure is strictly better for consumers and welfare compared with nondisclosure. We also find that whereas manufacturers’ disclosure incentives are misaligned with those of suppliers, they are largely aligned with the goal of maximizing channel profits. Together, our results underscore the distinct role that endogenous costs play in firms’ disclosure decisions. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought the availability of diagnostic tests to the forefront of public attention and highlighted the prevalence of undertesting (i.e., insufficient test supply relative to demand). Another important yet little studied systematic issue is overdiagnosis (i.e., positive diagnoses for patients with negligible viral loads); evidence suggests that U.S. laboratories have adopted highly sensitive diagnosis criteria such that up to an estimated 90% of positive diagnoses are for minuscule viral loads. Motivated by this situation, we develop a theory of diagnostic testing for infectious diseases that explains both undertesting and overdiagnosis. We show that a commercial laboratory has an incentive to inflate its diagnosis criterion, which generates a higher diagnosis-driven demand as a result of contact-tracing efforts, albeit while dampening demand from disease transmission. An inflated diagnosis criterion prompts the laboratory to build a higher testing capacity, which may not fully absorb the inflated demand, so undertesting arises. Finally, we examine a social planner’s problem of whether to mandate that the laboratory report the viral load along with its diagnosis so that a physician or contact tracer can make informed triage decisions. Our results show that the social planner may choose not to mandate viral-load reporting initially; this choice induces a higher testing capacity and can help reduce disease transmission.

  abstract     = {The role of advertising as an implicit price has long been recognized in economics and marketing, yet the effects of personalizing these implicit prices on firm profits and consumer welfare have not been explored. Using a large-scale field experiment on Pandora, we exogenously changed the ad load—the number of ads played per hour—for more than seven million users over 18 months. We find that the impact of ad load on consumption takes more than a year to stabilize, whereas subscription responses stabilize in less than six months. Using a machine-learning model, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of changing ad load on ad and subscription revenues. We then show that reallocating ads across users can enhance subscription profits by 7% without decreasing overall advertising profits. To achieve the same subscription rate with a uniform ad allocation policy, the firm would need to increase ad load by more than 22%. Our results show that, on average, consumer welfare drops by 2% with the proposed personalization strategy, and the effect seems to be more pronounced for users who have a higher willingness to pay.

Factors such as favorable brand attitudes and switching costs may drive customer loyalty, which is often considered a strong indicator of a firm’s profitability. However, empirical findings on the profitability of customer loyalty are inconsistent, and a comprehensive framework to analyze the connection between customer loyalty and firm profits is still lacking. This paper fills this gap by proposing an analytical framework that characterizes how repeat-purchase loyalty is generated from consumer choice in a dynamic competition environment. It also examines the impact of brand preference and switching costs on firm profits and customer loyalty. Our findings suggest that strong brand preference can either increase or decrease customer loyalty, depending on the stability of consumer preferences over time, and when it increases loyalty, such loyalty is profitable for firms. Conversely, if customer loyalty is primarily driven by habitual buyers who are simply avoiding switching costs, this type of loyalty is not profitable for firms.

  abstract     = {Product safety is jointly determined by product quality and consumers’ precaution efforts when using products. Product failures because of either party’s negligence can cause deaths and injuries. The strict liability rule holds firms fully responsible for damages, whereas the comparative negligence rule allocates responsibilities based on the firm’s negligence in product quality and the consumer’s negligence in precaution efforts. This paper examines how these two common product liability rules affect firms and consumers when firms can advertise product quality deceptively and consumers exert precaution efforts endogenously. Common wisdom suggests that the comparative negligence rule shifts responsibility from firms to consumers, which benefits firms and motivates consumers to exert precautions to improve safety. However, we find that comparative negligence incentivizes firms to use deceptive advertising, whereas strict liability induces firms to advertise low product quality more truthfully. The latter can induce consumers to exert precaution efforts to avoid product failures, thereby improving firm profit and product safety. Moreover, raising firms’ penalties or the amount that firms compensate consumers for product failures can benefit firms but reduce consumer surplus and product safety. These findings caution public policymakers and firms that with asymmetric information about product quality and endogenous precaution efforts, liability policies can lead to unintended consequences.

We then estimate the change in effectiveness of the same campaigns were advertisers to lose the ability to optimize ad delivery with offsite data. In each of these cases, we use recently developed deconvolution techniques to flexibly estimate the underlying distribution of effects. We find a median cost per incremental customer at baseline of $38.16 that under the median loss in effectiveness would rise to $49.93, a 31% increase. Further, we find ads targeted using offsite data generate more long-term customers per dollar than those without, and losing offsite data disproportionately hurts small scale advertisers. Taken together, our results suggest that offsite data bring large benefits to a wide range of advertisers. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {Many ads are engaging, but what makes them engaging may have little to do with the product. This problem can be particularly relevant to influencer advertising if influencers are motivated to promote themselves, not just the product. We develop an algorithm to measure the degree of effective engagement associated with the product and use it to predict the sales lift of influencer video advertising. We propose the concept of the product engagement score (PE score) to capture how engaging the product itself is as presented in a video. We estimate pixel-level engagement as a saliency map by training a deep three-dimensional convolutional neural network on video-level engagement data. We locate pixel-level product placement with an object detection algorithm. The PE score is computed as the pixel-level, engagement-weighted product placement in a video. We construct and validate the algorithm with influencer video ads on TikTok and product sales data on Taobao. We use variation in video posting time to identify video-specific sales lift and show that the PE score significantly and robustly predicts sales lift. We explore drivers of engagement and discuss how various stakeholders in influencer advertising can use the PE score in a scalable way to manage content, align incentives, and improve efficiency.
