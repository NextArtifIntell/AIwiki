  abstract     = {Electric power resources are essential for the efficient and orderly development of society. Accurate power load forecasting is a key driver for the low-carbon upgrade of power systems. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to capture long-term dependencies. Additionally, extracting complex nonlinear features from data remains a significant challenge, making it challenging to meet the accuracy demands of modern power systems. Besides, current deep learning-based forecasting methods cannot simulate multi-granularity power load data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Generative Pre-trained Transformer model, GPT4PLTS, designed for power data simulation and fine-grained power load forecasting. The model leverages the Transformer architecture, incorporating the first six layers of the GPT decoder structure. It utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to extract temporal features and includes a time alignment layer to maintain the sequence of time-series data, addressing both short-term and long-term dependencies. Extensive experiments are conducted on load observations from 2000 enterprises. The results demonstrate that GPT4PLTS achieves high accuracy in data simulation and forecasts across different time granularities, particularly excelling in short and medium-term predictions. Future research could focus on optimizing the model structure to enhance the model’s generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {The attention mechanism has been successfully used in a sequence consisted of a series of word embeddings to improve the representation of the sequence. Inspired by this, we leverage the attention mechanism on a set of tasks to implement a multi-task transfer learning method called AMP (Attentions between Multiple Prompts). First, we encode a task into a prompt as task representation called task embedding. Second, we learn an attention component on all task embeddings to generate a combined prompt for each task, which is an attention-weighted sum of task embeddings. Each combined prompt incorporates the knowledge of all tasks. The word embedding is a vector, but the task embedding is a 2D matrix. The attention mechanism can be exploited on a set of vectors rather than on a set of matrices. The prior methods employ pooling or flattened method to transform the matrix to the vector for computing the attentions between matrices. We propose a method called DAM (Direct Attention Mechanism) which can compute attentions between matrices directly without transforming. DAM method can more exactly compute the attentions between matrices. Wide experiments demonstrate that AMP outperforms prompt-tuning method and prior prompt transfer methods.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the flutter instability observed during lift-type power catwalk operations, a Dual-Loop Error-Driven Adaptive Disturbance Rejection Control (EDDL-ADRC) strategy is proposed. This approach enhances the tracking accuracy and robustness of the electro-hydraulic servo system under variable load and large inertia conditions, effectively alleviating flutter induced by fluctuations in driving speed. Under low-frequency small load conditions, the EDDL-ADRC overcomes the limitations of traditional Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), particularly those related to system order, and demonstrates superior control performance compared to conventional ADRC. The dual-loop error-driven controller consists of two identical second-order ADRC modules. The primary controller operates in a conventional driving mode, while the error-driven controller utilizes both the system’s output error and control input as driving signals. This error-driven controller effectively compensates for phase lag in the main controller and the limited observation accuracy of the Extended State Observer (ESO), thereby improving overall system performance. The proposed control strategy’s effectiveness is validated via a joint simulation platform that integrates both the electro-hydraulic and mechanical systems of the catwalk mechanism.},

To improve accuracy, this paper analyzes the advantages of the respective features of RSS and CSI, use algorithms to extract them, and proposes a novel WiFi fingerprint positioning algorithm for fusion to estimate the target location.

The issue of image blur caused by object motion poses a challenge in obtaining clear images. To address this, an improved AT-DGAN network model is proposed in this paper. This model integrates the pyramid generator module of the DeblurGAN-v2 network with a self-attention mechanism. The feature pyramid is employed for image feature extraction and representation, while the self-attention mechanism dynamically adjusts the weight of important features in each pyramid layer and performs weighted fusion, thereby compensating for the information loss during feature extraction in the feature pyramid network. Additionally, a hinge loss function is designed for the proposed model to balance the discriminator and the generator, enhancing the stability and training efficiency of the generative adversarial network. The experimental results show that compared to other algorithms of the same type, this improved algorithm has increased the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of restored images by 0.58 dB and 1.5%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Accurately and rapidly detecting traffic object has been attracted intensive attention due to its potential applications in the fields of autonomous driving, traffic flow monitoring, augmented reality (AR) and so on. However, there are many difficulties in the process of traffic object detection indeed, such as occlusion and aggregation between objects, insufficient feature extraction of objects, in particular the presence of a large number of small objects, which bring great challenges to these traffic objects detection. In this paper, an improved traffic object detection model based on You-Only-Look-Once version 5 small (YOLOv5s) is proposed to address the issues. By utilizing spatial pyramids to extract multi-scale spatial features and applying Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) channel attention to capture more global and local semantic features, especially by designing a sub-network in the neck to fuse high-resolution information in shallow layers with more accurately semantic information in deep layers, the detection sensitivity of object features is enhanced. More importantly, by explanting decoupled-head into the network, outstanding performance of the model with high detection accuracy and rapid detection speed is realized. The experimental results on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) and Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (LISA) traffic signs datasets both show that the modified model significantly improves the detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the high real-time performance is still maintained. Undoubtedly, the modified model proposed in this paper can effectively address many difficulties in traffic object detection under various complex scenes, which would be greatly helpful for its potential applications in the future.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of cloud services make users pay more attention to Quality of Service (QoS). Generally, the user cannot call all services simultaneously to obtain corresponding QoS data and can only choose a service from a few known data, thus it’s critical to predict unknown QoS values. A third-order tensor can model temporal patterns of QoS data, and studies indicate that the tensor latent factor analysis models based on Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition can effectively capture temporal patterns to predict unknown data in QoS. However, the existing CP decomposition-based models limit their learning ability since rank-one tensors contain less structure information, which results in low prediction accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a Biased Block Term Tensor Decomposition (BBTTD) model to achieve high accuracy for temporal pattern-aware QoS prediction. It mainly adopts the following three-fold ideas: (a) implementing a tensor learning model by adopting the block term decomposition in rank-( L r , L r , 1) terms; (b) proposing the bias block term tensors to enhance the model’s prediction accuracy; (c) designing a nonnegative multiplication update algorithm to learning model parameters. Extensive experiments on two public dynamic QoS datasets demonstrate that BBTTD has higher prediction accuracy compared with several QoS prediction models.},

Because of its potential applications across multiple areas, computer vision faces a significant challenge in recognizing human actions and the accompanying interactions with objects and the environment. Investigating the temporal and geographical characteristics of the skeleton sequence is essential for this endeavor, according to recent studies. However, efficiently extracting discriminative temporal and spatial information remains a difficult task. This work proposes a novel Human Action Recognition Model exploiting improved Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based pose estimation with a Hybrid Classifier (IGCN-HC). The phases carried out in this model are pre-processing, pose estimation, feature extraction, and activity recognition. Initially, the input video will be pre-processed and a frame from the input video stream will be generated. Subsequently, human pose estimation exploiting improved GCN will be accomplished. Further, human skeletal joints’ coordinates in two- or three-dimensional spaces are determined via human pose estimation. Then, Shape Local Binary Texture (SLBT) and an improved hierarchy of skeleton features have been used to detect the variance in different activities. In the last phase, a hybrid classification model with the combination of Deep Maxout and customized CNN has been proposed for the recognition phase. The model utilizes two inputs pose estimation results (skeleton) and the extracted features for training purposes. Finally, the proposed trained model is evaluated for recognition on different test inputs and contrasted with the existing techniques.},

In this study, we improve the DeepInversion algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained model to yield superior quality playback images for class incremental learning. Within the context of class incremental learning, we introduce a cosine orthogonal classification loss function, formulated on the basis of linear layer analysis, to guide image generation and augment class incremental learning. This loss function is designed to ensure the mutual orthogonality of all class centers while minimizing intra-class distances. In the realm of knowledge distillation, we harness a combination of limited real images, a profusion of synthesized images, and Mix virtual images to facilitate feature cosine distance distillation. Sufficient comparative experiments and analyses with similar latest methods underscore the efficacy of our proposed approach, and obtain the SOTA results.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a fault diagnosis method for synchronous traction machine demagnetization based on the Informer model. The method utilizes the Informer model to analyze and model the sensor data of the synchronous traction machine, adaptively learn the feature representation of time series data, and predict the future states in order to accurately identify and predict demagnetization faults. The specific steps include: (1) collecting sensor data of the synchronous traction machine, including parameters such as current, voltage, and rotational speed; (2) preprocessing the data, including denoising, normalization, and feature extraction; (3) constructing the Informer model and training and optimizing it using the preprocessed sensor data; and (4) using the trained model to predict and determine new sensor data, thereby achieving an accurate diagnosis of demagnetization faults. The advantages of this method are as follows: (1) automatic learning and extraction of important features of time series data without the need for manual feature design, improving diagnostic accuracy; (2) ability to handle long sequence data and strong modeling capability for time dependencies, better predicting future states and fault occurrences; and (3) adaptability to the characteristics and data features of different elevator systems and strong generalization capability.},

OTOT consists of two modules: a feature fusion module and a supervision module. The feature fusion module fuses several feature maps from the pose estimation network in a specified order to obtain a fused feature. Then, the supervision module uses the encoder–decoder structure network to implicitly extract useful features from the fused feature and optimizes the pose estimation network online through the back-propagation mechanism. OTOT can be migrated to any network with encoder–decoder structure. The network trained with OTOT achieves 56.11% accuracy in terms of the VSD metric on the TLESS dataset using RGB inputs, compared to the 46.70% accuracy of the original network trained without OTOT. Experiments show that OTOT greatly improves the accuracy of the pose estimation network, and since OTOT is not deployed in the testing stage, it does not increase any parameters during testing and affect the original speed of the network.},

Initially, the shared convolutional layer and the Recurrent Criss-Cross Attention (RCCA) layer are employed to extract features from the input image. Subsequently, the derived feature map is fed into the Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate detection boxes, and the Region of Interest Align (RoI Align) layer selects features corresponding to each Region of Interest (RoI) on the feature map, guided by the RPN’s output. Ultimately, we adopt an alternating training approach. Simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in multi-scene object detection. Our method has demonstrated significant improvements over existing algorithms and has delivered outstanding performance on the BDD-100 K, ApolloScape, and NuScenes datasets.

  abstract     = {In the visible light communication (VLC) system, adaptive symbol decomposition technology is one of the methods to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and suppress LED nonlinear distortion. However, at high symbol variances, there still exists a high PAPR, leading to a higher number of decomposed symbols, which in turn reduces the information rate and increases the bit error rate (BER) performance. Therefore, a combined approach of adaptive modulation, adaptive symbol decomposition serial transmission (ASDST), and space–time block code and orthogonal cyclic matrix transform (STBC-OCT) coding is proposed. The characteristics of PAPR, symbol decomposition and BER under different approaches through Monte Carlo simulation were analyzed. The simulation results show that when using 4-Quadrate Amplitude Modulation (4QAM) modulation and CCDF= 2 × 1 0 − 4 , the STBC-OCT-ASDST scheme gains a 5 dB improvement compared to ASDST alone. At a BER of 3 × 1 0 − 2 , STBC-OCT-ASDST achieves a 10 dBm gain in symbol variance compared to ASDST. Moreover, when the symbol variance of STBC-OCT-ASDST is less than 34 dBm, the BER remains below the 7% threshold of forward error correction (FEC) error rate.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosing brain tumors is particularly difficult because they can grow in unpredictable ways and look very different on MRI scans. The current methods used to automatically identify these tumors often struggle because of the wide variety of tumor types and the complex structure of the brain. As a result, these methods don’t always classify tumors accurately, which can affect patient treatment and outcomes. The main problems with these methods are that they find it hard to distinguish between different types of tumors accurately and to deal with the various ways tumors can appear on MRI scans. To improve this situation, our study integrates the robust image classification capabilities of VGG19 with the sequential data processing strengths of LSTM. This synergistic approach enhances our model’s ability to accurately classify various types of brain tumors from MRI scans, addressing the inherent challenges associated with tumor heterogeneity in medical imaging. VGG19, a deep convolutional neural network, is employed to extract detailed features from MRI scans, facilitating precise tumor characterization based on visual patterns and LSTM complements VGG19 by capturing temporal dependencies in the sequential data of MRI scans, enabling the model to discern subtle variations in tumor appearances over time. By leveraging the combined power of VGG19 and LSTM architectures, our study achieves significant advancements in the accurate classification of brain tumors from MRI images. This approach not only enhances diagnostic precision but also lays the groundwork for future improvements in neuro-oncological imaging diagnostics. Our study includes 1000 patients evaluated with MRI for brain tumors. We achieved an overall accuracy of 98.32% demonstrating the efficacy of our VGG19-LSTM model in accurate tumor classification. By using both, our model aims to get better at understanding MRI scans and, as a result, be more accurate at identifying brain tumors. This combination is a new step forward in making brain tumor diagnosis more precise through a detailed and cooperative approach using neural networks.},

Therefore, we propose an EEG (Electroencephalogram) based model for an accurate emotion classification without the effect of subjectivity. The captured EEG signals are converted into Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gama frequency bands. As emotions change, the frequency bands change and provide unique patterns for each emotion irrespective of different persons. With this observation, the statical features, namely, mean, standard deviation, variance, and kurtosis, and frequency-based features, namely, Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Petrosian Fractal Dimension (PFD) are extracted. To integrate the strength of spatial and frequency-based features, the features are supplied to quadratic discriminative analysis for the final classification. The experiments on the benchmark datasets, DEAP and SEED-IV, achieve 99.40% and 91.97% accuracy, respectively. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods shows that the method performs very well on some datasets.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors develop when abnormal cells grow within or near the brain. Determining the extent of the tumor is crucial for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a non-ionizing radiation tool for diagnosing brain tumors. Segmenting brain tumors manually is a tedious process so the performance depends on the experience of the operator. To overcome the above-mentioned problem, in this research project, brain tumor detection is classified by the proposed Shepard Convolutional Quantum Neural Network (ShCQNN) using MRI images. Initially, pre-processing of the input image is carried out with a Mean filter and the process of segmentation is executed by LinkNet. Here, the proposed Chicken Swarm Stock Exchange Trading Optimization (CSSETO) is used to train LinkNet. This CSSETO is formed from Stock Exchange Trading Optimization (SETO) and Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO). Further, image augmentation includes rotation, random erasing, brightness or contrast adjustment, and shearing. Moreover, the extraction of features is done next to image augmentation, where some important features such as Local Ternary Pattern (LTP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP) are obtained. In the last stage, a brain tumor is detected using ShCQNN which is the amalgamation of Shepard Convolutional Neural Network (ShCNN) along with Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The two benchmark datasets, namely Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2018 (BraTS2018) database and the Figshare dataset are used to assess the performance of the proposed model using performance measures, such as specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity. Also, the performance of the proposed method has been compared with existing models, such as VGG Stacked Classifier Network (VGG-SCNet), Whale Harris Hawks Optimization (WHHO), CNN model, and EfficientNet-B0 and the results revealed that the proposed method provided superior performance than other existing methods. The proposed method obtains the accuracy of 0.925, sensitivity of 0.915, and specificity of 0.915. Regarding the accuracy, the performance improvement of the devised ShCQNN technique is 19.14%, 18.60%, 10.81%, and 2.70% higher than the existing methods VGG-SCNet, WHHO, CNN model, and EfficientNet-B0.},

Effective HAR systems must integrate information from multiple modalities to accurately assist users. This paper introduces the XAttentionHAR model, an innovative cross-modality attention-based ensemble model for HAR. Our approach utilizes a self-attention module to extract features within each modality and an inter-domain cross-attention module to capture and integrate long-term dependencies across domains. The cross-modality attention mechanism enhances the fusion of diverse modalities, enriching the semantic information. We conducted extensive experiments on the WISDM public dataset, which includes accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartwatches and smartphones. Our results demonstrate that XAttentionHAR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in activity recognition, achieving 98.48% accuracy for smartphone-based HAR and 98.73% accuracy for smartwatch-based HAR, paving the way for improved human-centric services.},

  abstract     = {Molds on wall and ceiling surfaces in damp indoor environments especially in houses with poor insulation and ventilation are common in the UK. Since it releases toxic chemicals as it grows, it is a serious health hazard for occupants who live in such houses. For example, eye irritation, sneezing, nose bleeds, respiratory infections, and skin irritations. Furthermore, there are chances of developing serious medical conditions like lung infections and respiratory diseases which may even lead to death. The main challenge here is that due to their irregular patterns, camouflaged with the background, it is not so easy to detect with our naked eyes in the early stage and often confused as stains. Therefore, inspired by the accomplishments of the Yolo architecture for object detection, the Yolov9 model is explored for mold detection by considering mold region as an object in this work. The overall result shows a promising 76% average classification rate. Since the mold does not have a shape, specific pattern, or color, adapting the Yolov9 for accurate mold detection is challenging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind compared to existing methods. Since it is the first work, we constructed a dataset to perform experiments and evaluate the proposed method. To demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness, the results were also compared with the results of the Yolov8 and Yolov10 models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, railway construction has been plagued by frequent safety accidents, with workers’ safety during the construction process remaining a major concern. To mitigate this issue, intelligent monitoring of railway workers’ activity has been proposed as a means of improving the safety coefficient of construction. Human activity recognition (HAR) based on wearable devices holds significant application value in areas such as health monitoring, motion analysis, and intelligent assistance. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained extensive adoption and demonstrated outstanding performance in HAR. However, current HAR research still faces some challenges, including problems with establishing spatial–temporal dependencies and addressing the demand for lightweight models. To address the above issues, we propose a lightweight dual-stream convolution model (LDSC) based on deformable convolution and hierarchical segmentation. The model adaptively captures significant variations in sensor readings over time from portable cards of railway personnel through a temporal stream and learns the interactive information among sensor channels over a spatial stream. LDSC consists of three lightweight convolutional modules that combine deep convolution and point convolution to reduce model parameters, thus meeting the demand for a lightweight model. Experiments and ablation studies are conducted on three available datasets (UCI-HAR, UniMiB-SHAR, and WISDM) to evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of LDSC. In addition, theoretical analysis and ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed LDSC embodies lightweight characteristics.},
