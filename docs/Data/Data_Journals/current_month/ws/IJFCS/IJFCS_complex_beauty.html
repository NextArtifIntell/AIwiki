  abstract     = {The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem aims to find the subsequence exhibiting an increasing trend in a numeric sequence with the maximum length. In this paper, we generalize the LIS problem to the longest wave subsequence (LWS) problem, which encompasses two versions: LWSt and LWSr. Given a numeric sequence A of distinct values and a target trend sequence T , the LWSt problem aims to identify the longest subsequence of A that preserves the trend of the prefix of T . And, the LWSr problem aims to find the longest subsequence of A within r segments, alternating increasing and decreasing subsequences. We propose two efficient algorithms for solving the two versions of the LWS problem. For the LWSt problem, the time complexity of our algorithm is O ( n log n ) , where n represents the length of the given numeric sequence A . Additionally, we propose an O ( r n log n ) -time algorithm for solving the LWSr problem. In both algorithms, we utilize the priority queues for the insertion, deletion, and successor operations.},

  abstract     = {Soft set theory is a mathematical approach to address the challenges of handling vague or uncertain information. It is a more advanced version of classical set theory that deals with imprecise elements and enables the flexible representation of uncertain data. It involves categorizing the elements of the universe based on specific parameters. Semigraph is a generalization of a graph which is different from a hypergraph. A hypergraph extends the concept of a graph by allowing any subset of vertices to form an edge. Semigraphs, on the other hand, distinguish themselves from hypergraphs by imposing a specific order on the vertices within each edge. Soft semigraphs were developed using the principles of soft set theory applied to semigraphs. This study introduces Eulerian and Hamiltonian soft semigraphs. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a soft semigraph to be Eulerian, relying on parameters such as p -part consecutive adjacent degree, p -part end degree, and the p -part consecutive adjacency graph. Additionally, we provide the conditions for a soft semigraph to be Hamiltonian. We introduce the concept of maximal non-Hamiltonian p -part. Finally, we define the closure of a soft semigraph and demonstrate the relationship between a Hamiltonian soft semigraph and its closure.},

  abstract     = {The concept of vulnerability in a communication network plays an important role when there is a disruption in the network. There exist several graph parameters that measure the vulnerability of a communication network. Domination integrity is one of the vulnerability parameters that measure the performance of a communication network. In this paper, we introduce the concept of paired domination integrity of a graph as a new measure of graph vulnerability. Let G = ( V , E ) be a simple, connected graph. A set of vertices in a graph G , say S , is a paired dominating set if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) every vertex of G has a neighbor in S and (ii) the subgraph induced by S contains a perfect matching. The paired domination integrity of G , denoted by P D I ( G ) , is defined as P D I ( G ) = m i n { | S | + m ( G ‚àí S ) : S is¬†a¬†paired¬†dominating¬†set¬†of¬†G } , where m ( G ‚àí S ) is the order of the largest component in the induced subgraph of G ‚àí S . In this paper, we determine few bounds relating paired domination integrity with other graph parameters and the paired domination integrity of some classes of graphs.},

Moreover, for the first case, they gave a necessary condition for an MDS linear code ùíû with minimum distance 2 ‚Ñì + 2 to have an ‚Ñì -error-correcting pair, and for the other two cases, they only gave some counterexamples. For the second case, in this paper, we give a necessary condition for an MDS linear code ùíû with minimum distance 2 ‚Ñì + 2 to have an ‚Ñì -error-correcting pair, and then basing on the Product Singleton Bound, we prove that there are two cases for such pairs, and then give some counterexamples basing on twisted generalized Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes for these cases.},

  abstract     = {The Maximum Independent Set problem is well-studied in graph theory and related areas. An independent set of a graph is a subset of non-adjacent vertices of the graph. A maximum independent set is an independent set of maximum size. This paper studies the Maximum Independent Set problem in some classes of geometric intersection graphs in a distributed setting. More precisely, we study the Maximum Independent Set problem on two geometric intersection graphs, interval and axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, and present deterministic distributed algorithms in a model that is similar but a little weaker than the local communication model. We compute the maximum independent set on interval graphs in O ( k ) rounds and O ( n ) messages, where k is the size of the maximum independent set and n is the number of nodes in the graph. We provide a matching lower bound of Œ© ( k ) on the number of rounds, whereas Œ© ( n ) is a trivial lower bound on message complexity. Thus, our algorithm is both time and message-optimal. We also study the Maximum Independent Set problem in interval count l graphs, a special case of the interval graphs where the intervals have exactly l different lengths. We propose an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that runs in O ( l ) round. For axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, we design an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that obtains a solution in O ( D ) rounds. The results in this paper extend the results of Molla et al. [J.

These parallel cycles can provide an advantage for algorithms that require a ring structure. Additionally, EDHCs can enhance all-to-all data broadcasting and edge fault tolerance in network communications. In this paper, we investigate the construction of EDHCs in the balanced hypercube, which is a variant of the hypercube with many attractive properties, such as strong connectivity, regularity, and symmetry. In particular, each processor in the balanced hypercube has a backup processor that shares the common neighbors, enabling fault tolerance and efficient system reconfiguration. In 2019, L√º et al. provided an algorithm to construct two EDHCs in an n -dimensional balanced hypercube B H n for n ‚â• 2 . We further study this topic and give some construction schemes to construct 2 ‚åä log 2 n ‚åã EDHCs in B H n for n ‚â• 2 . Since B H n is 2 n -regular, our result is optimal for n = 2 r ( r ‚â• 1 ).
