  abstract     = {This article reviews emerging technologies in wireless communication systems, focusing on their key concepts, principles, use cases, and challenges. It examines relevant studies in the telecommunication sector, with a focus on technologies that enhance connectivity, performance, and innovative applications across industries. The review highlights advancements such as fifth-generation (5G) networks, which offer faster data speeds, lower latency, and increased network capacity, enabling the development of applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT devices are increasingly connecting physical objects, driving innovation in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. Edge computing, by enabling real-time processing and reducing latency, supports IoT applications requiring immediate responses. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being integrated to optimize network resources, improve spectrum management, and facilitate intelligent decision-making. Technologies such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) enhance spectral efficiency, network capacity, and interference reduction. Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies are being explored for high-speed wireless communication, enabling multi-gigabit data rates and applications in 5G, wireless backhaul, and ultra-high-definition video streaming. Software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) enable centralized management and greater network flexibility, while beam steering improves signal quality and coverage by directing wireless signals toward specific receivers. Quantum communication, leveraging quantum principles, provides secure communication channels, while quantum key distribution (QKD) ensures data confidentiality. Visible light communication (VLC) utilizes visible light for high-speed data transfer in environments where RF-based communication is not feasible. Despite the potential of these technologies, the article identifies challenges such as limited practical implementation, standardization issues, resource constraints, security and privacy concerns, and sustainability challenges. It concludes by discussing the practical implications of these emerging technologies, including enhanced data transfer speeds, improved network capacity, low-latency communication, IoT connectivity, ubiquitous coverage, industry transformation, and the security and privacy considerations that accompany these advancements.},

The models learn to use other symptoms to detect the presence of various diseases. In model evaluation, cross-validation is done on the training set after data preprocessing is performed to ensure none of the groups is overrepresented in the final model. In both the training and the testing of each model, which were respectively 100%, the model was able to make perfect predictions. A vote of three classifiers reached the 100% precision mark over a test dataset on an ensemble model that combined all the classifiers. This research integrates the advances in AI technology into the healthcare setting in a bid to enhance healthcare delivery. Additionally, we created such a straightforward tool in the case of input symptoms and proposed a possible disease diagnosis.

Human potential has been enhanced by robotics in many ways, most notably in the areas of safety, accuracy, and repeatability. When paired with artificial intelligence (AI), these developments have enormous potential for the healthcare industry in the 21st century. These days, robots help in various places, such as healthcare facilities, assisted living apartments, and rehabilitation centers. For example, Aethon‚Äôs TUG robots carry supplies throughout hospitals effectively and lessen the effort of hospital staff. The main applications of healthcare robotics, including telepresence, rehabilitation, and operating rooms, are outlined in this chapter. Giraff and other telepresence robots allow doctors to observe patients from a distance. Hugo TM RAS system from Medtronic has recently garnered notice because of its availability as a modular minimally invasive surgery solution that directly competes with the Da Vinci System in hospitals across the globe. Taking a focus on surgery rooms, telemedicine, and assistive care, this manuscript offers a broad review of the most recent advancements in healthcare robotics.

However, cybersecurity attacks may interrupt hospital operations and threaten patients‚Äô health and well-being due to this integration. Hence, developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) suited explicitly for healthcare systems is essential to ensure efficiency and accuracy. Nevertheless, it is challenging to integrate anomaly-based IDS frameworks in healthcare systems as they necessitate additional processing time, temporal feature retention, and increased complexity. Therefore, a deep learning system based on SqueezeNet and NasNet is presented in this paper to detect intrusions in a healthcare setting. In this, SqueezeNet is employed to extract more significant features. On the other hand, network breaches while data transmission across distinct locations are detected by the NasNet-based classifier. In addition, the Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA) is applied to adjust the classifier‚Äôs hyperparameters, guaranteeing that it would accurately detect attacks. Moreover, the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) approach is integrated into the proposed framework to avoid data imbalance. Applying different performance constraints, the proposed approach is thoroughly assessed on three publicly available datasets (TON-IoT, ECU-IoHT, and WUSTL-EHMS). The results show that the proposed deep learning-based cybersecurity model outperforms traditional methods and produces better outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely applied in the field of meteorological research, particularly in the downscaling of images due to their ability to generate super-resolution images. In recent years, numerous researchers have combined GANs with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address the issue of meteorological super-resolution. However, these models do not take into account the spatial variations of meteorological sequences. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution method named RN-STLSTM-GAN, which combines GANs with RN-STLSTM and ESA networks to learn the spatiotemporal features of meteorological sequences. Specifically, we first apply the RN-STLSTM at the initialization of the generator and discriminator to learn the spatiotemporal relationships between sequential images. Second, an ESA network is combined with the RN-STLSTM structure to enhance the learning of spatial features. Thirdly, LeakyReLU is used as the activation function for both the generator and discriminator to minimize the loss of image data during model training. Experiments conducted on the NJU-CPOL datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods and can generate realistic and temporally consistent super-resolution sequences for datasets at different heights.},

  abstract     = {Biotechnological analysis of DNA microarray genes provides valuable insights into the discovery and treatment of diseases such as cancer. It may also be crucial for the prevention and treatment of other genetic diseases. However, due to the large number of features and dimensions in a DNA microarray, the ‚Äúcurse of dimensions‚Äù problem is very common. Many machine learning methods require an effective subset of input genes to achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately, extracting features (genes) is an inherently NP-hard problem. Recently, the use of metaheuristics to overcome the NP-hardness of the feature extraction problem has attracted the attention of many researchers. In this paper, we use the combination of fuzzy entropy and Giza Pyramid Construction (GPC) for feature selection. First, redundant features in the microarray dataset are removed using the fuzzy entropy approach. GPC is then used to reduce the execution time. This results in the selection of a near-optimal subset of genes for cancer detection. Dimensionality reduction with GPC followed by classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) creates a synergy to increase efficiency. The proposed method is tested on five well-known cancer patient datasets: leukemia, lymphoma, MLL, ovarian, and SRBCT. The performance of CNN was also measured with four well-known classifiers, including K-nearest neighbor, na√Øve Bayesian, decision tree, and logistic regression. Our results show that, on average, CNN has the highest accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure in all datasets.},

However, existing research encounters challenges including low estimation accuracy, a deficiency of frequency domain features, and difficulty in integrating time domain and frequency domain features. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework called the Dual-Stream Fusion Network (DSFN). This framework combines the Time Domain Encoding (TDE) module, the Frequency Domain Hierarchical-Split Encoding (FDHSE) module, and a Two-Stage Feature Fusion (TSF) module. Specifically, the temporal stream of the framework employs the TDE module to capture deep temporal features that reflect the complex dynamic variations in time-series data. The frequency domain stream introduces the FDHSE module, which extracts frequency domain features using a multi-level, multi-scale approach, ensuring a comprehensive and diverse representation of frequency information. Through this dual-stream architecture, our model effectively learns both time and frequency domain features, addressing the limitations of frequency domain features observed in prior studies. Additionally, we propose the TSF module to fully integrate time and frequency domain features, effectively overcoming the challenge of fusing these two types of features. We conducted experiments on two public datasets, namely the GOTOV dataset (elderly people) and the JSI dataset (young people). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance across different age groups. Compared to the baseline models, the proposed DSFN significantly improves the accuracy of human energy expenditure estimation.},

First, construct a feature map based on the relationship between tourists‚Äô preferences and tourist attractions, and incorporate the attention mechanism to enhance the model‚Äôs learning capabilities. Second, utilize a two-part graph model to extract positive and negative preference features of tourists, and a conversation graph model to extract tourists‚Äô transfer preference features. Finally, various features are utilized to generate suggested content by computing scores for tourists‚Äô travel preferences. To address the problem of recommending tourist groups, suitable features for random group matching are collected and the cosine function is employed to identify users with similar random group features. Finally, the multi-features are merged, and the tourists‚Äô interest preferences are scored to arrive at content recommendations. In the experiment on individualized attraction recommendations, data from the Chengdu area were used to test the proposed model. The accuracy of the model‚Äôs recommendations was 0.822 for five recommendations which outperformed the other models. In the experiment for group-based attraction recommendations, this experiment tested the Chengdu dataset. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.972 when the group size was 70, outperforming the other two models. Additionally, with regards to different numbers of recommendations, the proposed model‚Äôs accuracy was 0.5241, which was the best performance among the three models when the number of recommendations was set to five. The proposed recommendation model performs optimally in suggesting tourist attractions and meets the needs of rural tourism. The research content provides crucial technical references for tourist traveling and rural tourism development.},

  abstract     = {Music composition, an intricate blend of human creativity and emotion, presents substantial challenges when generating melodies from lyrics which hinders effective learning in neural networks and the inadequate depiction of harmonic structure that fails to encapsulate the complex relationships between lyrics and melodies. The existing methods often struggle to balance emotional depth and structural coherence, leading to compositions that lack both the intended emotional resonance and musical consistency. To overcome these issues, this research introduces a novel approach named Dual Interactive Wasserstein Fourier Acquisitive Generative Adversarial Network (DIWFA-GAN), which integrates innovative techniques like swish activation functions and the Giant Trevally Optimizer (GTO) for parameter optimization. Meanwhile, the GTO, inspired by the movement patterns of the Giant Trevally fish, provides efficient and effective parameter optimization, improving the model‚Äôs convergence speed and accuracy. Comparative analysis against recent existing models reveals superior performance for both the LMD-full MIDI and Reddit MIDI datasets, with impressive metrics including inception scores of 9.36 and 2.98, Fr√©chet inception distances of 35.29 and 135.54 and accuracies of 99.98% and 99.95%, respectively. The DIWFA-GAN significantly outperforms existing models in generating high-fidelity melodies, as evidenced by superior inception scores, Fr√©chet inception distances, and accuracies on both datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a bi-population competition adaptive interior search algorithm (BCAISA) based on a reinforcement learning strategy is proposed for the classical flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) to optimize the makespan. First, the scheduling solution is represented using a machine-job-based two-segment integer encoding method, and various heuristic rules are then applied to generate the initial population. Secondly, a bi-population mechanism is introduced to partition the population into two distinct sub-populations. These sub-populations are specifically tailored for machine assignment and operation permutation, employing different search strategies respectively, aiming to facilitate an efficient implementation of parallel search. A competition mechanism is introduced to facilitate the information exchange between the two sub-populations. Thirdly, the ISA is adapted for the discrete scheduling problem by discretizing a series of search operators, which include composition optimization, mirror search, and random walk. A Q-learning-based approach is proposed to dynamically adjust a key parameter, aiming to strike a balance between the capacity for global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted based on 10 well-known benchmark instances of the FJSP.¬†The design of the experiment (DOE) method is employed to determine the algorithm‚Äôs parameters. Based on the computational results, the effectiveness of four improvement strategies is first validated. The BCAISA is then compared with fifteen published algorithms. The comparative data demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other algorithms in 50% of benchmark instances. Additionally, according to the relative percentage deviation (RPD) from the state-of-the-art results, the BCAISA also exhibits superior performance. This highlights the effectiveness of our algorithm for solving the classical FJSP.¬†To enhance the practical application, the scope of the ISA will be broadened in future work to more complex problems in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In pattern mining, high-utility itemset mining (HUIM) is useful for discovering high-utility patterns. The study of HUIM using heuristic techniques reflects issues in producing better offspring. It is ineffective in terms of search space organization, population diversity, and utility calculation, which impact runtime and accuracy. It is observed that very few researchers have experimented with genetic algorithm (GA) and are still facing the same issues as mentioned before. To overcome these problems, a novel approach is proposed for HUIM using modified GA and optimized local search (HUIM-MGALS) with six potential contributions. First is linking the utility with the Bitmap dataset to reduce utility access time, leading to effective search space organization. Second, HUIM-MGALS employs a fitness scaling strategy to avoid redundancy. Third, a high-utility itemset (HUI) revision strategy is employed to explore significant HUIs. Modified population diversity maintenance strategy and iterative crossover help to preserve significant HUIs and improve search capability as fourth and fifth contributions. Sixth, the use of multiple mutations refines the wasted individuals to boost accuracy. Extensive experimentation showed that HUIM-MGALS significantly outperforms the presented algorithms, up to 8.6 times faster. It also demonstrates superior HUI discovery capabilities for both sparse and dense datasets. This is supported by the modified population diversity maintenance strategy, which is proved to be the most impactful modification for HUI discovery in HUIM-MGALS.},

The results showed that the detection accuracy of the multi-task cascaded convolutional network using the improved non-maximum suppression algorithm was 98.7%, which was higher than the traditional multi-task cascaded convolutional network and effectively improved the detection performance of the multi-task cascaded convolutional network. The face detection model based on the improved multi-task cascaded convolutional network had the shortest average detection time of 361 s, the highest average detection accuracy of 90.3%, an accuracy of 99%, a recall rate of 98.5%, and an F 1 value of 99%. While maintaining high detection efficiency, it also ensured the accuracy of detection. The average accuracy of the mask detection method based on the MobileNet V2 network was relatively high, at 98.96%. The facial recognition model based on FaceNet achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.15% for faces without masks and 92.04% for faces with masks, with the highest accuracy and recall rates of 99.3% and 99.6%.

However, when faced with some small samples, the performance of the algorithm is often degraded due to over-fitting. Combined with specially designed data enhancement methods, a generated adversarial network optimization algorithm based on adaptive data augmentation (AdauGAN) is proposed. The adaptive data augmentation module is added before the discriminant network, and a spatial transformation is carried out simultaneously at the probability distribution level of generated data and real data. To alleviate the over-fitting phenomenon in the training process, the current enhancement intensity is adjusted adaptively after the over-fitting occurs. The proposed algorithm is verified on SVHN, CelebA and CIFAR-10 data sets. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of AdauGAN achieve 22.10, 23.94, 34.87, respectively, which is close to or even higher than the training results of Deep Convolution Generated Adversarial Network (DCGAN) under all data. Extensive experiment results show that the proposed Adaugan has an excellent performance in small samples.

And, the LWSr problem aims to find the longest subsequence of A within r segments, alternating increasing and decreasing subsequences. We propose two efficient algorithms for solving the two versions of the LWS problem. For the LWSt problem, the time complexity of our algorithm is O ( n log n ) , where n represents the length of the given numeric sequence A . Additionally, we propose an O ( r n log n ) -time algorithm for solving the LWSr problem. In both algorithms, we utilize the priority queues for the insertion, deletion, and successor operations.},

  abstract     = {Soft set theory is a mathematical approach to address the challenges of handling vague or uncertain information. It is a more advanced version of classical set theory that deals with imprecise elements and enables the flexible representation of uncertain data. It involves categorizing the elements of the universe based on specific parameters. Semigraph is a generalization of a graph which is different from a hypergraph. A hypergraph extends the concept of a graph by allowing any subset of vertices to form an edge. Semigraphs, on the other hand, distinguish themselves from hypergraphs by imposing a specific order on the vertices within each edge. Soft semigraphs were developed using the principles of soft set theory applied to semigraphs. This study introduces Eulerian and Hamiltonian soft semigraphs. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a soft semigraph to be Eulerian, relying on parameters such as p -part consecutive adjacent degree, p -part end degree, and the p -part consecutive adjacency graph. Additionally, we provide the conditions for a soft semigraph to be Hamiltonian. We introduce the concept of maximal non-Hamiltonian p -part. Finally, we define the closure of a soft semigraph and demonstrate the relationship between a Hamiltonian soft semigraph and its closure.},

  abstract     = {The Maximum Independent Set problem is well-studied in graph theory and related areas. An independent set of a graph is a subset of non-adjacent vertices of the graph. A maximum independent set is an independent set of maximum size. This paper studies the Maximum Independent Set problem in some classes of geometric intersection graphs in a distributed setting. More precisely, we study the Maximum Independent Set problem on two geometric intersection graphs, interval and axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, and present deterministic distributed algorithms in a model that is similar but a little weaker than the local communication model. We compute the maximum independent set on interval graphs in O ( k ) rounds and O ( n ) messages, where k is the size of the maximum independent set and n is the number of nodes in the graph. We provide a matching lower bound of Œ© ( k ) on the number of rounds, whereas Œ© ( n ) is a trivial lower bound on message complexity. Thus, our algorithm is both time and message-optimal. We also study the Maximum Independent Set problem in interval count l graphs, a special case of the interval graphs where the intervals have exactly l different lengths. We propose an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that runs in O ( l ) round. For axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, we design an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that obtains a solution in O ( D ) rounds. The results in this paper extend the results of Molla et al. [J. Parallel Distrib. Comput. 2019].},

In this paper, we investigate the construction of EDHCs in the balanced hypercube, which is a variant of the hypercube with many attractive properties, such as strong connectivity, regularity, and symmetry. In particular, each processor in the balanced hypercube has a backup processor that shares the common neighbors, enabling fault tolerance and efficient system reconfiguration.

Supervised learning systems are trained on large datasets to predict outcomes for new test cases.

Here, we introduce a novel method to identify regions in the feature space that diverge from training data, where an AI model may perform poorly. We utilize a compact precompiled structure that allows for fast and direct access to confidence scores in real time at the point of use without requiring access to the training data or model algorithms. As a result, users can determine when to trust the AI model‚Äôs outputs, while developers can identify where the model‚Äôs applicability is limited. We validate our approach using simulated data and several biomedical case studies, demonstrating that our approach provides fast confidence estimates ( &lt; 0 . 2 milliseconds per case), with high concordance to previously developed methods ( f - score &gt; 0 . 9 6 5 ). These estimates can be easily added to real-world AI applications. We argue that providing confidence estimates should be a standard practice for all AI applications in public use.},

  abstract     = {Space and time are fundamental attributes of the external world. Deciphering the brain mechanisms involved in processing the surrounding environment is one of the main challenges in neuroscience. This is particularly defiant when situations change rapidly over time because of the intertwining of spatial and temporal information. However, understanding the cognitive processes that allow coping with dynamic environments is critical, as the nervous system evolved in them due to the pressure for survival. Recent experiments have revealed a new cognitive mechanism called time compaction. According to it, a dynamic situation is represented internally by a static map of the future interactions between the perceived elements (including the subject itself). The salience of predicted interactions (e.g. collisions) over other spatiotemporal and dynamic attributes during the processing of time-changing situations has been shown in humans, rats, and bats. Motivated by this ubiquity, we study an artificial neural network to explore its minimal conditions necessary to represent a dynamic stimulus through the future interactions present in it. We show that, under general and simple conditions, the neural activity linked to the predicted interactions emerges to encode the perceived dynamic stimulus. Our results show that this encoding improves learning, memorization and decision making when dealing with stimuli with impending interactions compared to no-interaction stimuli. These findings are in agreement with theoretical and experimental results that have supported time compaction as a novel and ubiquitous cognitive process.},

  abstract     = {Since vision transformers excel at establishing global relationships between features, they play an important role in current vision tasks. However, the global attention mechanism restricts the capture of local features, making convolutional assistance necessary. This paper indicates that transformer-based models can attend to local information without using convolutional blocks, similar to convolutional kernels, by employing a special initialization method. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid multi-scale model called Frequency-Assisted Local Attention Transformer (FALAT). FALAT introduces a Frequency-Assisted Window-based Positional Self-Attention (FWPSA) module that limits the attention distance of query tokens, enabling the capture of local contents in the early stage. The information from value tokens in the frequency domain enhances information diversity during self-attention computation. Additionally, the traditional convolutional method is replaced with a depth-wise separable convolution to downsample in the spatial reduction attention module for long-distance contents in the later stages. Experimental results demonstrate that FALAT-S achieves 83.0% accuracy on IN-1k with an input size of 2 2 4 √ó 2 2 4 using 29.9 M parameters and 5.6 G FLOPs. This model outperforms the Next-ViT-S by 0.9 AP b /0.8 AP m with Mask-R-CNN 1 √ó on COCO and surpasses the recent FastViT-SA36 by 3.1% mIoU with FPN on ADE20k.},

To address this issue, a novel method for myoelectric recognition of finger movement patterns is proposed by incorporating a neural decoding approach with unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) learning. In our method, the neural decoding approach is implemented by extracting microscopic features characterizing individual motor unit (MU) activities obtained from a two-stage online surface electromyogram (SEMG) decomposition. A specific deep learning model is designed and initially trained using labeled data from a set of existing users. The model can update adaptively when recognizing the movement patterns of a new user. The final movement pattern was determined by a fuzzy weighted decision strategy. SEMG signals were collected from the finger extensor muscles of 15 subjects to detect seven dexterous finger-movement patterns. The proposed method achieved a movement pattern recognition accuracy of ( 9 3 . 9 4 ¬± 1 . 5 4 )% over seven movements under cross-user testing scenarios, much higher than that of the conventional methods using global SEMG features.

Additionally, neural architecture search (NAS) for GANs with one-shot models often leads to insufficient subnet training, where subnets inherit weights from a supernet without proper optimization, further degrading performance. To address both issues, we propose Architecture Knowledge Distillation for Evolutionary GAN (AKD-EGAN). AKD-EGAN operates in two stages. First, architecture knowledge distillation (AKD) is used during supernet training to efficiently optimize subnetworks and accelerate learning. Second, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) searches for optimal subnet architectures, ensuring efficiency by considering multiple performance metrics. This approach, combined with a strategy for architecture inheritance, enhances GAN stability and image quality. Experiments show that AKD-EGAN surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.91 and an Inception Score (IS) of 8.97 on CIFAR-10, along with competitive results on STL-10 (FID: 20.32, IS: 10.06).

Since ASD is regarded as a neurodevelopmental disorder, brain signals specially electroencephalography (EEG) are an effective method for detecting ASD. Therefore, this research aims at developing a method of extracting features from EEG signal for discriminating between ASD and control subjects. This study applies six prominent connectivity features, namely Cross Correlation (XCOR), Phase Locking Value (PLV), Pearson‚Äôs Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Mutual Information (MI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Transfer Entropy (TE), for feature extraction. The Connectivity Feature Maps (CFMs) are constructed and used for classification through Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). As CFMs contain spatial information, they are able to distinguish ASD and control subjects better than other features. Rigorous experimentation has been performed on the EEG datasets collected from Italy and Saudi Arabia according to different criteria. MI feature shows the best result for categorizing ASD and control participants with increased sample size and segmentation.},

However, the attention mechanism built on visual features treats label embeddings equally in the prediction score, leading to severe semantic ambiguity. This study focuses on efficiently utilizing semantic information in the attention mechanism. We propose a contrastive label-based attention method (CLA) to associate each label with the most relevant image regions. Specifically, our label-based attention, guided by the latent label embedding, captures discriminative image details. To distinguish region-wise correlations, we implement a region-level contrastive loss. In addition, we utilize a global feature alignment module to identify labels with general information. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, NUS-WIDE and Open Images, demonstrate that our CLA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Especially under the ZSL setting, our method achieves 2.0% improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) for NUS-WIDE and 4.0% for Open Images compared with recent methods.},

Although significant progress has been made in semantic decoding across individual visual cortices, studies on the semantic decoding of the ventral and dorsal cortical visual pathways remain limited. This study proposed a graph neural network (GNN)-based semantic decoding model on a natural scene dataset (NSD) to investigate the decoding differences between the dorsal and ventral pathways in process various parts of speech, including verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Our results indicate that the decoding accuracies for verbs and nouns with motion attributes were significantly higher for the dorsal pathway as compared to those for the ventral pathway. Comparative analyses reveal that the dorsal pathway significantly outperformed the ventral pathway in terms of decoding performance for verbs and nouns with motion attributes, with evidence showing that this superiority largely stemmed from higher-level visual cortices rather than lower-level ones. Furthermore, these two pathways appear to converge in their heightened sensitivity toward semantic content related to actions. These findings reveal unique visual neural mechanisms through which the dorsal and ventral cortical pathways segregate and converge when processing stimuli with different semantic categories.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used physiological signal to obtain information of brain activity, and its automatic detection holds significant research importance, which saves doctors‚Äô time, improves detection efficiency and accuracy. However, current automatic detection studies face several challenges: large EEG data volumes require substantial time and space for data reading and model training; EEG‚Äôs long-term dependencies test the temporal feature extraction capabilities of models; and the dynamic changes in brain activity and the non-Euclidean spatial structure between electrodes complicate the acquisition of spatial information. The proposed method uses range-EEG (rEEG) to extract time-frequency features from EEG to reduce data volume and resource consumption. Additionally, the next-generation state-space model Mamba is utilized as a temporal feature extractor to effectively capture the temporal information in EEG data. To address the limitations of state space models (SSMs) in spatial feature extraction, Mamba is combined with Dynamic Graph Neural Networks, creating an efficient model called DG-Mamba for EEG event detection. Testing on seizure detection and sleep stage classification tasks showed that the proposed method improved training speed by 10 times and reduced memory usage to less than one-seventh of the original data while maintaining superior performance. On the TUSZ dataset, DG-Mamba achieved an AUROC of 0.931 for seizure detection and in the sleep stage classification task, the proposed model surpassed all baselines.},

  abstract     = {In the last few decades, Artificial Neural Networks have become more and more important, evolving into a powerful tool to implement learning algorithms. Spiking neural networks represent the third generation of Artificial Neural Networks; they have earned growing significance due to their remarkable achievements in pattern recognition, finding extensive utility across diverse domains such as e.g. diagnostic medicine. Usually, Spiking Neural Networks are slightly less accurate than other Artificial Neural Networks, but they require a reduced amount of energy to perform calculations; this amount of energy further reduces in a very significant manner if they are implemented on hardware specifically designed for them, like neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we focus on exploring the versatility of Spiking Neural Networks and their potential applications across a range of scenarios by exploiting their adaptability and dynamic processing capabilities, which make them suitable for various tasks. A first rough network is designed based on the dataset‚Äôs general attributes; the network is then refined through an extensive grid search algorithm to identify the optimal values for hyperparameters. This dual-step process ensures that the Spiking Neural Network can be tailored to diverse and potentially very different situations in a direct and intuitive manner. We test this by considering three different scenarios: epileptic seizure detection, both considering binary and multi-classification tasks, as well as wine classification. The proposed methodology turned out to be highly effective in binary class scenarios: the Spiking Neural Networks models achieved significantly lower energy consumption compared to Artificial Neural Networks while approaching nearly 100% accuracy. In the case of multi-class classification, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90%, thus indicating that it can still be further improved.},

  abstract     = {Despite several automated strategies for identification/segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) being developed, they consistently fall short when compared to the performance of human experts. This emphasizes the unique skills and expertise of human professionals in dealing with the uncertainty resulting from the vagueness and variability of MS, the lack of specificity of MRI concerning MS, and the inherent instabilities of MRI. Physicians manage this uncertainty in part by relying on their radiological, clinical, and anatomical experience. We have developed an automated framework for identifying and segmenting MS lesions in MRI scans by introducing a novel approach to replicating human diagnosis, a significant advancement in the field. This framework has the potential to revolutionize the way MS lesions are identified and segmented, being based on three main concepts: (1) Modeling the uncertainty; (2) Use of separately trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) optimized for detecting lesions, also considering their context in the brain, and to ensure spatial continuity; (3) Implementing an ensemble classifier to combine information from these CNNs. The proposed framework has been trained, validated, and tested on a single MRI modality, the FLuid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) of the MSSEG benchmark public data set containing annotated data from seven expert radiologists and one ground truth. The comparison with the ground truth and each of the seven human raters demonstrates that it operates similarly to human raters. At the same time, the proposed model demonstrates more stability, effectiveness and robustness to biases than any other state-of-the-art model though using just the FLAIR modality.},

  abstract     = {Cloud cover experiences rapid fluctuations, significantly impacting the irradiance reaching the ground and causing frequent variations in photovoltaic power output. Accurate detection of thin and fragmented clouds is crucial for reliable photovoltaic power generation forecasting. In this paper, we introduce a novel cloud detection method, termed Adaptive Laplacian Coordination Enhanced Cross-Feature U-Net (ALCU-Net). This method augments the traditional U-Net architecture with three innovative components: an Adaptive Feature Coordination (AFC) module, an Adaptive Laplacian Cross-Feature U-Net with a Multi-Grained Laplacian-Enhanced (MLE) feature module, and a Criss-Cross Feature Fused Detection (CCFE) module. The AFC module enhances spatial coherence and bridges semantic gaps across multi-channel images. The Adaptive Laplacian Cross-Feature U-Net integrates features from adjacent hierarchical levels, using the MLE module to refine cloud characteristics and edge details over time. The CCFE module, embedded in the U-Net decoder, leverages criss-cross features to improve detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations show that ALCU-Net consistently outperforms existing cloud detection methods, demonstrating superior accuracy in identifying both thick and thin clouds and in mapping fragmented cloud patches across various environments, including oceans, polar regions, and complex ocean-land mixtures.},

Our proposed model addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative flow of information in the training procedure and integrating it as a new discriminator into the framework, thereby optimizing the training dynamics. Furthermore, it employs a supplementary distribution in the input space to steer reconstructions toward the normal data distribution. This adjustment distinctly isolates anomalous instances and enhances detection precision. Also, two unique anomaly scoring mechanisms were developed to augment detection capabilities.

  abstract     = {Seizures have a serious impact on the physical function and daily life of epileptic patients. The automated detection of seizures can assist clinicians in taking preventive measures for patients during the diagnosis process. The combination of deep learning (DL) model with convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer network can effectively extract both local and global features, resulting in improved seizure detection performance. In this study, an enhanced transformer network named Inresformer is proposed for seizure detection, which is combined with Inception and Residual network extracting different scale features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals to enrich the feature representation. In addition, the improved transformer network replaces the existing Feedforward layers with two half-step Feedforward layers to enhance the nonlinear representation of the model. The proposed architecture utilizes discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the original EEG signals, and the three sub-bands are selected for signal reconstruction. Then, the Co-MixUp method is adopted to solve the problem of data imbalance, and the processed signals are sent to the Inresformer network for seizure information capture and recognition. Finally, discriminant fusion is performed on the results of three-scale EEG sub-signals to achieve final seizure recognition. The proposed network achieves the best accuracy of 100% on Bonn dataset and the average accuracy of 98.03%, sensitivity of 95.65%, and specificity of 98.57% on the long-term CHB-MIT dataset. Compared to the existing DL networks, the proposed method holds significant potential for clinical research and diagnosis applications with competitive performance.},

This module enables the association of individual profiles with their EEGs, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. The efficacy of the model was rigorously evaluated using four publicly available datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in all conducted benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Interictal epileptiform spikes (spikes) and epileptogenic focus are strongly correlated. However, partial spikes are insensitive to epileptogenic focus, which restricts epilepsy neurosurgery. Therefore, identifying spike subtypes that are strongly associated with epileptogenic focus (traceable spikes) could facilitate their use as reliable signal sources for accurately tracing epileptogenic focus. However, the sparse firing phenomenon in the transmission of intracranial neuronal discharges leads to differences within spikes that cannot be observed visually. Therefore, neuro-electro-physiologists are unable to identify traceable spikes that could accurately locate epileptogenic focus. Herein, we propose a novel sparse spike feature learning method to recognize traceable spikes and extract discrimination information related to epileptogenic focus. First, a multilevel eigensystem feature representation was determined based on a multilevel feature representation module to express the intrinsic properties of a spike. Second, the sparse feature learning module expressed the sparse spike multi-domain context feature representation to extract sparse spike feature representations. Among them, a sparse spike encoding strategy was implemented to effectively simulate the sparse firing phenomenon for the accurate encoding of the activity of intracranial neurosources. The sensitivity of the proposed method was 97.1%, demonstrating its effectiveness and significant efficiency relative to other state-of-the-art methods.},

Current diagnostic approaches, including genetic screening, face challenges in identifying secondary cases due to symptom overlap with other disorders. This study introduces a novel PKD recognition method utilizing a resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) functional connectivity matrix and a deep learning architecture (AT-1CBL). Resting-state EEG data from 44 PKD patients and 44 healthy controls (HCs) were collected using a 128-channel EEG system. Functional connectivity matrices were computed and transformed into graph data to examine brain network property differences between PKD patients and controls through graph theory. Source localization was conducted to explore neural circuit differences in patients. The AT-1CBL model, integrating 1D-CNN and Bi-LSTM with attentional mechanisms, achieved a classification accuracy of 93.77% on phase lag index (PLI) features in the Theta band. Graph theoretic analysis revealed significant phase synchronization impairments in the Theta band of the functional brain network in PKD patients, particularly in the distribution of weak connections compared to HCs. Source localization analyses indicated greater differences in functional connectivity in sensorimotor regions and the frontal-limbic system in PKD patients, suggesting abnormalities in motor integration related to clinical symptoms. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models based on EEG functional connectivity for accurate and cost-effective PKD diagnosis, supporting the development of portable EEG devices for clinical monitoring and diagnosis. However, the limited dataset size may affect generalizability, and further exploration of multimodal data integration and advanced deep learning architectures is necessary to enhance the robustness of PKD diagnostic models.},

We found that continuous eye position could be decoded with high accuracy using spiking data from only a few dozen cortical neurons. We tested eight decoders and found that neural network models yielded the highest decoding accuracy. Simpler models performed well above chance with a substantial reduction in training time. We measured the impact of data quantity (e.g. number of neurons) and data format (e.g. bin width) on training time, inference time, and generalizability. Training models with more input data improved performance, as expected, but the format of the behavioral output was critical for emphasizing or omitting specific oculomotor events. Our results provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of continuously decoded eye movements across a large field of view.

However, analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from stroke patients poses challenges. To address the issues of low accuracy and efficiency in EEG classification, particularly involving MI, the study proposes a residual graph convolutional network (M-ResGCN) framework based on the modified S -transform (MST), and introduces the self-attention mechanism into residual graph convolutional network (ResGCN). This study uses MST to extract EEG time-frequency domain features, derives spatial EEG features by calculating the absolute Pearson correlation coefficient (aPcc) between channels, and devises a method to construct the adjacency matrix of the brain network using aPcc to measure the strength of the connection between channels. Experimental results involving 16 stroke patients and 16 healthy subjects demonstrate significant improvements in classification quality and robustness across tests and subjects. The highest classification accuracy reached 94.91% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8918. The average accuracy and F 1 scores from 10 times 10-fold cross-validation are 94.38% and 94.36%, respectively. By validating the feasibility and applicability of brain networks constructed using the aPcc in EEG signal analysis and feature encoding, it was established that the aPcc effectively reflects overall brain activity. The proposed method presents a novel approach to exploring channel relationships in MI-EEG and improving classification performance. It holds promise for real-time applications in MI-based BCI systems.},

Recently, State-Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, have gained significant attention as a promising alternative due to their linear computational complexity. Another approach, neural memory Ordinary Differential Equations (nmODEs), exhibits similar principles and achieves good results. In this paper, we explore the respective strengths and weaknesses of nmODEs and SSMs and propose a novel architecture, the nmSSM decoder, which combines the advantages of both approaches. This architecture possesses powerful nonlinear representation capabilities while retaining the ability to preserve input and process global information. We construct nmSSM-UNet using the nmSSM decoder and conduct comprehensive experiments on the PH2, ISIC2018, and BU-COCO datasets to validate its effectiveness in medical image segmentation. The results demonstrate the promising application value of nmSSM-UNet. Additionally, we conducted ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed improvements on SSMs and nmODEs.},

  abstract     = {Conventional retinal implants involve complex surgical procedures and require invasive implantation. Temporal Interference Stimulation (TIS) has achieved noninvasive and focused stimulation of deep brain regions by delivering high-frequency currents with small frequency differences on multiple electrodes. In this study, we conducted in silico investigations to evaluate extraocular TIS‚Äôs potential as a novel visual restoration approach. Different from the previously published retinal TIS model, the new model of extraocular TIS incorporated a biophysically detailed retinal ganglion cell (RGC) population, enabling a more accurate simulation of retinal outputs under electrical stimulation. Using this improved model, we made the following major discoveries: (1) the maximum value of TIS envelope electric potential ( EP max ) showed a strong correlation with TIS-induced RGC activation; (2) the preferred stimulating/return electrode (SE/RE) locations to achieve focalized TIS were predicted; (3) the performance of extraocular TIS was better than same-frequency sinusoidal stimulation (SSS) in terms of lower RGC threshold and more focused RGC activation; (4) the optimal stimulation parameters to achieve lower threshold and focused activation were identified; and (5) spatial selectivity of TIS could be improved by integrating current steering strategy and reducing electrode size. This study provides insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of a low-invasive stimulation approach in enhancing vision restoration.},

  abstract     = {Electric power resources are essential for the efficient and orderly development of society. Accurate power load forecasting is a key driver for the low-carbon upgrade of power systems. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to capture long-term dependencies. Additionally, extracting complex nonlinear features from data remains a significant challenge, making it challenging to meet the accuracy demands of modern power systems. Besides, current deep learning-based forecasting methods cannot simulate multi-granularity power load data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Generative Pre-trained Transformer model, GPT4PLTS, designed for power data simulation and fine-grained power load forecasting. The model leverages the Transformer architecture, incorporating the first six layers of the GPT decoder structure. It utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to extract temporal features and includes a time alignment layer to maintain the sequence of time-series data, addressing both short-term and long-term dependencies. Extensive experiments are conducted on load observations from 2000 enterprises. The results demonstrate that GPT4PLTS achieves high accuracy in data simulation and forecasts across different time granularities, particularly excelling in short and medium-term predictions. Future research could focus on optimizing the model structure to enhance the model‚Äôs generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {The attention mechanism has been successfully used in a sequence consisted of a series of word embeddings to improve the representation of the sequence. Inspired by this, we leverage the attention mechanism on a set of tasks to implement a multi-task transfer learning method called AMP (Attentions between Multiple Prompts). First, we encode a task into a prompt as task representation called task embedding. Second, we learn an attention component on all task embeddings to generate a combined prompt for each task, which is an attention-weighted sum of task embeddings. Each combined prompt incorporates the knowledge of all tasks. The word embedding is a vector, but the task embedding is a 2D matrix. The attention mechanism can be exploited on a set of vectors rather than on a set of matrices. The prior methods employ pooling or flattened method to transform the matrix to the vector for computing the attentions between matrices. We propose a method called DAM (Direct Attention Mechanism) which can compute attentions between matrices directly without transforming. DAM method can more exactly compute the attentions between matrices. Wide experiments demonstrate that AMP outperforms prompt-tuning method and prior prompt transfer methods.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the flutter instability observed during lift-type power catwalk operations, a Dual-Loop Error-Driven Adaptive Disturbance Rejection Control (EDDL-ADRC) strategy is proposed. This approach enhances the tracking accuracy and robustness of the electro-hydraulic servo system under variable load and large inertia conditions, effectively alleviating flutter induced by fluctuations in driving speed. Under low-frequency small load conditions, the EDDL-ADRC overcomes the limitations of traditional Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), particularly those related to system order, and demonstrates superior control performance compared to conventional ADRC. The dual-loop error-driven controller consists of two identical second-order ADRC modules. The primary controller operates in a conventional driving mode, while the error-driven controller utilizes both the system‚Äôs output error and control input as driving signals. This error-driven controller effectively compensates for phase lag in the main controller and the limited observation accuracy of the Extended State Observer (ESO), thereby improving overall system performance. The proposed control strategy‚Äôs effectiveness is validated via a joint simulation platform that integrates both the electro-hydraulic and mechanical systems of the catwalk mechanism.},

This model integrates the pyramid generator module of the DeblurGAN-v2 network with a self-attention mechanism. The feature pyramid is employed for image feature extraction and representation, while the self-attention mechanism dynamically adjusts the weight of important features in each pyramid layer and performs weighted fusion, thereby compensating for the information loss during feature extraction in the feature pyramid network. Additionally, a hinge loss function is designed for the proposed model to balance the discriminator and the generator, enhancing the stability and training efficiency of the generative adversarial network. The experimental results show that compared to other algorithms of the same type, this improved algorithm has increased the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of restored images by 0.58 dB and 1.5%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Accurately and rapidly detecting traffic object has been attracted intensive attention due to its potential applications in the fields of autonomous driving, traffic flow monitoring, augmented reality (AR) and so on. However, there are many difficulties in the process of traffic object detection indeed, such as occlusion and aggregation between objects, insufficient feature extraction of objects, in particular the presence of a large number of small objects, which bring great challenges to these traffic objects detection. In this paper, an improved traffic object detection model based on You-Only-Look-Once version 5 small (YOLOv5s) is proposed to address the issues. By utilizing spatial pyramids to extract multi-scale spatial features and applying Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) channel attention to capture more global and local semantic features, especially by designing a sub-network in the neck to fuse high-resolution information in shallow layers with more accurately semantic information in deep layers, the detection sensitivity of object features is enhanced. More importantly, by explanting decoupled-head into the network, outstanding performance of the model with high detection accuracy and rapid detection speed is realized. The experimental results on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) and Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (LISA) traffic signs datasets both show that the modified model significantly improves the detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the high real-time performance is still maintained. Undoubtedly, the modified model proposed in this paper can effectively address many difficulties in traffic object detection under various complex scenes, which would be greatly helpful for its potential applications in the future.},

Generally, the user cannot call all services simultaneously to obtain corresponding QoS data and can only choose a service from a few known data, thus it‚Äôs critical to predict unknown QoS values. A third-order tensor can model temporal patterns of QoS data, and studies indicate that the tensor latent factor analysis models based on Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition can effectively capture temporal patterns to predict unknown data in QoS. However, the existing CP decomposition-based models limit their learning ability since rank-one tensors contain less structure information, which results in low prediction accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a Biased Block Term Tensor Decomposition (BBTTD) model to achieve high accuracy for temporal pattern-aware QoS prediction. It mainly adopts the following three-fold ideas: (a) implementing a tensor learning model by adopting the block term decomposition in rank-( L r , L r , 1) terms; (b) proposing the bias block term tensors to enhance the model‚Äôs prediction accuracy; (c) designing a nonnegative multiplication update algorithm to learning model parameters. Extensive experiments on two public dynamic QoS datasets demonstrate that BBTTD has higher prediction accuracy compared with several QoS prediction models.},

Because of its potential applications across multiple areas, computer vision faces a significant challenge in recognizing human actions and the accompanying interactions with objects and the environment. Investigating the temporal and geographical characteristics of the skeleton sequence is essential for this endeavor, according to recent studies. However, efficiently extracting discriminative temporal and spatial information remains a difficult task. This work proposes a novel Human Action Recognition Model exploiting improved Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based pose estimation with a Hybrid Classifier (IGCN-HC). The phases carried out in this model are pre-processing, pose estimation, feature extraction, and activity recognition. Initially, the input video will be pre-processed and a frame from the input video stream will be generated. Subsequently, human pose estimation exploiting improved GCN will be accomplished. Further, human skeletal joints‚Äô coordinates in two- or three-dimensional spaces are determined via human pose estimation. Then, Shape Local Binary Texture (SLBT) and an improved hierarchy of skeleton features have been used to detect the variance in different activities. In the last phase, a hybrid classification model with the combination of Deep Maxout and customized CNN has been proposed for the recognition phase. The model utilizes two inputs pose estimation results (skeleton) and the extracted features for training purposes. Finally, the proposed trained model is evaluated for recognition on different test inputs and contrasted with the existing techniques.},

Therefore, this paper presents a design scheme based on lithology characteristics deep learning and artificial intelligence analysis of bit failure mode and characteristics of large section gravel layer in fore-salt.

  abstract     = {Image classification has surpassed human performance in numerous domains. However, in real-world scenarios, challenges such as storage constraints, privacy concerns, and commercial data protection necessitate the enhancement of existing models to accommodate new class classifications ‚Äî a critical area of research known as class incremental learning. Data replay stands out as a pivotal technique within this domain. The DeepInversion algorithm ingeniously employs classification networks to generate training set images of notable quality. In this study, we improve the DeepInversion algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained model to yield superior quality playback images for class incremental learning. Within the context of class incremental learning, we introduce a cosine orthogonal classification loss function, formulated on the basis of linear layer analysis, to guide image generation and augment class incremental learning. This loss function is designed to ensure the mutual orthogonality of all class centers while minimizing intra-class distances. In the realm of knowledge distillation, we harness a combination of limited real images, a profusion of synthesized images, and Mix virtual images to facilitate feature cosine distance distillation. Sufficient comparative experiments and analyses with similar latest methods underscore the efficacy of our proposed approach, and obtain the SOTA results.

The method utilizes the Informer model to analyze and model the sensor data of the synchronous traction machine, adaptively learn the feature representation of time series data, and predict the future states in order to accurately identify and predict demagnetization faults. The specific steps include: (1) collecting sensor data of the synchronous traction machine, including parameters such as current, voltage, and rotational speed; (2) preprocessing the data, including denoising, normalization, and feature extraction; (3) constructing the Informer model and training and optimizing it using the preprocessed sensor data; and (4) using the trained model to predict and determine new sensor data, thereby achieving an accurate diagnosis of demagnetization faults. The advantages of this method are as follows: (1) automatic learning and extraction of important features of time series data without the need for manual feature design, improving diagnostic accuracy; (2) ability to handle long sequence data and strong modeling capability for time dependencies, better predicting future states and fault occurrences; and (3) adaptability to the characteristics and data features of different elevator systems and strong generalization capability.},

OTOT consists of two modules: a feature fusion module and a supervision module. The feature fusion module fuses several feature maps from the pose estimation network in a specified order to obtain a fused feature. Then, the supervision module uses the encoder‚Äìdecoder structure network to implicitly extract useful features from the fused feature and optimizes the pose estimation network online through the back-propagation mechanism. OTOT can be migrated to any network with encoder‚Äìdecoder structure. The network trained with OTOT achieves 56.11% accuracy in terms of the VSD metric on the TLESS dataset using RGB inputs, compared to the 46.70% accuracy of the original network trained without OTOT. Experiments show that OTOT greatly improves the accuracy of the pose estimation network, and since OTOT is not deployed in the testing stage, it does not increase any parameters during testing and affect the original speed of the network.},

Ultimately, we adopt an alternating training approach. Simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in multi-scene object detection.

  abstract     = {In the visible light communication (VLC) system, adaptive symbol decomposition technology is one of the methods to reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and suppress LED nonlinear distortion. However, at high symbol variances, there still exists a high PAPR, leading to a higher number of decomposed symbols, which in turn reduces the information rate and increases the bit error rate (BER) performance. Therefore, a combined approach of adaptive modulation, adaptive symbol decomposition serial transmission (ASDST), and space‚Äìtime block code and orthogonal cyclic matrix transform (STBC-OCT) coding is proposed. The characteristics of PAPR, symbol decomposition and BER under different approaches through Monte Carlo simulation were analyzed. The simulation results show that when using 4-Quadrate Amplitude Modulation (4QAM) modulation and CCDF= 2 √ó 1 0 ‚àí 4 , the STBC-OCT-ASDST scheme gains a 5 dB improvement compared to ASDST alone. At a BER of 3 √ó 1 0 ‚àí 2 , STBC-OCT-ASDST achieves a 10 dBm gain in symbol variance compared to ASDST. Moreover, when the symbol variance of STBC-OCT-ASDST is less than 34 dBm, the BER remains below the 7% threshold of forward error correction (FEC) error rate.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosing brain tumors is particularly difficult because they can grow in unpredictable ways and look very different on MRI scans. The current methods used to automatically identify these tumors often struggle because of the wide variety of tumor types and the complex structure of the brain. As a result, these methods don‚Äôt always classify tumors accurately, which can affect patient treatment and outcomes. The main problems with these methods are that they find it hard to distinguish between different types of tumors accurately and to deal with the various ways tumors can appear on MRI scans. To improve this situation, our study integrates the robust image classification capabilities of VGG19 with the sequential data processing strengths of LSTM. This synergistic approach enhances our model‚Äôs ability to accurately classify various types of brain tumors from MRI scans, addressing the inherent challenges associated with tumor heterogeneity in medical imaging. VGG19, a deep convolutional neural network, is employed to extract detailed features from MRI scans, facilitating precise tumor characterization based on visual patterns and LSTM complements VGG19 by capturing temporal dependencies in the sequential data of MRI scans, enabling the model to discern subtle variations in tumor appearances over time. By leveraging the combined power of VGG19 and LSTM architectures, our study achieves significant advancements in the accurate classification of brain tumors from MRI images. This approach not only enhances diagnostic precision but also lays the groundwork for future improvements in neuro-oncological imaging diagnostics. Our study includes 1000 patients evaluated with MRI for brain tumors. We achieved an overall accuracy of 98.32% demonstrating the efficacy of our VGG19-LSTM model in accurate tumor classification. By using both, our model aims to get better at understanding MRI scans and, as a result, be more accurate at identifying brain tumors. This combination is a new step forward in making brain tumor diagnosis more precise through a detailed and cooperative approach using neural networks.},

Therefore, we propose an EEG (Electroencephalogram) based model for an accurate emotion classification without the effect of subjectivity. The captured EEG signals are converted into Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gama frequency bands. As emotions change, the frequency bands change and provide unique patterns for each emotion irrespective of different persons. With this observation, the statical features, namely, mean, standard deviation, variance, and kurtosis, and frequency-based features, namely, Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Petrosian Fractal Dimension (PFD) are extracted. To integrate the strength of spatial and frequency-based features, the features are supplied to quadratic discriminative analysis for the final classification. The experiments on the benchmark datasets, DEAP and SEED-IV, achieve 99.40% and 91.97% accuracy, respectively. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods shows that the method performs very well on some datasets.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors develop when abnormal cells grow within or near the brain. Determining the extent of the tumor is crucial for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a non-ionizing radiation tool for diagnosing brain tumors. Segmenting brain tumors manually is a tedious process so the performance depends on the experience of the operator. To overcome the above-mentioned problem, in this research project, brain tumor detection is classified by the proposed Shepard Convolutional Quantum Neural Network (ShCQNN) using MRI images. Initially, pre-processing of the input image is carried out with a Mean filter and the process of segmentation is executed by LinkNet. Here, the proposed Chicken Swarm Stock Exchange Trading Optimization (CSSETO) is used to train LinkNet. This CSSETO is formed from Stock Exchange Trading Optimization (SETO) and Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO). Further, image augmentation includes rotation, random erasing, brightness or contrast adjustment, and shearing. Moreover, the extraction of features is done next to image augmentation, where some important features such as Local Ternary Pattern (LTP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP) are obtained. In the last stage, a brain tumor is detected using ShCQNN which is the amalgamation of Shepard Convolutional Neural Network (ShCNN) along with Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The two benchmark datasets, namely Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2018 (BraTS2018) database and the Figshare dataset are used to assess the performance of the proposed model using performance measures, such as specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity. Also, the performance of the proposed method has been compared with existing models, such as VGG Stacked Classifier Network (VGG-SCNet), Whale Harris Hawks Optimization (WHHO), CNN model, and EfficientNet-B0 and the results revealed that the proposed method provided superior performance than other existing methods. The proposed method obtains the accuracy of 0.925, sensitivity of 0.915, and specificity of 0.915. Regarding the accuracy, the performance improvement of the devised ShCQNN technique is 19.14%, 18.60%, 10.81%, and 2.70% higher than the existing methods VGG-SCNet, WHHO, CNN model, and EfficientNet-B0.},

It uses Twitter account information, which includes shared images, profile pictures, banners, text in the images, and descriptions of the images. Motivated by the accomplishments of the transformer, for encoding visual features of the images, a new InfoGain Multi-Axial Wavelet Vision Transformer (IgMaWaViT) is explored here.

Furthermore, the model fuses encodings of images and text according to the questions on different personality traits for question answering. The model is called InfoGain Multi-Axial Wavelet Vision Transformer for Personality Traits Question Answering (IgMaWaViT-PQA).

The cross-modality attention mechanism enhances the fusion of diverse modalities, enriching the semantic information. We conducted extensive experiments on the WISDM public dataset, which includes accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartwatches and smartphones. Our results demonstrate that XAttentionHAR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in activity recognition, achieving 98.48% accuracy for smartphone-based HAR and 98.73% accuracy for smartwatch-based HAR, paving the way for improved human-centric services.},

  abstract     = {Molds on wall and ceiling surfaces in damp indoor environments especially in houses with poor insulation and ventilation are common in the UK. Since it releases toxic chemicals as it grows, it is a serious health hazard for occupants who live in such houses. For example, eye irritation, sneezing, nose bleeds, respiratory infections, and skin irritations. Furthermore, there are chances of developing serious medical conditions like lung infections and respiratory diseases which may even lead to death. The main challenge here is that due to their irregular patterns, camouflaged with the background, it is not so easy to detect with our naked eyes in the early stage and often confused as stains. Therefore, inspired by the accomplishments of the Yolo architecture for object detection, the Yolov9 model is explored for mold detection by considering mold region as an object in this work. The overall result shows a promising 76% average classification rate. Since the mold does not have a shape, specific pattern, or color, adapting the Yolov9 for accurate mold detection is challenging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind compared to existing methods. Since it is the first work, we constructed a dataset to perform experiments and evaluate the proposed method. To demonstrate the proposed method‚Äôs effectiveness, the results were also compared with the results of the Yolov8 and Yolov10 models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, railway construction has been plagued by frequent safety accidents, with workers‚Äô safety during the construction process remaining a major concern. To mitigate this issue, intelligent monitoring of railway workers‚Äô activity has been proposed as a means of improving the safety coefficient of construction. Human activity recognition (HAR) based on wearable devices holds significant application value in areas such as health monitoring, motion analysis, and intelligent assistance. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained extensive adoption and demonstrated outstanding performance in HAR. However, current HAR research still faces some challenges, including problems with establishing spatial‚Äìtemporal dependencies and addressing the demand for lightweight models. To address the above issues, we propose a lightweight dual-stream convolution model (LDSC) based on deformable convolution and hierarchical segmentation. The model adaptively captures significant variations in sensor readings over time from portable cards of railway personnel through a temporal stream and learns the interactive information among sensor channels over a spatial stream. LDSC consists of three lightweight convolutional modules that combine deep convolution and point convolution to reduce model parameters, thus meeting the demand for a lightweight model. Experiments and ablation studies are conducted on three available datasets (UCI-HAR, UniMiB-SHAR, and WISDM) to evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of LDSC. In addition, theoretical analysis and ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed LDSC embodies lightweight characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Change impact analysis (CIA) is an essential method in software maintenance and evolution. Its accuracy and usability play a crucial role in its application. However, most CIAs are coarse-grained and limited to class and method levels. Despite the fine-grained CIAs‚Äô success in giving the statement-level impact set, they are still limited without the sub-statement level dependency analysis, leading to low precision. Additionally, their unstructured impact sets make it challenging for users to comprehend the impact content. This paper proposes Hierarchical Change Impact Analysis (HCIA), a Hierarchical CIA technique based on the sub-statement level dependence graph. HCIA can perform a forward hierarchy program slicing on the change set from five levels: sub-statement, statement, method, class, and package. Based on the program slices, HCIA calculates the impact factor of the impact sets at the five levels to generate the final impact set. In the experiment, we evaluate the relationship between the impact factor and the actual affected codes and assess the most appropriate size of HCIA impact sets. Furthermore, we evaluate HCIA on 10 open-source projects by comparing our approach with popular CIAs at the five levels. The experimental result shows that HCIA is more accurate than the popular CIAs.},

  abstract     = {The paper addresses the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics for Question Answering (QA) systems that primarily focus on syntax and n-gram similarity. We propose a novel model-based evaluation metric, MQA-metric, and create a human-judgment-based dataset, squad-qametric and marco-qametric, to validate our approach. The research aims to solve several key problems: the objectivity in dataset labeling, the effectiveness of metrics when there is no syntax similarity, the impact of answer length on metric performance, and the influence of real answer quality on metric results. To tackle these challenges, we designed an interface for dataset labeling and conducted extensive experiments with human reviewers. Our analysis shows that the MQA-metric outperforms traditional metrics like BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR. Unlike existing metrics, MQA-metric leverages semantic comprehension through large language models (LLMs), enabling it to capture contextual nuances and synonymous expressions more effectively. This approach sets a standard for evaluating QA systems by prioritizing semantic accuracy over surface-level similarities. The proposed metric correlates better with human judgment, making it a more reliable tool for evaluating QA systems. Our contributions include the development of a robust evaluation workflow, creation of high-quality datasets, and an extensive comparison with existing evaluation methods. The results indicate that our model-based approach provides a significant improvement in assessing the quality of QA systems, which is crucial for their practical application and trustworthiness.},

When we study knowledge and apply them to understand and solve problems, the credibility of knowledge is becoming our main concerns. Usually, high credible domain knowledge can guide us correctly understand all concepts and the relationships between them in this domain. Due to its good layer structure and scalability, domain knowledge network is widely used to represent knowledge in knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and others in recent years. How to ensure the credibility of domain knowledge network? This is an important and interesting topic. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the knowledge credibility for domain knowledge network, which means that we can start from the layer structure of domain knowledge network, and evaluate the credibility of knowledge layer by layer using validated expert knowledge such as domain dictionary, domain ontology and domain expert experience. We conduct experiments with six domain knowledge network constructed based on network data and six domain knowledge network constructed manually based on published books or domain dictionaries, which describe the same domain knowledge in pairs. Experimental results show that the knowledge credibility of domain knowledge network constructed from validated expert knowledge is significantly higher than the knowledge credibility of domain knowledge network constructed directly from network data, which satisfy our expectation and also prove the effectiveness of our credibility evaluation method.},

Detecting traces in the event logs that do not comply with access control policies, such as role-based access control (RBAC) policies, is essential to ensuring system security. Moreover, process mining has been extensively utilized for security analysis in recent years. However, pattern-based approaches for designing and analyzing RBAC policies in the context of business processes through process mining are notably absent. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for checking the conformance of RBAC implemented in the event logs of business processes with the RBAC policies specified in domain knowledge. To facilitate the representation of the RBAC policies derived from the domain knowledge, we employ an RBAC domain-specific language (DSL) combined with our RBAC-driven object constraint language (OCL) invariant patterns built from the various types of RBAC constraints. The implemented RBAC in an event log is represented as snapshots within our framework. Then, we validate the snapshots with the RBAC policies to be able to detect RBAC conformance issues. The proposed framework is experimented with and evaluated on two business process logs, one simulated log and one real-world event log named ‚ÄúBPI Challenge 2017‚Äù.},

Existing studies demonstrated that developers frequently face recurrent bugs and adopt similar fix measures, known as code change patterns. As an essential static analysis technique, code pattern mining supports various tasks, including code refactoring, automated program repair, and defect prediction, thus significantly improving software development processes. A prevalent approach to identifying code patterns involves translating code changes to edit actions into a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. However, when applied to open-source projects, this method exhibits several limitations. For instance, it overlooks function call information and disregards feature word order. This study introduces MIFA, a novel technique for mining code change patterns using multiple feature analysis. MIFA extends existing BoW methods by incorporating analysis of function calls and overall changes in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure. We selected 20 popular Python projects and evaluated MIFA in both intra-project and cross-project scenarios. The experimental results indicate that: (1) MIFA achieved higher silhouette coefficients and F1 scores compared to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a superior accuracy; (2) MIFA can assist developers in detecting unique change patterns more earlier, with an efficiency improvement of over 40% compared to random sampling. Additionally, we discussed critical parameters for measuring the similarity of code changes, guiding users to apply our method effectively.},

To address this issue, we design a novel type of code context, i.e. schema context, that combines features of code text, syntax and structure. Regarding the requirements of class-level granularity, we focus on behavior and attribute in code syntax, and use element position and structural metrics to mine the hidden relationships. Based on schema context and an existing inference mode, we propose SchemaRec to recommend ORM-related class for the database executors once one of them has been changed. We conduct experiments with 110 open-source projects, and the results show that SchemaRec obtains more accurate results than Lucene, DeepCS, QobCS and SEA in terms of Top-1, Top-10 and MRR accuracy due to the better ability of context representation. We also find that code syntax is the most important information because it involves behavior and attribute information of ORM-related classes.},

Then, the comprehensive weight allocation method is established to characterize the importance degree of each interface defect type by combining the G1 and CRITIC methods. Subsequently, the attributes of the interface are evaluated by defect value analysis, and the trustworthiness measurement model of the interface is proposed based on these attributes. Furthermore, to evaluate the trustworthiness of the whole system, the trustworthiness measure models under different combination structure of components are established. Finally, the model‚Äôs‚Äô applicability is demonstrated through an illustrative example.

  abstract     = {Programming education is becoming increasingly popular in universities. However, due to a lack of debugging experience, novices often encounter numerous difficulties in the programming process. Automatic fault localization techniques have emerged as a promising solution to address this issue. Among these techniques, Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) have been widely used in industrial programs. However, there is a significant difference between industrial and novice programs and the performance of these methods on novice programs has not been extensively studied. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the fault localization performance and execution overhead of SBFL and MBFL in a typical novice programming environment. Our study specifically examined how different program characteristics, including code coverage and mutation score, affect the accuracy of these localization methods. Additionally, during the study, we identified the tie problem in both methods and further investigated its impact on fault localization techniques in novice programs. To remove the impact of the tie problem, we proposed using PageRank scores as weights for the suspiciousness, sorting, and locating faults based on the weighted suspiciousness. The PageRank algorithm is based on statement coverage information and constructs a directed graph. From the directed graph, a transition matrix generates the weight scores (PageRank scores) for each statement. Our research demonstrates that both SBFL and MBFL are effective for fault localization in novice programs, with MBFL showing significantly better performance in our tests. In TOP- N ( N = 1 , 3 , 5 ) , MBFL accurately locates 67, 96 and 114 faults, respectively, indicating superior performance. Additionally, calculating weighted suspiciousness significantly alleviates the tie problem.},

The motivation stems from the growing demand for innovative educational techniques that can effectively engage and empower learners in mastering Software Engineering principles. The proposed approach involves presenting students with modeling exercises solved by ChatGPT, prompting them to critically evaluate and provide constructive feedback on the generated solutions. By engaging students in a dialogue with the AI model, we aim to foster a dynamic learning environment where learners can articulate their considerations and insights, thereby enhancing their comprehension of software engineering principles, critical thinking and self evaluation skills. Preliminary results from pilot implementations indicate promising outcomes, suggesting that this approach not only enhances the quality of peer feedback but also contributes to a more interactive and engaging educational experience.},

However, classic SVR is feeble if data are imprecise or low-quality. Hence, the uncertainty theory emerged as the times require, which can process the imprecise observations well. In this study, a novel SVR model be introduced into uncertainty theory, termed v -SVR with imprecise observations, designed to handle imprecise or low-quality data. Unlike the conventional Œµ -SVR with imprecise observations approach, v -SVR offers an automated computation of the accuracy parameter Œµ , thereby eliminating the need for manual selection. This results in improved performance with simplified parameter tuning. The effectiveness of the approach in this paper be demonstrated through a numerical example.},

In this paper, we propose a graph-based generalization of Semi-Supervised Dimensionality Reduction (SSDR) algorithm that uses stochastic distances (Kullback-Leibler, Bhattacharyya and Cauchy-Schwarz divergences) to compute the similarity between local multivariate Gaussian distributions along the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) graph build from the samples in the input high-dimensional space. In summary, there are two variants of the proposed method: one which uses only a fraction of the labeled samples (10%) and another that also uses a clustering method (Gaussian Mixture Models) to estimate the labels of the minimum spanning tree of the KNN graph, incorporating more information into the process. Experimental results with several real datasets show that the proposed method is able to improve the classification accuracy of several supervised classifiers and also the quality of the obtained clusters (Silhouette Coefficients) in comparison to the regular SSDR algorithm, making it a viable alternative for pattern classification problems.},

  abstract     = {Humans‚Äô learning involves remembering patterns of the past to better understand recurring concepts as their knowledge grows. However, a key issue that arises from these cases is that previous knowledge in deep neural networks could be gradually forgotten when they are trained for a new concept. We address this problem by learning a general representation that can remember the previous information and promote future learning. In this pursuit, a new controller is introduced by the meta-learning strategy that guides the network to keep the balance between the previously learned concepts and the new concept, hence it avoids catastrophic forgetting. Compared to previous online incremental learning for evolving data streams, our approach is dedicated to handling recurring concepts. When encountering recurring concepts, the model can remember and recall the previous knowledge and can quickly adapt to this change. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Alternating Meta-learning approach for recurring concepts (BLAML), which emphasizes the hidden representation learning of different concepts in model-level learning, and obtains a set of shared parameters through the global meta-learning strategy. Through extensive experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an efficient regression algorithm based on primal formulation of twin support vector machine. This is an efficient approach to solve the optimization problem leading to reduced computation time. The proposed method is termed as twin parametric insensitive support vector regression (UPTPISVR). The optimization problems of the proposed (UPTPISVR) are a pair of unconstrained convex minimization problems. Moreover, the objective functions of UPTPISVR are strongly convex, differentiable and piecewise quadratic. Therefore, an approximate solution is obtained in primal variables instead of solving the dual formulation. Further, an absolute value equation problem is solved by using a functional iterative algorithm for UPTPISVR, termed as FUPTPISVR. The objective function of the proposed formulation involves the plus function which is non-smooth and therefore, smooth approximation functions are used to replace the plus function, termed as SUPTPISVR. The Newton-Armijo algorithm is then used to iteratively obtain the solutions, thus eliminates the requirement of any optimization toolbox. Various numerical experiments on synthetic and benchmark real-world datasets are presented for justifying the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed UPTPISVR. The results clearly indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing algorithms in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) on most datasets.},

We implement ICE on synthetic and real-world datasets.

To address this, an effective data augmentation approach is proposed by combining dynamic synthetic minority oversampling with a multimodal elicitation conditional generative adversarial network for emotion recognition using audio, text, and visual data. The balanced data is then fed into a granular elastic-net regression with a hybrid feature selection method based on dandelion fick‚Äôs law optimization to analyze sentiments. The selected features are input into a multilabel wavelet convolutional neural network to classify emotion states accurately. The proposed approach, implemented in python, outperforms existing methods in terms of trustworthiness (0.695), arousal (0.723), and valence (0.6245) on the car review dataset. Additionally, the feature selection method achieves high accuracy (99.65%), recall (99.45%), and precision (99.66%).

To speed up the processing and reply to a question, a columnar database‚Äôs job is to efficiently write and read data to and from hard disc storage. One of the most crucial methods in the creation of column-oriented database systems is compression. For columns with Zero-length string types, all heavier and light-in-weight compression techniques have limitations. Processing of transactions online,¬†these databases are substantially more effective for online analytical processing than for online transactional processing. This indicates that although they are made to examine transactions, they are not very effective at updating them. To overcome these issues a Zero Length Recurrent based Fruit Fly Optimization (ZLRFF) model is used. Additionally, a reduction technique is known as ZLRFF was designed to achieve a high compression ratio and allow straight lookups on compressed material without decompression first. ZLRFF‚Äôs main goal is to divide a Zero-length string written column vertically into smaller columns that can each be compressed using a separate lightweight compression technique. To search directly on compressed data, we also provide a search technique we call FF-search. Extensive testing demonstrates that ZLRFF supports direct searching on compressed data in addition to achieving a decent compression ratio, which enhances query performance.},

However, challenges such as data quality, storage, scarcity of data science professionals, data validation, and sourcing from diverse origins persist. Notably, while schema databases excel at reviewing transactions, they often fall short in updating them effectively. To address these issues, a Chimp-based radial basis neural model (CbRBNM) is employed. Initially, the Schemaless database was considered and integrated into the Python system. Subsequently, compression functions were applied to both schema and schema-less databases to optimize relational data size by eliminating redundant files. Performance validation involved calculating compression parameters, with the proposed method achieving memory usage of 383.37 Mb, a computation time of 0.455 s, a training time of 167.5 ms, and a compression rate of 5.60%. Extensive testing demonstrates that CbRBNM yields a favorable compression ratio and enables direct searching on compressed data, thereby enhancing query performance.},
