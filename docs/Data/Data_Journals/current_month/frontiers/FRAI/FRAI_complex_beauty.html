  abstract     = {The digital era is characterized by rapid technological advancements, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerging as a key driver of business transformation. Companies are increasingly integrating AI-enabled technologies into their operations to enhance productivity, streamline processes, and optimize decision-making [2]. For instance, one of the special issue papers examined the integration of artificial intelligence in supply chain management (SCM) [4]. One of the key insights highlighted by this paper is that &amp;quot;integrating AI in SCM not only improves operational efficiency and sustainability but also promotes resilience against disruptions&amp;quot; [4]. From intelligent automation to predictive analytics, AI is reshaping industries by enabling organizations to leverage vast amounts of data for actionable insights. For instance, another special issue paper discussed the use of AI for the analysis of vast amount of data for generating and reporting software defects [5]. This study reported several benefits such as rea-time analysis and operational efficiency which helped identifying and reducing the failure and errors in a timely manner. While AI-enabled automation offers several benefits, however, its inner working needs to be explained for enhancing stakeholders&amp;#39; trust. This topic was covered in this special issue by another accepted paper discussing the &amp;quot;stakeholder-centric explanations for black-box decisions: an XAI process model and its application to automotive goodwill assessments&amp;quot; [6]. Finally, the fourth paper in this special issue provided a methodology for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of skills intelligence management in the context of informed decisionmaking and adaptability [7]. Additionally, this editorial expands on these papers and draws our attention to one of the most significant advancements in AI which is the emergence of generative AI models, such as GPT and discusses its potential to revolutionize business process management (BPM) [1]. By automating repetitive tasks, generating contextual insights, and facilitating seamless human-machine collaboration, AI-driven technologies are setting the foundation for intelligent business ecosystems. The remainder of this editorial further expands the topic of AI-enabled business process management followed by a discussion of key considerations. It concludes with a future outlook on the role of AI in continuous innovation.Business Process Management (BPM) is central to enterprise efficiency, governing how organizations design, analyze, and optimize workflows. Traditional BPM approaches relied on human expertise and structured methodologies. However, the integration of AI has ushered in a new era of smart BPM, where AI models automate process discovery, enhance workflow optimization, and provide intelligent recommendations.For instance, ProcessGPT [1], an AI-driven BPM framework, leverages generative AI to streamline business processes. By analyzing historical data and learning from domainspecific knowledge, such technologies can generate process flows, identify inefficiencies, and recommend optimization strategies. The implications are profound: AI-powered BPM reduces operational costs, enhances agility, and enables organizations to adapt to evolving market conditions.AI&amp;#39;s transformative impact extends to data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes, where decision-making is crucial. AI models can analyze vast datasets, detect patterns, and generate actionable insights, thereby augmenting human expertise. In domains such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management, AI-driven analytics improve risk assessment, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer experiences.Moreover, knowledge-intensive industries, such as legal and research-driven enterprises, benefit from AI&amp;#39;s ability to process complex information. By integrating AI models with knowledge graphs and semantic reasoning, businesses can enhance decision-making and foster innovation. AI-enabled knowledge management systems facilitate the retrieval of relevant information, automate document summarization, and support collaborative problem-solving.One of the key drivers of business transformation is the shift from process augmentation to full automation. AI technologies are evolving from assisting human workers in decision-making to autonomously executing complex tasks. This transition is evident in various industries:1. Financial Services: AI-driven fraud detection systems analyze transactional data in real-time, identifying suspicious activities and preventing financial losses.2. Healthcare: AI models assist medical professionals in diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized treatment recommendations.3. Education: AI-powered tools automate grading, generate personalized learning pathways, and enhance student engagement.4. Manufacturing: AI-driven robotics and predictive maintenance optimize production lines, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.As AI capabilities advance, businesses must strategically navigate the balance between human expertise and machine intelligence to maximize efficiency while ensuring ethical considerations and transparency in decision-making.While AI presents unparalleled opportunities, it also raises challenges that businesses must address. Ethical AI deployment, data privacy, and bias mitigation are critical concerns. Organizations must ensure that AI models are trained on diverse datasets to prevent biases and maintain fairness in decision-making. Additionally, regulatory compliance and transparent AI governance frameworks are essential for building trust in AI-driven solutions.Another challenge is workforce transformation. As AI automates routine tasks, businesses must invest in upskilling employees to work alongside AI technologies. The future workforce will require a blend of technical skills and problem-solving capabilities to effectively leverage AI-driven insights.The future of AI-enabled business transformation lies in continuous innovation. As AI models become more sophisticated, businesses will increasingly adopt AI-driven decision intelligence, autonomous systems, and human-AI collaboration frameworks. The evolution of AI-powered digital twins [3], generative design systems, and adaptive AI solutions will redefine industry standards and create new business opportunities.To remain competitive, organizations must embrace AI as a strategic enabler of innovation. By integrating AI into core business functions, companies can unlock new revenue streams, enhance customer experiences, and drive operational excellence.},

  abstract     = {Approximately 30% of smart city applications will use artificial intelligence (AI) by the end of 2025, thereby radically altering the urban sustainability landscape in the future (Yan et al., 2023). The advent of AI in reshaping traditional businesses into sustainable operations is evident. Whenever AI is brought to the forefront, it is considered a cornerstone in the business domain, enabling a transition towards more innovative and sustainable practices (Appio et al., 2024). Incorporating AI into business practices has many facets. According to Grand View Research (2023), the global AI market size was anticipated at USD 196.63 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 36.6% from 2024 to 2030. The recent fanfare surrounding AI has elevated it to a key enabler of sustainable development, prompting many companies to prioritize and integrate it into their business operations; hence, there is a stark difference between traditional and new practices. In tandem with this evolution, urban growth and societal dynamics are experiencing profound changes as AI-driven solutions come to the fore in various aspects of modern society (Shahidi Hamedani et al., 2024). AI applications in city government, transforming conventional cities into efficient ones (Ortega-Fern&amp;#225;ndez et al., 2020), have significantly shifted from functional systems to more sustainable and intelligent ones. Furthermore, from another perspective, the role of AI in optimizing business processes has surpassed comparison with its implication for improving logistics operational capabilities and reducing environmental impacts (Jorzik et al., 2024a) till manufacturing reduces downtime, all of which contribute to the growth of urban economics. In the meantime, with the speedy pace of adoption of AI in business operations, it is also imperative to amalgamate with sustainable practices. Acting on this matter requires a thoughtful approach that aligns AI with social, economic, and environmental sustainability.The intersection of AI role and business operations has recently gained widespread attention. Some studies (Chen et al., 2024;Shahzadi et al., 2024)focused on AI&amp;#39;s role in supply chain management, highlighting its role in minimizing inefficiencies and improving logistics by utilizing AI more often;supply chains become leaner and reduced carbon footprints, paving the path to sustainable operations. It is estimated that by 2026, 60% of businesses will adopt AI-powered warehouse solutions instead of just 10% in 2020 (MHI, 2024).In line with this shift, (Dilmegani &amp;amp; Ermut, 2025) note that businesses also invest heavily in warehouse robots to enhance their supply chain management through AI technology. Robots can manage operations more efficiently and accurately by automating picking, packing, sorting, and inventory management, thus saving labor costs and accelerating order processing. Amazon, for instance, has deployed more than 200,000 robots in its warehouses to optimize operations.AI can be used to optimize resource utilization, automate processes for improved efficiency, and enable real-time monitoring that aligns with sustainability goals (Waltersmann et al., 2021). As sustainable supply chain management focuses on reducing waste and enhancing traceability, AI-driven technologies such as machine learning and big data analytics have been pivotal in achieving these goals. (Tsolakis et al., 2023) Companies like eBay leverage AI for machine translation, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency . Similarly, Vodafone employs AI-driven analytics to personalize services, exemplifying its transformative impact. (Jorzik et al., 2024a).These technologies help reduce forecasting errors, minimize excess inventory, and lower energy consumption. (Sharma et al., 2020) Likewise, Smart grid protection sensors can detect defects up to 80% more accurately than traditional sensors, reducing losses and improving the system&amp;#39;s reliability by adjusting to grid conditions dynamically (Mahadik, Sheetal et al., 2025). These applications contribute to urban economic growth by fostering technological innovation. AI leverages advanced techniques like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize dynamic business operations (Shuford, 2024). DRL improves supply chain management through adaptive routing and inventory optimization, dynamically adjusting to real-time changes in demand and logistics; with the help of DRL, researchers can develop systems that can dynamically adapt to changes, optimize resource utilization, and facilitate multi-objective decision-making for instance, (Dehaybe et al., 2024).In addition, it enables businesses to prevent equipment failures and minimize downtime, thereby streamlining workflows significantly (Mohan et al., 2021). Moreover, in urban centers, these advancements catalyze economic growth and foster innovation. In other words, a key contribution of AI is to facilitate smart urban development and efficient resource allocation, thereby ensuring that cities are resilient and economically prosperous (Li et al., 2024). In developing smart cities, AI has a transformative impact on urbanization trends. Through the application of AI, urban infrastructure can be optimized by improving energy efficiency, streamlining transportation, and managing housing needs; AI makes it possible to reduce traffic congestion and advance mobility in transportation systems, such as prescriptive traffic management and autonomous vehicles (Regona et al., 2024).In cities like Singapore, AI manages real-time traffic and monitors energy consumption, setting urban efficiency benchmarks (Padhiary et al., 2025). On a similar note, Tennet TSO, a German transmission system operator, has been utilizing AI-based forecasting and IBM Watson&amp;#39;s cognitive computing platform to anticipate renewable energy generation in real time, allowing real-time grid adjustments and maximizing clean energy use. (Mahadik, Sheetal et al., 2025) 3Nowadays, sustainability is a debatable topic, and the role of AI in sustainability is inevitable. Reducing waste and environmental food print, optimizing resource utilization, and fostering a circular economy is the sprout of AI role which assists in a sustainable environment (Onyeaka et al., 2023); for example, in the agriculture industry, enhancing operational automation, a prediction model for the total agricultural output value (Sachithra &amp;amp; Subhashini, 2023), improving yields while reducing environmental impact. Moreover, this is apparent regarding the implications of AI and IoT in agriculture due to their ability to improve efficiency and sustainability. Agriculture leads the way with 35% of these technologies, followed by precision farming and irrigation monitoring at 16% each.Farming practices are becoming smarter and more sustainable due to these innovations, which increase yields, reduce waste, and conserve resources (Market.Us, 2024).Similarly, smart grid technologies optimize energy distribution, lowering carbon footprints (Bhattacharya et al., 2022). As manufacturing and logistics become increasingly automated, energy consumption and operational inefficiencies will be minimized and aligned with global sustainability goals (Garrido et al., 2024).By placing AI at the heart of sustainability, industries can grow while solving environmental and social issues. Moreover, businesses shift from traditional linear operations to circular, innovative, and efficient models (Pathan et al., 2023). The paradigm shift of AI contributes to sustainability from various aspects; for site surveying and progress monitoring, AI power drones are used to enhance decision-making, reduce energy consumption and minimize waste, and facilitate green finance in the agriculture sector and its application in the cultivation and harvesting phases (Fuentes-Pe&amp;#241;ailillo et al., 2024). While AI is crucial in ensuring sustainable business operations, implementing it brings several challenges, including ethical and privacy concerns (Fan et al., 2023).In urban planning and infrastructure, there are also notable examples; by using data and knowledge acquired by AI, cities can shift to another level and have the potential to revolutionize city development, which will enable over 30% of smart city applications by 2025, including urban transportation solutions, significantly enhancing urban sustainability, social welfare, and vitality (Herath &amp;amp; Mittal, 2022). Furthermore, AI-enabled robots are deployed in the hospitality sector to provide personalized services and facilitate seamless guest experiences (Szpilko et al., 2023).Similarly, in the healthcare industry, AI can detect and predict diseases rapidly and accurately (Rashid &amp;amp; Kausik, 2024). For instance, The PRAIM study in Germany assessed AI-supported mammography screening versus standard double reading. Out of 463,094 women screened, 260,739 were assisted by AI. With AI-supported screening, 6.7 cancers were detected out of 1,000, which is 17.6% higher than in standard screening. (Eisemann et al., 2025) Policies are needed to protect individual privacy in urban settings and solve concerns (Dong &amp;amp; Liu, 2023). AI technologies rapidly gain momentum in various industries but present challenges, including significant data security and privacy concerns. Data privacy and security protection are becoming an urgent concern (Saura et al., 2022). Acknowledging that AI adoption will have significant societal consequences, particularly when shifting employment patterns and consumer behaviors, is important (Yu et al., 2023). The rise of automation has displaced traditional jobs and created a demand for AIspecialized workers (Betts et al., 2024).AI&amp;#39;s role in personalizing consumer experiences underscores the ethical responsibility to protect data privacy and mitigate algorithmic biases, maintaining public trust and equity. Governments and businesses must work together to implement reskilling programs to seamlessly transition to an AIdriven world. AI&amp;#39;s Ethical concerns, like data privacy and the digital divide, underscore the need for transparent and inclusive AI solutions (Bouhouita-Guermech et al., 2023). These challenges are amplified in urban areas, where disparities in digital access can marginalize vulnerable populations. These issues can be solved only by collaborative efforts to design AI systems prioritizing societal wellbeing and inclusiveness.Several challenges exist, including data integration issues, AI literacy issues, resistance to technological change, data availability, and reliance on data (Uwaoma et al., 2024). In many industries, getting clean and actionable data is time-consuming and costly. As a result, AI models cannot produce satisfactory results without robust data, undermining their potential for sustainability. Moreover, AI adoption is complicated by ethical issues (Bouhouita-Guermech et al., 2023). Ensuring equal access to technology and data privacy must be addressed so that AI benefits all sectors of society. Additionally, fostering AI literacy within organizations is of utmost importance. Many organizations resist to change due to a lack of understanding, making it difficult for them to adopt AI-driven sustainability practices in the future.Moreover, lack of data (availability and quality) also remains a hurdle for implementing sustainability in business operations; in other words, accessing clean data is also opaque (Jorzik et al., 2024b); for instance, for training DRL&amp;#39;s models, quality datasets are critical, and data within several sustainability contexts is both sparse and expensive to collect (Saliba et al., 2020).On the other hand, the reliability of data is also another concern; according to Choudhuri, (2023), 30 % of sustainability data is unreliable or has poor quality; having said that, incomplete data can fail any method of analysis and affect the decision-making process in other words without data-especially high-quality data-sustainable development is doomed to falter. A further concern is ensuring equitable access to AI since marginalized communities often face barriers to taking advantage of these developments (Kasun et al., 2024). The challenges highlighted here highlight the need for a balanced approach to AI deployment.Without AI, the prospects of adopting sustainable business practices are becoming increasingly bleak. However, Sustainable business demands the involvement of the government and the public sector.Governments must establish policies and regulations to promote transparency and collaboration to ensure high-quality data transfer to the private sector. Policies of this kind can foster cooperation between industries, facilitating the use of AI technologies responsibly and efficiently while addressing broader sustainability goals.The advancement of AI, however, is hindered by several limitations, including an unwillingness to change, ethical privacy concerns, and the difficulty of integrating new technology into pre-existing HR systems (Madanchian &amp;amp; Taherdoost, 2025). In addition, AI advancements are hampered by algorithms without common sense that cannot interpret data properly, resulting in flawed decisions (Nishant et al., 2024). As a result, clinicians&amp;#39; decision-making can be negatively impacted (Dratsch et al., 2023); for example, when prescribing antidepressants, clinicians were less accurate when following incorrect AI recommendations compared to a baseline or correct advice condition (Jacobs et al., 2021). The high cost of implementing AI in resource-intensive settings makes it difficult to reach a broad audience (Sommer et al., 2023). Additionally, organizational resistance to change creates a significant barrier to adopting AI in HRM since employees are reluctant to adopt AI due to concerns about data security, privacy, and possible job losses (Hassan et al., 2024).Businesses and industries are witnessing the impact of AI as a key driver of growth, which profoundly impacts businesses in various sectors. For instance, In the context of urban development, it can be implemented to improve traffic management, infrastructure, and public transportation scheduling in a way that contributes to more livable and sustainable urban development. AI can provide businesses with the means to optimize resources, reduce inefficiencies, and embrace innovative practices, enabling them to tackle urgent environmental and economic concerns. The full benefits of AI can only be realized if businesses align their operations with clearly defined sustainability targets. Achieving this requires a strategic approach to AI, not just a technical tool for generating short-term benefits.Policymakers must develop a reliable model that fairly and equitably fosters the use of AI in a broad range of sectors. Additionally, it would be beneficial for both the public and private sectors to work together to create inclusive solutions that will reduce societal disparities and protect the environment at the same time.As AI becomes increasingly integral to sustainability, it presents opportunities and challenges. A more sustainable market requires businesses to adopt AI to reduce costs; as McKinsey ( 2022), several companies have reported that AI forecasting engines reduce costs by 10% to 15% and improve their competitive position by automating up to 50% of workforce management tasks. However, the role of policymakers and urban planners in creating the conditions for AI innovations to thrive responsibly and inclusively cannot be overstated. Integrating AI into sustainable practices requires balancing technological advancements with ethical considerations. AI can be a powerful force for sustainable development if stakeholders create a collaborative atmosphere, address barriers, and promote transparency. As a result, businesses, societies, and the environment will all benefit. By examining the intersection of AI and urban sustainability in a new manner, the article introduces a fresh perspective to the literature because its analysis is not comprehensively covered in the current literature. It is valuable to synthesize existing literature to highlight trends and develop a strong foundation for understanding AI&amp;#39;s role in business.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated many aspects of daily life, including medicine, in recent years. As of 2021, 343 AI-enabled medical devices had been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, with many more in development (1). Most notable thus far has been AI&amp;#39;s ability to assist with every step of radiology workflow: it can determine the appropriateness of imaging, recommend the most appropriate imaging exam, predict wait times or appointment delays, and interpret imaging, with much more potential utilizations (2). The World Health Organization proposed that AI tools be integrated into healthcare to improve efficiency and achieve sustainable health-related development (3). AI in healthcare can reduce costs and administrative burdens, reduce waiting times for patients to receive care, improve diagnostic abilities and patient care, facilitate data management, and expedite discovery (4,5).However, the advancement of AI in healthcare comes with unique drawbacks. For example, data security and privacy are at risk and must be improved, as patients may more readily and unknowingly provide consent for covert data collection methods (6,7). Use of AI must be seriously reconsidered if it poses a risk to patient confidentiality, a non-negotiable in healthcare. With the ability of AI to rapidly gather and analyze large amounts of patient data, controlling the scope of its use becomes a challenge: these tools may progress to collect and disclose data without patient consent or direct investigator oversight (5). In addition, as most healthcare-based AI research has been conducted in non-clinical settings, rolling out AI in certain clinical settings may result in non-evidence-based practice (6). For example, clinicians may feel tempted to use AI for tasks beyond their validation, and training data may not adequately represent the scenarios clinicians encounter (8). In fact, many studies on AI in healthcare have been administered in non-clinical settings (5).That is not to say AI should not be used in healthcare. It does, however, require immense consideration in how it is designed and why it is utilized. Some have contended that a goal of developing AI for healthcare should be to minimize health disparities and make the healthcare system more equitable (1,9). Yet, many characteristics of AI make this goal difficult to achieve. As such, there is a growing body of literature that discusses AI&amp;#39;s role in both closing and perpetuating these inequalities (10)(11)(12). As the ability of AI is directly proportional to the quality of the training sets used, authors have addressed concerns regarding bias in training datasets and lack of diversity in development teams ultimately resulting in AI-driven disparities in care (5,(13)(14)(15). This article draws from existing literature to add to the ongoing conversation about the implications of AI in healthcare disparities. Specifically, we discuss economic implications, the explainability of AI systems, and the importance of compassionate care. Ultimately, while AI may indeed confer benefits to the healthcare system, it remains far from the goal of closing healthcare disparities and may, instead, backfire.One essential consideration in any kind of social disparity is economics. The United States is notorious for having the highest healthcare expenditure globally, with healthcare costing $3.5 trillion, or 17.9% of the Gross Domestic Product (16). Any measure to decrease this economic burden -either in the US or internationally -may be attractive. AI has the potential to save billions in annual healthcare costs (17). AI may greatly streamline workflow, even in non-clinical tasks. An automated system may alleviate administrative burdens such as scheduling patients, estimating wait times, and billing insurance companies (2,17,18). Such workflow optimization may reduce the cost of healthcare delivery by cutting out intermediaries that typically handle these mundane tasks. In turn, patients&amp;#39; financial responsibility related to their care may be reduced.On the clinical side, AI may be used to screen for and diagnose conditions, stratify disease risk, and devise treatment plans (16). It may significantly reduce medical errors and factors are associated with adverse outcomes (4). Eventually, as technology advances, it may even perform procedures, given that it is deemed ethical, safe and evidence-based. While these benefits may seem like simply a perk to those practicing in physician-rich areas, they could become indispensable to those in areas affected by shortages of medical professionals (19). Urban and rural communities bear the brunt of this inequity, with many struggling to access both primary and specialty care (20). It has been estimated that by 2030, there may be a shortage of up to 104,900 physicians in the United States (20). As such, AI implementation in these underserved populations may help to alleviate these challenges and improve disparities regarding access to care (19). Furthermore, AI assistants may help decrease physician burnout and therefore improve quality of care (21).These advantages of AI are conferred only with the proper development, installation and maintenance of these systems. AI requires immense investment. One model for an AI glaucoma screening tool in the Changjiang county in China estimated that the fifteen-year accumulated incremental cost of using this tool was $434,903.20 for approximately 2000 patients (22). While the costs of this screening tool are arguably worth early detection and reduced disease progression, it may be impractical to roll out to larger populations. Health institutions in wealthy countries may easily make this investment. But what about institutions in developing countries? Community hospitals with limited government funding? Practices in rural areas with less purchasing power? Even if analyses demonstrate that costs are saved in the long run, the upfront investment may be too large an obstacle (16).Once a system is developed, purchased, and installed, maintenance becomes another issue.Software updates, advanced computing technologies, and ever-increasing cloud storage requirements add to costs (1). The evolving cybersecurity needs to protect patient health information may create further barriers to widespread application of AI (23). These all-around cost barriers are more nuanced than the mere ability to implement AI in practice. Inevitably, there are AI algorithms with higher and lower levels of sophistication, infrastructures that are more and less robust, and security measures that are stronger and weaker. The AI system that institutions choose will be closely tied to their financial status. Of course, AI development will then leave behind under-resourced communities.Currently, there is a lack of &amp;quot;explainable&amp;quot; AI regarding algorithms and data sets that play a role in decision making (24). In other words -exactly how do these technologies work? How are they making these decisions? These are questions that even developers themselves cannot answer; we know they work, yet nobody can fully explain how. This &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; of AI holds important implications to healthcare disparities worldwide. Machine learning (ML) is a component of AI which involves automated decision making based on datasets (25). Detecting and correcting biases based on limited training sets is an ethical prerequisite of justice in AI-and ML-based clinical decision-making (20). In other words, explainable AI enables developers to identify and correct training set-based biases that currently skew algorithms (10,13).The discussion of justice behind explainable AI requires additional considerations. Explainable AI models keep model developers accountable for their work, as lack of accountability precedes error (24). This concern is compounded by the fact that patients who are less literate are less likely to ask questions or seek more information about their care (26). Since these patients may be less prepared to participate in shared decision making, they may not challenge questionable decisions (27).AI should be treated as a tool to support decision-making, not one to make decisions independently. For example, AI prescription systems have been developed to aid physician workflow and prevent human error (28,29). Inevitably, physicians will encounter scenarios in which the AI recommendation conflicts with their clinical judgement. Some of these scenarios may arise if AI systems are not trained on datasets that adequately represent the populations they treat, thereby generating recommendations poorly aligned with the realities of patients&amp;#39; needs (5). This challenge is particularly relevant to minority communities that have historically been under-studied (15). Healthcare providers should critically assess the AI recommendation in the context of their clinical experience and patient preferences. Institutions should establish clear policies on how to accept or reject AI suggestions to maintain quality patient care.Justice in explainable AI systems is important also in that more transparent technologies will foster patient trust in providers and the healthcare system. Unexplainable, opaque models, on the other hand, may exacerbate the mistrust that already pervades the healthcare system. This mistrust is particularly prevalent in socially and economically marginalized communities (30). A key component of trust in underprivileged populations is the patient&amp;#39;s comfort with the physician and physicians&amp;#39; personal involvement in patient care (31). As such, we may see that the unexplainable black box of AI and ML -if not handled correctly -would certainly exacerbate these concerns. Lack of explanation for these impersonal, automated algorithms may further alienate this vulnerable population and widen health disparities.Even if we are to elucidate the black box, can AI ever replace the physician-patient relationship in delivering empathic care? Currently, it seems unlikely -one recent study demonstrated that healthcare chatbots delivering both empathetic and sympathetic responses to patients in fact lowered patients&amp;#39; perception of their authenticity (32). In contrast, empathy and sympathy expressed by human physicians did not induce this negative effect (32). This lack of perceived authenticity may not only undermine patients&amp;#39; subjective satisfaction with their AI providers but may also objectively worsen patient outcomes. While some AI tools provided sound biomedical recommendations for diabetes management, they overlooked psychosocial components that are also necessary for glycemic control (33). Algorithms that determine A1c goals, calculate medication dosages, and send prescriptions may certainly help optimize patient care. However, recommendations poorly tailored to psychosocial challenges disproportionately affect those with greater social barriers. Continuing the stand-alone case of diabetes, for example, significant social barriers to care include having the ability to afford healthy food, the free time for follow-up visits and the literacy to understand health information (34). Now combine this diabetes with a slew of other health conditions, medications, unemployment concerns and an ailing family member. Surely, physicians can manage this patient in countless different ways. There is no one correct path. Regardless, it is imperative that health providers -human or AI-based -address these concerns with compassion.Palliative care, which emphasizes relieving suffering and optimizing quality of life in end-oflife care, is a field in which compassion is key (35). While AI may help assist in decision-making, it risks depersonalizing cases and lacking empathy when patients and their families need it the most. Death and dying are often rooted in culture, personal beliefs, and spirituality. The experience is deeply personal and unique to each family (35). Whereas some encourage open communication about death, others feel uncomfortable with it; whereas some value life-prolonging measures regardless of prognosis, others less so (36). Palliative care AI models risk imposing a &amp;quot;one-size-fits-all&amp;quot; model of care based on aWestern training dataset (35). Once again, understudied populations and cultural minorities fall behind in AI&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; -or lack thereof -of their values.Society at large, including regulators, policy makers, insurance companies, healthcare professionals and patients should carefully consider incorporating AI practices into the practice and business of medicine. Regulators have raised concerns over the need for regulation of clinical AI as well as generalizability to different populations (37). Another area of concern relevant to several stakeholders including healthcare providers and regulators is legal responsibility for AI clinical decision making (37). This fear exists for physicians in the scenario of a medical error made by AI and conversely for accusations of negligent care for not using AI. Physicians were neither prepared for nor agreed with assuming responsibility for errors made by AI, while AI developers believed they should not be liable since they do not practice medicine (37). Each side felt they only understood &amp;quot;part of the whole&amp;quot; when it comes to AI, further highlighting the need for explainable AI. Appropriate oversight by policy makers and regulators is needed to ensure accountability and promote development of explainable AI. These risks may be further mitigated by informing patients that AI was involved in decision making (38).Certain narratives have pitted AI as a rival to the skills and education of physicians, with claims that AI will one day replace physicians (38). AI remains solely a tool to assist in clinical setting with the final decision being made by a human. Rhetoric that continues to pit AI against physicians will only hinder the incorporation of AI into clinical practice (38). Patients will not benefit from AI replacing their physicians, but they also will not benefit from avoiding AI altogether.In discussing the role of AI in closing healthcare disparities, we must consider the role of AI in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). In areas where medical resources and personnel are scarce, AI can reduce the workload on healthcare personnel (39). AI can also improve access to medical care, especially for areas where specialty care is not available (40). Disease outbreaks can be predicted earlier and allow for mobilization of treatment to affected areas. ML has been used to assess disease severity and predict treatment failure for illnesses such as malaria, tuberculosis and dengue fever (39). However, LMICs face significant challenges in implementing AI. The lack of electronic health records and health data is a limiting factor since this data is the primary input used in AI algorithms (40). Most AI systems are developed in high income countries (HICs) and the ML models reflect datasets from those populations. When applying these technologies to LMICs, models must be updated to reflect the population it is being applied to. Failure to do so can reinforce and exacerbate existing health disparities (40).Gaining both physician and patient trust in the integration of AI in healthcare remains a problem that needs to be addressed in the future. In a small study interviewing patients on their perspectives on AI in GP, subjects had mixed feelings on implementation of AI (41). A common concern amongst participants related to sharing of and access to their medical information (41). The patients wanted assurance that appropriate consent would be obtained prior to sharing of their data and that anonymization would be used. A survey of 203 participants on public opinion of AI in medicine also yielded mixed results, with a near 50/50 split when asked if they trust AI as a physician&amp;#39;s tool for diagnosing medical conditions (42). In the same study, a majority of participants trusted a human physician over AI in making a culturally biased decision. There was a more positive outlook towards the future as over 25% of respondents believe AI will improve medical treatment in the next 10 years and nearly half of respondents for the next 50 years (42).Similarly, what AI lacks that physicians have is not intelligence, but rather wisdom -the sense of intuition that a human being can accumulate only over time (43). Can AI develop this intuition over time? Can an AI model mimic the human brain in synthesizing decades&amp;#39; worth of information to analyze a unique case and provide appropriate medical decision making? For simple cases, it likely can. But complex cases are a different story -risks and benefits of intervention must be weighed and complications must be predicted, all while delivering this information to the patient in an easilydigestible manner. Yet another layer of nuance is added when shared-decision making is introducednow, AI must understand patients&amp;#39; desires and uncertainties on a human level and incorporate that into its recommendations. Moreover, patients believe their physician should remain the primary decision maker, with AI can be used as a support tool (41). The use of AI in this setting may decrease time physicians spend on mundane tasks and leave more time for physicians to have meaningful conversations with their patients, facilitating the delivery of compassionate care (37,44). Once again, compassion and trust are key components to patient care for all patients alike.While AI has the potential to increase access to care for vulnerable populations and help bridge gaps in healthcare, we must ensure that data and algorithms are inclusive of patients to avoid worsening existing disparities. The healthcare system hinges on trust to maintain patient confidentiality, recommend the optimal course of action, and execute the plan appropriately. Particularly in marginalized communities, the critical process of building and maintaining this trust has proved difficult even in the absence of AI and continues to pose a significant obstacle in the success of AI to improve healthcare delivery. Both physicians and patients alike do not wish to see AI replace the standard physician-patient interaction. Instead, AI can serve as an adjunct to improve quality of care by reducing the chance of human error. Collaboration among patients, physicians, and AI developers is essential to achieve this goal in an equitable manner.},
