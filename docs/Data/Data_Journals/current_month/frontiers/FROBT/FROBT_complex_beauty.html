  abstract     = {This research topic arose on the back of the WTF workshop series (F&amp;#246;rster et al., 2022(F&amp;#246;rster et al., 2023a) ) that brought 2 together an interdisciplinary group of researchers ranging from roboticists and computational linguists to 3 conversation analysts and cognitive scientists to openly and frankly discuss failures of (robotic) speech 4 interfaces they experienced when deploying these in their studies. Some of the issues discussed in the 5 workshops are elaborated in the contributed articles below, more pointers can be found in the workshop 6 summary article by F&amp;#246;rster et al. (2023b).This research topic contributes towards two main objectives: Firstly, we provide a platform for reporting 8 commonly occurring communicative failures in human-robot interaction (HRI). Secondly, this topic aims Galbraith (2024) investigate how virtual assistants deal with the interactionally highly relevant and 28 frequent &amp;#39;huh?&amp;#39;, an other-initiated, and likely universal repair marker (cf. Dingemanse et al., 2015). They further investigate what repair strategies these assistants utilise when encountering unintelligible speech, 30 and how native speakers judge these different repair strategies. In their study, two different virtual assistants, 31 Google Assistant and Apple&amp;#39;s Siri, are compared across two different languages (English and Spanish).Galbraith finds that neither assistant actively produces &amp;#39;huh?&amp;#39; but rather employs more specific repair 33 strategies when confronted with unintelligible speech. The assistants frequently have trouble dealing with a 34 &amp;#39;huh?&amp;#39; produced by human users, and some of the repair strategies employed by the two assistants were 35 rated negatively by human judges. While these insights were gained by interacting with virtual assistants, 36 we expect some of these to apply to SDS more generally (cf. Lopez et al., 2022).},

  abstract     = {The development of smart endorobots is transforming the field of minimally invasive procedures by introducing novel solutions for diagnosis and treatment within the human body. These advanced robotic systems enable enhanced manoeuvrability, improved precision, and greater patient safety. Clinicians are increasingly supported by endorobots to perform diagnosis and treatment of difficult-toreach organs through small incisions or natural orifices. New technologies have provided a tool to improve the design of such devices (e.g., reducing size, improving dexterity, and reducing stress and fatigue, while AI and ML algorithms are providing a tool to support clinical judgment (Manfredi, 2021(Manfredi, 2022)). This new generation of endorobots is not only capable of mimicking users&amp;#39; movements but also performing tasks at different levels of autonomy. Their design requires a multidisciplinary team that involves experts in various research areas, including actuators, sensors, control, mechanics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp;amp; Machine Learning (ML), and imaging. The increased level of autonomy introduces ethical concerns regarding responsibility, regulatory compliance, and ensuring safety while avoiding limitations on technological advancements.The design of endorobots for endoluminal applications requires a multidisciplinary approach covering different research aspects. The goal of this research topic was to gather contributions from various disciplines into one collection, offering readers a comprehensive overview of the field.This research topic includes a collection of articles and reviews that can be summarized into three main themes: i)},
