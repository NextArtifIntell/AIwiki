By leveraging multiscale dynamics including pores, crystallization, and intermolecular interactions, a dense hierarchical structure is created that significantly improves toughness, reaching ≈90 MJ m⁻ 3 . This hydrogel withstands temperatures from −150 to 70 °C, pressure of 12 psi, and one-month storage under ambient conditions, while maintaining a lightweight profile of 0.25 g cm⁻ 3 . Additionally, its tunable rheological properties allow for high-resolution printing of desired shapes down to 220 µm, capable of supporting loads exceeding 164 kg m⁻ 2 .

Recent studies have focused on not only the cooling capacity but also the applicability and versatility of this technology. This study introduces a daytime radiative cooler as a sheet with exceptional cooling performance. Its matrix is composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which are emerging organic materials suitable for radiative cooling. Furthermore, aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is employed as a supporting dielectric particle to enhance cooling performance. An Al 2 O 3 -assisted organic composite (AOC) is created through electrospinning and hot-pressing, resulting in a bendable sheet form. The AOC sheet demonstrates a light reflectance of 97.9% across the solar spectral region (0.3–2.5 µm) and an emissivity of 95.2% within the atmospheric transparency window (ATW) of 8–13 µm. The cooling power, derived from optical properties, is calculated to be 120.1 Wm −2 . Experimental findings confirm the AOC sheet&#39;s capability to achieve 4.9 °C below ambient temperature and, when applied to a car model, to reduce the interior temperature by 12.7 °C.},

  abstract     = {Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a promising approach for cancer treatment. Compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT offers increased penetration depth and higher precision. However, the practical application of SDT is constrained by the low water solubility, poor tumor specificity, and metabolic susceptibility of most sonosensitizers. Recent research has explored the use of piezoelectric materials as sonosensitizers in cancer treatment and inhibition of bacterial growth. Upon ultrasound excitation, the separation of electron–hole (e − –h + ) pairs occurs within the piezoelectric material. By improving the crystal structure of the material or incorporating other nanoparticles to prevent rapid recombination of e − –h + pairs, the piezoelectric material accumulates charges in the conduction band and valence band, achieving the redox potential of O 2 /·O 2 − . This enables the piezoelectric material to serve as a sonosensitizer, leading to the concept termed Sono-Piezo Dynamic Therapy (SPDT). This review aims to define the concept of SPDT, provide a systematic overview of the historical development of piezoelectric materials in the application of SDT, and elucidate the potential mechanisms by which piezoelectric materials act as sonosensitizers. Importantly, various piezoelectric materials will be discussed in terms of their feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages as sonosensitizers, offering new perspectives for identifying potential sonosensitizers.},

  abstract     = {The crosstalk between immunity and cancer in the regulation of tumor growth is considered a hallmark of cancer. Antitumor immunity refers to the innate and adaptive immune responses that regulate cancer development and proliferation. Tumor immune evasion represents a major hindrance to effective anticancer treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized and lipid-bilayer-enclosed particles that are secreted to the extracellular space by all cell types. They are critically involved in numerous biological functions including intercellular communication. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) can transport a variety of cargo to modulate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review provides the latest update about how tumor cells evade immune surveillance by exploiting TEVs. First, the biogenesis of EVs and the cargo-sorting machinery are discussed. Second, how tumor cells modulate immune cell differentiation, activation, and function via TEVs to evade immune surveillance is illustrated. Last but not least, the novel antitumor strategies that can reverse immune escape are summarized.},

  abstract     = {Environmental factors are linked to aging and age-related diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that enhancing body&#39;s resistance to xenobiotics might be an anti-aging strategy. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, coordinating metabolism and immune responses to adapt to stress triggered by exogenous exposure. However, the impact of activating CAR on aging remains unknown. In this study, Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ), drug-induced premature aging mice, and senescence accelerated P8 (SAMP8) mice are used as models to explore the effects of CAR activation on lifespan and healthspan, along with the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that hCAR agonist CITCO and mCAR agonist TCPOBOP prolonged the lifespan and healthspan in model organism. The longevity effects of CITCO and TCPOBOP were attenuated in CAR homozygous nhr-8/daf-12 mutant C. elegans as well as CAR −/− mice. In C. elegans , CITCO activated both anti-stress and detoxification genes, and increased the resistance to environmental adversities. Additionally, the lifespan-extending and xenobiotic resistant effects of CITCO might be related to the regulation of age-related pathways. Furthermore, CITCO improved age-related neurodegeneration in C. elegans models. Taken together, the results suggest that the longevity effects of CAR agonists may be related to the enhancement of xenobiotic resistance of animals.},

  abstract     = {Muscle atrophy occurs during natural aging and under disease conditions. Muscle cell apoptosis is considered one of the main causes of muscle atrophy, while several recent studies argued that muscle cells do not die during muscle atrophy. Here, sensor zebrafish are generated to visualize muscle cell apoptosis and the engulfment of dead muscle cells by macrophages. Using these sensor zebrafish, starvation, and natural aging-induced muscle atrophy models are established. The data showed that the diameters of muscle cells decreased in both models; however, muscle cell apoptosis is not found in the process of muscle atrophy. In starvation-induced muscle atrophy, it also showed that the number of nuclei in muscle cells remained constant, and there is no increase in the number of macrophages in muscle tissues, both of which further confirmed that muscle cells do not die. In both models, transcriptional analysis showed that the apoptosis pathway is down-regulated, and autophagy and protein degradation pathways are up-regulated. All these data indicated that although there is a great reduction of muscle mass during starvation or aging-induced muscle atrophy, muscle cells do not die by apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into muscle atrophy and can benefit the treatments for muscle atrophy-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {A fibrous flexible sensor, with its small size, minimally burdens the human body, ranking among the most user-friendly flexible sensors. However, its application is often limited by damage caused by electrode movement, as flexible sensors are typically attached to joints, which can be greatly alleviated by placing the two electrodes on the same side. Inspired by the hydrogen bonds in the double-helical structure of DNA, the double-helical electrode design is commonly found and applied in fiber-based batteries and supercapacitors into fibrous flexible sensors through coaxial wet-spinning and further treatment. The double helical sensor exhibits high strength and maintains stable operation and is prepared under over 300% strain with gauge factors (GF) of 0.9, 39.5, and 349, respectively, in its working ranges. This unique single-sided electrode structure also enabled applications such as water flow sensing. The sensor into a smart glove capable of real-time is further integrated, five-channel finger motion detection, and used a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning algorithm to achieve 98.8% accuracy in recognizing six common gestures. This study provides a novel approach to optimize the electrode distribution in fiber-based flexible sensors through an internally encapsulated double-helical structure, making a significant contribution to the field of flexible sensing.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cells cope with oxidative stress for their proliferation and metastasis by equipping antioxidant systems, among which the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) play crucial roles. However, whether PRDXs exhibit nonenzymatic functions remains unclear. Here, it is shown that the 1-cysteine PRDX (PRDX6) upregulates nicotinamide N -methyltransferase (NNMT) to promote the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, independently of PRDX6&#39;s enzymatic activities. Mechanistically, PRDX6 interacts with NNMT to prevent its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite-motif protein 56 (TRIM56), leading to the inhibition of NNMT ubiquitination at lysine 23 and 210 and suppression of subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition, PRDX6-mediated NNMT upregulation activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, PRDX6 overexpression is associated with higher NNMT protein levels in human ovarian cancer tissues and is predictive of poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Overall, the findings illustrate a critical oncogenic mechanism of the antioxidant enzyme PRDX6 in promoting ovarian cancer progression beyond its enzymatic mechanisms.},

Herein, a battery-supercapacitor composite material Na 3 V 1.95 Ni 0.05 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3 /10%NC-KOH (NVNPF/NCK) with coexistence of crystalline and amorphous phases is fabricated by loading nitrogenous carbon (NC) onto Na 3 V 1.95 Ni 0.05 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3 (NVNPF) and etching with KOH. It demonstrates high specific capacity (187.26 mAh g −1 ), ultrahigh energy density (262.16 Wh kg −1 ), and excellent cycle performance (the capacity retention is 81% at 1 C after 500 cycles). The high performance is achieved by doping Ni 2 ⁺ loading NC and etching with KOH, which generates vacancy defects, enhances structural stability, and accelerates ion-diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the fully-printed ARSIBs (F-NTP//NVNPF/NCK) with high specific capacity (60.37 mAh g −1 ), amazing energy density (72.44 Wh kg −1 ), and excellent cycle performance, are fabricated using screen-printing technique based on the NVNPF/NCK cathode and NaTi 1.7 Fe 0.3 (PO 4 ) 3 (F-NTP) anode. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, F-NTP//NVNPF/NCK is the highest-performing fully-printed flexible ARSIB to date. In particular, these batteries can achieve tunability in shape and size, integration, and high-throughput manufacturing.

  abstract     = {Gene duplication has allowed protein evolution toward novel functions and mechanisms. The differences between paralogous genes frequently rely on the sequence of disordered regions. For instance, in mammals, the chaperones ANP32A and ANP32B share a common evolutionary line and have some exchangeable functions based on their similar N-terminal domains. Nevertheless, their C-terminal low-complexity-acidic-regions (LCARs) display substantial sequence differences, unveiling some degree of variability between them, in agreement with their different tissue-specific expression patterns. These structural and computational results indicate that a substitution in the vicinity of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), of Pro in ANP32A for Thr in ANP32B, determines the overall compactness of the C-terminal LCAR. The different structural properties of the disordered region affect the binding mode of ANP32 members to their targets. This type of divergent binding mode is exemplified with the extra-mitochondrial cytochrome c (C c ), a well-known ANP32B partner and which now determine also binds to ANP32A; and with the RNA binding protein HuR, whose export to the cytoplasm is mediated by ANP32 proteins under stress. Therefore, differential expression patterns of ANP32A or ANP32B may affect the regulation of C c and HuR and can help to explain the distinct roles of these proteins in diseases.},

Protein arginine methyltransferases 5 (PRMT5) plays a crucial role in regulating homeostasis of various mammalian tissues. However, its function in intestinal homeostasis remains elusive. In this study, conditional knockout of Prmt5 in the mouse intestinal epithelium leads to a reduction in stem cell population, suppression of cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis within the intestinal crypts, accompanied with shortened gut length, decreased mouse body weight, and eventual animal mortality. Additionally, Prmt5 deletion or its enzymatic inhibition in intestinal organoids in vitro also shows resembling cellular phenotypes. Methylome profiling identifies 90 potential Prmt5 substrates, which are involved in RNA-related biological processes and cell division. Consistently, Prmt5 depletion in intestinal organoids leads to aberrant alternative splicing in a subset of genes related to the mitotic cell cycle. Furthermore, Prmt5 loss triggers p53-mediated apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium. Collectively, the findings uncover an indispensable role of PRMT5 in promoting cell proliferation and survival, as well as maintaining stem cells in the gut epithelium.},

Here an efficient sintering method is presented using ultralow power UV by leveraging the photocleavable ligand, o -nitrobenzyl thiol (NT), – functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The controlled removal of NT ligands upon UV irradiation enhances light absorption by reducing the filling factor of voids in the printed layer, increasing the layer temperature, and facilitating further ligand desorption. This positive feedback mechanism accelerates nanoparticle sintering at several orders of magnitude lower energy than IPL, achieving an electrical conductivity of 7.0 × 10 6 S m −1 .

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial transfer emerges as a promising therapy for the restoration of mitochondrial function in damaged cells, mainly due to its limited immunogenicity. However, isolated mitochondria rapidly lose function because they produce little energy outside cells. Therefore, this study investigates whether near infrared (NIR)-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) pre-treatment enhances mitochondrial function and stability in mitochondria-donor cells prior to transplantation. Clinical applications of NADH, an essential electron donor in the oxidative phosphorylation process, are restricted due to the limited cellular uptake of NADH. To address this, a photo-mediated method optimizes direct NADH delivery into cells and increases NADH absorption. L6 cells treated with NADH and irradiated with NIR enhanced NADH uptake, significantly improving mitochondrial energy production and function. Importantly, the improved functional characteristics of the mitochondria are maintained even after isolation from cells. Primed mitochondria, i.e., those enhanced by NIR-mediated NADH uptake (P-MT), are encapsulated in fusogenic liposomes and delivered into muscle cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. Compared to conventional mitochondria, P-MT mitochondria promote greater mitochondrial recovery and muscle regeneration. These findings suggest that NIR-mediated NADH delivery is an effective strategy for improving mitochondrial function, and has the potential to lead to novel treatments for mitochondrial disorders and muscle degeneration.},

Natural biomolecules-based CPL materials are gaining plenty of attention due to their chiral diversity and sustainability. However, it is still challenging to construct CPL materials with opposite CPL signs from a single natural biomolecule due to its inherent chirality. Here, chiral assemblies with opposite CPL signs using chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) and achiral luminescent dyes are successfully prepared. It is found that COS can serve as a chiral template to induce the ordered assembly of the dyes along the polymer chain through electrostatic attraction interaction. It is demonstrated experimentally that the structural planarity of the dye molecules is crucial for the formation of chiral co-assemblies. Interestingly, the left-handed COS-templated co-assemblies can emit CPL with opposite handedness, which is controlled by the helicity degree of the co-assemblies. This study not only deepens the understanding of the complex assembly of natural biomacromolecules but also provides new insights into the design and construction of CPL materials.},

In this study, ULM is used to observe the human microvasculature in neonatal patients undergoing treatment for life-threatening malformations forming direct connections between the cerebral arterial and venous systems. It is observed that neuroendovascular treatment of neonatal arteriovenous malformations causes remodeling and reorganization of the cerebral vasculature by also activating corticomedullary vascular connections.

The Golgi apparatus (GA) of tumor cells is a key organelle in the formation of a tumor immunosuppressive network. However, there are no studies to show whether interfering with the GA of tumor cells can reshape the immunosuppressive network to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, the tumor cell GA-targeting self-assembled peptide (NF-1) is tailored, and confirmed that NF-1 treatment can achieve an effective immunotherapy and found that tumor cell-derived GA-dependent migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mediates the formation of immunosuppressive network in breast cancer (BRCA) through multi-omics analysis, in vivo, and in vitro experiments. NF-1 treatment-induced MIF reduction can reshape the immunosuppressive network and convert a “cold” tumor into a “hot” tumor, thus enabling immunotherapy in BRCA and enhancing the ICB efficacy in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). This study presents a general strategy for interfering with tumor GA for effective immunotherapy in BRCA, COAD, and other cancers characterized by a “cold” immune microenvironment.},

  abstract     = {Halide perovskite single crystals have demonstrated enormous potential for next-generation integrated optoelectronic devices. However, there is a lack of a facile method to realize the controllable growth of large-scale, high-quality, and high-resolution perovskite single crystal arrays on diverse types of substrates, which hinders their application in practical scenarios. Here, a one-step wettability-guided blade coating approach is reported for the rapid in situ crystallization of large-scale, multicolor, and sub-100 nm perovskite single-crystal arrays in the ambient environment. By this strategy, the physical dimensions of perovskite single crystals can be precisely regulated from 90 to 260 nm, with a size variation coefficient &lt; 10% and an area of over 900 mm 2 . All three typicalhalogen perovskites for multi-color luminescence, CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I) and their mixtures (Cl/Br or Br/I systems), are appliable to this fabrication process through the demonstration of complex RGB patterns with remarkable photoluminescence properties. Moreover, various rigid substrates such as silicon oxide (SiO 2 ), silicon (Si), and glass can also be used to construct the wettability-constrast templates where perovskite crystal nucleate and grow. After that, the perovskite single-crystal arrays or complex patterns can be transferred onto flexible substrates, for instance, COC. This method combines convenient solution processing with conventional photolithography to prepare the high-resolution, large-area, and superior-quality perovskite single crystal arrays in a high-throughput manner, showing great potential in the integration of perovskite nano-optoelectronic devices and chips.},

  abstract     = {Vanadium oxides are attracted cathodes for aqueous zinc batteries owing to their high capacity. However, the limited cyclability of vanadium-based oxide cathodes, especially at low current densities, impedes their practical application. Here, it is revealed that proton insertion is responsible for the limited lifetime of vanadium oxides. Proton insertion promotes the dissolution of vanadium oxides, deteriorating electrochemical performance. Propylene carbonate (PC) is introduced into Zn(CF 3 SO 3 ) 2 electrolyte to regulate the coordination environment of water, forming PC-coordinated Zn 2+ solvation structure and [H 2 O-CF 3 SO 3 − -PC] complex. The optimized coordination environment of water weakens the adsorption energy between water molecules and vanadium oxides, inhibiting proton insertion. As a result, vanadium-based oxides cathode without proton insertion can maintain the stability of crystal structure and avoid the dissolution of V. Taking CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O as cathode, Zn||CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O battery without proton insertion performs enhanced cycling performance. This work not only reveals the negative effect of proton insertion on the lifetime of vanadium-based oxides cathode but also provides an effective strategy to modulate proton insertion.},

However, the weak photostability always leads to inevitable photolysis of GO during the use, storage, and application. Indirect photolysis has a significant impact on the structure of GO via causing fragmentation and degradation, while the pathway can be divided into two stages. In the early stage, photoreduction is the dominant reaction to generate porous reduction GO (PrGO). Then H 2 O 2 breaks PrGO into fragments, and eventually, the fragmented GO is converted into CO 2 by OH radicals. The generation of porous structures in early photoreduction is a crucial premise for the subsequent photodegradation, while GO flakes without porous structure cannot be broken by H 2 O 2 and OH. In this work, a deep insight into the indirect photolysis pathway and the committed step is provided, which may bring some advanced ideas for enhancing GO stability in practical application.},

In this study, succinonitrile (SN) is incorporated into a PEO composite electrolyte to fabricate an electrode-compatible electrolyte with good electrochemical performance. The SN-doped electrolyte successfully inhibits the lithium dendrite growth and facilitates the SEI layer formation, as determined by the operando nanofocus wide-angle X-ray scattering (nWAXS), meanwhile, stably cycled over 500 h in Li/SN-PEO/Li cell. Apart from the observation of lithium dendrite, the robust SEI layer formation mechanism in the first cycle is investigated in the SN-enhanced composite electrolyte by nWAXS. The inorganic electrochemical reaction products, LiF and Li 3 N, are found to initially deposit on the electrolyte side, progressively extending toward the lithium metal anode. This growth process effectively protected the metallic lithium, inhibited electron transfer, and facilitated Li⁺ transport. The study not only demonstrates a high-performance interfacial-stable lithium metal battery with composite electrolyte but also introduces a novel strategy for real-time visualizing dendrite formation and SEI growth directing at the interface area of electrolyte and metallic lithium.},

  abstract     = {Ocular injury and infection are significant causes of vision impairment and blindness globally. Effective treatment is, however, challenging due to the physical barrier of the cornea, which restricts drug penetration in the eye, as well as the presence of eye injury that necessitates continuous delivery of growth factors on the ocular surface for cornea healing. Here, we introduce a transformative wearable corneal microneedle (MN) patch designed for efficient therapy of ocular injury and infection. The MN patch comprises water-soluble tips that encapsulate antibacterial nanoparticles (NPs), along with a transformative backing layer that contains epidermal growth factor (EGF). Upon insertion into the eye, the MN tips dissolve swiftly within the cornea stroma, resulting in the release of the antimicrobial NPs to efficiently eradicate bacteria. Meanwhile, the residual backing layer undergoes rapid in situ transformation upon contact with mildly acidic fluid from infected corneal edema, converting into a contact lens that conforms to the eye&#39;s surface, which facilitates sustained release of EGF on the ocular surface over 8 h to promote corneal healing. Benefiting from these features, the designed transformative corneal MN patch demonstrates superior efficacy in treating ocular injuries and infections in vivo, offering a promising therapeutic strategy to manage eye diseases.},

Herein, a versatile nanocomposite microneedle patch (referred to as GM-Ag 2 S/Ca 32 P) is designed to simultaneously eliminate residual tumor post-surgery and promote the healing of infectious wounds. This microneedle patch effectively penetrates subcutaneous tissues, delivering therapeutic payloads to infiltrating tumor cells and bacteria. The Ag 2 S/Ca 32 P nanocomposites encapsulated within the microneedle patch decompose in the acidic microenvironment of tumors and bacterial biofilms, releasing radioactive 32 P and Ag 2 S nanodots, which enhance tumor eradication and bacteria killing through synergistic brachytherapy and photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, the nanocomposite microneedle patch promotes scar-free wound healing by reducing inflammation, and promoting granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, thanks to localized hyperthermia, radiation, and the swelling and biodegradation of the microneedle matrices. This microneedle patch-based postoperative adjuvant therapy offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing melanoma recurrence and infectious wound healing, with promising potential for clinical application in postsurgical management.},

Here, multi-color fluorescence microscopy is applied to track the assembly of both liposomes and mRNA simultaneously in clinical mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy. Imaging reveals that the assembly occurs in discrete steps: initially, RNA adsorbs onto the liposomes; then, the RNA-coated liposomes cluster into heterogeneous structures ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The clustering process is consistent with a Smoluchowski model with a Brownian diffusion kernel. The transition between the two steps of assembly is determined by the orientation of RNA-mediated interactions.

  abstract     = {Sound-evoked wakefulness from sleep is crucial in daily life, yet its neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is found that CaMKIIα+ neurons in the temporal association cortex (TeA) of mice are not essential for natural awakening from sleep. However, optogenetic activation of these neurons reliably induces wakefulness from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but not from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In vivo electrophysiological and calcium recordings further demonstrated that TeA neurons are monotonically tuned to sound intensity but not frequency. More importantly, it is found that the activity of CaMKIIα+ neurons in TeA can gate sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, which is further confirmed by optogenetic manipulations. Further investigation reveals that the baseline excitability of TeA CaMKIIα+ neurons and the delta oscillations in the electroencephalogram are particularly important in regulating the evoked activity of TeA neurons. Anatomical and functional screening of downstream targets of TeA reveals that excitatory projections from TeA glutamatergic neurons to glutamatergic neurons in the basolateral/lateral amygdala are critical for modulating sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep. These findings uncover a top-down regulatory circuit that selectively governs sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, with the TeA functioning as a key connecting cortex to subcortical regions.},

In this paper, a neural device with intrinsic perception and decision-making (NDIPD), inspired by neuronal oscillatory activity is introduced. The device utilizes alternating signals generated by coupling the human body with the power-frequency electromagnetic field as both a signal source and energy source, mimicking neuronal oscillatory activity. The peaks and valleys of the alternating signal are differentially modulated to replicate the baseline shift process in neuronal oscillatory activity. By comparing the amplitude of the peaks and valleys in the NDIPD&#39;s electrical output signal, the device achieves intrinsic perception and decision-making regarding the location of mechanical stimulation. This is accomplished using a single interface, which reduces data transmission, simplifies functionality, and eliminates the need for an external power supply. The NDIPD demonstrates a low-pressure detection limit (&lt;0.02 N), fast response time (&lt;20 ms), and exceptional stability (&gt;200 000 cycles). It shows great potential for applications such as game control, UAV navigation, and virtual vehicle driving. The innovative energy supply method and sensing mechanism are expected to open new avenues in the development of bionic neural devices.},

Recently, an innovative catalyst, composed of ruthenium single atoms (Ru 1 ) integrated with small Ru nanoclusters (Ru NC ), has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community. However, because of its complexity, this catalyst remains a topic of some debate. Here, a method is reported of precisely controlling the ratios of Ru 1 to Ru NC on a nitrogenated carbon (NC)-based porous organic framework to produce Ru/NC catalysts, by using different amounts (0, 5, 10 wt.%) of reducing agent. The Ru/NC–10 catalyst, formed with 10 wt.% reducing agent, delivered the best performance under alkaline conditions, indicating that Ru NC played a significant role in actual alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) system using the Ru/NC–10 catalyst required a significantly lower operating voltage (1.72 V) than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (1.95 V) to achieve 500 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the system can be operated at 100 mA cm −2 without notable performance decay for over 180 h. Theoretical calculations supported these experimental findings that Ru 1 contributed to the water dissociation process, while Ru NC is more actively associated with the hydrogen recombination process.},

  abstract     = {The incidence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. However, the underlying mechanism of the process of kidney stone formation and the kidney damage caused are not well understood. Here, it is observed that Lgals3, a β-galactoside-binding protein, is significantly increased in tissues with calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, and in both in vivo and in vitro models. Lgals3 expression is positively correlated with the deposition of CaOx crystals. Knockout of Lgals3 markedly reduces the deposition of CaOx crystal and renal fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, Lgals3 deficiency decrease the glycolytic rate and lactate production during the process of CaOx deposition and inhibited histone lactylation of H3K18la. Mechanistic studies shows that Lgals3 directly interacted with the key glycolysis protein pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and promoted its expression by modulating E3 ligase Trim21, preventing the ubiquitination of PKM2. Furthermore, H3K18 lactylation promoted CaOx crystal deposition and kidney injury in vivo and in vitro. Lgals3 deficiency inhibites the transcription, activation, and expression of FGFR4 through inhibition of H3K18la. These findings suggest that Lgals3 may play a key role in CaOx stone formation and kidney injury by interacting with PKM2 and promoting both H3K18la-mediated gene transcription and activation.},

Although β -Ga 2 O 3 has attracted extensive research interest in advanced electronics, its high-temperature and high-speed volatile memory applications in harsh environment has been largely overlooked. Herein, a high-performance hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterostructure junction field-effect transistor (HJFET) is fabricated, exhibiting an off-state current as low as ≈10 fA, a high on/off current ratio of ≈10 8 , a low contact resistance of 5.6 Ω·mm, and an impressive field-effect electron mobility of 156 cm 2 （Vs） −1 . Notably, the current h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET exhibits outstanding thermal reliability in the ultra-wide temperature range from 223 to 573 K, as well as long-term environmental stability in air, which confirms its inherent capability of operation in harsh environments. Moreover, the h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET demonstrates successful applications for accelerator-in-memory computing fields, including dynamic random-access memory structure and neural network computations. These superior characteristics position β -Ga₂O₃-based electronics as highly promising for applications in extreme environments, with particular relevance to the automotive, aerospace, and sensor sectors.},

However, many current machine learning methods lack interpretability, making it difficult to grasp the physical mechanisms behind various phenomena, which hampers progress in related fields. This study focuses on the Poisson&#39;s ratio of a hexagonal lattice elastic network as it varies with structural deformation. By employing the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN), the transition of the network&#39;s Poisson&#39;s ratio from positive to negative as the hexagonal structural element shifts from a convex polygon to a concave polygon was accurately predicted. The KAN provides a clear mathematical framework that describes this transition, revealing the connection between the Poisson&#39;s ratio and the geometric properties of the hexagonal element, and accurately identifying the geometric parameters at which the Poisson&#39;s ratio equals zero. This work demonstrates the significant potential of the KAN network to clarify the mathematical relationships that underpin physical responses and structural behaviors.},

This study enrolled 2279 patients across 12 centers and develops a novel multi-modality model integrating longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spatial habitat radiomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing for predicting pCR. By analyzing tumor subregions on multi-timepoint MRI, the model captures dynamic intra-tumoral heterogeneity during NAT. It shows superior performance over traditional radiomics, with areas under the curve of 0.863, 0.813, and 0.888 in the external validation, immunotherapy, and multi-omics cohorts, respectively. Subgroup analysis shows its robustness across varying molecular subtypes and clinical stages. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that high model scores correlate with increased immune activity, notably elevated B cell infiltration, indicating the biological basis of the imaging model. The integration of imaging and molecular data demonstrates promise in spatial habitat radiomics to monitor dynamic changes in tumor heterogeneity during NAT. In clinical practice, this study provides a noninvasive tool to accurately predict pCR, with the potential to guide treatment planning and improve breast-conserving surgery rates. Despite promising results, the model requires prospective validation to confirm its utility across diverse patient populations and clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {2D metal-chalcogenide nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibit promising photocatalysis properties due to their ultrathin morphology, high surface-to-volume ratio, and enhanced in-plane electron transport mobility. However, NPLs, especially cadmium chalcogenides, encounter challenges in CO 2 photoreduction due to insufficient solar energy utilization and fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Defect engineering offers a potential solution but often encounters difficulties maintaining structural integrity, mechanical stability, and electrical conductivity. Herein, by taking two monolayers (2ML) CdSe NPLs as a model system, selenium (Se) vacancies confined in atomic layers can enhance charge separation and conductivity. A straightforward approach to create Se vacancies in various monolayers CdSe NPLs (2, 4, and 5ML) has been developed, enabling efficient CO 2 photoreduction with a 4-fold increase in CO generation compared to their defect-free counterparts. Significantly, accounting for higher charge density and efficient carrier transport due to Se vacancies, defective 2ML CdSe NPLs (V Se -2ML CdSe) exhibit CO evolution performance up to 2557.5 µmol g − ¹ h − ¹ with no significant decay over 5 h, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of common semiconductor catalysts.

In terms of electrochemistry, this requires fast and stable kinetics for electrochemical reaction processes. Despite the great complexity of kinetics, it is clear that lithium-ion desolvation and a subsequent step of crossing through cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial to high-rate performance, in which the two key steps depend heavily on the working electrolyte formula. In this work, a customized electrolyte is developed to coordinate ion desolvation and interphase formation by introducing vinylene carbonate (VC), triphenylboroxin (TPBX), and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) but excluding ethylene carbonate (EC). Serving Ni-rich cathodes, the customized electrolyte generates a double-layered CEI, LiF-dominated inorganics inner layer, and ROCOOLi-dominated organics outer layer, which is not only stable and very efficient for lithium ion transport. Meanwhile, a -dominated solvation structure is induced and effectively decreases the desolvation energy to 29.72 kJ mol −1 , supporting fast lithium ion transport in the cathode interfacial processes. Consequently, the Ni-rich lithium-ion battery achieves a stable long cycle at a superior high rate of 10 C.},

  abstract     = {Although both Taurine Upregulated Gene 1(TUG1) and Human Antigen R (HuR) play significant regulatory roles in Cerebral Ischemic Reperfusion Injury (CIRI), their potential pro-angiogenesis mechanisms in CIRI remain unclear. Methods: Herein, the biological roles of TUG1 and HuR in angiogenesis are first confirmed. Following that, HuR-binding VEGFA mRNAs are identified via the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays. Actinomycin D and polysomal assays are also employed to confirm VEGFA mRNA stability. The co-localization of TUG1 with HuR is confirmed using FISH, while the RIP and RNA pull-down assays are employed to elucidate their interplay. The direct binding between TUG1 and HuR is confirmed through the CLIP assay. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and rescue experiments are performed to further elucidate TUG1-HuR interactions. Results: While TUG1 repressed angiogenesis and aggravated CIRI, HuR exerted contrary effects. Specifically, HuR bound directly to VEGFA mRNA, a phenomenon that enhanced VEGFA mRNA stability. Conversely, TUG1 binds to HuR directly, inhibiting its nuclear translocation and promoting its ubiquitination, ultimately reducing VEGFA mRNA stability. Conclusions: It is found that TUG1 can inhibit angiogenesis in CIRI through the HuR/VEGFA mRNA axis.},

Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) receptor EP4 is essential for cardiovascular homeostasis. This study aims to investigate the roles of cardiomyocyte (CM) and cardiac fibroblast (CF) EP4 in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis. By crossing the EP4 f/f mice with α-MyHC-Cre or S100A4-Cre mice, this work obtains the CM-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ ) or CF-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ ) mice. The mice of both genders are subcutaneously injected with ISO (5 mg kg −1 day −1 ) for 7 days. Compared to the control mice, both EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ and EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ mice show a significant improvement in cardiac diastolic function and fibrosis as assessed by echocardiography and histological staining, respectively. In the CMs, inhibition of EP4 suppresses ISO-induced TGF-β1 expression via blocking the cAMP/PKA pathway. In the CFs, inhibition of EP4 reversed TGF-β1-triggers production of ECM via preventing the formation of the TGF-β1/TGF-β receptor complex and blocks CF proliferation via suppressing the ERK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, double knockout of the CM- and CF-EP4 or administration of EP4 antagonist, grapiprant, markedly improves ISO-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction and fibrosis. Collectively, this study demonstrates that both CM-EP4 and CF-EP4 contribute to β-adrenergic activation-induced cardiac fibrosis. Targeting EP4 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for cardiac fibrosis.},

Here, microcosm experiments are performed with the bacterial feeding nematode Protorhabditis to explore the potential of nematodes in regulating microbial communities and thereby soil N 2 O emissions. Removal of nematodes by defaunation resulted in increased N 2 O emissions, with the removal of Protorhabditis contributing most to this increase. Further, inoculation with Protorhabditis altered bacterial community composition and increased the relative abundance of Bacillus , and the abundance of the nosZ gene in soil. In vitro experiments indicated that Protorhabditis reinforce the reduction in N 2 O emissions by Bacillus due to suppressing competitors and producing bacteria growth stimulating substances such as betaine. The results indicate that interactions between nematodes and bacteria modify N 2 O emissions providing the perspective for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions via manipulating trophic interactions in soil.},

In this paper, light-induced localized liquid secretion is demonstrated on the scale of tens of micrometers by a liquid crystal polymer coating with an alternating homeotropic-planar alignment. The light responsiveness is achieved by the incorporation of azobenzene derivative. The localization is achieved by applying regional through-thickness electric fields to the monomeric liquid crystals before polymerization. The polymerized coating preserves both homeotropic and planar alignment. Upon actuation, the liquid can be locally secreted from the homeotropic region while suppressed in the planar area. This method allows precise control over various secretion patterns based on different pre-designed electrodes, which paves the way for the development of responsive devices in a multitude of fields, such as targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, and microfluidic devices.},

  abstract     = {Stainless steel felt has been employed in AEMWE as a combination of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts and porous transport layers, which are not only easy to prepare but also have excellent OER activity under alkaline conditions. However, by realizing detailed electrochemical analysis and multi-scale visualization of the bubble behaviors, it is found that the combined effect of chemical and electrochemical corrosion led to the constant accumulation of metal oxides on the stainless steel fiber surface post-durability compared to the slow-growing hydroxides after initial activation. Moreover, the rougher fiber surface morphology and weaken hydrophilicity cause the adjacent bubbles are slower to detach from the electrode and are more likely to fusion. The measured diameter of bubbles leaving the electrode almost doubles, while the total number of bubbles decreases by about two-thirds, causing the increase of plug flow in the flow field and deteriorating the performance and long-term stability of AEMWE.},

Quercetin, one of the most important dietary flavonoids, is being explored as an effective therapy for obesity with its mechanism remains understudied. Here in this study, it is demonstrated that quercetin intervention significantly reverses obesity-related phenotypes through reshaping the overall structure of microbiota, especially boosting colonization of the beneficial gut commensal Akkermansia muciniphila ( A. muciniphila ). Enrichment of A. muciniphila leads to generate more indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) to upregulate the expression of 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) via fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)/ N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)/YTHDF2 manner, thereby facilitating cholesterol converts to cholic acid (CA). CA in turn drastically suppresses lipid accumulation via activating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in adipose tissue. This work introduces a novel therapeutic target for addressing obesity and expands upon the current limited understanding of the mediator function of m 6 A modifications in microorganism-influenced bile acid (BA) metabolism.},

However, the common pathogenicity of distinct viruses has rarely been studied. Here, it is shown that a plant-specific RAV-type transcription factor, OsRAV15, is specifically targeted by several distinct viral proteins for facilitating viral infection. OsRAV15 is found to activate jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated broad-spectrum antiviral immunity by physically associating with JA signaling essential components OsMYC2-OsJAZ complex. To facilitate viral infection, evolutionarily distinct viral proteins encoded by diverse rice viruses generally disrupt the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 complex to attenuate activation of JA signaling. Together, the results reveal a common counter-defense strategy used by different viruses to suppress the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 module that plays a vital role in fine-tuning JA-mediated antiviral defense.},

In this work, a model laser-fabricated rotating lattice Sb 2 S 3 crystal grown in stoichiometric glass is used to demonstrate fabrication of novel macroperiodic metastructures that utilize intrinsic lattice curvature superimposed with subtle crystallographic influences. The limited availability of slip systems drives the lattice curvature magnitude to vary with crystal growth direction, maximizing for lattices aligned with the predominant Burgers vector along with corresponding increases in dislocation density. Misaligned lattice orientations form smaller secondary lattice curvatures arising from misaligned Burgers vectors with further elastic contributions. Over extended crystal growth, these secondary components align the lattice to rotate about either the &lt;001&gt; or &lt;010&gt; crystal axes forming repeating metastructures of lattice orientation with periodicity 20–160 microns in length.

The experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the nanorods are welded through the facet-dependent atomic surface diffusion and rearrangement along {100} facets. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the preferred coalescence of two {100} surfaces is thermodynamically favorable.

Despite the facile design of DNA hybridization probes, their limited specificity poses challenges in clinical applications. Here, a differential reaction pathway probe (DRPP) based on a dynamic DNA reaction network is presented. DRPP leverages differences in reaction intermediate concentrations between SNV and WT groups, directing them into distinct reaction pathways. This generates a strong pulse-like signal for SNV and a weak unidirectional increase signal for wild-type (WT). Through the application of machine learning to fluorescence kinetic data analysis, the classification of SNV and WT signals is automated with an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly exceeding the 80.7% accuracy of conventional methods. Additionally, sensitivity for variant allele frequency (VAF) is enhanced down to 0.1%, representing a ten-fold improvement over conventional approaches. DRPP accurately identified D614G and N501Y SNVs in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 variants in patient swab samples with accuracy over 99% (n = 82). It determined the VAF of ovarian cancer-related mutations KRAS-G12R , NRAS-G12C , and BRAF-V600E in both tissue and blood samples (n = 77), discriminating cancer patients and healthy individuals with significant difference ( p &lt; 0.001).

This perspective examines the multifaceted biological principles that provide olfactory systems their discriminatory prowess, and how these ideas can be ported to the design of electronic noses for substantial improvements in performance across metrics such as sensitivity and ability to speciate chemical mixtures. The topics examined herein include the fluid dynamics of odorants in natural channels; specificity and kinetics of odorant interactions with olfactory receptors and mucus linings; complex signal processing that spatiotemporally encodes physicochemical properties of odorants; active sampling techniques, like biological sniffing and nose repositioning; biological priming; and molecular chaperoning. Each of these components of natural olfactory systems are systmatically investigated, as to how they have been or can be applied to electronic noses. While not all artificial sensors can employ these strategies simultaneously, integrating a subset of bioinspired principles can address issues like sensitivity, drift, and poor selectivity, offering advancements in many sectors such as environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and disease diagnostics.},

This phenomenon provides a potential basis for the development of treatment strategies for tissue damage and degeneration. This study aims to evaluate whether mitochondria isolated from osteoblasts can promote osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mitochondria from MSCs, which primarily utilize glycolysis, are compared with those from MG63 cells, which depend on oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria from both cell types are then encapsulated in cationic liposomes and transferred to MSCs, and their impact on differentiation is assessed. Mitochondria delivery from MG63 cells to MSCs grown in both two- and three-dimensional cultures results in increased expression of osteogenic markers, including Runt-related transcription factor 2, Osterix, and Osteopontin, and upregulation of genes involved in Bone morphogenetic protein 2 signaling and calcium import. This is accompanied by increased calcium influx and regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Transplantation of spheroids containing MSCs with MG63-derived mitochondria in bone defect animal models improves bone regeneration. The results suggest that delivery of MG63-derived mitochondria effectively guides MSCs toward osteogenesis, paving the way for the development of mitochondria-transplantation therapies.},

In contrast, an increase in the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition module after radiotherapy in both relapse groups is observed. Cell–cell interactions, drug-target expression analyses in malignant cells after radiation, and multiplex immunofluorescence of tumor tissue identified interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) as a potential therapeutic target.

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major factor contributing to poor treatment outcomes. This resistance markedly affects the effectiveness of surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy and leads to post-surgical tumor recurrence. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM is crucial for understanding its progression and improving therapeutic options. This study found that moesin (MSN) acts as a key promotor of chemoradiotherapy resistance in glioma stem cells (GSCs), enhancing their proliferation and stemness maintenance. Mechanistically, MSN activates the downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, driving the proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) in GSCs. This process enhances the repair of DNA damage caused by radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), thereby increasing the resistance of GSCs to chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, GNE-317, a small molecule drug capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, specifically inhibits MSN and suppresses the activation of downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling. Importantly, the combination of GNE-317 with RT and TMZ exhibits a strong synergistic effect both in vivo and in vitro, achieving better efficacy compared to the traditional combination of RT and TMZ. This study not only advances understanding of the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM but also provides a promising new approach for enhancing treatment outcomes.},

In this study, pancreatic lesions in patients diagnosed as either type 1 AIP or type 2 AIP are examined, and these patients’ peripheral blood at single-cell level. Furthermore, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and functional assays are performed to verify the identified cell subtypes. In type 1 AIP, there is a notable increase in the amount of B cells and plasma cells, and IgG4+ plasma cells are key pathogenic cells of AIP. The differentiation path of naïve-stage B cells into IgG4+ produced plasma cells is observed, and an increased amount of T helper cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. This study also reveals that HIF-1α, an activated transcriptional factor, can directly bind to promoter site of NAMPT, promoting higher levels of visfatin production in HIF1A+ classical monocytes.

  abstract     = {The coordination of public and private goods production is essential for bacterial adaptation to environmental changes. Quorum sensing (QS) regulates this balance by mediating the trade-off between the communal benefits of “public goods,” such as siderophores and antibiotics, and the individual metabolic needs fulfilled by “private goods,” such as intracellular metabolites utilized for growth and survival. Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 harbors a LasI/LasR-type QS system, MupI/MupR, which regulates mupirocin production through signaling molecules. This study explores how QS coordinates carbon and nitrogen metabolism to optimize the production of key secondary metabolites, including 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), mupirocin, and siderophores, which serve as public goods. Loss of QS disrupts this balance by enhancing the Krebs cycle, denitrification, pyruvate anaplerosis, and ammonium assimilation, lead to halted 2,4-DAPG and mupirocin synthesis and increased siderophore production. In the absence of QS, elevated siderophore production compensates for iron acquisition, ensuring rapid cellular growth. Under nutrient-limited or high cell density conditions, MupR regulates carbon and nitrogen fluxes to sustain public goods production. These findings highlight QS as a key environmental sensor that fine-tunes resource allocation, bacterial fitness, and adaptation to ecological and nutritional conditions, suggesting the potential for QS-targeted approaches to enhance antibiotic production and agricultural sustainability.},

  abstract     = {The adult mammalian heart has limited regenerative capacity to replace lost tissue after a major injury. Forkhead box P1 (Foxp1) regulates embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart development. However, whether Foxp1 participates in postnatal-injury cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration remains unclear. This study demonstrates that Foxp1 is downregulated at border zone cardiomyocytes of both neonatal apical resection and adult myocardial infarction. Analysis of the Single-cell transcriptome database reveals reduced Foxp1 expression in the cardiomyocyte population with high regenerative capacity. Cardiomyocyte-Foxp1 loss-of-function significantly promotes, whereas cardiomyocytes-Foxp1 gain-of-function suppresses cardiomyocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, Foxp1 directly regulates ubiquitin specific peptidase 20 (USP20), a de-ubiquitinase that prevents hypoxia inducible factor 1ɑ (HIF1α) degradation. Thus, Foxp1 regulates HIF1α and downstream heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1 (Hand1) to control the cardiomyocyte proliferation via metabolic transition from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. Finally, cardiac type troponin T2 (cTnT)-promoter-driven adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) for Hand1 induction in cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiac regeneration and functional recovery. These findings may provide novel molecular strategies to promote heart regeneration and therapeutic interventions for heart failure.},

  abstract     = {Doxorubicin, an anthracycline commonly used for treating cancer patients, is known for its cardiotoxic side-effects. Although dose-dependent, but susceptibility remains variable among patients, and childhood-exposure-adult-onset remains challenging. Besides topoisomerase toxicity, Doxorubicin is also toxic to the mitochondria yet the underlying late onset mechanism remains elusive. Here, it is observed that the mitochondrial copy number in PBMCs of patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy is negatively correlated with the change in plasma BNP levels after treatment. Isogenic hiPSC-CMs are generated with high, norm, and low mitochondrial copy numbers using mitochondrial transplantation and the YFP-Parkin system. Remarkably, lower mitochondria copy number translates to lower IC 50 , suggesting increased susceptibility. Mitochondria supplementation by intramyocardial injection prevents doxorubicin induced heart failure. Mechanistically, doxorubicin treatment leads to mPTP opening and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. This mtDNA leakage event activates the cGAS-STING pathway and drives inflammation and myocardial senescence. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Sting (Myh6-Cre/Sting flox/flox ; Sting CKO ) and over expression of mitochondrial tagged DNase1 in mice partially rescue doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. In conclusion, the work establishes a negative correlation between cardiomyocyte mitochondrial copy number and doxorubicin toxicity. Molecularly, it is demonstrated that mtDNA leakage activates cGAS-STING pathway and accelerates myocardial dysfunction. These insights offer new co-administration strategies for cancer patients.},

Although several key plasmid elements that balance mcr-1 persistence and bacterial growth are identified, the regulatory interactions between mcr-1 and host bacteria remain poorly understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi crRNA library, it is identified that DNA polymerase IV, dinB , is essential for controlling the fitness cost associated with mcr-1 in Escherichia coli . The absence of dinB operon enhances mcr-1 -mediated colistin resistance but simultaneously compromises bacterial growth and competitiveness. Meanwhile, dinB deficiency mitigates inflammatory response in RAW267.4 cells and enhances bacterial colonization in murine tissues. Further investigation reveals that mcr-1 actively upregulates dinB expression, with the increased reactive oxygen species induced by mcr-1 being crucial for this activation.   These findings suggest that dinB modulates mcr expression and bacterial fitness via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. Leveraging this regulatory relationship, a Toxin-Intein is engineered under the control of dinB promoter to selectively target and kill mcr -positive E. coli both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the work uncovers a novel adaptive mechanism underlying mcr persistence and provides a precise antimicrobial strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Metastasis remains a significant challenge in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) in HCC is still uncertain, although it has been reported to have contradictory effects on some cancers. Here, it is demonstrated that RNASET2 knockout leads to significant accumulation of cholesterol, which in turn promotes MET-mediated HCC metastasis. Mechanistically, the absence of RNASET2 hinders the degradation of RNA into uridine, thereby reducing the conversion to UTP. This reduction restrains glucuronate metabolism and the expression of the related enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol due to decreased formation of glucuronidated-bile acids. The administration of cholesterol induces the migration and invasion of HCC cells through MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) activation. However, the deficiency of RNASET2-induced HCC metastasis can be reversed by blocking MET with shRNA or savolitinib. The study identifies RNASET2 as a key regulator that coordinates RNA, glucuronate, and cholesterol metabolism. Its deficiency drives HCC metastasis through cholesterol-triggered MET activation. These findings highlight the potential of targeting RNASET2 and MET in improving the prognosis of HCC.},

  abstract     = {Targeting cholesterol metabolism is a novel direction for tumor therapy. Unfortunately, the current use of statins for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Herein, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) is identified as a novel target for treating HCC and a potential alternative to statins. Twenty-three key genes in cholesterol biosynthesis are screened, and FDFT1 is identified via public databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, International Cancer Genome Consortium and Gene Expression Omnibus). Clinical samples reveal that FDFT1 is highly expressed in HCC tissues, and this phenotype is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally, FDFT1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells and suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo, whereas FDFT1 overexpression promotes HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, FDFT1 downregulation decreases cholesterol and bile acid levels and then increases hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) transcriptional activity. Experiments indicate that HNF4A combines with the promoter of aldolase B ( ALDOB) and promotes the ALDOB transcription and that ALDOB combines with AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and inhibits AKT1 phosphorylation. Moreover, FDFT1 knockdown combined with AKT inhibitor (AZD5363) treatment shows remarkable therapeutic potential. FDFT1 inhibition reduces cholesterol and bile acid levels to delay HCC progression through the HNF4A/ALDOB/AKT1 axis. Thus, targeting FDFT1 may be a novel potential strategy for treating HCC.},

The prognostic significance of circMETTL6 is assessed using RNA in situ hybridization. Functional studies involving circMETTL6 overexpression are performed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations are performed using RNA-seq, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, protein degradation assay and dual-luciferase reporter assays. circMETTL6 is significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer, and its lower expression correlates with worse prognosis. Overexpression of circMETTL6 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cell in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, circMETTL6 recruited the non-POU domain containing octamer binding protein (NONO) by binding to its Coiled-coil domain and disrupted its binding with RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), and consequently inhibiting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) transcription, thereby suppressing ovarian cancer progression.

Here, the non-conventional oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is genetically engineered to enhance MA production. Initially, the malonyl-CoA pathway, comprising a malonyl-CoA hydrolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is confirmed as the most efficient for MA production in Y. lipolytica . To further enhance MA production, two novel malonyl-CoA hydrolases exhibiting higher activity than the hydrolase from S. cerevisiae , are identified from Y. lipolytica and Fusarium oxysporum , respectively. The introduction of the malonyl-CoA hydrolase from F. oxysporum increases the MA titer to 6.3 g L −1 . Subsequently, advanced metabolic engineering strategies are performed to ensure a sufficient flux of the precursors acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA for MA production, resulting in a production of 13.8 g L −1 MA in shaking-flasks. Finally, by employing the fermentation conditions and feeding strategies, a maximum concentration of 63.6 g L −1 of MA is achieved at 156 h with a productivity of 0.41 g L −1 h −1 in fed-batch fermentation.

Herein, a strategy is reported for the direct visualization of VOCs sensing by mimicking human olfactory function and integrating colorimetric COF-on-MOF sensors with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted data analysis techniques. The Dye@Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework@Covalent Organic Framework (Dye@ZIF-8@COF) sensor takes advantage of the highly porous structure of MOF core and hydrophobic nature of the COF shell, enabling highly sensitive colorimetric sensing of trace number of VOCs. The Dye@ZIF-8@COF sensor exhibits exceptional sensitivity to VOCs at sub-parts per million levels and demonstrates excellent humidity resistance (under 20–90% relative humidity), showing great promise for practical applications. Importantly, AI-assisted information fusion and perceptual analysis greatly promote the accuracy of the VOCs sensing processes, enabling direct visualization and classification of seven stages of matcha drying processes with a superior accuracy of 95.74%.

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with oxidative stress and redox signaling disruption. It is recently reported that proautophagic autophagy/beclin-1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1) is a positive modulator of the NF-κB pathway that promotes intestinal inflammation. However, its effect on intestinal redox state and whether AMBRA1 is regulated by oxidative stress remain unknown. In this study, it is found that AMBRA1 functions as a pro-oxidative factor that increases oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the N-terminal F1 domain is required for AMBRA1 to competitively interact with the N-terminal domain of NRF2, thereby antagonizing the interaction between deubiquitinating protein 3 (DUB3) and NRF2, suppressing DUB3-mediated NRF2 deubiquitination, and leading to NRF2 degradation. In response to H 2 O 2 stimulation, the interaction between AMBRA1 and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is enhanced, facilitating USP7 to deubiquitinate AMBRA1 at K83 and K86 and stabilize AMBRA1. Notably, the USP7 inhibitor, P5091, inhibits oxidative stress and colitis in vivo. Elevated AMBRA1 expression in inflamed colon tissues from ulcerative colitis patients is negatively correlated with decreased NRF2 protein levels. Overall, this study identifies AMBRA1 as a pro-oxidative factor in IECs and provides a redox-modulating therapeutic strategy for targeting USP7/AMBRA1 in IBD.},

  abstract     = {A major characteristic of ovarian cancer (OC) is its unique route of metastasis via ascites. The immune microenvironment in ascites remains understudied, leaving the mechanism of ascites-mediated abdominal metastasis obscure. Here, a single-cell transcriptomic landscape of CD45 + immune cells across multiple anatomical sites is depicted, including primary tumors, metastatic lesions, and ascites, from patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). A novel subset of perilipin 2 high (PLIN2 hi ) macrophages are identified that are enriched in ascites and positively correlated with OC progression, hence being designated as “ascites-associated macrophages (AAMs)”. AAMs are lipid-loaded with overexpression of the lipid droplet protein PLIN2. Overexpression or suppression of PLIN2 can enhance or inhibit tumor cell migration, invasion, and vascular permeability in vitro, which is also confirmed in vivo. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that PLIN2 boosts HIF1α/SPP1 signaling in macrophages, thereby exerting pro-tumor functions. Finally, a PLIN2-targeting liposome is designed to efficiently suppress ascites production and tumor metastasis. Taken together, this work provides a comprehensive characterization of the cancer-promoting function and lipid-rich property of ascites-enriched PLIN2 hi macrophages, establishes a link between lipid metabolism and hypoxia within the context of the ascites microenvironment, and elucidates the pivotal role of ascites in trans-coelomic metastasis of OC.},

  abstract     = {Textured Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ bulk ceramic membranes are fabricated via slip casting in a 0.9 T magnetic field generated by neodymium magnets. This process aligns the oxide grains with their easy-magnetization c -axis parallel to the applied magnetic field. Depending on the magnetic field&#39;s direction relative to the slip casting, grains orient either with their a , b -plane or c -axis parallel to the normal direction of the disk-shaped ceramic, thus aligning with the oxygen permeation direction. Without the magnetic field, a non-textured bulk membrane is formed. The microstructure and texture of the ceramic membranes are meticulously analyzed using advanced techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as related methods. Evaluation of the texturing effect on the oxygen permeation performance shows that the a , b -plane textured Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ bulk membrane achieves the highest oxygen permeation fluxes between 1023–1223 K. Additionally, it demonstrates impressive CO₂ stability, maintaining effective performance for at least 140 h due to preferential oxygen transport along the a , b -plane. These characteristics make Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ an auspicious material for industrial applications as an oxygen transport membrane, outperforming more susceptible perovskite-based materials. Magnetic alignment thus proves to be an effective method for achieving membrane texturing, enabling precise regulation of oxygen transport properties.},

Amphiphilic particles have been shown to spontaneously capture aqueous droplets within their cavities upon mixing with an immiscible oil phase, where each particle templates a single droplet. Here, an amphiphilic microparticle with four discrete hydrophilic patches embedded at the inner corners of a square-shaped hydrophobic outer ring of the particle (4C particle) is fabricated. Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations predict droplet formation dynamics and differing equilibrium conditions depending on the patterning configuration. Experiments recapitulate equilibrium conditions, enabling tunable dropicle configurations with reproducible volumes down to ≈200 pL templated by the amphiphilic particles. The dropicle configurations depend predominantly on the size of the hydrophilic patches of the 4C particles. This validates that the modeling approach can inform the design of dropicles with varying volumes and numbers per particle, which can be harnessed in new amplified bioassays for greater sensitivity, dynamic range, and statistical confidence.},

  abstract     = {Older individuals experience increased susceptibility and mortality to bacterial infections, but the underlying etiology remains unclear. Herein, it is shown that aging-associated reduction of commensal Parabacteroides goldsteinii ( P. goldsteinii ) in both aged mice and humans critically contributes to worse outcomes of bacterial infection. The colonization of live P. goldsteinii conferred protection against aging-associated bacterial infections. Metabolomic profiling reveals a protective compound, apigenin, generated by P. goldsteinii , antagonizes bacterial clearance defects in aged mice. AMP-binding protein ( ampB ) is identified as a key gene involved in apigenin synthesis in P. goldsteinii using homologous recombination in bacteria. Mechanistically, apigenin binds directly to the potential sites on Fgr (M341 and D404), preventing its inhibitory role on Vav1 phosphorylation, and therefore promoting the activation of Cdc42/Rac1, Arp2/3 expression and subsequent actin reorganization, which contributes to the enhanced phagocytosis of macrophages to bacteria. Collectively, the findings suggest that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may impair host defense mechanisms and increase susceptibility to bacterial infections in older adults and highlight the microbiota-apigenin-Fgr axis as a possible route to ameliorate aging-associated antibacterial defects.},

  abstract     = {Innate immune activation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, involving cGAMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), has emerged as a key mediator of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanisms through which cGAS activation influences AD progression remain poorly understood. In this study, we observed significant up-regulation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway in AD. Notably, this increase is primarily attributed to microglia, rather than non-microglial cell types. Using an inducible, microglia-specific cGAS knockout mouse model in the 5xFAD background, we demonstrated that deleting microglial cGAS at the onset of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology profoundly restricts plaque accumulation and protects mice from Aβ-induced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, our study revealed cGAS promotes plaque-associated microglia accumulation and is essential for inflammasome activation. Moreover, we showed that restricting cGAS-mediated innate immunity is crucial for preserving inter-cellular communication in the brain and induces pleiotrophin, a neuroprotective factor. These findings offer novel insights into the specific roles of the innate immune system in AD employing a cell-type-specific approach. The conclusions provide a foundation for targeted interventions to modulate the microglial cGAS-STING signaling pathway, offering promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Suppressing the non-radiative loss in the organic solar cells (OSCs) through molecular design remains a significant challenge. Typically, triplet state of organic semiconductors is lower than the charge transfer (CT) state, contributing to substantial non-radiative loss via the triplet state. Herein, a set of terpolymers is prepared by introducing a simple Pt complex block into the PM6 polymer backbone. These metalated terpolymers exhibit high triplet energy ( E T1 ) and small singlet–triplet energy gap (∆ E ST ), facilitating fast intersystem crossing (ISC) process to generate triplet excitons. Consequently, the metalated terpolymers show enhanced exciton lifetime and diffusion length, and most importantly, effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination via terminal triplet loss channels. Moreover, the Pt complex modifies the molecular aggregation of the polymer, hence optimizing the morphology of the active blends. The PM6-Pt1:L8-BO devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.54% (certified as 18.32%), the highest reported for metalated terpolymers to date. The PCE is further increased to a record high 19.24% in the PM6-Pt1:PM6:L8-BO (0.8:0.2:1.2, wt/wt/wt) ternary devices.

A novel 119-amino-acid protein, NLRP12-119aa is identified, encoded by the circular RNA circNLRP12, that effectively disrupts the formation of rhabdovirus RNP complexes through two distinct mechanisms and significantly reduces their replication. NLRP12-119aa exhibits a strong affinity for the conserved 18-nucleotide sequence at the start of the leader RNA of rhabdoviruses VSV, SCRV, and RABV, outcompeting their native N protein interactions, thereby disrupting the assembly of RNP complexes and inhibiting viral replication. NLRP12-119aa exerts anti-rhabdoviral effects by directly binding to the viral N protein, leading to its destabilization and accelerated degradation, and consequently hindering the formation of the viral RNP complex. To assess the therapeutic potential of circNLRP12 against rhabdovirus infections, a zebrafish model of VSV infection is established and noted a substantial reduction in viral load after-treatment with circNLRP12, as well as the recovery of spleen&#39;s to a normalized state from its previously enlarged and hemorrhagic state. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel dual anti-RNP assembly strategy mediated by NLRP12-119aa, offering valuable insights for further exploration and clinical management of rhabdoviral infections.},

While most work has focused on densely covered Pickering emulsions, such emulsions are known to retain stability even when the interfaces are sparsely covered with particles. Here, the formation, dynamics, and stability of poorly covered model Pickering emulsions are studied in a controlled manner by utilizing a microfluidic platform. The formed Pickering emulsions remain highly stable, over at least 12 h, even with a surface area coverage below 3%. By directly visualizing the droplet interface at various stages, the exceptional stability is attributed to the highly spatially heterogeneous distribution of adsorbed particles which exclusively form particle bridges at the contact point between the droplets. Remarkably, these bridges are assembled in the form of crowns between the droplet interfaces, as visualized by confocal microscopy. The assembly behavior of the adsorbed particles in response to hydrodynamic forces and the formation of non-uniform particle distribution are discussed by analyzing the different forces present during emulsification, corroborated by numerical simulations. In conclusion, using a lab-on-a-chip approach, this work provides further understanding toward the fabrication of Pickering emulsions via preferential interfacial localization of particles.},

  abstract     = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent bone marrow disorder. The challenges in managing MM include selecting chemotherapy regimens that effectively modulate the myeloma microenvironment and delivering them to the bone marrow with high efficacy and minimal toxicity. Herein, a novel bone marrow targeting strategy using c(RGDfk) peptide-modified liposomes loaded with chemotherapeutics is developed, which can specifically recognize and hitchhike neutrophils following systemic administration, capitalizing on their natural aging process to facilitate precise drug delivery to the bone marrow, thus minimizing off-target effects. On the one hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes containing carfilzomib (CRLPs) successfully transformed macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype, enhancing immunotherapeutic responses. On the other hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes encapsulating BMS-202 (BRLPs), a small molecule checkpoint inhibitor, interrupted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and promoted the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. The co-administration of CRLPs and BRLPs successfully delivered drugs to bone marrow, leading to significant modulation of the myeloma microenvironment, reduced tumor growth, and improved survival time of MM-bearing mouse models. These findings introduced an alternative approach to modulating the myeloma microenvironment and underscored the efficacy of hitchhiking neutrophils for bone marrow drug delivery. This strategy show advantages over traditional drug delivery methods in terms of improved efficacy and lowered toxicity.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is a promising anti-tumor therapeutic strategy; however, its efficacy in solid tumors is limited. Chromosome missegregation is common in various solid tumors; however, its role in tumor progression remains poorly understood, and its correlation with ICI is yet to be explored. Here, it is found that increased chromosome missegregation promotes tumor immune microenvironment, and eventually immunotherapeutic efficacy, by triggering pyroptosis. yin yang 2 (YY2) is identified as a mitotic checkpoint regulator, which promotes chromosome missegregation by upregulating BUB1B transcription. Increased chromosome missegregation promoted the formation of micronuclei and release of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into the cytosol, triggering an AIM2-mediated cytosolic dsDNA response. The subsequent pyroptosis strengthened the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing immunoinfiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, while preventing their exhaustion. Finally, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that combining YY2 overexpression-induced chromosome missegregation/cytosolic dsDNA response and PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced the efficacy of ICI immunotherapy in microsatellite instable and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer cells. Together, these findings provide new insights on the role of chromosome missegregation in triggering cytosolic dsDNA response-mediated pyroptosis and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, suggesting a novel strategy for improving ICI therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer.},

  abstract     = {Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AS-AIH) is characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis, with a current lack of effective targeted treatments. Stem cell therapy has demonstrated significant therapeutic promise across various autoimmune diseases. However, the intricate pathogenesis of AS-AIH has hindered the widespread utilization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in this domain. Herein, it is demonstrated that necroptosis, as the primary mode of cell death in AIH, is crucial in causing AS-AIH. Inflammatory macrophages are the primary cell population involved in necroptosis. Inhibition of the specificity protein 1/sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine-1-phosphate (SP1/SK1/S1P) axis is responsible for this phenomenon, leading to excessive activation of the intrahepatic immune system and aggravating liver damage. Furthermore, the S1P/S1PR2/YAP axis is the key pathway in initiating liver regeneration during AS-AIH. S1P synthesized by hepatocytes is the primary source, and this process is also regulated by the SP1/SK1 axis. MSCs promote S1P synthesis by macrophages through the delivery of SP1, which inhibits necroptosis and synergistically enhances liver regeneration. In addition, MSCs also promote S1P synthesis in hepatocytes through the same mechanism, further aiding liver regeneration. These findings unveil the core pathogenesis of AS-AIH and provide a theoretical foundation for using MSCs as a potential targeted therapeutic modality.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly resistant to ferroptosis, which hinders the application of anti-ferroptosis therapy. Through drug screening, it is found that histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) significantly sensitized CRC to ferroptosis. The combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers synergically suppresses CRC growth both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, HDACi reduces ferroptosis suppressor protein (FSP1) by promoting its mRNA degradation. Specifically, it is confirmed that HDACi specifically targets HDAC1 and promotes the H3K27ac modification of fat mass- and obesity-associated gene (FTO) and AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase (ALKBH5), which results in significant activation of FTO and ALKBH5. The activation of FTO and ALKBH5 reduces N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification on FSP1 mRNA, leading to its degradation. Crucially, lactylation of HDAC1 K412 is essential for ferroptosis regulation. Both Vorinostat (SAHA) and Trichostatin A (TSA) notably diminish HDAC1 K412 lactylation in comparison to other HDAC1 inhibitors, exhibiting a consistent trend of increasing susceptibility to ferroptosis. In conclusion, the research reveals that HDACi decreases HDAC1 K412 lactylation to sensitize CRC to ferroptosis and that the combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers can be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC.},

However, there is a need to develop multiplexed assays capable of analyzing multiple genes simultaneously to expand its application. To address this, a multiplexed RT-qPCR using a double emulsion (DE)-based carrier and a polymer microparticle reactor, termed primer-incorporated network tailored with Taqman probe (TaqPIN) is developed. The DE securely stores nucleic acid reagents like primers and probes within the polymer network until heating releases them for the reaction. The TaqPIN RT-qPCR demonstrates an amplification efficiency of 93.8% and can detect as few as 20 copies/µL. By loading the multiple microparticles into a single reaction, a multiplexed assay with only one optical channel is enabled. In practice, a nine-plex assay is designed to distinguish between variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even subtle variations of a single nucleotide can be simultaneously detected. Testing on 75 nasopharyngeal swab samples yields 100% sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection and 94% accuracy in variant discrimination.},

  abstract     = {The immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic cancer, characterized by low tumor-specific T cells and excessive fibrosis, limits the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here, three datasets and multi-immunofluorescence staining of tissue microarrays in pancreatic cancer indicate that mesothelin (MSLN) expression negatively correlates with cytotoxic T cells in tumor. Anti-MSLN antibody ( α MSLN) treatment of pancreatic cancer in vivo can significantly increase T cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the combination of α MSLN and neoantigen peptide vaccine identified from pancreatic cancer cell lines is demonstrated to be more effective in inducing neoantigen-specific T cell generation and infiltration at subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models for enhancing antitumor efficacy. Single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that the combined treatment significantly reduces the proportion of fibroblasts, improves the infiltration of IFN- γ + CD4 + and GZMK + CD8 + T cells, as well as reduces the interaction of antigen presentation-associated ligands and receptors between antigen-presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (apCAFs) and naive CD4 + T cells. The negative correlations between apCAFs and CD8 + T cells/IFN- γ + CD4 + T cells are further confirmed in human pancreatic cancer tissues. Overall, this study demonstrates that targeting MSLN can improve neoantigen vaccine induced immune efficacy by reducing apCAFs to interrupt the conversion of naive CD4 + T cells to Tregs, and therefore increase the infiltration of tumor-specific T cells.},

A sequence-enhanced parallel convolutional neural network is developed and generated a dataset through finite element simulations. This DL model enables high-precision prediction of hydrogel deformation. Furthermore, a progressive evolutionary algorithm (PEA) is proposed by integrating the DL model to construct a DL-PEA framework. This framework supports rapid reverse engineering of the desired shape, and the average design time for specified target shapes is reduced to ≈3.04 s. The present findings illustrate how 4D printing of optimized hydrogel designs can effectively transform in response to environmental stimuli.

This study proposes the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating CRISPR RNAs as an in vivo screening tool for ICPs in a syngeneic model of mesenchymal GSCs. Using PD-L1 and CD47 to validate the proof of concept, intratumoral administration of LNPs in orthotopic tumors achieved efficient editing of ICPs, leading to enhanced immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Targeting CD47 reduced tumor growth, suggesting improved cancer cell sensitization to the immune system post-ICP editing. The study positions LNPs as a robust tool for in vivo validation of ICPs as therapeutic targets in clinically relevant GBM models.

  abstract     = {Re-epithelialization constitutes a critical stage in the intricate process of wound healing, yet its mechanisms in the context of diabetic wounds remain elusive. In this study, the role of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) vis-à-vis the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of keratinocytes in diabetic wound re-epithelialization is investigated. The findings reveal an impediment in the MET process, rather than EMT, which significantly compromised re-epithelialization in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, Desmoplakin ( DSP ) gene expression, encoding a key desmosome protein, is down-regulated in diabetic rats. This down-regulation coincided with aberrant hypo-demethylation of the DSP promoter. The inhibition of DSP expression is linked to reduced occupancy of Ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET3) at the DSP promoter, consequently suppressing TET3-dependent DNA demethylation. Additionally, a novel lncRNA termed DSP-AS1is identified, which is antisense to DSP . Notably, DSP-AS1 expression is down-regulated in diabetic skin wounds, and it interacted with TET3, a DNA demethylase. Notably, DSP-AS1 is found to form R-loops, triple-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids, at the DSP promoter, facilitating TET3 localization to the DSP promoter. Collectively, the findings suggest that reduced R-loop formation by DSP-AS1 impairs DSP gene transcription by repressing TET3-mediated DNA demethylation. This disruption of the orchestrated re-epithelialization process contributes to refractory diabetic wound healing.},

In drug screening, the framework illustrates the inhibitory effects of memantine on endogenous channels, and antagonistic interactions among potassium, magnesium, and calcium ion channels. For nanomatrix-induced differentiation, the classifier indicates the effects of differentiation conditions on sodium and potassium channels associated with action potentials, validating the functional properties of differentiated neurons for Parkinson&#39;s disease treatment.

Unraveling the major regulatory programs underlying MP patterned malignancy offers opportunities to identify more feasible therapeutic targets for patients with MP LUAD. This study shows that patients with MP subtype LUAD have aberrant activation of the MYC pathway compared to patients with other subtypes. In vitro and xenograft mouse model studies reveal that MP pattern in malignancy cannot be solely due to aberrant MYC expression but requires the involvement of M2-like macrophages. Excessively expressed MYC leads to the accumulation of M2-like macrophages from the bone marrow, which secretes TGFβ, to induce the expression of FOSL2 in tumor cells, thereby remodeling chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of MP-pattern genes to promote the MYC-mediated de novo transcriptional regulation of these genes. Additionally, the MP-pattern in malignancy can be effectively alleviated by disrupting the TGFβ-FOSL2 axis. These findings reveal new functions for the M2-like macrophage-TGFβ-FOSL2 axis in MYC-overexpressing MP-subtype LUAD, identifying targetable vulnerabilities in this pathway.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, targeting programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), has exhibited amazing clinical outcomes in various types of cancers. However, only a small portion of patients benefit from ICB therapy, indicating that the mechanism underlying immune checkpoint is still unclear. Here, it is reported that motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1), a homeobox domain-containing transcription factor, contributes to the tumor immune escape. MNX1 increases PD-L1 expression in cancer cells by stabilizing PD-L1 mRNA rather than activating transcription. Mechanistically, MNX1 exists in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and interacts with Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), a multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein, to enhance the binding of YBX1 to PD-L1 mRNA. MNX1 ablation activates cytotoxic T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and sensitizes CTLA-4 blockade therapy. Moreover, MNX1 also facilitates tumor progression in an immune-independent manner in cancer cells. In addition, MNX1 is upregulated by its adjacent long non-coding RNA MNX1-AS1 via HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (HERC2). Together, these results reveal MNX1 as a novel immune checkpoint regulator with promising therapeutic potential.},

  abstract     = {To efficiently capture, activate, and transform small molecules, metalloenzymes have evolved to integrate a well-organized pocket around the active metal center. Within this cavity, second coordination sphere functionalities are precisely positioned to optimize the rate, selectivity, and energy cost of catalytic reactions. Inspired by this strategy, an artificial distal pocket defined by a preorganized 3D strap is introduced on an iron-porphyrin catalyst ( sc-Fe ) for the CO 2 -to-CO electrocatalytic reduction. Combined electrochemical, kinetic, and computational studies demonstrate that the adequate positioning of a carboxylate/carboxylic group acting in synergy with a trapped water molecule within this distal pocket remarkably enhances the reaction turnover frequency (TOF) by four orders of magnitude compared to the perfluorinated iron-tetraphenylporphyrin catalyst ( F 20 Fe ) operating at a similar low overpotential. A proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is found to be the key process responsible for the unexpected protonation of the coordinating carboxylate, which, upon CO 2 insertion, shifts from the first to the second coordination sphere to play a possible secondary role as a proton relay.},

  abstract     = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role in wound healing. They act as crucial signaling molecules and antimicrobial agents when present at moderate levels. However, excessive levels of ROS can hinder the healing process for individuals with diabetes. As a result, targeting ROS levels to maintain redox balance has become a promising strategy for improving wound recovery. Currently, no biomaterials have been reported to simultaneously up-regulate and down-regulate ROS to achieve broad-spectrum antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Inspired by the site-dependent effect of nanomaterials, a micron-sized ferroferric oxide (Fe 3 O 4 )/MXene (FM) heterojunction is synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The FM heterojunction could scavenge extracellular ROS by activating catalase (CAT)-like and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like nanozyme activities. Meanwhile, FM heterojunction could release ferric ions and ferrous ions by defect engineering to induce bacterial ferroptosis, up-regulating intercellular ROS, and lipid peroxidation. For applications in vivo, FM heterojunction is incorporated into the tips of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based microneedle (termed as GFM microneedle) using a two-step casting technique. The results showed that GFM microneedle combined with photothermal therapy could improve S. aureus -infected skin regeneration in diabetic rats. The effectiveness and safety of GFM microneedle are not less favorable than that of a commercial wound dressing. This study provides a proof-of-concept for heterojunction-mediated regenerative medicine via a site-dependent ROS-targeting strategy.},

Diverse reducing agents for Li supplements, such as quinone molecules, have been considered to homogenize the Li distribution in the cathode materials obtained after cycling; however, the detailed reaction mechanism is still unknown. Herein, the ideal electrochemical potential factor and reaction mechanism of the redox mediator 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone (DTBQ) for the chemical relithiation of high-Ni-layered cathodes are elucidated. Here, 100% efficiency of DTBQ-assisted chemical relithiation is achieved by adjusting the direct immersion time of Li-deficient cathode electrodes. The reversible reaction features of the physical and chemical structures of both the regenerated cathodes and the DTBQ molecules are investigated using advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations. These findings emphasize the potential of redox-mediator-assisted chemical relithiation for realizing direct recycling processes and offer a facile and sustainable solution for battery recycling.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous clusters are gaining prominence as prospective hosts for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs), but their efficacy is still affected by atomic coordination. Optimization of ion storage and charge transport can be achieved through high coordination and bimetallic configurations. Herein, high-coordination amorphous P 6 -Nb-W-P 5 (Nb/W-P) clusters are skillfully tailored by bridging Nb into the second shell of W in the W-P 5 configuration, nested in situ in conductive and stable N, P co-doped carbon nanospheres (Nb/W-P@NPC). Such clusters with high atom utilization can offer profuse Na + storage sites due to their high coordination. As an electron donor, Nb-bridging can subtly modify the electronic structure of clusters, and broaden the hybridization of d-p orbitals, thus improving charge transfer efficiency and fostering diversified active sites. Compared with the low-coordinated W-P L @NPC and the high-coordinated W-P@NPC, the reversible capacity of Nb/W-P@NPC upgrades to 556.3 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , alongside exceptional cycling stability at high rates. When integrated into SIHCs, the high energy density and high-power output (223.6 and 9800 W kg −1 ) are achieved. By systematically exploring the effect of high coordination and bimetallic design on the storage efficacies of amorphous clusters, this study has greatly advanced the development of SIHC technologies.},

More importantly, uncommon vesicle-like patterns are probed via TOF-SIMS, which may not be captured by conventional electron microscopy. The possible origins of vesicles are also proposed.

Here, the development of a barcode-indexed PCR coupled with HiFi long-read sequencing pipeline (BIP-seq) is reported for high throughput Protein Protein Interaction (PPI)identification. BIP-seq is essentially built on the integration of library versus library Y2H mating strategy to facilitate the efficient acquisition of random PPI colonies, semi-mechanized dual barcode-indexed yeast colony PCR for the large-scale indexed amplification of bait and prey cDNAs, and massive pac-bio sequencing of PCR amplicon pools. It is demonstrated that BIP-seq could map over 15 000 high-confidence (≈62.5% could be verified by Bimolecular fluorescence Complementation (BiFC)) rice PPIs within 2 months, outperforming the other reported methods. In addition, the obtained 23 032 rice PPIs, including 22,665 newly identified PPIs, greatly expanded the current rice PPI dataset, provided a comprehensive overview of the rice PPIs networks, and could be a valuable asset in facilitating functional genomics research in rice.},

  abstract     = {Membrane-based gas separation provides an energy-efficient approach for the simultaneous CO 2 and H 2 S removal from sour natural gas. The fluorinated polyimide (PI) membranes exhibited a promising balance between permeability and permselectivity for sour natural gas separation. To further improve the separation efficiency of fluorinated PI membranes, a melamine-copolymerization synthetic approach is devised that aims to incorporate melamine motifs with high sour gas affinity into the structure of the PI membranes. The fluorinated copolyimide membranes that are structurally engineered exhibited excellent solution-processability and enhanced sweet-mixed gas selectivity compared to their original PI membranes. Additionally, under a five-component sour mixed-gas feed, these melamine-copolymerized fluorinated PI membranes provided superior combined H 2 S and CO 2 removal efficiency in comparison to conventional glassy polymer membranes. The melamine-copolymerization strategy provides an easily operable and generally effective approach to developing performance-enhancing PI membranes for sour natural gas separation.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia (NH 3 ) is esteemed for its attributes as a carbon-neutral fuel and hydrogen storage material, due to its high energy density, abundant hydrogen content, and notably higher liquefaction temperature in comparison to hydrogen gas. The primary method for the synthetic generation of NH 3 is the Haber–Bosch process, involving rigorous conditions and resulting in significant global energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. To tackle energy and environmental challenges, the exploration of innovative green and sustainable technologies for NH 3 synthesis is imperative. Rapid advances in electrochemical technology have created fresh prospects for researchers in the realm of environmentally friendly NH 3 synthesis. Nevertheless, the intricate intermediate products and sluggish kinetics in the reactions impede the progress of green electrochemical NH 3 synthesis (EAS) technologies. To improve the activity and selectivity of the EAS, which encompasses the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen gas, nitrate, and nitric oxide, numerous electrocatalysts and design strategies have been meticulously investigated. Here, this review primarily delves into recent progress and obstacles in EAS pathways, examining methods to boost the yield rate and current efficiency of NH 3 synthesis via multidimensional structural optimization, while also exploring the challenges and outlook for EAS.},

Simultaneous discrimination and detection of ATP and biothiols offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of conditions such as epilepsy and liver injury. This study introduces the first fluorescent probe, BCR , designed for multifunctional detection of ATP, GSH, Hcy, and Cys. With outstanding optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, high selectivity, and superior sensitivity, probe BCR enables effective imaging of ATP and biothiol dynamics in vivo. Moreover, probe BCR successfully visualizes changes in ATP, GSH, Hcy, and Cys levels in a PTZ-induced epileptic zebrafish model and an APAP-induced mouse liver injury tissue section model.

  abstract     = {Pulmonary hypertension (PH) increases the mortality of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). There are no curative therapies for this disease. Lung endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme of the carnitine shuttle system, is reduced in a rodent model of BPD. It is unknown whether endothelial Cpt1a reduction causes pulmonary vascular (PV) remodeling. The latter can be the result of endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Here, endothelial cell (EC)-specific Cpt1a KO and WT mice (&lt;12 h old) are exposed to hyperoxia (70% O 2 ) for 14 days and allow them to recover in normoxia until postnatal day 28. Hyperoxia causes PH, which is aggravated in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Upregulating endothelial Cpt1a expression inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Hyperoxia causes lung EndoMT, detected by immunofluorescence, scRNA-sequencing, and EC lineage tracing, which is further increased in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Blocking EndoMT inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Male mice under the same high oxygen conditions develop a higher degree of PH than females, which is associated with reduced endothelial Cpt1a expression. Conclusively, neonatal hyperoxia causes PH by decreasing endothelial Cpt1a expression and upregulating EndoMT. This provides a valuable strategy for developing targeted therapies by upregulating endothelial Cpt1a levels or inhibiting EndoMT to treat BPD-associated PH.},

  abstract     = {Stem cell implantation holds promise for enhancing bone repair, but risks of pathogen transmission and malignant cell transformation should not be ignored. Compared to stem cell implantation, recruitment of endogenous stem cells to injured sites is more critical for in situ bone regeneration. In this study, based on the acidic microenvironment of bone injury, an HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel with a dual-control intelligent switch function is developed by incorporating stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1α), arginine carbon dots (Arg-CDs), and calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) into the oxidized hyaluronic acid/gelatin methacryloyl (HG) hydrogel. The acidic microenvironment triggers the first switch (Schiff base bond is broken between HG-AA 1:1 and SDF-1α) of HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel to continuously release SDF-1α. Compared to the neutral (pH 7.4) media, the cumulative release of SDF-1α in acidic (pH 5.5) media is ≈2.5 times higher, which enhances the migration and recruitment of endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The recruited MSCs immediately initiate the second switch and metabolize Arg-CDs into the bioactive nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of Ca 2+ , activating NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the engineered HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel shows promising potential to achieve “coupling osteogenesis and angiogenesis” for bone regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-performance dielectric materials remains a significant challenge due to the inherent trade-offs between high energy storage density and low energy loss. A central difficulty lies in identifying a suitable dipolar unit that can enhance the polarity and dielectric constant of the material while effectively suppressing the high energy losses associated with polarization relaxation, charge injection, and conduction. To address this, a novel strategy is proposed that introduces electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents on the benzene ring of polystyrene-based polymers, creating bulky dipole groups that are resistant to reorientation under an electric field. This approach mitigates relaxation losses associated with dipole reorientation and manipulates the band structure via substituent modification to suppress conduction losses. Additionally, the deformation of the π -electron cloud under an electric field enhances the dielectric constant and energy storage density. Ultimately, the optimized chlorostyrene-methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymer exhibits an 85% discharge efficiency and an energy storage density of 18.3 J cm − 3 , nearly three times that of styrene-based copolymers under the same conditions. This study introduces a new approach for designing high-energy density, low-loss polymer dielectric materials by precisely controlling electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects to modulate the distribution of π -conjugated electron clouds.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen usually exists in the form of diatomic molecules at ambient conditions. At high pressure, it undergoes a series of phase transitions from diatomic O 2 to O 8 cluster and ultimately dissociates into a polymeric O 4 spiral chain structure. Intriguingly, the commonly found cyclic hexameric molecules in other group VIA elements (e.g., S 6 and Se 6 ) are never reported in the bulk oxygen. Through extensive computational crystal structure search, herein it is reported that such hexameric O 6 molecules can exist in a stable compound HeO 3 above 1.9 TPa. The first-principles calculations reveal that, during the reaction by mixing oxygen with helium, the insertion of helium does not only expand the lattice volume, but also relieves the electron lone pair repulsion among diatomic O 2 , and thus significantly promoting the formation of cyclic O 6 molecules. Furthermore, the transition pathway calculations demonstrate that molecular O 2 is dissociated first, and then six oxygen atoms form a polymeric digital 2-shaped intermediate O 6 . Subsequently, each unstable intermediate O 6 decomposes into two intermedia O 3 trimers. Finally, O 3 trimers transform into cyclic O 6 molecules at high pressure. This study expands the known molecular forms of oxygen and suggests a route to the synthesis of intriguing cyclic O 6 molecules.},

However, the inherent characteristics of metal droplets, including high surface tension, elevated viscosity, and extreme temperatures, pose significant challenges for wetting and spreading on nonwetting substrates. Herein, this work proposes a strategy that employs a two-dimensional (2D) orthogonal ultrasonic field to construct a vibration deposition substrate with radial vibration amplitude gradient, thereby enhancing the wettability and adhesive strength of impacting metal droplets ejected by a piezoelectric micro-jet device. First, a 2D ultrasonic vibration device is designed based on the combination of longitudinal vibration modes. Additionally, oblique and circular vibration trajectories are synthesized. The vibration amplitude distributions and trajectories of the deposition substrate are verified utilizing the finite element method. Subsequently, the experimental results demonstrate that the contact angle is decreased by 24.7%, the spreading diameter is increased by 10.3%, and the adhesive strength is enhanced by 5.4 times compared to deposition on a static substrate. The 2D ultrasonic field facilitates the transition of metal droplets from a non-wetting state to a wetting state on the nonwetting substrate, which highlights the versatility and adaptability of ultrasonic strategy for expanding the applications of metal droplets.},

Current treatment modalities for GD carry significant disadvantages, especially for pregnant or nursing women. As a novel extracorporeal therapeutic technique, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) shows great promise for treating GD; however, its low treatment efficacy impedes clinical application. In this study, a thyroid-targeted nano-bomb system (PD-PLGA@Si-Ab/PDA-I, PSAPI) is developed to enhance HIFU efficacy and improve therapeutic outcomes for GD. The core structure of PSAPI encapsulates a phase-transition material, perfluorohexane, and the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac within a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and silica shell. A polydopamine coating enhances biocompatibility, while iodine loading and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies grafting ensure targeted delivery to the thyroid. Robust in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that PSAPI is highly biocompatible, accumulates in the thyroid within 24 h after administration, and significantly potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of HIFU, resulting in markedly reduced inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a cellular defense mechanism activated in PSAPI-treated cells following HIFU irradiation, highlighting potential molecular targets for the future development of HIFU-sensitizing agents. The biocompatible PSAPI nano-bomb developed in this study holds great transformative potential, addressing critical gaps in current therapeutic practices for GD.},

Moreover, HI@PSeP-IMTP effectively mitigates MIRI due to a synergistic integration of diselenide bonds and hesperadin, which can eliminate ROS and suppress cardiac inflammation. Specifically, the expression levels of p-CaMKII, p-IκBα, and p65 in the MIRI region in the HI@PSeP-IMTP group demonstrate a reduction of 30%, 46%, and 42% respectively compared to that of the PBS group.

  abstract     = {In the search for new ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, two novel cadmium mixed halide compounds, (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Cl 3 F 3 and (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 , are successfully synthesized via hydrothermal methods. These compounds crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) space group, R 32, and are composed of distorted octahedral [CdX 3 F 3 ] (X═Cl or Br) units, which extend into a 3D framework. Remarkably, both compounds demonstrate strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiencies—3.0 and 8.0 times that of KH 2 PO 4 for the Cl- and Br-containing analogs, respectively—with phase-matching behavior observed. The SHG efficiency is attributed to the highly distorted coordination environment of the polarizable d 10 Cd 2+ ions, with (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 benefiting further from Br&#39;s greater polarizability. Furthermore, these compounds exhibit wide bandgaps exceeding 4.2 eV, making them the first d 10 metal mixed halide systems incorporating fluoride that are suitable for UV NLO applications. With UV absorption cut-off edges as short as 203 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Cl 3 F 3 and 243 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 , these materials represent a significant advancement in the development of UV-transparent NLO materials. This study introduces a novel synthetic strategy for the design of d 10 mixed halide systems with enhanced optical properties, offering promising candidates for future UV NLO technologies.},

  abstract     = {Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are commonly used in polarization-sensitive photodetectors (PDs) for applications such as polarization imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Although various methods exist to adjust the polarization-sensitive photocurrent, a universal and effective approach for continuous control of MHPs’ optoelectronic and polarized properties is lacking. A universal strategy to electrically modulate the polarization ratio (PR) of self-powered polarized PDs using the ferro-pyro-phototronic effect (FPPE) in 2D perovskites is presented. By varying the amplitude and direction of ferroelectric polarization voltage, the built-in electric field in the heterojunction can be modulated, allowing for controllable PR regulation and adjustable polarization characteristics. Moreover, the polarized pyroelectric photoresponses are realized, significantly enhancing the responsivity, response speed of the polarized PDs. Both the pyroelectric currents and photocurrents exhibit obvious polarization characteristics. This method&#39;s versatility is demonstrated by creating three additional quasi-2D MHP ferroelectric-based polarized-sensitive PDs. A proof-of-concept for encrypted optical communication is achieved using the UV-sensitive PDs as light-sensing units. These findings highlight FPPE&#39;s potential to enhance ferroelectric device polarization control, enabling high-performance and self-powered polarization photodetection.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal batteries are considered the holy grail for next-generation high-energy systems. However, lithium anode faces poor reversibility, unsatisfying cyclability and rate capability due to its uncontrollable plating/stripping behavior. While galvanostatic conditions are extensively studied, the behavior under more realistic application scenarios with variable inputs are less explored. Here, an in situ imaging platform using in-plane microdevice configurations is developed to effectively investigate Li plating/stripping behavior under dynamic conditions. This platform offers high detectivity for analyzing the nuclei size, density, distribution, and growth location, rate, and mode. It is for the first time revealed that nuclei density and growth locations remain constant and are solely determined by the initial nucleation overpotentials during dynamic plating. A transition in growth modes from uniform granular growth to tip-induced dendrite growth, and finally to directional growth among the dendrites is also observed. Guided by these findings, a dynamic plating protocol is proposed, which can greatly improve the Li reversibility and cycling stability. This work not only provides a novel approach to visualize the evolution of key nucleation and growth parameters, especially under variable inputs, but also offers valuable guidance for the future industrialization of metal batteries and the rational design of charging facilities.},

  abstract     = {The human visual nervous system excels at recognizing and processing external stimuli, essential for various physiological functions. Biomimetic visual systems leverage biological synapse properties to improve memory encoding and perception. Optoelectronic devices mimicking these synapses can enhance wearable electronics, with layered heterojunction materials being ideal materials for optoelectronic synapses due to their tunable properties and biocompatibility. However, conventional synthesis methods are complex and environmentally harmful, leading to issues such as poor stability and low charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a more efficient, convenient, and eco-friendly method for preparing layered heterojunction materials. Here, a one-step ultrasonic method is employed to mix fullerene (C60) with graphene oxide (GO), yielding a homogeneous layered heterojunction composite film via self-assembly. The biomimetic optoelectronic synapse based on this film achieves 97.3% accuracy in dynamic visual recognition tasks and exhibits capabilities such as synaptic plasticity. Experiments utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier–transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms stable π-π interactions between GO and C60, facilitating electron transfer and prolonging carrier recombination times.

  abstract     = {Recipients often suffer from hyperlactatemia during liver transplantation (LT), but whether hyperlactatemia exacerbates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after donor liver implantation remains unclear. Here, the role of hyperlactatemia in hepatic IRI is explored. In this work, hyperlactatemia is found to exacerbate ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Lactate-primed lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8) is determined to directly lactylate mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) at Lys100 and augments PCK2 kinase activity. By using gene-edited mice, evidence indicating that PCK2 exacerbates hepatic ferroptosis during IRI is generated. Mechanistically, PCK2 lactylate at Lys100 acts as a critical inducer of ferroptosis during IRI by competitively inhibiting the Parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (OXSM), thereby leading to metabolic remodeling of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) and the potentiation of oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. More importantly, targeting PCK2 is demonstrated to markedly ameliorate hyperlactatemia-mediated ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Collectively, the findings support the use of therapeutics targeting PCK2 to suppress hepatic ferroptosis and IRI in patients with hyperlactatemia during LT.},

  abstract     = {Most current highly efficient organic solar cells utilize small molecules like Y6 and its derivatives as electron acceptors in the photoactive layer. In this work, a small molecule acceptor, SC8-IT4F, is developed through outer side chain engineering on the terminal thiophene of a conjugated 6,12-dihydro-dithienoindeno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDTT) central core. Compared to the reference molecule C8-IT4F, which lacks outer side chains, SC8-IT4F displays notable differences in molecule geometry (as shown by simulations), thermal behavior, single-crystal packing, and film morphology. Blend films of SC8-IT4F and the polymer donor PM6 exhibit larger carrier mobilities, longer carrier lifetimes, and reduced recombination compared to C8-IT4F, resulting in improved device performance. Binary photovoltaic devices based on the PM6:SC8-IT4F films reveal an optimal efficiency over 15%, which is one of the best values for non-Y type small molecule acceptors (SMAs). The resultant devices also show better thermal and operational stability than the control PM6:L8-BO devices. SC8-IT4F and its blend exhibit a higher relative degree of crystallinity and π coherence length, compared to C8-IT4F samples, beneficial for charge transport and device performance. The results indicate that outer side chain engineering on existing small electron acceptors can be a promising molecular design strategy for further pursuing high-performance organic solar cells.},

Traditional topical ocular drug delivery methods often fail to effectively reach the meibomian glands (MGs). To address this, the study has developed a soluble microneedles (MN) patch comprising poly(vinyl alcohol), cyclodextrin modified polyacrylic acid, and new indocyanine green. This innovative MN patch facilitates the transdermal release of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonists, such as rosiglitazone in response to near-infrared ray induced temperature changes. By safely optimizing temperature, the patch effectively liquefied meibum lips, thereby alleviating duct obstruction while releasing the drug. MN patches exhibit sufficient mechanical strength for effective skin penetration, and its biosafety for eyelid application has been rigorously assessed in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic efficiency of rosiglitazone loaded MN (ROSI-MN) treatment for MGD is evaluated in high-fat mice. After three months of treatments, ROSI-MN administration significantly alleviated MGD clinical manifestations, including ocular surface damage, lipid deposits, glandular hypertrophy, and inflammatory infiltration, ultimately improving the microstructure and biofunction of MGs. In conclusion, the soluble MN patches hold promise as an effective drug delivery strategy for treating ocular surface diseases beyond MGD.},

Numerous attempts have been made to develop agrochemicals that inhibit biofilms, however, their ineffective foliar deposition and difficulty in removing mature biofilms remain major challenges. Herein, multifunctional three-component supramolecular nano-biscuits (NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD) are successfully engineered via ordered self-assembly between two macrocycles [cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), β -cyclodextrin ( β -CD)] and ( R )-2-naphthol-based bis-imidazolium bromide salt (NI6R). This macrocycles-involved bactericidal material combines many advantages. 1) Alleviate the off-target movement of droplets on hydrophobic blade surfaces. 2) Enhance the biofilm-disrupting ability. At a low-dose of 4.44 µg mL −1 , the inhibition rate of biofilm formation reached 78.3%. At 35.5 µg mL −1 , the potency to remove mature biofilms reached 77.6%. 3) Efficiently hinder bacterial reproduction, swimming, extracellular polysaccharide production, extracellular enzyme secretion, and virulence to plants. These superior characteristics are undoubtedly transmitted to the in vivo control effect. At 200 µg mL −1 , this smart material exhibits superior control efficiencies of 49.6%/65.0%/85.4% against three kinds of bacterial diseases (rice leaf blight, citrus canker, and kiwifruit canker), respectively, surpassing the commercial bactericide—thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (33.6%/41.5%/43.2%) and NI6R (40.3%/51.2%/71.2%). Furthermore, NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD is biosafe to non-target organisms. This study is instructive for constructing multifunctional agrochemicals in sustainable crop protection.},

Herein, a series of protein spike-in experiments are conducted to systematically investigate protein depletion and enrichment during NPC formation. Proteomic depth is serum concentration-dependent, and NPC exhibits powerful tolerance to ultra-high abundant proteins. In addition, protein-protein interactions (PPI), especially those involving albumin, play a pivotal role in promoting proteomic depth. Furthermore, a triple-protein assay is established to interrogate the relationship between protein binding affinity and concentration. NPC formation is a product of balancing binding affinity, concentration, and PPI.

  abstract     = {Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis worldwide. The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC-infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA-seq and SMART-seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z-DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1-knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1-pRIP3-pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, an all-optical modulation photodetector based on a CdS/graphene/Ge sandwich structure is designed. In the presence of the modulation (near-infrared) light, the Fermi level of the graphene channel shifts, allowing for the tuning of the visible light response speed as well as achieving a broad responsivity range from negative (-3376 A/W) to positive (3584 A/W) response. Based on this, logical operations are performed by adjusting the power of the modulation light superimposed with the signal light. This facilitates more covert, all-optical, high-speed encrypted communication. The ultrahigh tunability and nearly symmetric positive and negative photoconductivity of all-optical modulation photodetectors significantly enhance the computational capacity of neuromorphic hardware. The proposed device exhibits substantial advantages in applications requiring high fault tolerance for integrated sensing-computing （ISC） and high-resolution motion object recognition, providing insights for the development of next-generation high-bandwidth, low-power-consumption ISC devices.},

  abstract     = {DNA methylation plays a critical role in gene regulation, affecting cellular differentiation and disease progression, particularly in non-coding regions. However, predicting the epigenetic consequences of non-coding mutations at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. Existing tools have limited prediction capacity and struggle to capture dynamic, cell-type-specific regulatory changes that are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Here, Methven, a deep learning framework designed is presented to predict the effects of non-coding mutations on DNA methylation at single-cell resolution. Methven integrates DNA sequence with single-cell ATAC-seq data and models SNP-CpG interactions over 100 kbp genomic distances. By using a divide-and-conquer approach, Methven accurately predicts both short- and long-range regulatory interactions and leverages the pre-trained DNA language model for enhanced precision in classification and regression tasks. Methven outperforms existing methods and demonstrates robust generalizability to monocyte datasets. Importantly, it identifies CpG sites associated with rheumatoid arthritis, revealing key pathways involved in immune regulation and disease progression. Methven&#39;s ability to detect progressive epigenetic changes provides crucial insights into gene regulation in complex diseases. These findings demonstrate Methven&#39;s potential as a powerful tool for basic research and clinical applications, advancing this understanding of non-coding mutations and their role in disease, while offering new opportunities for personalized medicine.},

Melatonin (MT), structurally similar to auxin, also significantly influences root induction, but its specific mechanism is unclear. Phytomelatonin&#39;s signal transduction is discovered in wound-induced root formation, identifying SlPMTR1/2 as phytomelatonin receptors, transmitting signals to SHOOT BORNE ROOTLESS 1 (SlSBRL1), a key regulator of wound-induced root regeneration, via the G protein α subunit 1 (SlGPA1). Additionally, SlPMTR1/2 is activated by JA, and targeted by SlMYC2. Overall, the specific mechanisms of phytomelatonin on wound-induced root regeneration is uncovered and revealed a crosstalk between phytomelatonin and JA, offering new insights into plant repair mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The integrated modulation of radiation and scattering provides an unprecedented opportunity to reduce the number of electromagnetic (EM) apertures in the platform while simultaneously enhancing communication and stealth performance. Nevertheless, achieving full-polarization, arbitrary amplitude, and phase modulation of radiation scattering remains a challenge. In this paper, a strategy that realizes space-time coding of radiation scattering within the same frequency band, which enables the simultaneous and independent modulation of amplitude and phase, is proposed. To address the limitations of the high sideband levels (SBLs) of conventional space-time-coding metasurfaces, a strategy comprising nonuniform modulation periods and stochastic coding is proposed. Consequently, beam scanning with ultra-low sidelobe levels (SLLs) and suppressed SBLs is achieved in the radiation mode (RM). In scattering mode (SM), in-band low scattering characteristics are achieved within the same operating frequency band as RM. A prototype of a space-time-coding radiation-scattering metasurface (STCRSM) is fabricated and the aforementioned functionalities are validated by measurements. Furthermore, the proposed strategy does not necessitate the utilization of optimization algorithms and exhibits low SLLs and low SBLs, which will make it flourish in RF stealth applications, such as covert communication systems.},

Here, the micro size CsPbCl 3 perovskite crystals (MCs) are reported with uniform Mn 2+ ions doping by self-assembly of Mn 2+ ions doped CsPbCl 3 perovskite NCs. The electron–phonon coupling strength is enhanced in the perovskite self-assembled CsPbCl 3 MCs, which remarkably accelerates the PL decay of Mn 2+ ions in room temperature. Furthermore, the phonon-involved PL emission splits to two peaks at low temperature of 80 K, due to the phonon emission and absorption-induced energy exchange for exciton recombination in Mn 2+ ions. These findings not only demonstrate a novel material system but also introduce a new theoretical framework for phonon-modulated PL manipulation in Mn 2+ -doped perovskite materials.},

Despite their widespread in nature, the integration into engineered materials is limited by the lack of study on their complex architectures. This study addresses the challenge by investigating the structure-property relationships and stability of biomimetic 3D-DFNS using large datasets generated through procedural modeling, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning. Based on these datasets, a network deep reinforcement learning (N-DRL) framework is developed to optimize its stability, effectively balancing weight reduction with the maintenance of structural integrity. The results reveal a pronounced correlation between the total fiber length in 3D-DFNS and its mechanical properties, where longer fibers enhance stress distribution and stability. Additionally, fiber orientation is also considered as a potential factor influencing stress growth values. Furthermore, the N-DRL model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional approaches in optimizing network stability while minimizing mass and computational cost. Structural integrity is significantly improved through the addition of triple junctions and the reduction of higher-order nodes. In summary, this study leverages machine learning to optimize biomimetic 3D-DFNS, providing novel insights into the design of lightweight, high-strength materials.},

However, the specific mechanisms and the protective effects of α-lipoic acid (LA) remain unclear. Therefore, this study employs network toxicology and network pharmacology to comprehensively analyze the hepatotoxic mechanism of As and the hepatoprotective mechanism of LA, and further verifies the mechanisms of peroxisomal β-oxidation and lipophagy in the process. The network analysis results show that As induces liver damage mainly through autophagy, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress, whereas LA exerts its hepatoprotective properties mainly by regulating lipid metabolism. Further verifications find that As inhibits SIRT1 expression, activates the P53 and Notch pathways, damages mitochondria, inhibits peroxisomal β-oxidation, increases lipid accumulation, and enhances lipophagy in the liver, while LA intervention alleviates As-induced lipid accumulation and enhances lipophagy by targeting SIRT1, ameliorating mitochondrial damage, enhancing peroxisomal β-oxidation, thereby alleviating As-induced liver damage. This study further clarifies the mechanism of As hepatotoxicity and provides a theoretical basis for LA as a potential hepatoprotective agent.},

In this study, the identification and characterization of an undescribed enzyme, PheG, from Phellinus igniarius ( P. igniarius ), which catalyzes the construction of a key C─C bond in the enzymatic synthesis of hispidin are reported. It is demonstrated in vitro that PheG generates hispidin by catalyzing C─C bond formation in the aldol condensation reaction. Based on these results, a plausible pathway for hispidin biosynthesis is proposed by utilizing the primary triacetic acid lactone (TAL, 2 ) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde ( 3 ). The mechanisms for the aldol condensation reaction of PheG are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations, density functional theory, and site-specific mutations. The locations of the key amino acid residues that catalyze the conversion of substrates 2 and 3 to hispidin at the active site of PheG-1 are identified.

A central component of this process is gut-derived metabolites, which play a crucial role in mediating the distal functioning of the microbiota. In this study, a comprehensive microbiome-metabolite analysis using fecal and serum samples from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and volunteers with risk factors for coronary heart disease and culture histology is performed, and identified the core strain Bacteroides ovatus ( B. ovatus ). Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments further demonstrated that the gut microbiota significantly influences AS progression, with B. ovatus alone exerting effects comparable to volunteer feces from volunteers. Notably, B. ovatus alleviated AS primarily by restoring the intestinal barrier and enhancing bile acid metabolism, particularly through the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a tryptophan-derived metabolite. IAA inhibited the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in M1 macrophages, promoted M2 macrophage polarisation, and restored the M1/M2 polarisation balance, ultimately reducing aortic inflammation. These findings clarify the mechanistic interplay between the gut microbiota and AS, providing the first evidence that B. ovatus , a second-generation probiotic, can improve bile acid metabolism and reduce inflammation, offering a theoretical foundation for future AS therapeutic applications involving this strain.},

Additionally, mitochondrial proteins have not previously been reported to be secreted into hosts by pathogens. Here, it is found that the Meloidogyne javanica elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) (MjEF-Tu) located in the nematode mitochondria is up-regulated and secreted into the host plant during nematode parasitism. MjEF-Tu interacts with the PRR Arabidopsis thaliana EF-Tu receptor (AtEFR), triggering the plant hallmark defence responses mediated by AtEFR. An 18-aa sequence (Nelf18) in the N terminus of the nematode EF-Tu contributes to the immunogenic activity. M. javanica water extract and mitochondrial extract also induce plant immunity sensed by AtEFR, owing to the presence of MjEF-Tu. In addition, Nelf18 enhances plant resistance to nematode, virus, and bacterial infections depending on AtEFR. These findings first demonstrate that mitochondrial proteins from pathogens can be secreted into hosts and function as a cross-kingdom signal and identified the first plant-parasitic animal-derived proteinaceous PAMP/PRR pair, providing novel insights into host-pathogen interactions.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a globally prevalent degenerative joint disease. Recent studies highlight the role of ferroptosis in OA progression. Targeting ferroptosis regulation presents a promising therapeutic strategy for OA; however, current research primarily focuses on single targets associated with ferroptosis. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanoparticle is developed by linking deferasirox (DEF) and pterostilbene (PTE) with thioketal and incorporating cerium ions (Ce), creating Ce@D&amp;P nanoparticles (NPs), which offer multitarget regulation of ferroptosis. The characteristics of Ce@D&amp;P NPs are evaluated and their therapeutic effects on IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes are verified. Results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs reduce ROS levels, mitigate inflammation, chelate iron to inhibit ferroptosis, and balance extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses suggest that Ce@D&amp;P NPs exerted their effects by regulating oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in chondrocytes. To better treat destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA in mice, Ce@D&amp;P NPs via intra-articular injection are delivered. The results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs alleviate cartilage matrix damage and slow OA progression. Overall, the findings indicate that Ce@D&amp;P NPs represent a promising multitarget drug delivery system, and Ce@D&amp;P NPs may be an effective strategy for OA treatment.},

  abstract     = {The past decade witnessed a surge in discoveries where biological systems, such as bacteria or living cells, inherently portray active polar or nematic behavior: they prefer to align with each other and form local order during migration. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, utilizing their physical properties to achieve controllable cell-layer transport will be of fundamental importance. In this study, the ratchet effect is harnessed to control the collective motion of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro. NPCs travel back-and-forth and do not specify head or tail, and therefore regarded as nematics alike liquid crystals. Ratchet and splay-shaped confinements are crafted to modulate collective cell dynamics in dense environments, while jamming is not explicitly spotted. The adaptation of an agent-based simulation further revealed how the ratchet&#39;s asymmetry and active forces from nematic order synergistically reinforce the directional cell flow. These findings provide insights into topotaxis in cell populations when restricted to crowded 2D ratchets and the mechanisms that regulate collective behavior of the cells.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease and the leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Recent studies have shown that stroke development and prognosis are closely related to abnormal tryptophan metabolism. Here, significant downregulation of 3-hydroxy-kynurenamine (3-HKA) in stroke patients and animal models is identified. Supplementation with 3-HKA improved long-term neurological recovery, reduced infarct volume, and increased ipsilateral cerebral blood flow after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis, functional blood vessel formation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) repair. Moreover, 3-HKA inhibited A1-like (neurotoxic) astrocyte activation but promoted A2-like (neuroprotective) astrocyte polarization. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-HKA inhibited AIM2 inflammasome activation after stroke, and co-labeling studies indicated that AIM2 expression typically increased in astrocytes at 7 and 14 days after stroke. Consistently, in co-cultures of primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). AIM2 overexpression in astrocytes abrogated 3-HKA-driven vascular remodeling in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that 3-HKA may regulate astrocyte-mediated vascular remodeling by impeding AIM2 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, 3-HKA may promote post-stroke vascular remodeling by regulating A1/A2 astrocyte activation, thereby improving long-term neurological recovery, suggesting that supplementation with 3-HKA may be an efficient therapy for stroke.},

  abstract     = {Efficiency, stability, and cost are crucial considerations in the development of photovoltaic technology for commercialization. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising third-generation photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low-cost potential. However, the stability of organohalide perovskites remains a significant challenge. Inorganic perovskites, based on CsPbX ₃ (X = Br − /I − ), have garnered attention for their excellent thermal stability and optoelectronic properties comparable to those of organohalide perovskites. Nevertheless, the development of inorganic perovskites faces several hurdles, including the need for high-temperature annealing to achieve the photoactive α-phase and their susceptibility to transitioning into the nonphotoactive δ-phase under environmental stressors, particularly moisture. These challenges impede the creation of high-efficiency, high-stability devices using low-cost, scalable manufacturing processes. This review provides a comprehensive background on the fundamental structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties of inorganic lead-halide perovskites. It discusses the latest advancements in fabricating inorganic PSCs at lower temperatures and under ambient conditions. Furthermore, it highlights the progress in state-of-the-art inorganic devices, particularly those manufactured in ambient environments and at reduced temperatures, alongside simultaneous advancements in the upscaling and stability of inorganic PSCs.},

  abstract     = {A novel additive method to boost the Seebeck coefficient of doped conjugated polymers without a significant loss in electrical conductivity is demonstrated. Perovskite (CsPbBr 3 ) quantum dots (QDs) passivated by ligands with long alkyl chains are mixed with a conjugated polymer in a solution phase to form polymer-QD blend films. Solution sequential doping of the blend film with AuCl 3 solution not only doped the conjugated polymer but also decomposed the QDs, resulting in a doped conjugated polymer film embedded with separated ions dissociated from the QDs. For the doped polymer-molten QD blend films with the optimal QD content, it is found that a greatly enhanced Seebeck coefficient is achieved compared to that of the doped polymer film without QDs, while the doping level and electrical conductivity are not significantly reduced by the QD incorporation. Consequently, the power factor is enhanced, reaching a remarkably high value of up to 401.9 µW m −1 K −2 (≈155% increase with the QDs). The applicability of this method to a variety of conjugated polymers is also demonstrated. The enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient is attributed to ion-induced local variations in the polymer work function, which generates an internal energy barrier for charge transport and causes an energy filtering effect.},

The V-shaped wake formed by a moving object on the water surface results from the constructive interference of water waves of different wavelengths, similar to CR. We designed and fabricated a one-dimensional (1D) water wave crystal to analogize the behavior of moving particles in water waves. This crystal exhibits a band structure with both positive (positive group velocity) and negative slopes (negative group velocity), exciting and directing the water waves to produce forward and backward radiating wakes through a mechanism similar to CR. Notably, the radiation angle is easily adjustable. This method of regulating water wave wakes holds potential applications in scattering cancellation-based wake stealth, navigation technology, and fluid dynamics for future offshore vessels.},

The primary challenge in modulating this gap has been the absence of a direct method for observing changes of the band gap in momentum space. In this study, advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique is employed to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moiré potentials. The application of displacement field via in situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moiré potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ≈20 meV. Theoretical calculations effectively capture the experimental observations. This investigation provides a quantitative understanding of how these two mechanisms collaboratively modulate the band gap in bilayer graphene, offering valuable guidance for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.},

Here, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is conducted on NPC, leveraging gene expression prediction models based on epithelial tissues and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 1577 NPC cases and 6359 controls of southern Chinese descent. The TWAS identifies VAMP8 on chromosome 2p11.2 as a novel susceptibility gene for NPC. Further fine-mapping analyses pinpoint rs1058588, located within VAMP8 , as a causal variant through eQTL colocalization, and GWAS analyses across multiple cohorts, achieving GWAS significance (OR = 1.18, P = 3.09 × 10 −10 ). Functional assays demonstrate that VAMP8 exerts a tumorigenic role in NPC, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. Mechanically, it is uncovered that rs1058588 modulates VAMP8 expression by altering its binding affinity to miR-185 . Furthermore, the results show that VAMP8 interacts with DHX9 to facilitate the nuclear recruitment of p65, activating the NF-κB pathway. Collectively, the findings shed light on the genetic predisposition to NPC and underscore the critical role of the functional axis involving miR-185, VAMP8, DHX9, and the NF-κB pathway in NPC pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and animal models of depression, key pathological hallmarks include activation of microglia as well as atrophy and loss of astrocytes. Under certain pathological conditions, microglia can inflict damage to neurons and astrocytes. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how activated microglia induced astrocyte atrophy and loss remain enigmatic. In this study, a depression model induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is utilized. The results show that CSDS induces significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, along with notable astrocyte atrophy and apoptosis, microglial activation, and elevated levels of microglial interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subsequent studies demonstrate that IL-6 released from activated microglia promotes astrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in microglia, which is implicated in the stress response, reduces stress-induced microglial activation, IL-6 release, and astrocyte apoptosis. Direct inhibition of microglia by minocycline corroborates these effects. The selective knockdown of IL-6 in microglia and IL-6 receptors in astrocytes effectively mitigates depression-like behaviors and reduces astrocyte atrophy. This study identifies microglial IL-6 as a key factor that contributes to astrocyte apoptosis and depressive symptoms. Consequently, the IL-6/IL-6R pathway has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of depression.},

In this study, an AOM-DSS-induced three-stage colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) model is constructed and targeted metabolomics analysis and pathway enrichment are performed, uncovering the metabolic changes in this transition. Spatial metabolic trajectories in the “normal-to-normal adjacent tissue (NAT)-to-tumor” transition, and temporal metabolic trajectories in the “colitis-to-dysplasia-to-carcinoma” transition are identified through K-means clustering of 74 spatially and 77 temporally differential metabolites, respectively. The findings reveal two distinct metabolic profile categories during the inflammation-to-cancer progression: those with consistent changes, either increasing (e.g., kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid) or decreasing (e.g., long-chain fatty acids, LCFAs), and those enriched at specific disease stages (e.g., serotonin). Further analysis of metabolites with consistent temporal trends identifies eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as a key metabolite, potentially exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects by inhibiting insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). This study reveals novel metabolic mechanisms underlying the transition from UC to CAC and suggests potential targets to delay the progression.},

However, unpredictable switching behavior and poor mechanical stability in conventional memristors present significant challenges to achieving device reliability. Here, a reliable and flexible memristor using zirconium-oxo cluster (Zr 6 O 4 OH 4 (OMc) 12 ) as the resistive switching layer is demonstrated. The optimization of the structural rigidity of the hybrid oxo-cluster network by thermal polymerization allows the precise formation of dispersed conductive cluster networks, enhancing the repeatability of the resistive switching with mechanical flexibility. The optimized memristor exhibits endurance of ∼10 4 cycles and stable memory retention performance up to 10 4 s, maintaining a high I ON / I OFF ratio of 10 4 under a bending radius of 2.5 mm. Moreover, the device achieves a pattern recognition accuracy of 97.44%, enabled by highly symmetric analog switching with multilevel conductance states.

  abstract     = {METTL3, a key enzyme in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, plays a crucial role in the progression of renal fibrosis, particularly in chronic active renal allograft rejection (CAR). This study explored the mechanisms by which METTL3 promotes renal allograft fibrosis, focusing on its role in the macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT). Using a comprehensive experimental approach, including TGF-β1-induced MMT cell models, METTL3 conditional knockout (METTL3 KO) mice, and renal biopsy samples from patients with CAR, the study investigates the involvement of METTL3/Smad3 axis in driving MMT and renal fibrosis during the episodes of CAR. We found that elevated m6A modification and METTL3 levels strongly correlated with enhanced MMT and increased fibrotic severity. METTL3 knockout (METTL3 KO) significantly increased the m6A modification of Smad3, decreased Smad3 expression, and inhibited M2-driven MMT. Smad3 knockdown with siRNA (siSmad3) further inhibited M2-driven MMT, while Smad3 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effects of METTL3 silencing, restoring M2-driven MMT and fibrotic tissue damage. Additionally, the METTL3 inhibitor STM2457 effectively reversed M2-driven MMT and alleviated fibrotic tissue damage in CAR. These findings highlight that METTL3 enhances M2-driven MMT in renal fibrosis during CAR by promoting the TGF-β1/Smad3 axis, suggesting that METTL3 is a promising therapeutic target for mitigating renal fibrosis in CAR.},

  abstract     = {Hemodynamic stabilization is crucial in managing acute cardiac events, where compromised blood flow can lead to severe complications and increased mortality. Conditions like decompensated heart failure (HF) and cardiogenic shock require rapid and effective hemodynamic support. Current mechanical assistive devices, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), offer temporary stabilization but are limited to short-term use due to risks associated with prolonged blood contact. This research presents a novel proof-of-concept soft robotic device designed with the aim of achieving low-risk, medium-term counterpulsation therapy. The device employs a nature-inspired growing mechanism for potentially minimally invasive deployment around the ascending aorta, coupled with hydraulic artificial muscles for aortic compression. It demonstrated a maximum stroke volume of 16.48 ± 0.21 mL (SD, n = 5), outperforming all other non-pneumatic extra-aortic devices. In addition, in vitro tests with a mock circulation loop (MCL) show a drop in aortic end-diastolic pressure by 6.32 mmHg and enhance coronary flow under mild aortic stenosis, which attenuate the device&#39;s assistive effect. These findings highlight the device&#39;s strong potential for optimization as a promising solution to improve outcomes for hemodynamically unstable HF patients.},

  abstract     = {Polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) molecules reveal narrowband emission, making them very promising emitters for high color purity display. Nevertheless, they still have challenges such as aggregation-induced emission quenching and spectral broadening. Overcoming these obstacles requires an in-depth understanding of the correlations among the alterations in their geometries, packing structures, and molecular vibrations and their corresponding changes in their photoluminescence (PL) properties. Herein, it is demonstrated that high-pressure infrared, UV−visible absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies can be combined with computational results to elucidate the influence of the subtle structural variations on the exciton‒vibration couplings and their PL properties. An ortho-carborane-decorated MR emitter (BNC) is a piezochromic molecule and exhibits emission enhancement under high pressure. A thorough analysis of the in situ experimental measurements and calculated results reveals that the pressure-induced changes in the exciton binding energy and exciton‒vibration couplings are responsible for the unusual piezochromism. This research provides insights into the structure‒fluorescence relationship and potential for high-pressure techniques to optimize MR materials for advanced organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications.},

Extracting meaningful physical insights from these datasets is challenging, particularly for multilayer heterogeneous nanoscale structures. In this paper, an unsupervised approach is presented to enhance AFM image contrast by analyzing the nonlinear response of a cantilever interacting with a material&#39;s surface using a wavelet-based AFM. This method simultaneously measures different frequencies and harmonics in a single scan, without the need for additional hardware and exciting multiple cantilevers&#39; eigenmodes. This developed AFM image contrast enhancement (AFM-ICE) approach employs unsupervised learning, image processing, and image fusion techniques. The method is applied to interpret complex multilayer structures consist of defects, deposited nanoparticles and heterogeneities. Its substantial capability is demonstrated to improve image contrast and differentiate between various components.

This study presents an innovative approach that harnesses controlled inflammation to guide neutrophil-mediated drug delivery, effectively overcoming the limitations imposed by tumor heterogeneity. By inducing localized inflammation within tumors using lipopolysaccharide, it significantly amplify the recruitment of drug-laden neutrophils to tumor sites, irrespective of specific tumor markers. This strategy not only enhances targeted drug delivery but also triggers the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, further potentiating the anti-tumor effect. Crucially, this study demonstrates that potential systemic inflammatory responses can be effectively mitigated through neutrophil transfusion, ensuring the safety and clinical viability of this approach. In a murine breast cancer model, the method significantly impedes tumor growth compared to conventional treatments. This work offers a versatile strategy for precise drug delivery across diverse tumor types.

Herein, the potential of GH in disulfidptosis regulation, a novel form of programmed cell death induced by disulfide stress is explored. The omics results indicated that NRF2 signaling could be significantly activated by GH. The potential targets are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and cell death. Moreover, both glutathione (GSH) metabolism and NADP + -NADPH metabolism are affected by GH, indicating the potential in disulfidptosis regulation. It is also observed that GH enhanced the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to disulfidptosis, which is dependent on the activation of NRF2-SLC7A11 pathway. GH significantly increased the levels of NRF2 and promoted the transcription of NRF2 target gene, SLC7A11, through autophagy-mediated non-canonical mechanism. Under the condition of glucose starvation, GH-induced upregulation of SLC7A11 aggravated uptake of cysteine, disturbance of GSH synthesis, depletion of NADPH, and accumulation of disulfide molecules, ultimately leading to the formation of disulfide bonds between different cytoskeleton proteins and disulfidptosis eventually. Collectively, the findings underscore the potential role of GH in promoting cancer cell disulfidptosis, thereby offering a promising avenue for the treatment of drug-resistant HCC in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Gram-positive bacteria pose significant threats to human health, necessitating the development of targeted bacterial detection and eradication strategies. Nevertheless, current approaches often suffer from poor targeting specificity. Herein, the study utilizes purple rice lixivium to synthesize biomass carbon dots (termed BCDs) with wheat germ agglutinin-like residues for precisely targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Subsequently, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules are grafted onto BCDs to yield FITC-labeled BCDs (termed CDFs), which can selectively and rapidly (≤5 min) stain bacterial cell wall and particularly target the peptidoglycan component. Strikingly, CDFs achieve superselective visualization of Gram-positive bacteria even in the presence of mammalian cells and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, protoporphyrin (PpIX) molecules are conjugated onto BCDs to yield PpIX-modified BCDs (termed CDPs), which can induce bacterial aggregation and in situ generate singlet oxygen for realizing enhanced antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT). At the minimum bactericidal concentration of CDPs (PpIX: 5 µg mL −1 ), CDP-mediated PDT disrupts bacterial structure and metabolism pathways, thereby affecting bacterial interactions to eradicate biofilms. Importantly, CDP-mediated PDT efficiently modulates antiinflammatory responses to promote wound healing in the bacteria-infected mice. This study underscores the significance of harnessing renewable and cost-effective biomass resources for preparing Gram-positive bacteria-targeting theranostic agents, which may find potential clinical applications in the future.},

By accessing the single-cell spatial transcriptome of over 25 million neuron cells across the entire macaque cortex, it is discovered that the distribution of neurons within cortical layers is highly non-random. Strikingly, over three-quarters of these neurons are located in distinct neuronal clusters. Within these clusters, different cell types tend to collaborate rather than function independently. Typically, excitatory neuron clusters mainly consist of excitatory-excitatory combinations, while inhibitory clusters primarily contain excitatory-inhibitory combinations. Both cluster types have roughly equal numbers of neurons in each layer. Importantly, most excitatory and inhibitory neuron clusters form spatial partnerships, indicating a balanced local neuronal network and correlating with specific functional regions. These organizational principles are conserved across mouse cortical regions. These findings suggest that different brain regions of the cortex may exhibit similar mechanisms at the neuronal population level.},

Here, by employing a tip-enhanced Raman thermal measurement approach, substantial phonon nonequilibrium in gallium nitride near sub-10 nm laser-excited hotspots is directly revealed for the first time. As further evidence, quantitative agreements between measurements and accurate first-principles-based phonon Boltzmann transport equation calculations are obtained. The large nonequilibrium is attributed to the strong Fröhlich coupling of electrons with longitudinal optical phonons and the large acoustic-optical phonon frequency gap in gallium nitride, which is further demonstrated in other common III-V semiconductors. This work establishes a viable approach for understanding nanoscale nonequilibrium phonon transport and can potentially benefit the future modulation of hot carrier dynamics.},

Optimizing the neutron spectrum can improve the production efficiency of 238 Pu, but currently, it is still a lack of knowledge about the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production. Genetic algorithms and burnup algorithms are combined to identify optimal neutron spectra for 238 Pu production under various irradiation times and flux levels, and build an optimal neutron spectrum database, which answers the questions “What is the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production?” and “What is the maximum efficiency for 238 Pu production” once and for all. This database can be referred to for determining the optimal neutron spectrum, guiding the neutron spectrum regulation process to improve the yield of 238 Pu. Moreover, these results find that the production method of in-reactor irradiation 237 Np not only has a higher yield but also achieves a higher purity of 238 Pu than that of in-reactor irradiation 241 Am, which conflicts with the traditional experiences, providing with previously unknown insights and helping break through the efficiency limit of traditional methods, maximizing 238 Pu production.},

Here, the impacts of plant species and diversity on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in three agricultural soils are comprehensively investigated in a pot experiment. The results indicate that increased plant diversity reduces ARGs and MGEs abundance by 19.2%–51.2%, whereas plant species exhibit inconsistent and soil-dependent effects. Potential bacterial hosts harboring abundant ARGs have greater relative abundance than nonhosts, and both their richness and cumulative relative abundance are reduced by plant diversity. Notably, hosts inhibited by plant diversity present a greater relative abundance than the other hosts. The enriched compounds in root exudates due to plant diversity play a more important role in the metabolic network and contribute to rebalancing of the abundance of potential hosts and nonhosts. An independent test using pure organics reveals that higher resource diversity, resulting from increased plant diversity, reduces the relative abundance and mobility of abundant and high-risk ARGs. This study highlights the resource-mediated mitigation of the risks posed by ARG contamination and indicates that ensuring plant and resource diversity is a promising strategy for controlling ARGs in agroecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Dietary high salt intake is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies have identified a population of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA)-like astrocytes closely linked to amyloid deposition and tau pathology in an AD mouse model. However, the presence and role of these astrocytes in high-salt diet (HSD) models remain unexplored. In this study, it is demonstrated that HSD significantly induces enhanced reactivity of DAA-like astrocytes in the hippocampal CA3 region of mice, with this reactivity being critically dependent on neuronal tau pathology. Neuronal tau pathology activates adenosine A1R signaling, exacerbating tau pathology by inhibiting the Cers1 pathway, which sustains astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, neurons burdened with tau pathology promote astrocyte reactivity via releasing Proteins Associated with Promoting DAA-like Astrocyte Reactivity (PAPD), with Lcn2 playing a pivotal role. Knockout of Lcn2 or its receptor 24p3R significantly mitigates HSD-induced DAA reactivity and neuroinflammation. These findings suggest a vicious cycle between tau pathology and A1R signaling, driving DAA-like astrocyte reactivity. Targeting the Tau-A1R axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing HSD-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative joint disease, prominently influenced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Although elevated IL-6 levels in joint fluid are well-documented, the uneven cartilage degeneration observed in knee OA patients suggests additional underlying mechanisms. This study investigates the role of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) in mediating IL-6 signaling and its contribution to OA progression. Here, significantly elevated IL-6R expression is identified in degenerated cartilage of OA patients. Further, in vivo experiments reveal that intra-articular injection of recombinant IL-6R protein or activation of gp130 (Y757F mutation) accelerates OA progression. Conversely, knockout of IL-6R or JAK2, as well as treatment with a JAK inhibitor, alleviates OA symptoms. Mechanistically, chondrocytes derived from degenerative cartilage exhibit impaired nuclear localization of SOX9, a key regulator of cartilage homeostasis. JAK inhibition stabilizes SIRT1, reduces SOX9 acetylation, and thereby facilitates SOX9 nuclear localization, promoting cartilage repair. Additionally, the JAK inhibitor-induced apoptosis in p21-positive senescent cells, and their targeted clearance successfully alleviates OA in p21-3MR mice. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which inhibiting the IL-6R/JAK2 pathway can alleviate OA. Furthermore, this study proposes targeting p21-positive senescent cells as a new therapeutic strategy for OA.},

  abstract     = {Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been widely adopted in medical and life science researches. Although various physical and biological effects of FUS have been well-documented, there is still a lack of understanding and direct evidence on the biological mechanism of therapeutic cell ablation caused by high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) and the subsequent wound healing responses. This study develops an enclosed cell culture device that synergistically combines non-invasive FUS stimulation and real-time, on-the-fly live-cell imaging, providing an in vitro platform to explore short and long-term biological effects of ultrasound. The process, mechanism, and wound healing response of cell ablation induced by HIFU are elucidated, revealing a unique mechanism, termed ultrasound-inflicted cellular mechanolysis, that is mediated by growing subcellular cavitation air bubbles under confined contact with cells. This provides a previously unappreciated mechanism for understanding the biomechanical principles of ultrasound-based ablative therapy. A post-ablation phantom layer is also revealed that serves as a guiding cue for collective cell migration during wound healing, thereby providing a biomimetic model for studying wound healing after HIFU-inflicted damage. Together, this study provides theoretical and technological basis for advancing the understanding of the biological effects of ultrasound-based ablative therapy and inspiring clinically relevant applications in the future.},

  abstract     = {The advent of biomacromolecules antagonizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). However, frequent intravitreal injections of these biomacromolecules impose an enormous burden on patients and create a massive workload for healthcare providers. This causes patients to abandon therapy, ultimately leading to progressive and irreversible vision loss. In order to address this unmet clinical need, a noninvasive treatment for nAMD is developed. An optimized cell-penetrating peptide derivative, bxy Penetratin (bxyWP), is used to non-covalently complex with the anti-VEGF protein aflibercept (AFL) via reversible hydrophobic interaction. The interaction is crucial for AFL delivery, neither impairing the affinity of AFL to pathological VEGF, nor being interfered by endogenous proteins in tear fluids. AFL/bxyWP eye drops exhibit prolonged retention on the eye and excellent absorption into the posterior ocular segment following topical administration, with significant drug distribution to the retina and choroid. In a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model on cynomolgus monkeys, AFL/bxyWP eye drops efficiently reduce lesion size and leakage comparable to conventional intravitreal injection of AFL. These results suggest that AFL/bxyWP eye drops are feasible self-administered treatment for neovascular retinal diseases and potentially become a substitute for intravitreal injections.},

By combining the continuous activation of the Wnt pathway, through perfusion of CHIR99021, within a mild hypoxia environment, the expansion of hiPSC-CM as aggregates is maximized, reaching 4 billion of pure hiPSC-CM in 2L STB. In particular, the importance of i) controlling the dissolved oxygen at 10% O 2 to reduce reactive oxygen species production and upregulate genes involved in cell proliferation, resulting in higher expansion rates (tenfold) compared to normoxic conditions, and ii) maintaining constant power input per volume as a scale-up criteria is demonstrated. After expansion, hiPSC-CM further mature in culture, revealing more mature transcriptional signatures, higher sarcomere alignment and improved calcium handling.

  abstract     = {3D porous carbon electrodes have attracted significant attention for advancing compressible supercapacitors (SCs) in flexible electronics. The micro- and nanoscale architecture critically influences the mechanical and electrochemical performance of these electrodes. However, achieving a balance between high compressive strength, electrochemical stability, and cost-effective sustainable production remains challenging. Here, a superelastic wood nanocarbon sponge (WNCS) with a wrinkled multilayer structure is developed via a facile “top–down” design on natural wood. These unique wrinkled nanolayers effectively alleviate stress concentration through elastic deformation, resulting in a high compressive strength of 580.6 kPa at 70% reversible strain. The significantly increased specific surface area, coupled with abundant micro-mesopores and highly graphitized nanocarbon, promotes rapid ion/electron transport, enabling the WNCS to achieve an ultrahigh capacitance of 4.21 F cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 , along with excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using a WNCS anode and a NiCo-layered double hydroxide cathode retains 71.8% of its initial capacitance after 1000 compression cycles and withstands stress up to 1.03 MPa without capacitance degradation. This sustainable, cost-effective WNCS shows great promise for flexible, compressible, and wearable electrochemical energy systems.},

The membrane serves as the interface between the circulating air-flow and the ambient water, preventing water flux while allowing an oxygen flux across the membrane, driven by a partial oxygen pressure gradient. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, a prototype system was built based on guidelines derived from a mathematical model that was developed to describe the oxygen transfer process. A computational fluid dynamics model is developed and validated against the measurements from the prototype, resulting in a digital twin. The analysis indicates that the proposed power supply system has the potential to be superior to any battery-based solution currently available.},

Here, a new catalyst with an inverse structure of a supported metal catalyst that consists of metallic iron particles loaded with an aluminum hydride species is reported. The iron catalyst is readily prepared from an α-Fe 2 O 3 precursor and ammonia could be synthesized at more than twice the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst volume of the conventional industrial iron catalyst, even though the specific surface area of the former is only half that of the latter. In addition, ammonia synthesis over the catalyst is observed with a small apparent activation energy at 50 °C. Mechanistic studies suggested that an increase in the active sites with strong electron-donating capability on the iron catalyst significantly increased the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst surface area, which resulted in high catalytic activity/catalyst volume.},

Such systems, however, do not reproduce the types of nuclear deformations expected to occur in cells that line tissues such as endothelial or epithelial cells whose physical confinement stems principally from the topography of their underlying basement membrane. Here, it is shown that endothelial cells and myoblasts cultured on microgroove substrates that mimic the anisotropic topography of the basement membrane exhibit large-scale 3D nuclear deformations, with partial to complete nuclear penetration into the microgrooves. These deformations do not lead to significant DNA damage and are dynamic with nuclei cyclically entering and exiting the microgrooves. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that these deformation cycles are accompanied by transient changes in perinuclear stiffness. Interestingly, nuclear penetration into the grooves is driven principally by cell-substrate adhesion stresses, with a limited need for cytoskeleton-associated forces. Finally, it is demonstrated that myoblasts from laminopathy patients exhibit abnormal nuclear deformations on microgrooves, raising the possibility of using microgroove substrates as a novel functional diagnostic platform for pathologies that involve abnormal nuclear mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Vascular calcification is a highly regulated process in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality, especially in the adverse stage of vascular remodeling after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). However, the pathogenesis of vascular graft calcification, particularly the role of endothelial-smooth muscle cell interaction, is still unclear. To test how ECs interact with SMCs in artery grafts, single-cell analysis of wild-type mice is first performed using an arterial isograft mouse model and found robust cytokine-mediated signaling pathway activation and SMC proliferation, together with upregulated endothelial tripartite motif 35 (TRIM35) expression. Unexpectedly, severe SMC calcification in artery grafts is found in TRIM35 conditional endothelial knockout (cKO) mice. Calcified medium (comprising calcium chloride and beta-glycerophosphate)-induced calcium deposition in vitro is also found in SMCs cocultured with TRIM35 knockout endothelium. This extraordinary phenomenon is further confirmed to be induced by increased MMP10 secretion. Mechanistically, endothelial TRIM35 inhibits MMP10 expression and secretion by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RelB and maintaining its nuclear localization, consequently inhibiting nuclear transcription of MMP10 through the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Targeting MMP10 in situ in arterial isografts can effectively alleviate vascular calcification caused by conditional endothelial TRIM35 knockout. These findings demonstrated that TRIM35 inhibited vascular calcification during arterial isograft remodeling, a process that is driven by the aberrant secretion of endothelial MMP10. Targeting MMP10 pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for vascular calcification in vessel grafts.},

However, due to the undefined chemical structure, toxicity, non-biodegradability, and lack of design technology in many existing adjuvants, it remains difficult to achieve substantive breakthroughs in the adjuvant research field. Here, a novel adjuvant development strategy based on stapling peptides is reported to overcome this challenge. The nano-vaccine incorporating peptide adjuvant and recombinant HBsAg protein not only induced strong antibody titers that are equivalent to aluminum adjuvanted vaccines but also simultaneously activated T-cell immune response. Similar results are also observed in herpes zoster vaccine and more complex influenza vaccine. The mechanism analysis demonstrates that antigen is efficiently carried into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by peptide, further promoting the secretion of cytokines and activation of APCs. In addition, by redesigning the adjuvant, it is found that the sulfonium centers, rather than the sequence of peptide played an important role in immune activation. This discovery may provide a new paradigm for the rational design of peptide-based adjuvants. In brief, this study demonstrates that stapling peptides with sulfonium centers can provide a well-defined, programmable, biocompatible, and effective adjuvant for multiple types of vaccines.},

  abstract     = {Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier results in increased permeability and is a key factor in the onset and progression of Crohn&#39;s disease (CD). The protein SPARC is primarily involved in cell interaction and migration, but its specific role in the intestinal epithelial barrier remains unclear. This study demonstrates that SPARC is significantly overexpressed in both CD patients and murine models of colitis. Furthermore, mice deficient in SPARC exhibits resistance to chemically induced colitis, a phenomenon associated with the modulation of barrier-associated proteins. Mechanistically, it is elucidated that SPARC competitively binds to OTUD4 in conjunction with MYD88, facilitating the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and subsequent activation of the p65-MLCK/MLC2 pathway, thereby compromising barrier integrity. Additionally, it is identified that the elevated expression of SPARC in CD is regulated via the METTL3-YTHDF1 axis. These findings indicate that SPARC levels are elevated in patients with CD and in colitis-induced mice, leading to intestinal barrier damage through direct interaction with OTUD4 and subsequent activation of the MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 signaling pathway. Consequently, targeting SPARC or the OTUD4/MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 axis may offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CD and represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Plants activate defense machinery when infested by herbivorous insects but avoid such costs in the absence of herbivory. However, the key signaling pathway regulators underlying such flexibility and the mechanisms that insects exploit these components to disarm plant defense systems remain elusive. Here, it is reported that immune repressor 14-3-3e in rice Oryza sativa (OsGF14e) regulates immune homeostasis. Infestation with brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens decreased OsGF14e expression; however, the level of downregulation is limited both by the short duration and the specific feeding location. OsGF14e interacts with Enhanced Disease Resistance 1-like (OsEDR1l), a Raf-like MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), and repressed jasmonic acid, jasmonic acid-isoleucine, and H 2 O 2 accumulation by enhancing OsEDR1l abundance and signaling ability. OsGF14e and OsEDR1l overexpression renders rice susceptible to BPH, whereas their knockout increases plant resistance but compromises rice growth and grain yield. Intriguingly, BPH 14-3-3e protein (Nl14) that shares high sequence homology and structural similarity with OsGF14e is identified from BPH saliva and egg-associated secretions. Mediated through BPH feeding and oviposition, Nl14, similar to OsGF14e, interacts with OsEDR1l and triggers the OsEDR1l signaling, thereby suppressing plant defenses and facilitating BPH infestation. Apparently, structural and functional mimicry makes it possible for this newly discovered BPH effector to exploit rice OsGF14e-EDR1l immune suppression module. The results reveal a novel mechanism deployed by herbivorous insects, in a manner similar to certain pathogen effectors, to evade host plant defenses by mimicking host immune regulators.},

Furthermore, this model effectively addresses the challenge of balancing large-scale positive and negative samples, leading to improved performance across various evaluation metrics such as an Area under curve (AUC) of 0.9298 and an F1 score of 0.6316. Moreover, the algorithm accurately predicts drug combinations and achieves an F1 score of 0.7746 after fine-tuning. Additionally, it identifies two previously unexplored synergistic drug combinations for distinct cancer types in disease-specific biological network environments. These findings are further validated through in vitro cytotoxicity assays, demonstrating the potential of the model to enhance drug development and identify effective treatment regimens for specific diseases.},

  abstract     = {MXenzymes, a promising class of catalytic therapeutic material, offer great potential for tumor treatment, but they encounter significant obstacles due to suboptimal catalytic efficiency and kinetics in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, this study draws inspiration from the electronic structure of transition metal vanadium, proposing the leverage of TME specific-features to induce structural transformations in sheet-like vanadium carbide MXenzymes (TVMz). These transformations trigger cascading catalytic reactions that amplify oxidative stress, thereby significantly enhancing multimodal tumor therapy. Specifically, the engineered HTVMz, coated with hyaluronic acid, exhibits good stability and generates a thermal effect under NIR-II laser irradiation. The thermal effect, combined with TME characteristics, facilities a structural transformation into ultra-small vanadium oxide nanozymes (VO x ). The enlarged surface area of VO x substantially enhances ROS regeneration and amplifies oxidative stress, which promotes lysosomal permeability and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. The high-valent vanadium in VO x interacts with intracellular glutathione, disrupting redox homeostasis and intensifying oxidative stress further. These amplifications accelerate tumor apoptosis, induce ferroptosis, and suppress HSP90 expression. Consequently, the heightened thermal sensitivity of HTVMz synergistically promotes tumor cell death via multimodal therapeutic pathways. This study presents an innovative strategy for tumor catalytic therapy by manipulating MXenzymes structures, advancing the field of catalytic therapy.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are commonly considered accomplices in tumorigenesis and tumor development. However, the precise mechanism by which tumor cells prompt TAMs to aid in evading immune surveillance remains to be further investigated. Here, it is elucidated that tumor-secreted galectin-1 (Gal1) conferred immunosuppressive properties to TAMs. Specifically, patient specimens and a public database is first used to analyze the clinical relevance of Gal1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Then, it is demonstrated that TAMs functioned as a critical mediator in the Gal1-induced progression of HCC and the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing determined that Gal1 promoted the upregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) in TAMs via activating the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Employing an anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibody and Foxp3DTR mice, it is demonstrated that CCR6 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruited by Gal1-induced TAMs contributed to reduced infiltration and dysfunctional state of CD8 + T cells, subsequently facilitating tumor progression. Targeting Gal1 dampened the secretion of CCL20 and inhibits the recruitment of Tregs, thereby activating anti-tumor immunity and ameliorating anti-PD-1 resistance. Together, this findings revealed that Gal1-induced TAMs recruited Tregs through the CCL20-CCR6 axis. Inhibition of Gal1 improves the effectiveness of anti-PD1 therapy, shedding important new light on the combination immunotherapy of HCC.},

However, the properties of the hAECs and their proliferative mechanisms remain unclear. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is performed on hAECs obtained from amniotic tissues at different gestational ages and passages during in vitro culture. The results showed that the proliferation of hAECs is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) during amniogenesis. Freshly isolated, full-term hAECs are identified as mature epithelial cells. Once cultured in vitro, they are observed to rapidly undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enter a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) state to regain their EMP properties and proliferation capacities. With the continuous development of EMT, hAECs eventually enter a senescent state. The addition of SB431542 and microcarrier screening enabled the effective 3D expansion of hAECs by 50 fold while maintaining the EMP status in hAECs for further proliferation. This study not only elucidated the central proliferation mechanism of hAECs during development and expansion but also optimized the in vitro culture system so that it is sufficient to generate hAECs for 50 patients from a single donor amniotic membrane.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in obese patients remains challenging. Recent studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of TNBC and malignancies. Through multiomic analysis and experimental validation, a dysfunctional Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit H (EIF3H)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) proteolytic axis is identified as a pivotal junction mediating the interplay between cancer-associated adipocytes and the response to anti-cancer drugs in TNBC. Mechanistically, cancer-associated adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in an upregulated hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This aberrant upregulation of HBP promotes YAP O-GlcNAcylation and the subsequent recruitment of EIF3H deubiquitinase, which stabilizes YAP, thus promoting tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. It is found that Retatrutide, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits HBP and YAP O-GlcNAcylation leading to increased YAP degradation through the deprivation of EIF3H-mediated deubiquitylation of YAP. In preclinical models of obese TNBC, Retatrutide downregulates HBP, decreases YAP protein levels, and consequently decreases tumor size and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. This effect is particularly pronounced in obese mice bearing TNBC tumors. Overall, these findings reveal a critical interplay between adipocyte-mediated metabolic reprogramming and EIF3H-mediated YAP proteolytic control, offering promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on TNBC progression.},

However, the development of nasal mRNA vaccines has been hampered by the lack of effective means to overcome the mucus barrier. Herein, ionizable lipid-incorporated liquid lipid nanoparticles (iLLNs) capable of delivering mRNA cargo across airway mucosa are designed. Adjusting the ratios of ionizable and cationic lipids allows fine-tuning of the p K a of iLLNs to the range of nasal mucosal pH (5.5–6.5), thus facilitating mucus penetration via the formation of near-neutral, PEGylated muco-inert surfaces. When nasally administered to mice, the top candidate iLLN-2/mRNA complexes enable about 60-fold greater reporter gene expression in the nasal cavity, compared to the benchmark mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (ALC-LNP) having the same lipid composition as that of BNT162b2 vaccine. Moreover, a prime-boost intranasal immunization of iLLN-2/mRNA complexes elicits a greater magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific mucosal IgA and IgG response than ALC-LNP, without triggering any noticeable inflammatory reactions. Taken together, these results provide useful insights for the design of nasally deliverable mRNA formulations for prophylactic applications.},

  abstract     = {Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with well-established metabolic risk factors, especially hyperlipidemia and obesity. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mIRI) significantly offsets the therapeutic efficacy of revascularization. Previous studies indicated that disrupted lipid homeostasis can lead to lipid peroxidation damage and inflammation, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the study demonstrates that hyperlipidemia is a key driver of mIRI. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) is upregulated in both hyperlipidemia and AMI patients. ACSL1 expression is induced by a high-fat microenvironment (oxLDL and palmitic acid) in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, the protein level is positively correlated with total cholesterol level and thromboinflammatory biomarkers. Furthermore, ACSL1 reprogrammed lipid metabolism in monocytes, leading to the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)/lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The monocytic LPC/LPA axis accelerated lipid peroxidation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-induced thromboinflammation via the paracrine effect. The main LPA producer Autotaxinis is also induced under high-fat conditions and then exerts thromboinflammation response through converted LPC to LPA. Finally, ACSL1 knockdown or NETs release inhibitor (DNase I or GSK484) significantly alleviated mIRI in mice. These findings highlight ACSL1 and NETosis as potential key targets for preventing mIRI and underscore the lipid peroxidation in the mechanisms of ACSL1-mediated thromboinflammation.},

  abstract     = {Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly prevalent yet neglected health burden for women. Strengthening the pelvic floor with bioactive tissue-engineered meshes is an emerging concept. This study investigates tissue regenerative design parameters, including degradability, porosity, and angulation, to develop alternative degradable melt electrowritten (MEW) constructs for surgical applications of POP. MEW constructs were fabricated in hierarchical geometries by two-way stacking of the fibers with three different inter layer angles of 90°, 45°, or 22.5°. Implants printed at 22.5° have higher tensile strength under dry conditions and show better vaginal fibroblast (VF) attachment in vitro. In vivo assessment using preclinical mouse and ovine models demonstrates more effective degradation and improved tissue integration in 22.5° angular meshes compared to 90° and 45° meshes, with evidence of neo-collagen deposition within implants at 6 weeks. The pattern and geometry of the layered MEW implants also influence the foreign body response, wherein the anti-inflammatory phenotype shows a greater ratio of anti-inflammatory CD206+ M2 macrophages/pro-inflammatory CCR7+ M1 macrophages. This presents an attractive strategy for improving the design and fabrication of next-generation vaginal implants for pelvic reconstructive surgery.},

  abstract     = {Aspartate (Asp) metabolism-mediated antioxidant functions have important implications for neonatal growth and intestinal health; however, the antioxidant mechanisms through which Asp regulates the gut microbiota and influences RIP activation remain elusive. This study reports that chronic oxidative stress disrupts gut microbiota and metabolite balance and that such imbalance is intricately tied to the perturbation of Asp metabolism. Under normal conditions, in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that exogenous Asp improves intestinal health by regulating epithelial cell proliferation, nutrient uptake, and apoptosis. During oxidative stress, Asp reduces Megasphaera abundance while increasing Ruminococcaceae . This reversal effect depends on the enhanced production of the antioxidant eicosapentaenoic acid mediated through Asp metabolism and microbiota. Mechanistically, the application of exogenous Asp orchestrates the antioxidant responses in enterocytes via the modulation of the RIP3-MLKL and RIP1-Nrf2-NF-κB pathways to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species and maintain mitochondrial functionality and cellular survival. These results demonstrate that Asp signaling alleviates oxidative stress by dynamically modulating the gut microbiota and RIP-dependent mitochondrial function, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress disease treatment.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc ion batteries are often adversely affected by the poor stability of zinc metal anodes. Persistent water-induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth have seriously damaged the long-term service life of aqueous zinc ion batteries. In this paper, it is reported that a zinc sulfide with optimized electron arrangement on the surface of zinc anode is used to modify the zinc anode to achieve long-term cycle stability of zinc anode. The effective active sites of the zinc metal anode surface are first significantly improved by a simple ultrasound-assisted etching strategy, and then the in situ zinc sulfide interface phase further guides the zinc ion deposition behavior on the surface of the zinc metal anode. The zinc sulfide protective layer well regulates the interfacial electric field and the migration of Zn 2+ , thereby significantly promoting the homogenization of zinc ion flux to achieve dendrite-free deposition. In addition, the aqueous zinc ion full cell assembled based on ZnS@3D-Zn anode achieves better output performance in long-term cycles. In summary, this work sheds light on the importance of reasonable interfacial modification for the development of dendrite-free and stable zinc anode chemistry, which opens up a new path for promoting the development of zinc-based batteries.},

Traditional perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomers encounter challenges in meeting these stringent requirements. Herein, this study reports a perfluoroimide multi-acid (PFMA) ionomer with dual active centers achieved through the incorporation of sulfonimide and phosphonic acid groups into the side chain. The fluorocarbon skeleton and multi-acid side chain structure facilitate the segregation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic microphases, augmenting the short-range ordering of hydrophilic nanodomains. Furthermore, the introduction of a rigid segment-benzene ring is employed to decrease side chain flexibility and raise the glass transition temperature. Notably, the prepared membrane exhibits a conductivity of 41 mS cm −1 at 40% relative humidity, showcasing a 1.8 times improvement over that of PFSA. Additionally, the power output of the H 2 -air fuel cell based on this membrane reaches 1.5 W cm −2 at 105 °C, marking a substantial 2.3 times enhancement compared to the PFSA. This work demonstrates the unique advantages of perfluorinated ionomers with multiple protogenic groups in the development of high-performance high-temperature electrolyte materials.},

  abstract     = {To enable in vitro investigation of human skin immunology, this study develops a microfluidic human skin equivalent (HSE) that supports the delivery of circulating immune cells via a vascular microchannel embedded within the dermis of a full-thickness construct. Within this platform, activation of keratinocyte inflammation promotes monocyte migration out of the vascular channel and into the dermal and epidermal compartments. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals dynamic and cell-specific patterns of gene expression that are characteristic of acute activation and resolution of an inflammatory immune response, and the gene signatures of the monocyte-derived cells closely matches the differentiation trajectory of the monocytes into mature dermal macrophages. The microfluidic HSE is also applied to modeling age-associated immune dysfunction and accurately replicates elevated monocyte recruitment in aged skin. Thus, the microfluidic HSE presented here replicates key aspects of dynamic inflammatory immune responses and represents a tractable experimental tool for interrogating mechanisms of human skin immunology.},

  abstract     = {The unavoidable self-reduction of Bismuth (Bi)-based catalysts to zero-valence Bi often results in detrimental adsorption of OCHO * , leading to unsatisfactory selectivity of HCOOH in the electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). A novel Bi-tannin (Bi-TA) complex is developed, which undergoes in situ reconstruction into a Bi/Bi₂O₂CO₃ phase during CO 2 reduction. This reconstructed catalyst exhibits high activity and selectivity, achieving a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for formate production exceeding 90%, peaking at 96%. Operando spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal that the Bi δ+ active site in Bi/Bi₂O₂CO₃ significantly enhances the formation of the OCHO * intermediate, crucial for formate production. The study offers a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of Bi-based catalysts in CO 2 reduction to formate.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves the recombination of diamagnetic hydroxyl (OH) or water (H 2 O) into the paramagnetic triplet state of oxygen (O 2 ). The spin conservation of oxygen intermediates plays a crucial role in OER, however, research on spin dynamics during the catalytic process remains in its early stages. Herein, β -Ni(OH) 2 and Fe-doped β -Ni(OH) 2 (Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 ) are utilized as model catalysts to understand the mechanism of spin magnetic effects at iron (III) sites during OER. Combined with magnetic characterization, it is founded that the introduction of Fe transforms the antiferromagnetic Ni(OH) 2 into a ferromagnetic material. Testing the magnetic response of the catalyst under an external magnetic field, the OER activity of Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 is significantly enhanced in comparison to Ni(OH) 2 . This improvement is likely due to the introduction of iron sites, which promote spin magnetic effects and enhance reaction kinetics, thereby increasing catalytic efficiency. Combining experimental and theoretical characterization, it is discovered that the iron sites accelerate the formation of heterogeneous dual-site O─O bridging, represented as ─Ni─O─O─Fe─, thereby effectively enhancing the kinetics of the OER reaction. This study provides a magnetic perspective on the structure-function relationship of magnetic iron-based catalysts and has significant implications for the design of new catalysts.},

Despite its potential, progress in this domain is constrained by material limitations and the intricate nature of the underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have achieved efficient regulation of ferroelectric polarization and thermal conductivity in chiral ferroelectric thin films through the application of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light (LCP and RCP). Differential absorption of circularly polarized light (CPL) induces nonequilibrium carrier dynamics, generating distinctive interfacial electrostatic fields that enable precise control of ultrathin ferroelectric films. For (R)-BINOL−DIPASi and (S)-BINOL−DIPASi (C 26 H 26 O 2 Si), polarization changes surpass 23%, exhibiting opposite response under LCP and RCP excitation. In R chiral films, remnant polarization decreases from 1.05 µC cm − 2 under LCP to 0.85 µC cm − 2 under RCP, whereas in S chiral films, polarization increases from 0.85 µC cm − 2 under LCP to 0.98 µC cm − 2 under RCP. This reversible modulation facilitates reliable switching between ON and OFF states, presenting the potential of chiral ferroelectric materials for flexible, high-speed integrated photonic sensor technologies.},

Progress in designing these materials is limited to complex structures. There is a significant need to develop an alloy-based anode that can be industrially manufactured and offers high reversible capacity. This necessitates a profound understanding of the interplay between structural changes and electrochemical performance. Here, operando X-ray imaging is used to correlate the morphological evolution to electrochemical performance in foil and foam systems. The 3D Sn-foam-like structure electrode is fabricated in-house as a practical approach to accommodate the volume expansion and alleviate the mechanical stress experienced upon alloying/dealloying. Results show that generating pores in Sn electrodes can help manage the volume expansion and mitigate the severe mechanical stress in thick electrodes during alloying/dealloying processes. The foam electrode demonstrates superior electrochemical performance compared to non-porous Sn foil with an equivalent absolute capacity.

The experimental results demonstrate that the deoxygenation dynamics are governed by the interaction between the hydrogen partial pressure and the surface area of the hydrogen plasma arc irradiation range. Furthermore, the results of the detailed characterization of the recycled titanium alloys indicate that hydrogen plasma arc technology not only reduces the oxygen content to levels compliant with industrial standards for Ti-6Al-4 V but also substantially enhances the tensile strength and ductility of Ti-6Al-4 V compared with those of conventional cast titanium alloys. The results of microstructural analysis show that hydrogen tends to concentrate in the β phase, whereas oxygen is predominantly found in the α phase.

Cardiac resident macrophages (CRMs) are the primary mediators of cardiac immunity, and they serve a dual role through their shaping of both myocardial injury and post-AMI myocardial repair. To appropriately regulate AMI-associated inflammation, HM4oRL is herein designed, an innovative bifunctional therapeutic nanoplatform capable of inhibiting cardiomyocyte pyroptosis while reprogramming inflammatory signaling. This HM4oRL platform is composed of a core of 4-Octyl itaconate (4-OI)-loaded liposomes, a middle layer consisting of a metal-polyphenol network (MPN) film, and an optimized outer hybrid immune-cell membrane layer. The unique properties of this hybrid membrane layer facilitated HM4oRL targeting to the injured myocardium during early-stage AMI in mice, whereupon the release of 4-Ol and modified MPN synergistically inhibited cardiomyocyte pyroptosis while suppressing inflammatory monocytes/macrophage responses at the infarcted site. Mechanistically, HM4oRL preserved cardiac metabolic homeostasis through AMPK signaling activation, establishing favorable microenvironmental conditions for the reprogramming of CRM-mediated inflammation. Ultimately, HM4oRL treatment is able to resolve inflammation, enhance neovascularization, and suppress myocardial fibrosis, reducing the infarct size and enhancing post-AMI cardiac repair such that it is an innovative approach to the targeted treatment of AMI.},

  abstract     = {Ruthenium (Ru)-based electrocatalysts have shown promise for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) due to their ability to facilitate water dissociation in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their performance is limited by strong hydrogen binding, which hinders hydrogen desorption and water re-adsorption. This study reports the development of RuNi nanoalloys supported on MoO 2 , which optimize the hydrogen binding strength at Ru sites through modulation by adjacent Ni atoms. Theoretical simulations reveal that substituting Ni atoms for adjacent Ru atoms reduces the high hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy on Ru while maintaining a low energy barrier for water dissociation. As a result, the RuNi/MoO₂ catalyst shows excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of 51 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm⁻ 2 , outperforming commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, RuNi/MoO₂ demonstrates high turnover frequency (7.06 s −1 ), mass activity (13.4 A mg −1 ), and price activity (1030.77 A dollar −1 ). In an AEMWE cell, RuNi/MoO₂ as the cathode catalyst achieves a current density of 1 A cm −2 at 60 °C with just 1.7 V using 1 m KOH.

However, the exact role of PBRM1 in iCCA and the mechanism by which it regulates downstream target genes remain unclear. This research has revealed that PBRM1 is significantly downregulated in iCCA tissues, and this reduced expression is linked to aggressive clinicopathological features and a poor prognosis. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that PBRM1 can impede iCCA progression, and a gene therapy nanomedicine is developed to treat iCCA in vivo by modulating PBRM1 expression. The heightened expression of PBRM1 induces by the nanomedicine substantially inhibited tumor growth in iCCA. Conversely, the decrease in PBRM1 results in the abnormal activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, a reduction in p16, p53/p21, and cellular senescence, thereby promoting iCCA advancement. Treatment with U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, effectively halted iCCA progression by regulating the PBRM1-ERK1/2-cellular senescence pathway. These findings underscore the significant role of PBRM1 in controlling iCCA progression and predicting prognosis.

The role of operando XAS is also explored in analyzing conversion-type S-based cathodes, where it helps unravel the intricate reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges of in situ cell design for operando XAS, especially under ultrahigh vacuum conditions for soft XAS.

Mechanistically, human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6 and E7 upregulate TUBORF through CREB-binding protein (CBP)/E1A-binding protein p300 (p300)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) of lncTUBA3FP enhancer. Furthermore, E6 and E7 elevate and recruit acetyltransferase establishment of sister chromatid cohesion N-acetyltransferase 1 (ESCO1) to bind to and acetylate TUBORF, which facilitates the degradation of immunity-related GTPase Q (IRGQ) via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in the inhibition of ferroptosis and promotion of the malignant proliferation of CC cells. Importantly, silencing ESCO1 or TURORF amplifies anticancer effects by paclitaxel both in CC cells and in vivo. These novel findings reveal oncopeptide TUBORF and its acetyltransferase ESCO1 as important regulators of ferroptosis and tumorigenesis during cervical cancer pathogenesis and establish the scientific basis for targeting these molecules for treating CC.},

  abstract     = {T-cell lymphoma (TCL) is a group of non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma with high heterogeneity and unfavorable prognosis. Current standard treatments have demonstrated limited efficacy in improving the outcomes for TCL patients. Therefore, identification of novel drug targets is urgently needed to improve the prognosis of TCL patients. Through multi-omics analysis, aberrant expression of threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK) in TCL is identified. High expression of TTK is closely associated with poor prognosis in TCL patients. Targeting TTK through gene knockdown exerts anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo, including inhibiting the cell proliferation, inducing G2/M phase arrest, enhancing DNA damage and cell apoptosis. Mechanically, p38α is identified as the potential phosphorylation substrate of TTK through phosphoproteomic quantification and motif prediction. Furthermore, inhibition of TTK suppresses activation of p38α through dephosphorylating it at Thr180/Tyr182, thereby promoting the activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway. In addition, targeting TTK enhances the autophagy in TCL cells through dephosphorylating p38α. CFI-402257, a specific inhibitor of TTK, is found to exhibit anti-tumor effects and exerted synergistic efficacy with PI3K inhibitor, Duvelisib, in TCL. The study shows that TTK contributes to the development of TCL by regulating p38α-mediated AMPK/mTOR pathway. CFI-402257 is expected to be a promising strategy for TCL treatment.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral optoacoustic tomography is a promising medical imaging modality that combines light and sound to provide molecular imaging information at depths of several centimeters, based on the optical absorption of endogenous chromophores, such as hemoglobin. Assessment of inflammatory bowel disease has emerged as a promising clinical application of optoacoustic tomography. In this context, preclinical studies in animal models are essential to identify novel disease-specific imaging biomarkers and understand findings from emerging clinical pilot studies, however to-date, these studies have been limited by the precise identification of the bowel wall. Herein, a transrectal-absorber guide is applied, serving as a high-contrast landmark for 3D optoacoustic tomography of the colon. This study shows that guided multispectral optoacoustic tomography is able to measure changes in blood oxygenation status over the course of acute, chemically-induced colitis in mice and correlates with standard disease activity scores. This novel approach depicts intestinal hemoglobin composition non-invasively during murine inflammation. These results underscore the potential for optoacoustic imaging in translational inflammatory bowel disease research.},

The rapid development of nanoenzyme technology presents a promising therapeutic paradigm for the rational and targeted treatment of GBM. In this review, the underlying mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis are comprehensively discussed, emphasizing the impact of the BBB on treatment strategies. Recent advances in nanoenzyme-based approaches for GBM therapy are explored, highlighting how these nanoenzymes enhance various treatment modalities through their multifunctional capabilities and potential for precise drug delivery. Finally, the challenges and therapeutic prospects of translating nanoenzymes from laboratory research to clinical application, including issues of stability, targeting efficiency, safety, and regulatory hurdles are critically analyzed.

  abstract     = {Imaging luminescence kinetics is invaluable in many fields, including biology and chemistry. However, the luminescence lifetime of most photo-activated states is in the low ns-µs range and its measurement requires adding costly image intensifiers to cameras to access the fast phenomena present. Here, the Rectified Imaging under Optical Modulation (RIOM) and Heterodyne Imaging under Optical Modulation (HIOM) protocols make this possible with standard low-cost cameras only, even under ambient light. RIOM and HIOM originate from a thorough theoretical analysis, which showed that modulated illumination of any reversibly photoactivable luminophore probed at high frequency generates components of the luminescence response that are detectable at low frequency: RIOM harnesses the mean luminescence response to modulated light at a single frequency, whereas HIOM exploits the luminescence response to modulated light at two close frequencies. When the luminophore behavior obeys a two-state model, the frequency dependence of the RIOM and HIOM observables can be used to extract a photoactivation time. In this work, their ability to retrieve maps of the luminescence lifetime of a reversibly photoswitchable protein, and phosphorescent microsensors are demonstrated. Where the luminophore does not obey a two-state model, RIOM and HIOM can still retrieve rich information, as here exemplified by the recovery of kinetic fingerprints of the physiological state of a plant.},

Herein, we first report that secernin 2 (SCRN2), an uncharacterized gene in human cancer, acts as a novel tumor suppressor in TNBC to inhibit cancer progression and enhance therapeutic sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. SCRN2 is downregulated in TNBC through chaperone-mediated autophagic degradation, and its downregulation is associated with poor patient prognosis. Moreover, SCRN2 impedes the proteasomal degradation of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) by recruiting Bcl2-associated athanogene 2 to block the interaction of KMT2C with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP. Consistently, SCRN2 transcriptionally activates Bcl2-modifying factor by amplifying histone H3 monomethylation at lysine 4 at its enhancer, thereby inducing intrinsic apoptosis. Notably, KMT2C knockdown restores the impaired TNBC progression caused by SCRN2 overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SCRN2 decreases the expression of key DNA repair-related genes and induces endogenous DNA damage, thus conferring therapeutic sensitivity of TNBC cells to PARP inhibition.   Collectively, these findings identify SCRN2 as a novel suppressor of TNBC, reveal its mechanism of action, and highlight its potential role in TNBC therapy.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis. The natural compound pristimerin has shown promising anti-tumor effect. Here, it is found that pristimerin significantly triggered the activation of autophagy initiation and induced apoptosis in TNBC. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing revealed that pristimerin activated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracelluar regulated protein kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway. Drug affinity responsive target stability and mass spectrometry techniques are employed to confirm the direct binding target of pristimerin. Heat shock protein family A member 8 (HSPA8) is identified and verified by cellular thermal shift assays and surface plasmon resonance assays. The further results suggested that pristimerin promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of HSPA8, leading to a decrease in the degradation of Vac Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 1 (VAV1), a downstream client protein of HSPA8 which plays a crucial role in activating the ERK pathway. Importantly, knockdown of HSPA8 or VAV1 significantly impaired the anticancer activity of pristimerin on TNBC cells. Additionally, pristimerin significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of TNBC cells and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to doxorubicin. Collectively, this study provides the initial evidence that pristimerin directly targets HSPA8 to activate the VAV1/ERK pathway, thereby promoting cell autophagy and apoptosis.},

The intestine, owing to its distinct structure and physiological environment, plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. It functions as the “central organ” or “engine” in the progression of sepsis, with intestinal injury exacerbating the condition. Despite the availability of current therapies that offer partial symptom relief, they fall short of adequately protecting the intestinal barrier. In this study, an advanced nanodrug formulation (OLA@MΦ NPs) is developed by coating macrophage membranes onto polymeric organic nanoparticles encapsulating olaparib.

Upon oral administration in septic mice, these capsules withstand gastric acid and release their contents in the intestine, specifically targeting injured tissues. The released OLA@MΦ NPs effectively neutralize pro-inflammatory cytokines via macrophage membrane receptors, while olaparib inhibits intestinal epithelial parthanatos (a form of programmed cell death) by suppressing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation.

Bidirectional stepwise logistic regression is employed to identify significant variables, facilitating the construction of a prognostic model, which is benchmarked against four machine learning algorithms.

Patients from Xiangya Hospital are stratified into high-risk (n = 11) and low-risk (n = 30) groups. RNA sequencing revealed an enrichment of immune-related pathways, particularly the interferon (IFN) pathway in the low-risk group. Immune cell infiltration analysis identified a significant presence of CD8 + -T cells, IFNγ-6/-18 in the low-risk group, suggesting an immunologically favorable tumor microenvironment.

This study introduces a novel collagen-lignin sponge (CLS), a renewable biomass-based material that combines collagen&#39;s acoustic properties with lignin&#39;s structural benefits. CLSs demonstrate high porosity (&gt;0.97), lightweight (10 mg cm − 3 ), and exceptional broadband noise absorption performance (sound absorption coefficient exceeding 0.9 across 2000–6300 Hz). Due to their unique hierarchical and aligned pore structure, CLSs display superior low-frequency sound-absorbing capabilities and a high noise-reduction coefficient of 0.64 (for a 30-mm-thick sample). A geometric model is also developed to evaluate and predict the sound absorption performance with high consistency to the experimental results. Additionally, the inclusion of lignin as a green crosslinker has significantly improved the thermal stability and compressive strength by ≈600% compared to collagen sponges alone.

  abstract     = {Circularly Polarized Light (CPL)-dependent anomalous photovoltaic effect (APVE), characterized by light helicity-manipulated steady photocurrent and above-bandgap photovoltage, has demonstrated significant potential in the fields of photoelectronic and photovoltaics. However, exploiting CPL-dependent APVE in chiral hybrid perovskites, a promising family with intrinsic chiroptical activity and non-centrosymmetric structure, remains challenging. Here, leveraging the flexible structural design of chiral alternating cations intercalation-type perovskites, CPL-dependent APV, for the first time, is achieved in chiral perovskites. Specifically, by introducing lone pair electrons into the organic layers to greatly amplify the polarization, [(R)-PPA](MOPA)PbBr 4 ( 2-R ) (PPA = 1-phenylpropylammonium, MOPA = 3-methoxypropylammonium) exhibit intrinsic APVE with an above-bandgap photovoltage of 6.50 V ( E g = 3.01 eV) under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination. Strikingly, profiting from the natural chiral optical activity of chiral perovskites, unprecedented UV CPL-dependent APV is realized in 2-R , driving the high distinguishability between right-hand and left-hand CPLs with a large anisotropy factor ( g Iph ) of 0.33. This study pioneers the realization of CPL-dependent APV within chiral perovskite, promising significant advancements in optoelectronic device technologies.},

  abstract     = {Fano resonances in photonics arise from the coupling and interference between two resonant modes in structures with broken symmetry. They feature an uneven and narrow and tunable lineshape and are ideally suited for optical spectroscopy. Many Fano resonance structures have been suggested in nanophotonics over the last ten years, but reconfigurability and tailored design remain challenging. Herein, an all-optical “pick-and-place” approach aimed at assembling Fano metamolecules of various geometries and compositions in a reconfigurable manner is proposed. Their coupling behavior by in situ dark-field scattering spectroscopy is studied. Driven by a light-directed opto-thermoelectric field, silicon nanoparticles with high-quality-factor Mie resonances (discrete states) and low-loss BaTiO 3 nanoparticles (continuum states) are assembled into all-dielectric heterodimers, where distinct Fano resonances are observed. The Fano parameter can be adjusted by changing the resonant frequency of the discrete states or the light polarization. Tunable coupling strength and multiple Fano resonances by altering the number of continuum states and discrete states in dielectric heterooligomers are also shown. This work offers a general design rule for Fano resonance and an all-optical platform for controlling Fano coupling on demand.},

  abstract     = {Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by reduced platelet levels and heightened susceptibility to bleeding resulting from augmented autologous platelet destruction and diminished thrombopoiesis. Although antibody-mediated autoimmune reactions are widely recognized as primary factors, the precise etiological agents that trigger ITP remain unidentified. The pathogenesis of ITP remains unclear owing to the absence of comprehensive high-throughput data, except for the belated emergence of autoreactive antibodies. In this study, using flow cytometry (FCM), proteomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing of samples from patients with ITP, it is shown that exosome-mediated lectin complement pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of ITP, which triggers and enlarges the complement activation cascade without effective regulation because of downregulated CD55. The activated complement system enhances the immune response and resistin and further Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) triggers several proinflammatory signaling pathways, which contribute to the survival of hyperactivated immune cells and dysfunctional arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. The resistin and MIF are also identified as potential contributors to resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Taken together, the findings indicate that the lectin pathway of the complement system, resistin, MIF, and AA metabolism may serve as promising targets for ITP treatment, offering novel perspectives on potential therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {Sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction is an emerging class of click chemistry reaction. Owing to its efficient reactivity under physiological conditions, SuFEx reaction is used to construct covalent protein drugs. Herein, a covalent affibody-molecular glue drug conjugate nanoagent is reported, which can irreversibly bind with its target protein through proximity-enabled SuFEx reaction. As a proof of concept, a latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid fluorosulfate-L-tyrosine (FSY) is first introduced at site 36 of the affibody with cysteine mutation (Z HER2:342 -Cys) to produce Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -Cys. Subsequently, Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -Cys is coupled with a molecular glue drug (CR8) to yield an amphiphilic conjugate of Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8, which can self-assemble into affibody–drug conjugate nanoagent (Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN) in PBS. When Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN specific binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on cancer cells, the FSY36 of Z HER2:342 approaches to the His490 of HER2 and ultimately reacts with each other to form a covalent bond via SuFEx reaction. Such a covalent binding mode endows Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN with permanent binding ability to effectively increase the concentration of drugs in tumor. Eventually, the covalent Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN exhibits an outstanding tumor inhibition ratio of 90.03 ± 4.29% in HER2-positive ovary tumor models, strikingly higher than that of the noncovalent one (64.25 ± 7.71%).},

  abstract     = {Denervated muscle atrophy, a common outcome of nerve injury, often results in irreversible fibrosis due to the limited effectiveness of current therapeutic interventions. While extracellular vesicles (EVs) offer promise for treating muscle atrophy, their therapeutic potential is hindered by challenges in delivery and bioactivity within the complex microenvironment of the injury site. To address this issue, an injectable hydrogel is developed that is responsive to both ultrasound and pH, with inherent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, designed to improve the targeted delivery of stem cell-derived EVs. This hydrogel system allows for controlled release of EVs from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs), adapting to the specific conditions of the injury environment. In vivo studies using a rat model of nerve injury demonstrated that the EV-loaded hydrogel (EVs@UR-gel) significantly preserved muscle function. Six weeks post-nerve reconstruction, treated rats exhibited muscle strength, circumference, and wet weight reaching 89.53 ± 0.96%, 76.02 ± 7.49%, and 88.0 ± 2.65% of healthy controls, respectively, alongside an improvement in the sciatic nerve index (−0.11 ± 0.09). This platform presents a novel therapeutic approach by maintaining EV bioactivity, enabling tunable release based on the disease state, and facilitating the restoration of muscle structure and function.},

  abstract     = {Partial oxidation of methane (POM) is achieved by forming air-methane microbubbles in saltwater to which an alternating electric field is applied using a copper oxide foam electrode. The solubility of methane is increased by putting it in contact with water containing dissolved KCl or NaCl (3%). Being fully dispersed as microbubbles (20–40 µm in diameter), methane reacts more fully with hydroxyl radicals (OH·) at the gas-water interface. The alternating voltage (100 mV) generates two synergistic POM processes dominated by Cl − → Cl· + e − and O 2 + e − → O 2 −• under positive and negative potentials, respectively. By tuning the frequency and amplitude, the extent and path of the POM process can be precisely controlled so that more than 90% methanol is selectively formed compared to the two byproducts, dichloromethane, and acetic acid. The methane to methanol conversion yield is estimated to be 57% at a rate of approximately 887 µM h −1 . This method appears to have potential for removing methane from air using seawater or for converting higher-concentration methane sources into value-added methanol.},

  abstract     = {Current treatments for ulcerative colitis (UC) remain limited, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Trilobatin (TLB), a naturally derived food additive, exhibits potential anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced animal model is used to investigate the effects of TLB on UC. It is found TLB significantly alleviates DSS-induced UC in mice, as evidenced by a reduction in the disease activity index, an increase in colon length, improvement in histopathological lesions. Furthermore, TLB treatment results in a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. TLB mitigates UC by modulating the intestinal microbiota, particularly Akkermansia , which enhances tryptophan metabolism and upregulates the production of xanthurenic acid (XANA). To confirm the role of TLB-induced microbiota changes, experiments are performed with pseudogerm-free mice and fecal transplantation. It is also identified XANA as a key metabolite that mediates TLB&#39;s protective effects. Both TLB and XANA markedly activate the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Administration of an AhR antagonist abrogates their protective effects, thereby confirming the involvement of AhR in the underlying mechanism. In conclusion, the study reveals a novel mechanism through which TLB alleviates UC by correcting microbiota imbalances, regulating tryptophan metabolism, enhancing XANA production, and activating AhR.},

The results showed that reduced oxygen levels in the small intestine of neonatal rats induced by Saccharomyces boulardii accelerated microbiome colonization and type 3 immunity development, which protected against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection. Microbiome maturation increased the abundance of microbiome-encoded bile salt hydrolase ( BSH ) genes and hyocholic acid (HCA) levels. Furthermore, reducing oxygen levels in the intestine increased the abundance of Limosilactobacillus reuteri , a bacterium encoding BSH , and promoted intestinal type 3 immunity. However, inhibition of BSH blocked the L. reuteri- induced development of intestinal type 3 immunity. Mechanistically, HCA promoted the development of gamma-delta T cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells by stabilizing the mRNA expression of RAR-related orphan receptor C via the farnesoid X receptor–WT1-associated protein-N6-methyl-adenosine axis. These results reveal that gut microbiota-derived HCA plays a crucial role in promoting the development of intestinal type 3 immunity in neonates.

  abstract     = {Bacterial keratitis (BK) is a type of corneal inflammation resulting from bacterial infection in the eye. Although nanozymes have been explored as promising materials in corneal wound healing, currently available nanozymes lack sufficient catalytic activity and the ability to penetrate bacterial biofilms, limiting their efficacy against the treatment of BK. To remedy this, ZnFe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe-LDH) nanosheets are loaded with Cu single-atom nanozymes (Cu-SAzymes) and aminated dextran (Dex-NH 2 ), resulting in the formation of the nanozyme DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu, which possesses peroxidase (POD)-, oxidase (OXD)-, and catalase (CAT)-like catalytic activities. This enables the nanozyme to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals ( • OH), superoxide anion radical (O 2 •− ), and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) from hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), thereby killing the bacteria causing the infections. The surface Dex-NH 2 enabled the DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu to penetrate the biofilm and adsorb onto extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria in the biofilm. Additionally, the DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu successfully repaired P. aeruginosa -infected corneal injury in a BK rabbit model more effectively than commercially available tobramycin eye drops. This was enabled, in part, by the ability of DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu to reduce inflammation by promoting the polarization of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) to anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and decrease the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) to promote wound healing without scar formation. This study provides an innovative concept for the treatment of BK and holds great scientific value and clinical application potential.},

This study presents a hollow egg-box structure used in MXene composite film, by which the reflectivity (R) could decrease from 0.98 to 0.54 and absorbance (A) increased from 0.02 to 0.45, effectively decreasing the high electromagnetic reflectivity of pure MXene. Additionally, compared to pure MXene films, the MXene composite films exhibit improved electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) and SSE/t.

The hollow egg-box structure not only enhances the electromagnetic shielding performance beyond pure MXene but also demonstrates outstanding performance compared to most reported MXene films, balancing lightweight material properties with effective shielding.

  abstract     = {Feeding behavior changes induced by opioid addiction significantly contribute to the worsening opioid crisis. Activation of the reward system has shown to provoke binge eating disorder in individuals with opioid use disorder, whereas prolonged opioid exposure leads to weight loss. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these phenomena is essential for addressing this pressing societal issue. This study demonstrates that weight loss resulting from feeding behavior changes during morphine addiction requires the activation of the ventral tegmental area dopamine (DA) system, which suppresses the orexin feeding center. Specifically, DA exerts an inhibitory effect on orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus area (LHA) through a feedforward inhibition mediated by GABA neurons in the LHA, involving D1 receptors (D1R) and T-type Ca 2+ channels. Moreover, the morphine addiction-induced reduction in body weight and food intake can be reversed by the D1R antagonist SCH23390 and chemogenetic silencing of GABA neurons in the LHA. These findings delineate a neuromodulatory mechanism underlying morphine addiction-associated feeding behavior changes and weight loss.},

The basic neural circuits involved in emotion perception are becoming clear, though the emotion&#39;s cognitive processing remains under investigation. Utilizing the stereo-electroencephalograph with high temporal-spatial resolution, this study aims to decipher the neural pathway responsible for discriminating low-arousal and high-arousal emotions. This study involves 19 patients with pharmacologically resistant epilepsy who participate in a delayed match/mismatch sample task designed to separately assess their ability to discriminate between low-arousal and high-arousal emotions. Three groups of 11 brain subregions, with dominant lateralization, compose a network, which is identified as responsible for discriminating arousal-dependent emotions. The connection of these subregions, leading by the left insula and right middle temporal gyrus, defines the pathways for discriminating emotions with different arousals. Further, the separated network patterns related to emotional discrimination are face-independent. Overall, the left insula and the right middle temporal gyrus emerge as core components in the network, which plays key roles in the dynamic course for discriminating low- and high-arousal emotions in the human brain.},

This study explores multiple enzyme interaction process of typhactyloside (TYP) with gut microbiota and its lipid-lowering pharmacological activity. TYP, with bioavailability of only 2.78%, is an active component of Typha angustifolia L . and Pushen capsules which is clinically treated for hyperlipidemia. The metabolic process of TYP is identified, and key enzymes involved in TYP metabolism are validated through gene knockout and overexpression techniques. Through overexpressing α-rhamnosidase (Rha) in Escherichia coli , TYP is verified to metabolize into isorhamnetin-3- O -neohesperidin (M1) and isorhamnetin-3- O -glucoside (M2) after removing rhamnose through Rha. Besides, knockout of β-glucosidase (Glu) confirms that TYP generates M3 through Glu after removing glucose. Combined with molecular docking, M3 is transformed to generate 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (M4), protocatechuic acid (M5), and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (M6) through flavonoid reductase (Flr) and chalcone isomerase (Chi). In conclusion, multiple enzymes involved in TYP metabolism (Rha/Glu→Flr→Chi) are identified. Through in vivo experiments, combined use of M3 and M5 also shows excellent anti-hyperlipidemia efficacy. This is the first study on complex metabolism mechanism and pharmacological activity of natural flavonoids mediated by multiple enzymes, which provide insight to investigate analogous natural products.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant research progress, tumor heterogeneity remains elusive, and its complexity poses a barrier to anticancer drug discovery and cancer treatment. Response to the same drug varies across patients, and the timing of treatment is an important factor in determining prognosis. Therefore, development of patient-specific preclinical models that can predict a patient&#39;s drug response within a short period is imperative. In this study, a printed gastric cancer (pGC) model is developed for preclinical chemotherapy using extrusion-based 3D bioprinting technology and tissue-specific bioinks containing patient-derived tumor chunks. The pGC model retained the original tumor characteristics and enabled rapid drug evaluation within 2 weeks of its isolation from the patient. In fact, it is confirmed that the drug response-related gene profile of pGC tissues co-cultured with human gastric fibroblasts (hGaFibro) is similar to that of patient tissues. This suggested that the application of the pGC model can potentially overcome the challenges associated with accurate drug evaluation in preclinical models (e.g., patient-derived xenografts) owing to the deficiency of stromal cells derived from the patient. Consequently, the pGC model manifested a remarkable similarity with patients in terms of response to chemotherapy and prognostic predictability. Hence, it is considered a promising preclinical tool for personalized and precise treatments.},

  abstract     = {Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a critical complication following revascularization therapy for ischemic heart disease. Itaconate, a macrophage-derived metabolite, has been implicated in inflammation and metabolic regulation. This study investigates the protective role of itaconate derivatives against IR injury. Using a mice model of IR injury, the impact of 7-day 4-Octyl itaconate (4-OI) administration on cardiac function is assessed. Exogenous administration of 4-OI significantly reduces myocardial damage, enhances angiogenesis, and alleviates myocardial hypoxia injury during reperfusion. RNA sequencing and molecular docking techniques are used to find the target of itaconate, and changes in cardiac function are observed in Immune-Responsive Gene1 (IRG1) global knockout mice. In cell culture studies, 4-OI promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration, mediated by Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway activation, particularly through Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) signaling. Inhibition of ERK blocks these beneficial effects on endothelial cells. Furthermore, itaconate synthesis inhibition worsens myocardial damage, which is mitigated by 4-OI supplementation. The results indicate that 4-OI promotes angiogenesis by activating MAPK signaling via FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt1), highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for myocardial IR injury.},

  abstract     = {The transformation of graphite into diamond (2–10 nm) at ordinary pressure by monodispersed Ta atoms was recently reported, while the effects of Ta concentration on the transition process remain obscure. Here, by regulating the Ta wire treatment time, as well as the annealing time and temperature, larger diamond grians (5–20 nm) are successfully synthesized, and the transition process of graphite to diamond is revealed to vary with Ta concentration. Specifically, short Ta wire treatments (5–10 min) induce graphite to form a “circle” structure and transforms into diamond directly after annealing. Long Ta wire treatments (15–25 min) produce larger and more “circle” structures, containing an increased number of graphite layers. After annealing at 1100 °C for 30–120 min, graphite first transforms into amorphous carbon, then to i-Carbon and n-Diamond, and finally to diamond. Notably, a large amount of n-Diamond and diamond are formed after 120 min annealing. By modulating the annealing temperature from 500 to 1200 °C for 30 min, diamond is already obtained at 500 °C, and hexagonal diamond up to 20 nm in size at 1200 °C. This provides a fresh insight into the graphite/diamond transition process and an approach for diamond synthesis.},

In this study, we cloned a gene, CTB6 , encoding a lipid transfer protein involved in cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice, based on our previous fine-mapped quantitative trait locus (QTL) qCTB10-2 . CTB6 is mainly expressed in the tapetum and young microspores of the anther. CTB6 interacts with catalases (CATs) to maintain their stability, thereby scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and facilitating tapetum development under cold stress conditions. Additionally, CTB6 has lipid-binding ability and affects the lipid content in anthers to regulate cold tolerance at the booting stage. Haplotype analysis and promoter activity assay revealed a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-489 variation in the promoter of CTB6 , which enhances its expression and results in improved cold tolerance in Hap1-K varieties. The CTB6 near-isogenic line (NIL) exhibited enhanced cold tolerance at the booting stage, with no significant effects on other agronomic traits. Our findings uncover a natural variation of CTB6 for cold tolerance at the booting stage and provide new genetic resources for cold tolerance breeding in rice.},

A functionally graded oxide scale comprising an outer dense layer and an underlying fine granular layer formed. The former is a better oxygen barrier owing to fewer cracks and the latter has high strain tolerance due to finer grain size. The uniform dissolving of ≈4 mol% Ti in the inner layer results in grain refinement via sluggish diffusion and thus stress release. For the outer layer, Ti segregation at the nanoscale leads to a metastable cubic (Hf,Zr,Ti)O 2 and local severe lattice distortion, inhibiting the propagation of cracks. Ti ions’ unique dissolving in the oxide scale enables a strong oxygen diffusion barrier with high strain tolerance, which is responsible for superior performance.

However, whether ruining the existing NETs within the local infectious bone lesions can contribute to inflammation resolve and bone repair remains understudied. Herein, a nanocapsuled delivery system that scavenges NETs dual-responsively to near-infrared light as a switch and to NETs themselves as a microenvironment sensor is designed. Besides, the photothermal and photodynamic effects endow the nanocapsules with antibacterial properties. Together with the ability to clear NETs, these features facilitate the restoration of the normal host response. The immunocorrective properties and inherent pro-osteogenic effects finally promote local bone repair. Together, the NET scavenging nanocapsules address the challenge of impaired bone repair in chronic infections due to biased host response caused by excessive NETs.

An enzyme-sensitive sequence is designed in NP as a bioswitchable apparatus for cargo miRNAs release. NP is compared with conventional delivery modes and delivery vehicles, confirming its excellent transportability and sustained release properties. Moreover, NP confers good enzyme and serum resistance to the cargo miRNAs. Simultaneously, it can easily deliver miRNA-125 to liver and kidney lesions owing to its passive targeting properties. This allows for Keap1/Nrf2 pathway regulation and p53 protein targeting in the affected tissues. Additionally, NP negatively regulates the expression of Bax and Caspase-3.

Although hydrogel-based therapies have shown potential for mucosal repair, challenges remain due to inadequate targeting and low hydrogel density, leading to ongoing infiltration of harmful substances and delayed mucosal healing. In this study, an inflammation-targeting-triggered healing hydrogel (ITTH hydrogel) is developed, composed of polyvinyl alcohol-alginate microgels (PALMs) and a cyclodextrin polymer crosslinker (CPC). This hydrogel specifically targets inflamed colonic sites and crosslinks in situ to form a dense network. The results demonstrate that the ITTH hydrogel adheres effectively to inflamed colonic tissue in both IBD mouse models and human samples. The dense crosslinked network acts like the mucosal barrier, preventing the penetration of detrimental substances such as bacteria and small molecules, thereby protecting the underlying mucosal tissue. Furthermore, the ITTH hydrogel significantly improved therapeutic outcomes in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is increasingly recognized as a whole-organ disease predominantly affecting the elderly, characterized by typical alterations in subchondral bone and cartilage, along with recurrent synovial inflammation. Despite the availability of various therapeutics and medications, a complete resolution of OA remains elusive. In this study, novel functional hydrogels are developed by integrating natural bioactive molecules for OA treatment. Specifically, baicalin (Bai) is combined with 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) to form a polymerizable monomer (HEA-Bai) through esterification, which is subjected to reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to produce Bai-based polymer (P m ). These macromolecules are incorporated into Schiff-base hydrogels, which demonstrate excellent mechanical properties and self-healing performance. Notably, the Bai-based formulations are taken up by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), where they regulate glycolysis. Mechanistically, inhibition of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) by the formulations suppressed the FLSs glycolysis and reduced the secretion of inflammatory factors, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8. Furthermore, the functional hydrogel (AG-P m )-OC, severing as a lubricant and nutrient, prolonged joint retention of Bai, thereby reducing cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation. Meanwhile, (AG-P m )-OC alleviated joint pain by targeting the YAP1 signaling and inhibiting macrophage recruitment and polarization. Taken together, this flavonoid-based injectable hydrogel exhibits enhanced biocompatibility and efficacy against OA.},

  abstract     = {The conductivity of AgNWs electrodes can be enhanced by incorporating Ag grids, thereby facilitating the development of large-area flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs). Ag grids from vacuum evaporation offer the advantages of simple film formation, adjustable thickness, and unique structure. However, the complex 3D multi-component structure of AgNWs electrodes will exacerbate the aggregation of large Ag particles, causing the device short circuits. To address this issue, the relationship between the surface energy of modification layers and the morphology and conductivity of ultrathin Ag on AgNWs is studied. The amorphous ZnO (α-ZnO) layer promotes Ag growth from Volmer–Weber (VW) to Frank–Van der Merwe (FM), reducing particle aggregation. The 1 µm thick PET/AgNWs/Ag grid electrode with α-ZnO exhibited low contact resistance and high conductivity. As a result, 1 cm 2 FOSCs with Ag grids achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.01%. As the area increased to 4 and 9 cm 2 , the performance of the monolithic FOSCs is 14.70% and 12.69%, showing less efficiency loss during upscaling. The 8 and 16 cm 2 modules constructed by series and parallel connection of the monolithic devices yield PCEs of 14.47% and 12.92%, respectively. This study offers valuable insights into constructing Ag grids on AgNWs electrodes for highly efficient large-area FOSCs.},

In this study, for the first time, two new GDAs, DYF-V and DY2F-V are designed and synthesized for OSC operation, by connecting one vinylene linker with the mono-/di-fluorinated end group on two Y-series monomers, respectively. After fluorination, both DYF-V and DY2F-V exhibit bathochromic absorption and denser packing modes due to the stronger intramolecular charge transfer effect and torsion-free backbones. Through precise fluorination, the DYF-V-based devices exhibit the highest performance of 18.63% among the GDA-based OSCs, outperforming its non-fluorinated counterpart, DY-V-based ones (16.53%). Theoretical and morphological results demonstrate that proper fluorination in DYF-V-based devices strengthens intra/intermolecular interactions for enhanced crystallinity, superior phase segregation, and less energy disorder, which is beneficial for fast exciton dissociation, rapid carrier transport, and suppressed charge recombination. The work demonstrates that proper fluorination on GDAs with rigid coplanar backbones is effective for broader photon harvesting, stronger packing, and robust stability in GDA-based OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Podocyte injury and proteinuria in glomerular disease are critical indicators of acute kidney injury progression to chronic kidney disease. Renal mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated by intracellular calcium levels and oxidative stress, is a major contributor to podocyte complications. Despite various strategies targeting mitochondria to improve kidney function, effective treatments remain lacking. This study investigates the potential of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in mitigating renal fibrosis and elucidates their underlying mechanisms. In animal models of Adriamycin-induced nephropathy and 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy, GQDs treatment exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects by restoring podocyte actin structure. These therapeutic benefits are associated with the downregulation of transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) activity, which is related to kidney fibrosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In vitro, GQDs suppress TRPC5, enhancing anti-fibrotic and anti-apoptotic effects by lowering calcium levels under oxidative stress and mechanical pressure. Anti-oxidative and anti-senescent effects are also confirmed. Most significantly, transcriptomics and electron microscopy analyses reveal that GQD treatment enhances mitochondrial respiration-related gene profiles and improves mitochondrial cristae morphology. These findings suggest that GQDs are a promising therapeutic nanomaterial for renal cell damage, capable of modulating calcium-dependent apoptosis associated with mitochondrial injury, potentially slowing fibrosis progression.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical CO 2 reduction in acidic media attracts extensive research attention due to its potential in increasing carbon efficiency. In most reports, alkali cations are introduced to suppress hydrogen evolution and to promote CO 2 reduction. However, the mass transport of alkali cations through cation exchange membrane induces the change of electrolyte compositions. Herein, the variation of electrolyte compositions and the flow of carbon during CO 2 reduction are analyzed quantitatively by simulation and experiments. If the initial amount of alkali cations in the anolyte is higher than the initial amount of H + in the catholyte, the pH of the catholyte increases remarkably in long-term CO 2 reduction electrolysis, resulting in the decrease of carbon efficiency. Bicarbonate salt precipitation on the cathode with alkali cation-containing catholyte is another origin of the decrease of CO 2 reduction Faradaic efficiency and carbon efficiency. To maintain high carbon efficiency, the electrolyte should contain low concentration of alkali cations or even be free of alkali cations. Decorating the catalyst of cathode with ionomer with high density of cation sites enables CO 2 reduction in pure acid solution, achieving 30-h stable carbon efficiency.},

In this study, whole exome sequencing (WES) and genetic linkage analysis across a four-generation lineage presenting with six cases of FPD are conducted. A disease-causing mutation in ABCA6 is identified for FPD. Further analyses reveal a consistent correlation between ABCA6 expression downregulation and PD occurrence, chondrocyte degeneration, and OA onset. Moreover, ABCA6-KO mice demonstrate severe knee joint degeneration and accelerated OA progression. Besides, synovial mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) are extracted from WT, ABCA6 −/+ , and ABCA6 −/− mice to create chondrogenic organoids in vitro, confirming ABCA6 deficiency can lead to chondrocyte degeneration via modulating cell cycle and activating cellular senescence.

  abstract     = {In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pro-tumoral macrophages promote metastasis and suppress the immune response. To target these cells, a previously identified CD206 (mannose receptor)-binding peptide, mUNO was engineered to enhance its affinity and proteolytic stability. The new rationally designed peptide, MACTIDE, includes a trypsin inhibitor loop, from the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor-I. Binding studies to recombinant CD206 revealed a 15-fold lower K D for MACTIDE compared to parental mUNO. Mass spectrometry further demonstrated a 5-fold increase in MACTIDE&#39;s half-life in tumor lysates compared to mUNO. Homing studies in TNBC-bearing mice shows that fluorescein (FAM)-MACTIDE precisely targeted CD206 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) upon intravenous, intraperitoneal, and even oral administration, with minimal liver accumulation. MACTIDE was conjugated to Verteporfin, an FDA-approved photosensitizer and YAP/TAZ pathway inhibitor to create the conjugate MACTIDE-V. In the orthotopic 4T1 TNBC mouse model, non-irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice exhibited anti-tumoral effects comparable to those treated with irradiated MACTIDE-V, with fewer signs of toxicity, prompting further investigation into the laser-independent activity of the conjugate. In vitro studies using bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages showed that MACTIDE-V excluded YAP from the nucleus, increased phagocytic activity, and upregulated several genes associated with cytotoxic anti-tumoral macrophages. In mouse models of TNBC, MACTIDE-V slowed primary tumor growth, suppressed lung metastases, and increased markers of phagocytosis and antigen presentation in TAM and monocytes, increasing the tumor infiltration of several lymphocyte subsets. MACTIDE-V is proposed as a promising peptide-drug conjugate for modulating macrophage function in breast cancer immunotherapy.},

This study unveiled a novel miRNA, microRNA-32533 (miR-32533), featuring a distinctive base sequence identified through RNA sequencing of the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse brain. Its role and underlying mechanisms were subsequently explored. Bioinformatics and confirmatory experiments revealed that miR-32533 had a novel 23-base sequence with minimal coding potential, functioning within the Drosha ribonuclease III (Drosha)/Dicer 1, ribonuclease III (Dicer)-dependent canonical pathway and identifiable via northern blot. miR-32533 was abundantly brain-distributed and downregulated in diverse AD-related models, including APP/PS1 and five familial AD (5×FAD) mouse brains and AD patient plasma. Overexpression or inhibition of miR-32533 led to improvements or exacerbations in cognitive dysfunction, respectively, by modulating Aβ production, apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation through targeting cAMP-responsive element binding protein 5 (CREB5), which interacted with α disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin 1 (PS1) promoters, thereby enhancing Aβ production through BACE1 and PS1 upregulation while suppressing non-amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing via ADAM10 downregulation. Furthermore, modulation of the miR-32533/CREB5 axis ameliorated or worsened cognitive impairment by inhibiting or amplifying Aβ overproduction through the BACE1-involved amyloidogenic and ADAM10-involved non-amyloidogenic pathways. Overall, the findings suggest miR-32533 as a regulator of Aβ metabolism, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, establishing the miR-32533/CREB5 signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets for combating Aβ accumulation and cognitive deficits in AD.},

Drawing inspiration from cardiac muscle fiber arrangement, a three-dimensional (3D)-printed multi-layered microporous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold is created with interlayer angles set at 45° to replicate the precise structure of native cardiac tissue. Compared with the control group and 90° PCL scaffolds, the 45° PCL scaffolds exhibited superior biocompatibility for cell culture and improved hiPSC-CM maturation in calcium handling. RNA sequencing demonstrated that the 45° PCL scaffold promotes the mature phenotype in hiPSC-CMs by upregulating ion channel genes. Using the 45° PCL scaffold, a multi-cellular EHT is successfully constructed, incorporating human cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. These complex EHTs significantly enhanced hiPSC-CM engraftment in vivo, attenuated ventricular remodeling, and improved cardiac function in mouse myocardial infarction.

  abstract     = {The interaction between biomaterials and immune system is a critical area of research, especially in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. A fascinating and less explored aspect involves the immunomodulatory behaviors of macrophage (MΦ)-derived exosomes induced by biomaterial surfaces. Herein, untreated surface, nanostructured surface, and type I collagen (Col-I)-decorated nanostructured surface of titanium implants are chosen to culture MΦs, followed by extraction of MΦ-derived exosomes and investigation of their immunomodulatory functions and mechanisms. The results show that the exosomes in the untreated group carried plenty of inflammatory cytokines, predominantly C ─ C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). After targeting recipient cells, the CCL2 on the exosomes can specifically bind to its receptor C ─ C motif chemokine receptor 2, triggering downstream signaling pathways to induce internalization of membrane integrin β1 and targeted lysosomal degradation, consequently suppressing the functions of recipient cells. In contrast, the exosomes in the nanostructured group, especially Col-I-decorated nanostructured group carried few CCL2, moderating their inhibition on the functions of recipient cells. These findings not only clearly show that CCL2 is a key constituent of exosomes involved in the interaction between biomaterials and host immune system, but also potentially a key target for designing advanced biomaterials to promote tissue repair and regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising agents for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Although discovering novel AMPs is crucial for combating multidrug-resistant bacteria and biofilm-related infections, their clinical potential relies on precise, real-time evaluation of efficacy, toxicity, and mechanisms. Optical diffraction tomography (ODT), a label-free imaging technology, enables real-time visualization of bacterial morphological changes, membrane damage, and biofilm formation over time. Here, a computational analysis of the leech transcriptome using an advanced AI-based peptide screening strategy with ODT to identify potential AMPs is employed. Among the 19 potential AMPs identified, hirunipin 2 demonstrates potent antibacterial activity, low mammalian cytotoxicity, and minimal hemolytic effects. It demonstrates efficacy comparable to melittin, resistance to physiological salts and human serum, and a low likelihood of inducing bacterial resistance. Microscopy and 3D-ODT confirm its disruption of bacterial membranes and intracellular aggregation, leading to cell death. Notably, hirunipin 2 effectively inhibits biofilm formation, eradicates preformed biofilms, and synergizes with antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) by enhancing membrane permeability. Additionally, hirunipin 2 significantly suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages, highlighting its anti-inflammatory properties. These findings highlight hirunipin 2 as a strong candidate for developing novel antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antibiofilm therapies, particularly against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.},

  abstract     = {Repair of infectious bone defects remains a serious problem in clinical practice owing to the high risk of infection and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the early stage, and the residual bacteria and delayed Osseo integrated interface in the later stage, which jointly creates a complex and dynamic microenvironment and leads to bone non-union. The melatonin carbon dots (MCDs) possess antibacterial and osteogenesis abilities, greatly simplifying the composition of a multifunctional material. Therefore, a multifunctional hydrogel containing MCDs (GH-MCD) is developed to meet the multi-stage and complex repair needs of infectious bone injury in this study. The GH-MCD can intelligently release MCDs responding to the acidic microenvironment to scavenge intracellular ROS and exhibit good antibacterial activity by inducing the production of ROS in bacteria and inhibiting the expression of secA2 . Moreover, it has high osteogenesis and long-lasting antimicrobial activity during bone repair. RNA-seq results reveal that the hydrogels promote the repair of infected bone healing by enhancing cellular resistance to bacteria, balancing osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis, and regulating the immune microenvironment. In conclusion, the GH-MCD can promote the repair of infectious bone defects through the programmed transformation of the microenvironment, providing a novel strategy for infectious bone defects.},

However, its functional role and molecular mechanism in mitochondrial function regulation and aged bone regeneration remain insufficiently elucidated. This proteomic analysis has revealed a greater abundance of proteins supporting mitochondrial function in the young ECM (Y-ECM) secreted by young bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) compared to the aged ECM (A-ECM). Further studies demonstrate that Y-ECM significantly rejuvenates mitochondrial energy metabolism in adult BMMSCs (A-BMMSCs) through the promotion of mitochondrial respiratory functions and amelioration of oxidative stress. A-BMMSCs cultured on Y-ECM exhibited enhanced multi-lineage differentiation potentials in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo. Mechanistically, silencing of silent information regulator type 3 (SIRT3) gene abolished the protective impact of Y-ECM on A-BMMSCs. Notably, a novel composite biomaterial combining hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel microspheres with Y-ECM is developed, which yielded substantial improvements in the healing of bone defects in an aged rat model. Collectively, these findings underscore the pivotal role of Y-ECM in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis and present a promising therapeutic strategy for the repair of aged bone defects.},

Experimental results demonstrate the realization the coexistence of corner modes with distinct mechanisms within one single model. This provides a pathway for finding ℤ-classified with large MCNs independent of long-range coupling. Additionally, a universal approach is introduced here to fabricate topological bound states in the continuum derived from the discrepant onsite energy of degenerate p -orbitals.

  abstract     = {The most prevalent types of lymphomas are B cell lymphomas (BCL). Newer therapies for BCL have improved the prognosis for many patients. However, approximately 30% with aggressive BCL either remain refractory or ultimately relapse. These patients urgently need other options. This study shows how calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMKIIδ) is pivotal for BCL development. In BCL cells, ablation of CAMKIIδ inhibits both lipolysis from lipid droplets and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). With lipolysis blocked, BCL progression is markedly suppressed in two distinct BCL mouse models: MYC-driven EµMyc mice and Myc/Bcl2 double-expressed mice. When CAMKIIδ is present, it destabilizes transcription factor Forkhead Box O3A (FOXO3A) by phosphorylating it at Ser7 and Ser12. This then permits transcription of downstream gene IRF4 – a master transcription factor of lipid metabolism. The CAMKIIδ/FOXO3A axis bolsters lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and tumor fitness in BCL under metabolic stress. This study also evaluates Tetrandrine (TET), a small molecule compound, as a potent CAMKIIδ inhibitor. TET attenuates metabolic fitness and elicits therapeutic responses both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study highlights how CAMKIIδ is critical in BCL progression. The results also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies for treating aggressive BCL.},

  abstract     = {Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) is extensively used in waterproof coatings and fire-fighting foams, and several studies have found it to be a potential health hazard, but there is still unknown about its effects on spermatogenesis. Our results showed that PFHxS-treated mice have significant reproductive toxicity, including a decrease in sperm count and motility, and the levels of sex hormones ( P &lt; 0.05). Concurrently, structural abnormalities are observed in sperm, affecting ≈60–75% of those in the PFHxS-treated group. Additionally, it is found that the structure of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) is damaged after PFHxS treatment, leading to higher expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the microenvironment for spermatogenesis. Moreover, the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, including PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), is dysregulated in the testes after PFHxS treatment. Based on metabolome data, the differential metabolite 3-hydroxybutanoic acid is identified in the PFHxS-treated group, which can regulate the histone Kac levels, especially H3K4ac and H3K9ac. In summary, the results of this study suggest that in the testes of PFHxS-treated mice, inflammatory factors disrupt the mitochondrial function and metabolic profiles and hinder the progress of gene transcription through histone Kac, ultimately causing sperm dysfunction.},

Nanoparticle-embedded resin-based nanoimprint lithography (PER-NIL) has shown itself to be a low-cost, high-throughput manufacturing method enabling the replication of high-index nanostructures. It has been extensively integrated into the fabrication of hologram metasurfaces, metalenses, and sensors due to its procedural simplicity. Most research on PER-NIL has been limited to exploring appropriate materials to enhance the efficiency of imprinted metasurfaces, but the intrinsic issue of PER-NIL lies in the high-index residual layer remaining on the substrate. This high-index residual layer generates undesired noise, limiting the efficiency and functionality of imprinted metasurfaces. Despite the need for the removal of the residual layer, it has never been experimentally achieved owing to the different etching rates between the nanoparticles and resin. Here, a new methodology named tape-assisted PER-NIL is proposed, achieving one-step removal of the residual layer using a tape. This novel method enables the replication of residual layer-free, high-index metasurfaces. As a result, imprinted residual layer-free metasurfaces prove their potential in high-purity dielectric structural colorations by achieving a sharp reflectance peak unattainable with conventional NIL, and in vivid hologram metasurfaces by covering a full 2π phase without unwanted scattering.},

This research highlights the importance of the circular RNA (circRNA) circPCSK6 and its peptide derivative circPCSK6-167aa in ICC. CircPCSK6 is significantly downregulated in both ICC patients and mouse primary ICC models, and its lower expression is linked to adverse prognosis, highlighting its pivotal role in ICC pathogenesis. Functionally, this study elucidates the regulatory effect of circPCSK6-167aa on IκBα ubiquitination within the NF-κB pathway, which is mediated by its competitive binding to the E3 ligase RBBP6. This complex interaction leads to reduced activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby curbing tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, stemness, and hepatic-lung metastasis in vivo. This groundbreaking discovery expands the understanding of circRNA-driven tumorigenesis through atypical signaling pathways. Additionally, this investigation identified EIF4A3 as a detrimental regulator of circPCSK6, exacerbating ICC malignancy. Importantly, by leveraging patient-derived xenograft (PDX), organoids, and organoid-derived PDX models, higher levels of circPCSK6-167aa enhance sensitivity to gemcitabine, indicating its potential to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. These insights emphasize the therapeutic promise of targeting circPCSK6-167aa, offering vital biological insights and clinical directions for developing cutting-edge therapeutic approaches, thus revealing innovative strategies and targets for future treatments.},

  abstract     = {A previous study classifies solid tumors based on collagen deposition and immune infiltration abundance, identifying a refractory subtype termed armored &amp; cold tumors, characterized by elevated collagen deposition and diminished immune infiltration. Beyond its impact on immune infiltration, collagen deposition also influences tumor angiogenesis. This study systematically analyzes the association between immuno-collagenic subtypes and angiogenesis across diverse cancer types. As a result, armored &amp; cold tumors exhibit the highest angiogenic activity in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal close interactions and spatial co-localization of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In vitro experiments demonstrate that collagen stimulates tumor cells to express vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and directly enhances vessel formation and endothelial cell proliferation through sex determining region Y box 18 (SOX18) upregulation. Collagen inhibition via multiple approaches effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, armored &amp; cold tumors display superior responsiveness to anti-angiogenic therapy in advanced LUAD cohorts. Post-immunotherapy resistance, the transformation into armored &amp; cold tumors emerges as a potential biomarker for selecting anti-angiogenic therapy. In summary, collagen deposition is shown to drive angiogenesis across various cancers, providing a novel and actionable framework to refine therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic treatments.},

This study proposes a new method to address the trade-off between pool sizes and RT-PCR accuracy. This method integrates large-scale pooling with sample enrichment using a nano-hybrid membrane, preventing the pooling-induced decrease in viral concentration and maintaining cycle threshold (Ct) values close to individual positive samples. The nano-hybrid membrane, named SIMPLE (streamlined, simple, and inexpensive method for preconcentration, lysis, and nucleic acid extraction), comprises layered red blood cell membranes, polyethersulfone, and silica membranes. Using SIMPLE, a Ct value reduction to ≈2.6 is demonstrated in pooled COVID-19 samples with a pool size of 6 and found Ct values from larger pool sizes (8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) comparable to individual positive samples.},

  abstract     = {Melanoma stem cells are a kind of cells with self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation potential. They are one of the key factors in the occurrence, development and metastasis of melanoma. This study demonstrates that MLLT3 is a transcription factor that regulates the stemness and progression of melanoma. MLLT3 interacted with HMGB1 to inhibit its entry into the nucleus, MLLT3 interacted with YBX1 to inhibit its reading of m 5 C of MAGEA1 , thereby inhibiting the mRNA stability of MAGEA1 , and directly transcribed P53 to inhibit the stemness, proliferation and metastasis of melanoma cells. This study further explored the potential mechanism of the interaction between miR-542-3p/miR-3922-3p and MLLT3 . Furthermore, the scRNA-seq of melanoma cells with MLLT3 knock-out resulted in important changes in cell subsets, activating the TP53 and MAPK pathways and transforming into stem cells. The results indicate that the transcription factor MLLT3 is a suppressor gene that regulates the stemness and progression of melanoma, and is expected to become a target for melanoma therapy.},

The application of these therapies is highly dependent on the evaluation of tumor HER2 status. However, there are many risks and challenges in HER2 assessment in GC. Therefore, an economically viable and readily available instrument is requisite for distinguishing HER2 status among patients diagnosed with GC. The study has innovatively developed a deep learning model, HER2Net, which can predict the HER2 status by quantitatively calculating the proportion of HER2 high-expression regions. The HER2Net is trained on an internal training set derived from 531 hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) whole slide images (WSI) of 520 patients. Subsequently, the performance of HER2Net is validated on an internal test set from 115 H&amp;E WSI of 111 patients and an external multi-center test set from 102 H&amp;E WSI of 101 patients. The HER2Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9043 on the internal test set, and an accuracy of 0.8922 on an external test set from multiple institutes. This discovery indicates that the HER2Net can potentially offer a novel methodology for the identification of HER2-positive GC.},

  abstract     = {Lead-free halide double perovskites provide a promising solution for the long-standing issues of lead-containing halide perovskites, i.e., the toxicity of Pb and the low stability under ambient conditions and high-intensity illumination. Their light-to-electricity or thermal-to-electricity conversion is strongly determined by the dynamics of the corresponding lattice vibrations. Here, the measurement of lattice dynamics is presented in a prototypical lead-free halide double perovskite(Cs 2 NaInCl 6 ). The quantitative measurements and first-principles calculations show that the scatterings among lattice vibrations at room temperature are at the timescale of ≈1 ps, which stems from the extraordinarily strong anharmonicity in Cs 2 NaInCl 6 . Further the degree of anharmonicity of each type of atom is quantitatively characterized in the Cs 2 NaInCl 6 single crystal, which stems from the interatomic forces, and demonstrate that this strong anharmonicity is synergistically contributed by the bond hierarchy, the tilting of the NaCl 6 and InCl 6 octahedral units, and the rattling of Cs + ions. Consequently, the crystalline Cs 2 NaInCl 6 possesses an ultralow thermal conductivity of ≈0.43 W mK −1 at room temperature, and a weak temperature dependence of T −0.41 . These findings uncovered the underlying mechanisms behind the dynamics of lattice vibrations in double perovskites, which can largely benefit the design of optoelectronics and thermoelectrics based on halide double perovskites.},

  abstract     = {L-Aspartic acid (L-Asp) poses a dual function, which can affect the evaporation and crystallization process of the high-salinity brine by altering the physical or chemical properties of the salts. MSWI (municipal solid waste incineration) fly ash washing leachate, as a typical high-salinity brine, is utilized here to validate this hypothesis under the simulation guidance. Since L-Asp has stronger adsorption energy on the (110) crystal face of CaCO 3 , L-Asp can facilitate the preferential growth of more valuable vaterite during the softening process (pretreatment before crystallization). Subsequently, the resulting solution undergoes a stable interfacial solar-driven crystallization process under the L-Asp, with a high salt recovery ratio of 0.14 kg m −2 h −1 within 40 h under 1 sun. Finally, to harness the “cradle to grave” full life cycle utilization of washing leachate, the extracted mixed salts are utilized for moisture-enabled electricity generation. L-Asp can significantly enhance this process by reducing the critical relative humidity of mixed salts, thereby exhibiting a stable open circuit potential and short-cut current of ≈ 0.51 V and 10.6 µA within continuous 800 min. In conclusion, this work not only provides innovative approaches for upcycling high-salinity wastewater but also explores novel applications for L-Asp.},

  abstract     = {3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2 (HACD2), an obesity-related gene involved in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids, is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer (PC) and is associated with patient prognosis. Interestingly, the study reveals that HACD2 mediated the proliferation of PC cells in a dehydratase-independent manner, affecting the downstream glycolytic pathway. Mechanistically, HACD2 promotes PC cells proliferation by binding to E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin (PRKN) and enhancing pyruvate kinase PKM (PKM2) dissociation from PRKN, resulting in reduced ubiquitination of PKM2 and increased dimerization of PKM2, which subsequently promote c-Myc expression and tumor growth. Moreover, HACD2 overexpression-induced PC growth is mitigated by knockdown of PKM2 or overexpression of PRKN. Furthermore, the weight loss drug orlistat, which potentially binds to HACD2, disrupted the interaction between HACD2 and PRKN and further increased the ubiquitination of PKM2. Therefore, this study elucidates the mechanism by which the obesity-related gene HACD2 regulates PC cells proliferation through a noncanonical signaling pathway, which may provide a potential new target and strategy for the individualized clinical treatment of PC.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) usually creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby hindering immunotherapy response. Effective treatment options remain elusive. Using scRNA-seq analysis in a tumor-bearing murine model, it is found that lobeline, an alkaloid from the herbal medicine lobelia, promotes polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward M1-like TAMs while inhibiting their polarization toward M2-like TAMs. Additionally, lobeline upregulates mRNA expression of secreted Ly-6/UPAR-related protein 1 ( Slurp1 ) in cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of lobeline on tumor load and TAM polarization are almost completely eliminated when Slurp1-deficient MC38 cells are subcutaneously injected into mice, suggesting that lobeline exerts an antitumor effect in a Slurp1-dependent manner. Furthermore, using target-responsive accessibility profiling, MAPK14 is identified as the direct target protein of lobeline. Mechanistically, upon binding to MAPK14 in colon cancer cells, lobeline prevents nuclear translocation of MAPK14, resulting in decreased levels of phosphorylated p53. Consequently, negative transcriptional regulation of SLURP1 by p53 is suppressed, leading to enhanced transcription and secretion of SLURP1. Finally, combination therapy using lobeline and anti-PD1 exhibits stronger antitumor effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment using small-molecule lobeline may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC.},

Recent efforts in this area have highlighted the utility of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as drug carriers, given that they naturally occur in bloodstream and tissues, and can be loaded with a wide range of therapeutic molecules. However, biodistribution and tissue tropism of EVs remain difficult to study systematically. Here, a multiplexed approach is developed for simultaneous tracking of EVs from various cell lines within a single in vivo experiment. EVs are used from 16 different cell lines, and through controlled fusion with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying single-stranded DNA barcodes, uniquely barcoded hybrid EV particle (hEV) library is generated. These hEVs are combined for a multiplexed in vivo biodistribution profiling in mice, and discovered that HAP1-derived hEVs demonstrated lung tropism, suggesting that these hEVs may be used for targeted drug delivery into lung tissue. To examine this possibility further, it is shown that HAP1 hEV loaded with Cre mRNA displayed functional delivery to the lungs. Overall, the barcoded hEV technology enables rapid profiling of biodistribution across EV cell sources, which is poised to improve throughput and extent of EV studies, while reducing the number of animals required for research.},

The role of MDVs in DFU is yet to be reported. Using single-cell datasets, it is discovered that the increase in MDVs may be regulated by Sorting Nexin 9 (SNX9). In vitro experiments revealed that MDVs secreted by fibroblasts cultured in high glucose medium exhibited similar composition and protein enrichment results to those in DFU tissues, suggesting their potential as an ideal in vitro surrogate. These MDVs promoted apoptosis and intracellular oxidative stress, disrupted mitochondrial structure, and reduced aerobic metabolism in target cells. In vivo experiments also showed that MDV drops hindered wound healing in diabetic mice; however, this effect is rescued by SNX9 inhibitors, restoring mitochondrial dynamics and balance. Under high glucose conditions, MDVs significantly upregulated oxidative stress levels and induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

Here, dual-targeting biomimetic carrier-free nanomaterials (BSA-MTX-CyI nanosystem, BMC) is developed for synergistic photo-chemotherapy of RA. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which has high affinity with SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) in the RA joint microenvironment, is selected as the hydrophilic end and coupled with MTX and the phototherapeutic agent CyI to self-assemble into BMC. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that BMC accumulated significantly at the joint site in collagen antibody-induced arthritis mice and could be specifically recognized and taken up by folate receptors in proinflammatory M1 macrophages. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation, CyI exerted photodynamic and photothermal effects, whereas MTX not only inhibited cell proliferation but also increased cell sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, enhancing the apoptotic effect induced by CyI and achieving synergistic photo-chemotherapy. Moreover, BMC could induce macrophages to reprogram into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. This study provides innovative approaches for RA treatment via macrophage apoptosis and re-polarization.},

WAC acts as a scaffold protein and facilitates the integration of RNA-binding motif 12 (RBM12) into nuclear speckles, where RBM12 potentially interacts with the spliceosomal U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). Importantly, knockdown of RBM12, or deletion of the WAC CC domain led to altered splicing outcomes, resulting in an elevated level of BECN1-S, the short splice variant of BECN1 that is shown to upregulate mitophagy.

Previous study indicates that Kdm7a mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) increases after drug exposure, yet its role in drug-related behaviors is largely unknown. In a morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, these findings reveal a specific increase of Kdm7a expression in the mPFC 7 days after drug withdrawal. Subsequently, these results demonstrate that knockdown of Kdm7a in the mPFC do not affect the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP, but it attenuate memory consolidation. To further explore Kdm7a-mediated transcriptomic changes, this work employs Nanopore direct RNA sequencing. Transcriptome profiling unveils several gene expression alterations impacted by KDM7A, which are enriched in relevant neural function categories. Notably, this work identifies and validates fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (Fscn1) as a downstream molecular target. Knockdown of Fscn1 has a similar impact on CPP to Kdm7a, along with corresponding decrease of dendritic spine density and neuronal activity in the mPFC. Additionally, silencing Kdm7a decreases enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 at the Fscn1 promoter region, suggesting that KDM7A may act as a crucial regulator of transcriptional responses to morphine-related reward memory via Fscn1.},

  abstract     = {Protein self-assembly allows for the formation of diverse supramolecular materials from relatively simple building blocks. In this study, a single-component self-assembling hydrogel is developed using the recombinant protein CsgA, and its successful application for spinal cord injury repair is demonstrated. Gelation is achieved by the physical entanglement of CsgA nanofibrils, resulting in a self-supporting hydrogel at low concentrations (≥5 mg mL −1 ). By leveraging the programmability of the CsgA gene sequence, the bioactive hydrogel is enhanced by fusing functional peptide GHK. GHK is recognized for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurotrophic factor-stimulating properties, making it a valuable addition to the hydrogel for spinal cord injury repair applications. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the CsgA-GHK hydrogel can modulate microglial M2 polarization, promote neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells, and inhibit astrocyte differentiation. Additionally, the hydrogel shows efficacy in alleviating inflammation and promotes neuronal regeneration at the injury site, leading to significant functional recovery in a rat model with compression injury spinal cord cavity. These findings lay the groundwork for developing a modular design platform for recombinant CsgA protein hydrogels in tissue repair applications.},

  abstract     = {The fungal Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) protein Bdf1 is a potential antifungal target against invasive fungal infections. However, the need to selectively inhibit both Bdf1 bromodomains (BDs) over human orthologs and the lack of molecular tools to assess on-target antifungal efficacy hamper efforts to develop Bdf1 BD inhibitors as antifungal therapeutics. This study reports a phenyltriazine compound that inhibits both Bdf1 BDs from the human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata with selectivity over the orthologous BDs from the human BET protein Brd4. On-target antifungal activity is established by devising two yeast-based inhibition assays: a growth assay using humanized Candida strains in which the Bdf1 BDs are replaced by their Brd4 counterparts, and a NanoBiT assay that evaluates the BD-mediated association of Bdf1 with chromatin. These assays additionally enable the discovery that BET inhibitor I-BET726 targets both Bdf1 BDs, inhibits the growth of a broad spectrum of Candida species, including antifungal-resistant clinical isolates, and displays efficacy in an invertebrate animal model of infection. These collective findings highlight the promising potential of Bdf1 BD inhibitors as an innovative class of antifungal therapeutics and the pivotal role of yeast-based assay development toward achieving this end.},

  abstract     = {The initiation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stone formation is highly likely to stem from injury to the renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) induced by stimulation from an aberrant urinary environment. CHAC1 plays a critical role in stress response mechanisms by regulating glutathione metabolism. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ferroptosis are demonstrated to be involved in stone formation. This study attempted to elucidate the mechanism of ER stress-dependent ferroptosis and the role of CHAC1 in CaOx kidney stones. Here, regulating ER stress and CHAC1 expression are performed in in vivo and in vitro stone models. These findings indicated that 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)treatment and CHAC1 deficiency alleviated the ferroptotic status, including restoring GSH content, suppressing Fe 2+ and lipid peroxidation accumulation, as well as regulating ferroptosis-related proteins. Notably, 4-PBA treatment and CHAC1 deficiency both attenuated oxidative damage, improved renal function, importantly, decreased crystal deposition. Additionally, ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR analyses demonstrated that CHAC1 is the vital downstream target gene of ATF4. The results indicated that ATF4 depletion inhibited the upregulation of CHAC1 and pro-ferroptotic response induced by Ox stimulation. Overall, ATF4/CHAC1 axis mediating ER stress-dependent ferroptosis may be a promising research direction for identifying potential strategy to prevent and treat CaOx kidney stones.},

  abstract     = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is usually considered associate with immune inflammation and synaptic injury within specific brain regions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the neural deterioration resulting in depression remain unclear. Here, it is found that miR-204-5p is markedly downregulated in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induce rat model of depression. Knockdown of miR-204-5p in the vmPFC of normal rats results in depression and anxiety-like behaviors accompanied with the activation of microglia, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased numbers of neural apoptotic cells, effects which appear to be mediated by activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Electrophysiological recordings further demonstrate that knockdown of miR-204-5p induces abnormal excitability of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, upregulation of miR-204-5p in the vmPFC of CUMS rats significantly causes inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, improvements in neuronal impairments, and an abolition of the depression and anxiety-like behaviors. Moreover, pharmacological blocking of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway significantly ameliorates abnormal behaviors resulting from miR-204-5p deficiency within the vmPFC. Collectively, these results provide robust evidence that the miR-204-5p/JAK2/STAT3 pathway may critically involve in the pathogenesis of depression, which may serve as potentially critical therapeutic target in the treatment of MDD.},

Using a light-induced circadian rhythm disruption model, we showed that disrupted circadian rhythms exacerbate autoimmune uveitis by impairing the stability and function of Treg cells. Mechanistically, we identified the core clock gene Per1 , which is significantly reduced under circadian disruption, is essential for Treg cell metabolism and immunoregulatory function.

Herein a novel approach is introduced utilizing MOF-derived nanoporous metal/carbon composites as precursors to circumvent this traditional trade-off. The resulting bulk graphite, composed of densely packed multilayered graphene sheets functionalized with diverse cobalt forms (nanoparticles, single atoms, and clusters), exhibits unprecedented electrical conductivity in all directions (in-plane: 7311 S cm⁻¹, out-of-plane: 5541 S cm⁻¹) and excellent mechanical strength (flexural: 101.17±5.73 MPa, compressive: 151.56±2.53 MPa). Co nanoparticles act as autocatalysts and binders, promoting strong interlayer adhesion among highly graphitized graphene layers via spark plasma sintering. The strong nano-interfaces between graphite and Co-create critical bridges between graphene nanosheets, facilitating highly efficient electron migration and enhanced strength and stiffness of the assembled bulk nanocomposites. Leveraging these exceptional properties, practical demonstrations highlight the immense potential of the robust material for applications demanding superior electromagnetic interference shielding and efficient heating. An innovative approach, which effectively decouples electrical conductivity from mechanical properties, paves the way for the creation of HPBGs tailored for diverse application sectors.},

  abstract     = {Far-red phosphors have emerged as a desirable research hotspot owing to their critical role in promoting plant growth. Especially, Eu 3+ ions typically present the 5 D 0 → 7 F J (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions, which overlap with the far-red light required for plant photosynthesis. However, achieving high-efficiency far-red emission of Eu 3+ remains challenging due to weak 5 D 0 → 7 F 4 transition and concentration quenching. The study constructs two anomalously efficient far-red garnet phosphors A 3 Sc 2 C 3 O 12 (A = Y 3+ , Gd 3+ . C = Al 3+ , Ga 3+ ):Eu 3+ . A high-resolution STEM measurement equipped with an aberration corrector provides the direct proofs for both the [EuO 8 ] configuration-dependent strong 5 D 0 → 7 F 4 and the origin of high quenching concentration. Excitedly, a two-component substitution (replacing Y 3+ -Al 3+ with Gd 3+ -Ga 3+ ) triggers a near-unity internal quantum efficiency (IQE = 99.01%) and high external quantum efficiency (EQE = 38.73%) in Gd 3 Sc 2 Ga 3 O 12 :60%Eu 3+ , resulting from the effective modulation of 5 D 0 → 7 F 4 / 7 F 2 transitions. A far-red LEDs device based on Gd 3 Sc 2 Ga 3 O 12 :60%Eu 3+ exhibits an output power of 113 mW at 300 mA. Subsequently, practical applications for promoting plant growth underscore the significance of these findings. This work opens a new path for the development of highly efficient far-red phosphors via the synergistic effect of Eu 3+ square antiprism configuration and high quenching concentration.},

Herein, a NaHCO 3 etching strategy is developed to introduce abundant in-plane pores within the carbon substrates that further enable the construction of low-coordinated and asymmetric Co─N 3 sites with nearby vacancy defects in a Co─N─C catalyst. This catalyst exhibits a high HER activity with an overpotential ( η ) of merely 78 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , a Tafel slope of 45.2 mV dec −1 , and a turnover frequency of 1.67 s −1 (at η = 100 mV). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the vacancy defects neighboring the Co─N 3 sites can modulate the electronic structure of the catalyst and alter the adsorption configuration of the H intermediate from the typical atop mode to the side mode, resulting in weakened H adsorption strength and thus improved HER activity. This work provides an efficient strategy to regulate the coordination environment of SACs for improved catalytic performance and sheds light on the atomic-level understanding of the structure-activity relationships.},

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of electronic structure and the relationships between structure and properties to develop magneto-structural correlations that are currently unexplored in the literature. Herein, a series of five-coordinate distorted square pyramidal Co II complexes [Co(L)(X 2 )].CHCl 3 (where X = Cl ( 1 ), Br ( 2 ), or I ( 3 )) is reported, all exhibiting easy-axis magnetic anicotropy. The size of the zero field splitting axial parameter ( D ) is quantitatively determined ( 1 = −72; 2 = −67 and 3 = −25 cm −1 ) using a cantilever torque magnetometry which is further firmly supported by magnetic susceptibility, and EPR measurements. The study of the magnetization relaxation dynamics reveals field-induced slow relaxation of magnetization due to the predominant Raman relaxation process. Theoretical calculations on 1 – 3 and optimized model complexes of 1 reveal insights into the electronic structure and highlight the impact of steric and electronic effects on modulating the D values. Overall, the studies reported pave the way for designing a new generation of Co II complexes with enhanced  axiality and a lower rhombicity.},

However, achieving high sensitivity, self-powered operation, and reliable performance at room temperature within a miniaturized form factor remains a formidable challenge, largely due to constraints in MIR light absorption and the intricacies of embedding encryption at the device level. Here, a novel on-chip metamaterial-enhanced, 2D tantalum nickel selenide (Ta₂NiSe₅)-based photodetector, meticulously designed with a custom-engineered plasmonic resonance microstructure to achieve self-powered photodetection in the nanoampere range is unveiled. Gold cross-shaped resonators are demonstrated that generate plasmon-induced ultrahot electrons, significantly enhancing the absorption of MIR photons with energies far below the bandgap and boosting electron thermalization in Ta₂NiSe₅, yielding a 0.1 V bias responsivity of 47 mA/W—an order of magnitude higher than previously reported values. Furthermore, the implementation of six reconfigurable optoelectronic logic computing (“AND”, “OR”, “NAND”, “NOR”, “XOR”, and “XNOR”) are illustrated via tailored optical and electrical input-output configurations, thereby establishing a platform for real-time infrared-encrypted communication.

  abstract     = {Multimode luminescent materials exhibit tunable photon emissions under different excitation or stimuli channels, endowing them high encoding capacity and confidentiality for anti-counterfeiting and encryption. Achieving multimode luminescence into a stable single material presents a promising but remains a challenge. Here, the downshifting/upconversion emissions, color-tuning persistent luminescence (PersL), temperature-dependent multi-color emissions, and hydrochromism are integrated into Er 3+ ions doped Cs 2 NaYbCl 6 nanocrystals (NCs) by leveraging shallow defect levels and directed energy migration. The resulting NCs display strong static and dynamic colorful luminescence in response to ultraviolet, 980-nm laser, and X-ray. Additionally, the NCs exhibit distinct luminescent colors as the temperature increases from 330 to 430 K. Surprisingly, it also demonstrates the ability of the reversible emission modal and color in response to water. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that self-trapped exciton state (STEs), chlorine vacancy defects, and ladderlike 4f energy levels of Er 3+ ions contribute to multimodal luminescence. More importantly, it has extremely remarkable environmental stability, which can be stored in the air for more than 18 months, showing promising commercial prospects. This work not only gives new insights into lanthanide-based metal halide NCs but also provides a new route for developing multimodal luminescent nanomaterials for anti-counterfeiting and encryption.},

Here, using Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based crystal structure prediction including zero-point energy, it is that proton superoxide (HO 2 ), the lightest superoxide, can be stabilized energetically at high pressure and temperature conditions. HO 2 is metallic at high pressure, which originates from the 𝜋 * orbitals overlap between adjacent superoxide anions (O 2 − ). By lowering pressure, it undergoes a metal-to-insulator transition similar to LiO 2 . Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations reveal that HO 2 becomes superionic with high electrical conductivity. The possibility of creating hydrogen-mixed superoxide at lower pressure using a (Li x ,H 1-x )O 2 hypothetical structure is also proposed. This discovery bridges gaps in superoxide and superionicity, guiding the design of various H-O compounds under high pressure.},

To date, analyses of miRNAs-induced transcriptome remodeling are at the whole plant or tissue levels. Here, Arabidopsis ’s ABA-induced single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is performed at different stages of time points–early, middle, and late. Single-cell level primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) atlas supported the rapid, dynamic, and cell-type specific miRNA responses under ABA treatment. MiRNAs respond rapidly and prior to target gene expression dynamics, and these rapid response miRNAs are highly cell-type specific, especially in mesophyll and vascular cells. MiRNA-TF-mRNA regulation modules are identified by identifying miRNA-contained feed-forward loops (M-FFLs) in the regulatory network, and regulatory networks with M-FFLs have higher co-expression and clustering coefficient (CC) values than those without M-FFLs, suggesting the hub role of miRNAs in regulatory networks. The cell-type-specific M-FFLs are regulated by these hub miRNAs rather than TFs through sc-RNA-seq network analysis. MiR858a-FBH3-MYB module inhibited the expression of MYB63 and MYB20, which related to the formation of plant secondary wall and the production of lignin, through M-FFL specifically in vascular.

Importantly, the functionality of these dyes defines the ultimate application. Herein, CsPbBr 3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are interfaced with zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) dyes featuring carboxylic acid. The functionality is the photosensitization of singlet oxygen. The CsPbBr 3 @ZnPc nanohybrid is to the best of our knowledge the first example, in which an unusual Dexter-type singlet energy transfer between metal halide perovskite nanocrystals and phthalocyanine dyes enables singlet oxygen generation as a proof-of-concept application. A detailed temporal picture of the singlet energy transfer mechanism is made possible by combining key time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, that are, femtosecond, nanosecond, and microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy as well as time-correlated single photon counting, and target analyses. In fact, three excitonic components in the NCs govern a concerted Dexter-type energy transfer. The work illustrates the potential of CsPbBr 3 @ZnPc as a singlet photosensitizer of ZnPc to produce singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) almost quantitatively while photoexciting CsPbBr 3 .},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phases marks a major breakthrough in soft matter research. An intermediate phase, often observed between the nonpolar and the ferroelectric nematic phase, shows a distinct antiferroelectric response to electric fields. However, its structure and formation mechanisms remain debated, with flexoelectric and electrostatics effects proposed as competing mechanisms. By controlling the magnitude of electrostatic forces through ion addition in two representative ferroelectric nematic materials, it is shown that the primary mechanism for the emergence of antiferroelectric order is the flexoelectric coupling between electric polarization and splay deformation of the nematic director. The addition of ions significantly expands the temperature range over which the antiferroelectric phase is observed, with this range increasing with increasing ion concentration. Polarizing optical microscopy studies and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy reveal the splayed structure modulated in 2D, while SHG interferometry confirms its antiferroelectric character. The model previously used to describe pretransitional behavior is extended by incorporating the electrostatic contribution of ions. The model shows qualitative agreement with the experiments, accurately reproducing the phase diagram and temperature-dependent evolution of the modulation period of the observed structure.},

  abstract     = {To bolster the capacity for managing potential infectious diseases in the future, it is critical to develop specific antiviral drugs that can be rapidly designed and delivered precisely. Herein, a CRISPR/Cas13d system for broad-spectrum targeting of influenza A virus (IAV) from human, avian, and swine sources is designed, incorporating Cas13d mRNA and a tandem CRISPR RNA (crRNA) specific for the highly conserved regions of viral polymerase acidic (PA), nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix (M) gene segments, respectively. Given that the virus targets cells with specific receptors but is not limited to a single organ, a Susceptible Cell Selective Delivery (SCSD) system is developed by modifying a lipid nanoparticle with a peptide mimicking the function of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus to target sialic acid receptors. The SCSD system can precisely deliver an all-RNA-based CRISPR/Cas13d system into potentially infected cells. This drug is shown to reduce the viral load in the lungs by 2.37 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 and protect 100% of mice from lethal influenza infection. The SCSD-based CRISPR/Cas13d system shows promise for the flexible and efficient therapy of infections caused by rapidly evolving and novel viruses.},

  abstract     = {Efficient removal of 99 TcO 4 − from radioactive effluents while recovering drinking water remains a challenge. Herein, an excellent ReO 4 − (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99 TcO 4 − ) scavenger is presented through covalently bonding imidazolium poly(ionic liquids) polymers with an ionic porous aromatic framework (iPAF), namely iPAF-P67, following an adsorption-site density-addition strategy. It shows rapid sorption kinetics, high uptake capacity, and exceptional selectivity toward ReO 4 − . Notably, the residual concentration of TcO 4 − /ReO 4 − in the radioactive wastewater after iPAF-P67 treatment is as low as 0.046 ppb, fully meeting the drinking water standards of World Health Organization (WHO, 0.159 ppb) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA, 0.053 ppb). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the imidazolium groups in iPAF-P67 provide stronger electrostatic interactions and higher binding energies between iPAF-P67 and TcO 4 − anions, leading to its superior adsorption performance. Furthermore, the scale-up synthesized iPAF-P67 materials are shaped with polyethersulfone (PES) to fabricate PAF-P67/PES beads and nanofibers via phase inversion method and electrospinning technique, respectively. Both composites demonstrate outstanding ultra-purification abilities toward ReO 4 − to meet the WHO criteria even after multiple dynamic adsorption/desorption cycles. This work develops a design strategy for adsorbents applicable in the sequestration of low-concentration radioactive pollutants.},

However, the birefringence, which is one of the most important optical parameters in electro-optic devices, is not large enough (&lt;0.25) in most ferroelectric nematic materials. Here, a polar liquid crystal molecule library containing more than 60 molecules with a highly rigid and fluorinated nature is developed. The introduction of triple bonds constructs a long π-electron conjugated mesogen skeleton, significantly improving the birefringence of polar liquid crystal phases. The birefringence and dispersion properties are systematically studied, demonstrating a strong dependence on chemical structures and the type of polar phases. Furthermore, through multi-component mixing, polar liquid crystal mixtures with ultra-wide temperature range and excellent stability at or near room temperature are obtained. They possess much higher birefringence than the existing ferroelectric liquid crystal materials. The unique combination of high birefringence and fluidic ferroelectricity is expected to promote the application of polar liquid crystals in electro-optic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary metastasis represents one of the most prevalent forms of metastasis in advanced melanoma, with mortality rates reaching 70%. Current treatments including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy frequently exhibit limited efficacy or present high costs. To address these clinical needs, this study presents a biomimetic drug delivery system (Ce6-pTP-CsA) utilizing cryoshocked adipocytes (CsA) encapsulating the prodrug triptolide palmitate (pTP) and the photosensitizer Ce6, exploiting the characteristic of tumor cells to recruit and lipolyze adipocytes for energy. CsA substantially enhances the drug-loading capacity of adipocytes, with its particle size characteristics enabling targeted delivery of pTP to the lungs. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and pTP activates the caspase cascade, promoting apoptosis in tumor cells. Notably, the cleavage of disulfide bonds in pTP depletes glutathione (GSH), reducing its scavenging effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing the efficacy of PDT. Results demonstrate that Ce6-pTP-CsA effectively inhibits the proliferation and invasion of pulmonary metastatic melanoma cells in vitro and induces apoptosis, while significantly suppressing lung metastasis of SCID mice models in vivo. In conclusion, this novel biomimetic drug delivery system based on adipocytes provides a promising strategy for targeted therapy in pulmonary metastatic melanoma.},

However, conventional IEMs are limited to separating only monovalent cations or anions, presenting a significant challenge in achieving concomitant H⁺/OH⁻ permselectivity for simultaneous acid and alkali recovery. To address this issue, the charged microporous polymer framework membranes are developed, featuring rigid Tröger&#39;s Base network chains constructed through a facile sol-gel process. The intrinsic ultramicropore confinement and quaternary ammonium-charged functional groups provide ultrahigh size-sieving capability and enhanced Donnan exclusion for H⁺/OH⁻ selectivity; meanwhile, the internal protoplasmic channels of the polymer frameworks serve as highways for rapid ion transfer. The resulting membrane achieves high H⁺/Fe 2 ⁺ and OH⁻/WO₄ 2 ⁻ selectivities of 694.4 and 181.0, respectively, for concurrent acid and alkali separation in diffusion dialysis and electrodialysis processes over extended operational periods (exceeding 1600 and 600 h, respectively), while maintaining remarkable transport rates. These results outperform most literature-reported and nearly all commercially available membranes. This study validates the novel applicability of polymer framework materials with ionized angstrom-scale channels and versatile functionalities in high-performance IEMs for acid/alkali resource recovery.},

However, achieving balanced detection across a broad spectrum—from X-rays to infrared—within a single perovskite photodetector presents challenges. These challenges stem from conflicting requirements for different wavelength ranges, such as the narrow bandgap needed for infrared detection and the low dark current necessary for X-ray sensitivity. To address this, this study have designed a type-II FAPbI 3 perovskite-based heterojunction featuring a large energy band offset utilizing narrow bandgap tellurium (Te) semiconductor. This innovative design broadens the detection range into the infrared while simultaneously reducing dark current noise. As-designed device allows for the detection of near infrared band, achieving a detectivity of 6.8 × 10 9 Jones at 1550 nm. The low dark current enables X-ray sensitivity of up to 1885.1 µC Gy⁻¹ cm⁻ 2 . First-principles calculations confirm the type-II band structure alignment of the heterojunction, and a self-driven response behavior is realized. Moreover, this study have developed a scalable 40 × 1 sensor array, demonstrating the potential for wide-spectrum imaging applications.

  abstract     = {Developing low-cost unipolar n-type organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) is necessary for logic circuits. To achieve this objective, the usage of new electron-deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthetic route is desirable. Among all electron-deficient building units, N -oxide-functionalized bipyridines can be prepared through a simple oxidized transformation of bipyridines. However, employing N -oxide-functionalized bipyridines as the building unit to construct efficient N-type polymers has been overlooked. This gap strongly encourages us to design and synthesize two new N -oxide building blocks, 5,5&#39;-dibromo-[2,2&#39;-bipyridine] 1-oxide (BPyO) and 5,5&#39;-dibromo-[2,2&#39;-bipyridine] 1,1&#39;-dioxide (BPyDO), through the oxidation of sp 2 - N in 2,2ʹ-bipyridine. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction shows that BPyO and BPyDO possess planar structure with strong π-stacking, which is beneficial for charge transport. Incorporation of these building blocks into acceptor–acceptor backbones leads to two new polymers, namely P(DPP-BPyO) and P(DPP-BPyDO). Both P(DPP-BPyO) and P(DPP-BPyDO) possess lower frontier molecular orbital energy levels than the non-oxide polymer P(DPP-BPy). Consequently, the transition from P(DPP-BPy) (without oxide group) to P(DPP-BPyO) (mono-oxide group) and then to P(DPP-BPyDO) (dioxide group) can decrease hole-transport performance and gradually switch the transport nature from p-type to n-type via ambipolar. These results prove that the introduction of sp 2 - N oxide groups in building units would be a promising strategy to approach high-performance n-type polymers.},

This study introduces a simple and effective chemical method by synthesizing seven ester-based PCMs through chemical reactions involving lauric acid (LA) and seven different alcohols. These materials notably broaden the phase change temperature range, exhibiting melting temperature from −8.99 to 46.60 °C, expanding by 203.18% compared to raw alcohol materials. In addition, these samples exhibit excellent thermal stability and high latent heat, with a maximum latent heat value of 182.98 J g −1 . In subsequent application studies, this material demonstrates outstanding energy storage characteristics and proposed an innovative thermal management method for batteries based on the PCM immersion technique, allowing the battery to maintain a temperature below 60 °C for 20.5 h, while the blank group rapidly reached 60 °C within 0.82 h and increased to 75 °C within 2.35 h.

  abstract     = {Metasurfaces are the 2D counterparts of metamaterials, and their development is accelerating rapidly in the past years. This progress enables the creation of devices capable of uniquely manipulating light, with applications ranging from optical communications to remote biosensing. Metasurfaces are engineered by rational assembly of subwavelength elements, defined as meta-atoms, giving rise to unique physical properties arising from the collective behavior of meta-atoms. These meta-atoms are typically organized using effective, reproducible, and precise nanofabrication methods that require a lot of effort to achieve scalable and cost-effective metasurfaces. In contrast, bottom–up methods based on colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) have developed in the last decade as a fascinating alternative for accelerating the technological spread of metasurfaces. The present review takes stock of recent advances in the fabrication and applications of hybrid metasurfaces prepared by bottom-up methods, resulting in disordered metasurfaces. In particular, metasurfaces prepared with plasmonic NPs are emphasized for their multifold applications, which are discussed from a biotechnology perspective. However, some examples of organized metasurfaces prepared by merging bottom–up and top–down approaches are also described. Finally, leveraging the historical disordered metasurface evolution, the review draws new perspectives for random metasurface design and applications.},

  abstract     = {To address the ongoing demand for high-performance energy storage devices, it is crucial to identify new electrode materials. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) store energy via the electrochemical redox process, so their electrode materials should have reversible redox properties for rechargeability. On that note, redox-active metal complexes are explored as innovative electrode materials for LIBs. Redox-active metal(II) chloride complexes (MCC) demonstrate promising potential as anode materials, exhibiting high capacity and excellent rate capability. In particular, zinc(II) chloride complexes, referred to as ZCC, achieve a capacity of 1720 mAh g −1 at 2.0 A g −1 over 200 cycles. Additionally, the lithium-ion storage mechanism of MCC is elucidated using ex situ analyses of MCC anode&#39;s surface in its fully discharged state. The high capacity of the MCC anode is attributed to conversion reaction with Li + ions forming LiCl and electrodeposition of metallic lithium from the over-lithiated Li + ions. These findings support the potential use of redox-active metal complexes as novel anode materials for LIBs.},

  abstract     = {Optical metasurfaces have found widespread applications in the field of optoelectronic devices. However, achieving dynamic and flexible control over metasurface functionalities, while also developing simplified fabrication methods for metasurfaces, continues to pose a significant challenge. Here, the study introduces a PCM-only metasurface that exclusively consists of voxel units crafted from different phases of phase-change materials. Micro-nano regions, with varying phase states, are directly utilized as resonant elements and embedded in the material, forming the metasurface voxel meta-atoms. By manipulating the morphology, size, and arrangement of these meta-atoms, the study achieves both the fabrication and modulation of the PCM-only metasurface. Additionally, a 3D high-precision voxelated beam deflection method based on femtosecond laser phase modulation is introduced to streamline the fabrication and modulation of PCM-only metasurface. By using a spatial light modulator to load the blazed grating phase manipulation beam for precise deflection, high-precision deflection processing of individual meta-atom on metasurfaces can be achieved, with a deflection accuracy of up to 200nm. By loading Fresnel phase manipulation beams to move along the z-axis, perfect modulation of PCM sub-meta-atoms can be achieved. The 3D femtosecond laser beam deflection technology will bring many potential application opportunities in the fields of optoelectronic device fabrication and functional control.},

  abstract     = {Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are emerging environmental pollutants characterized by their extreme stability and resistance to degradation. Among them, tetrafluoromethane (CF 4 ) is the simplest and most abundant PFC in the atmosphere. However, the highest C─F bond energy and its highly symmetrical structure make it particularly challenging to decompose. In this work, a yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor is developed to enhance the catalytic hydrolysis performance of CF 4 by creating a local autothermic environment. Finite element simulations predict that the yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor captures the heat released during the catalytic hydrolysis of CF 4 , resulting in a local autothermic environment within the yolk–shell structure that is 50 °C higher than the set temperature. The effectiveness of this local autothermic environment is experimentally confirmed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. As a result, the obtained yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor achieves 100% CF 4 conversion at a considerably low temperature of 580 °C for over 150 h, while hollow and solid Al 2 O 3 structures required higher temperatures of 610 and 630 °C, respectively, to achieve the same conversion rate, demonstrating the potential of yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor to significantly reduce the energy requirements for PFCs degradation and contribute to more sustainable and effective environmental remediation strategies.},

Apart from conventional welding, a variant involving a dynamic beam modulation superimposed onto the linear motion is studied.

CT-Cl possesses a higher surface energy than CT-F, promoting vertical phase segregation and resulting in its preferential accumulation near the bottom interface of the blend. This arrangement, combined with the lower HOMO energy level of CT-Cl, effectively reduces undesired hole and electron injection under reverse voltage.

The conformational dynamics of IDPs are essential for their interactions and the formation of a condensed phase. From a physical perspective, collective behavior and the emergence of phase are associated with long-range correlations. Here the conformational dynamics of IDPs and the correlations therein are analyzed, using µs-scale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. The existence of typical scale-free spatio-temporal correlations in IDP conformational fluctuations is demonstrated. Their conformational evolutions exhibit “1/ f noise” power spectra and are accompanied by the appearance of residue domains following a power-law size distribution. Additionally, the motions of residues present scale-free behavioral correlation. These scale-free correlations resemble those in physical systems near critical points, suggesting that IDPs are poised at a critical state. Therefore, IDPs can effectively respond to finite differences in sequence compositions and engender considerable structural heterogeneity which is beneficial for IDP interactions and phase formation.},

In this study, it is demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counteracted the aging of NPCs and IVDD at the cellular and physiological levels. The expression of ACE2 correlates negatively with the degree of NPC senescence and IVDD. Using both loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, it is revealed that ACE2 deficiency increased the senescence of NPCs and exacerbated injury- or instability-induced IVDD, whereas ACE2 overexpression counteracted these detrimental effects. Mechanistically, integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk transcriptomics shows that ACE2 deficiency results in the activation of TGFβ2/Smads signaling pathway and the transcription of Serpine1, ultimately triggering NPC senescence and IVDD. A nanomedical delivery system (virus-like nanovectors, VNs) composed of nanovectors with a virus-like surface topology and small interfering RNA targeting Serpine1 (VN-siSer) is developed. With nanotopology-enhanced transfection efficiency, RNA-interfering treatment by VN-siSer effectively alleviated NPC senescence and IVDD at both the cellular and animal levels. Overall, the data reveal the underlying mechanisms of ACE2 in NPC senescence and IVDD pathogenesis and propose a distinct paradigm of precise nanomedical senescence-blockade RNAi for IVDD treatment.},

In this work, a novel approach—adaptive optical spatial differentiation is proposed for field-of-view-tunable edge detection. This method improves the ability to acquire spatial information and facilitates edge detection over a wider angular range. The adaptive optical spatial differentiation meta-device relies on two core components: the spatial differentiation dielectric metasurface and the adaptive liquid prism. The meta-device is shown to function as a highly efficient (≈85%) isotropic spatial differentiator, operating across the entire visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm) within a wide-angle object space, expanding up to 4.5 times the original field of view. The proposed scheme presents new opportunities for efficient, flexible, high-capacity integrated data processing and imaging devices.

To address the limitations of current commercial desensitizers in terms of acid resistance, friction resistance, and stability, a black phosphorus nanosheet-composited methacrylate gelatin hydrogel (GelMA/BP) is developed for DH treatment, leveraging the synergistic effects of photothermal therapy and biomineralization. Incorporating the BP nanosheet provided GelMA/BP with a stable photothermal response and the continuous release of phosphate anions, which blocked dentinal tubules by converting light energy into heat and initiating biomineralization. In vitro desensitizing therapy showed that the dentinal tubule diameter in the GelMA/BP50 group (0−1.13 µm) is significantly reduced compared to that in the DH-model group (0−3.14 µm). The GelMA/BP50 group achieved an 86% tubule occlusion rate, with acid resistance of 80%, friction resistance of 76%, and long-term stability of 74%. In vivo studies further validated the efficacy of GelMA/BP50, showing a reduction in tubule diameter (0−0.37 µm) and an occlusion rate of 79%, which alleviated toothache and increased intake and weight. These results demonstrate that this desensitizing hydrogel acts as an effective dentinal tubule sealant, offering promising clinical benefits for the topical treatment of DH.},

Here, unconvered aberrant energetic metabolism pattern in meniscus cells with OA is uncovered first, which results in lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. And these phenomena are induced by impaired autophagy in meniscus cells with OA. It is further revealed that the suppression of m 6 A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) inhibits autophagy and causing lower ATP production by reducing oxidative phosphorylation. Specific deletion of FTO in meniscus cells by generating FTO flox/flox ; COL1A1-Cre ERT2 (FTO cko ) mice impair autophagy and promote meniscus degeneration and OA, while intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus of FTO (AAV-FTO) restores autophagy and alleviates meniscus degeneration and OA. Mechanistically, FTO regulates the mRNA stability of ATG16L1 by targeting the m 6 A methylation sites on ATG16L1 in a YTHDF2-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes and causing an imbalance in energetic metabolism. Intra-articular injection of AAV-FTO reverses the catabolic phenotype of meniscus degeneration and OA in FTO cko mice. In summary, these findings reveal FTO orchestrates autophagy and energetic metabolism by regulating ATG16L1 in a m 6 A-dependent manner. Therefore, targeting FTO might be a potential therapeutic strategy for meniscus degeneration and early-stage OA.},

  abstract     = {Tinnitus, a widespread condition affecting numerous individuals worldwide, remains a significant challenge due to limited effective therapeutic interventions. Intriguingly, patients using cochlear implants (CIs) have reported significant relief from tinnitus symptoms, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and intracochlear implantation risks cochlear damage and hearing loss. This study demonstrates that targeted intracochlear electrical stimulation (ES) in guinea pigs with noise-induced hearing loss reversed tinnitus-related maladaptive plasticity in the cochlear nucleus (CN), characterized by reduced auditory innervation, increased somatosensory innervation, and diminished inhibitory neural networks. Additionally, a customized extracochlear ES delivered by a newly designed extracochlear electrode array to guinea pigs with salicylate-induced tinnitus also reversed the aforementioned maladaptive plasticity and alleviated tinnitus without causing additional cochlear damage or hearing loss. These findings suggest that CI-delivered ES may alleviate tinnitus by reversing maladaptive CN plasticity. Additionally, the extracochlear ES strategy offers a promising tinnitus treatment with minimal risk to hearing.},

  abstract     = {Neo-vascularization plays a key role in achieving long-term viability of engineered cells contained in medical implants used in precision medicine. Moreover, strategies to promote neo-vascularization around medical implants may also be useful to promote the healing of deep wounds. In this context, a biocompatible, electroconducti v e b o rophene–poly(ε-capro l ac t one) (PCL) 3D platform is developed, which is called VOLT, to support designer cells engineered with a direct-current (DC) voltage-controlled gene circuit that drives secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). The VOLT platform consists of a 3D-printed borophene-PCL honeycomb-shaped matrix decorated with borophene-PCL nanofibers by electrospinning. The honeycomb structure provides mechanical stability, while the nanofibers facilitate the adhesion, migration, and proliferation of the engineered cells. The cells incorporate a DC-powered reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensing gene circuit wired to an engineered synthetic promoter that triggers secretion of VEGFA to promote vascularization in the adjacent extracellular matrix. Cells engineered with this gene circuit and enclosed in the VOLT matrix, termed the VOLT VEGFA system, can be simply triggered using off-the-shelf AA batteries, utilizing the established ability of a brief DC bias to generate non-cytotoxic levels of ROS. For proof-of-concept, a subcutaneous wound-healing model in rats is chosen. Electrostimulation of a VOLT VEGFA implant (5 V, 20 s per day) induced secretion of VEGFA, and significantly accelerated neovascularization and granulation tissue formation, resulting in faster wound closure compared with non-stimulated controls. Complete re-epithelialization and dermal regeneration are observed within 15 days of application.},

Results demonstrate that the system can eliminate biofilm, reduce cytotoxicity, promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration by the multiple advantages of chemodynamic therapy (CDT), enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT), and improved degradation process from BP NSs to phosphate for promoting cell proliferation. Notably, the balance between excellent photodynamic stability and rapid degradability of BP NSs is maintained, and the improved degradation mechanism of BP NSs is vividly elucidated by density functional theory (DFT)-based molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Furthermore, the transcriptional changes of treated MRSA-infected skin are studied using RNA-seq technology to reveal the potential therapeutic mechanism.

  abstract     = {Despite their safety and widespread use, conventional protein antigen-based subunit vaccines face significant challenges such as low immunogenicity, insufficient long-term immunity, poor CD8 + T-cell activation, and poor adaptation to viral variants. To address these issues, an infection-mimicking gel (IM-Gel) is developed that is designed to emulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of immune stimulation in acute viral infections through in situ supramolecular self-assembly of nanoparticulate-TLR7/8a (NP-TLR7/8a) and an antigen with tannic acid (TA). Through collagen-binding properties of TA, the IM-Gel enables sustained delivery and enhanced retention of NP-TLR7/8a and protein antigen in the lymph node subcapsular sinus of mice for over 7 days, prolonging the exposure of vaccine components in both B cell and T cell zones, leading to robust humoral and cellular responses. The IM-Gel system with the influenza A antigen confers cross-protection against multiple influenza subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H3N2, H7N3, and H9N2) with long-term immune responses. Combination of the IM-Gel with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein also elicits strong cross-reactive antibody responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, NY510+D614G, Gamma, Kappa, and Delta). The IM-Gel, as a programmable immunomodulatory material, provides a vaccine design principle for the development of next-generation universal vaccines that can elicit broad and durable protective immunity against emerging viruses.},

However, it is unclear whether maternal gut inflammation (MGI) during lactation influences mother-to-infant microbial transmission and offspring microbiota and disease susceptibility. In this study, it is found that MGI during lactation altered the gut microbiota of suckling pups by shaping the maternal microbiota in the gut and mammary glands. MGI-induced changes in the gut microbiota of suckling pups lasted into adulthood, resulting in the exacerbation of acute liver failure (ALF) caused by acetaminophen (APAP) in offspring. Specifically, MGI reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri ( L. reuteri ) and its metabolite indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level in adult offspring. L. reuteri and IAA alleviated ALF in mice by promoting intestinal IL-22 production. Mechanistically, IL-22 limits APAP-induced excessive oxidative stress and ferroptosis by activating STAT3. The intestinal abundances of L. reuteri and IAA are inversely associated with the progression of patients with ALF. Overall, the study reveals the role of MGI in mother-to-infant microbial transmission and disease development in offspring, highlighting potential strategies for intervention in ALF based on the IAA-IL-22-STAT3 axis.},

The material set for 3D printing traditionally is focused on structural materials rather than functional materials suitable for electronic and electrochemical applications. In this review the fundamental challenges are considered for transforming 3D printed materials into conductive, multifunctional electrodes suitable for electrical and electrochemical devices by printing nanocomposites, infusing molecular precursors and post-processing these structures via carbonization. To understand the design of 3D electrodes toward their use in both sensors and electrochemical devices such as catalysts, this review summarizes recent advances in hierarchical design of porous metastructures, the engineering of mass transport and electronic transport in 3D structures, and the application of high-throughput materials design by machine learning and artificial intelligence. These emerging approaches to 3D electrode design and architecture promise to expand the capabilities of additive manufacturing beyond structural materials and bring its advantages to bear on modern devices such as sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, and electrocatalysts.},

Therefore, understanding the immune mechanisms underlying mammary infections caused by S. aureus is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies against mastitis. This study identified hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) as a potential regulator of S. aureus infection in mammary glands. It is demonstrated that HCAR2 deficiency exacerbates the inflammatory response and disrupts the blood-milk barrier in the mammary gland during S. aureus infection, with NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis playing a central role. Activation of HCAR2, on the other hand, suppressed CMPK2 expression, thereby mitigating mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis in mouse mammary epithelial cells (mMECs) induced by S. aureus . Additionally, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released from S. aureus -infected mMECs activates the cGAS/STING signaling pathway in macrophages, impairing their bactericidal activity. In conclusion, this study highlights the critical role of HCAR2 in S. aureus infection of the mammary gland and provides a theoretical basis for identifying potential therapeutic targets for such infections.},

Here, a self-assembling, licofelone-loaded nanoparticle (termed LCF-CSBN), comprising chondroitin sulfate and bilirubin joined by an ethylenediamine linker, is developed to selectively reprogram lipid metabolism in macrophage activation. LCF-CSBN is internalized by M1 macrophages via CD44-mediated endocytosis and targets the Golgi apparatus accompanied with the reactive oxygen species-responsive release of licofelone (LCF, dual inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism). LCF-CSBN effectively promotes M1 to M2 macrophage transition by reprogramming the Golgi apparatus-related sphingolipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. Intra-articularly injected LCF-CSBN retains in the joint for up to 28 days and accumulates into M1 macrophages. Moreover, LCF-CSBN can effectively attenuate joint inflammation, oxidative stress, and cartilage degeneration in OA model rats.

  abstract     = {In the face of exponential data growth, DNA-based storage offers a promising solution for preserving big data. However, most existing DNA storage methods, akin to traditional block printing, require costly chemical synthesis for each individual data file, adopting a sequential, one-time-use synthesis approach. To overcome these limitations, a novel, cost-effective “DNA-movable-type storage” system, inspired by movable type printing, is introduced. This system utilizes prefabricated DNA movable types-short, double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides encoding specific payload, address, and checksum data. These DNA-MTs are enzymatically ligated/assembled into cohesive sequences, termed “DNA movable type blocks,” streamlining the assembly process with the automated BISHENG-1 DNA-MT inkjet printer. Using BISHENG-1, 43.7 KB of data files are successfully printed, assembled, stored, and accurately retrieved in diverse formats (text, image, audio, and video) in vitro and in vivo, using only 350 DNA-MTs. Notably, each DNA-MT, synthesized once (2 OD ), can be used up to 10000 times, reducing costs to $122/MB—outperforming existing DNA storage methods. This innovation circumvents the need to synthesize entire DNA sequences encoding files from scratch, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages. Furthermore, it has considerable untapped potential to advance a robust DNA storage system, better meeting the extensive data storage demands of the big-data era.},

  abstract     = {Wireless, passive, and flexible strain sensors can transform structural health monitoring across various applications by eliminating the need for wired connections and active power sources. Such sensors offer the dual benefits of operational simplicity and high-function adaptability. Herein, a novel wireless sensor is fabricated using radio frequency (RF) technology for passive, wireless measurement of mechanical strains. Previously introduced concept of coupling piezoresistive electrodes is utilized with capacitive sensors to ensure high-sensitivity capacitive sensing. For the first time, it is implemented and demonstrated here as a fully printable, inexpensive, and ready-to-use device utilizing the recent advances in piezoresistive inks and screen-printing technologies. The near-field communication (NFC) tag features an inductor - capacitor (LC) resonant circuit with a distinct resonant frequency. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity and detects substantial variations in capacitance, with a gauge factor (GF) of ≈16 at 20 MHz for strain levels below 5%. Within the wireless framework, the sensor achieves a significant shift in resonance frequency (GF of ≈2.2). It also exhibited excellent performance in wirelessly monitoring the strain in a glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) specimen during the bending test. The results confirm the potential applicability of the sensor as an embedded sensor for monitoring various types of composite structures. This confirms the potential of the sensor for use in composite structures as an embedded sensor.},

  abstract     = {Studying the molecular basis of intestinal infections caused by enteric pathogens at the tissue level is challenging, because most human intestinal infection models have limitations, and results obtained from animals may not reflect the human situation. Infections with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) have different outcomes between organisms. 3D tissue modeling of primary human material provides alternatives to animal experimentation, but epithelial co-culture with immune cells remains difficult. Macrophages, for instance, contribute to the immunocompetence of native tissue, yet their incorporation into human epithelial tissue models is challenging. A 3D immunocompetent tissue model of the human small intestine based on decellularized submucosa enriched with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) is established. The multicellular model recapitulated in vivo-like cellular diversity, especially the induction of GP2 positive microfold (M) cells. Infection studies with STm reveal that the pathogen physically interacts with these M-like cells. MDMs show trans-epithelial migration and phagocytosed STm within the model and the levels of inflammatory cytokines are induced upon STm infection. Infected epithelial cells are shed into the supernatant, potentially reflecting an intracellular reservoir of invasion-primed STm. Together, the 3D model of the human intestinal epithelium bears potential as an alternative to animals to identify human-specific processes underlying enteric bacterial infections.},

One hundred and eighty-six twins are recruited and played as responders in the Ultimatum Game (UG) while undergoing fMRI scanning in their early adulthood (Study-1) and are measured on depressive symptoms eight years later (Study-2). With computational modeling, the process of norm adaptation is differentiated from that of fairness valuation in UG. The two processes both have moderate levels of heritability. The anterior insula has a significant phenotypic correlation, whereas the Supplementary Motor Area/Medial Frontal Gyrus (SMA/mSFG) shows both a significant phenotypic correlation and a shared genetic influence with the learning rate, an index for norm adaptation. The dopaminergic DRD2 polymorphisms correlate with both the learning rate and the SMA/mSFG encoding of prediction error, constituting of their common genetic basis. Regional gene expression analysis reveals the high expression of dopamine-related genes in the SMA/mSFG. Moreover, the learning rate can predict depressive symptom severity eight years later, with the DRD2 polymorphisms constituting their shared genetic basis. This suggests that heritability is a non-negligible driving force behind norm adaptation, which facilitates the learning of social norms in changing environments and preserves long-term mental health.},

This panel permits not only identification of thalassemia mutations at 100% of sensitivity and specificity, but also detection of rare structural variants (SVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in modifier genes/loci. The highly homologous regions of α-/β-globin gene clusters are then phased and 3 novel haplotypes in HBG1/HBG2 region are reported in this population of β-thalassemia patients. Furthermore, one of the haplotypes is associated with ameliorated symptoms of β-thalassemia. Similarly, 5 major haplotypes are identified in HBA1/HBA2 homologous region while one of them is found highly linked with deletional α-thalassemia mutations. Finally, rare mutations in erythroid transcription factors in DNMT1 and KLF1 associated with increased expression of fetal hemoglobin and reduced transfusion dependencies are identified.

MMFuncPhos outperforms existing functional phosphorylation site prediction approaches. EFuncType is further developed based on transfer learning to predict whether phosphorylation of a residue upregulates or downregulates enzyme activity for the first time.

The study contributes to the understanding of the functional regulatory mechanism of phosphorylation and provides valuable tools for precision medicine, enzyme engineering, and drug discovery.

In MCAO mice, the nanoformulation (polymer: 3.2 mg·kg −1 , BAPTA-AM: 400 µg·kg −1 ) reversibly opened the BBB and achieved high brain biodistribution up to 12.7%ID/g of the total administered dose after 3 h post single injection, effectively restoring intracellular Ca 2+ and redox homeostasis, improving cerebral histopathology, and inhibiting mitochondrial PI3K/Akt/Bcl-2/Bax/Cyto-C/Caspase-3,9 apoptosis pathway for rescuing dying neurons (reduced apoptosis cell from 59.5% to 7.9%). It also remodeled the inflammatory microenvironment in cerebral ischemic penumbra by inhibiting astrocyte over-activation, reprogramming microglia polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and blocking NF-κB/TNF- α /IL-6 signaling pathways. These interventions eventually reduced the cerebral infarction area by 96.3%, significantly improved neurological function, and restored blood flow reperfusion from 66.2% to ≈100%, all while facilitating BBB repair and avoiding brain edema.

  abstract     = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is an “environmental obesogen” and this study aims to investigate the intergenerational impacts of BPA-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS), specifically focusing on unraveling mechanisms. Exposure to BPA induces metabolic disorders in the paternal mice, which are then transmitted to offspring, leading to late-onset MetS. Mechanistically, BPA upregulates Srebf1, which in turn promotes the Pparg-dependent transcription of Dicer1 in spermatocytes, increasing the levels of multiple sperm microRNAs (miRNAs). Several of these miRNAs are highly expressed in a synchronized manner in liver of the offspring. miR149-5p, miR150-5p, and miR700-5p target a specific region in the Lepr 3′UTR, termed “SMITE” (“ S everal Mi RNAs T argeting E lements”), to negatively regulate Lepr. These i nherited a nti- L epr miRNAs, also referred to i nherited a nti- L epr miRNAs (IAL-miRs), modulate hepatic steatosis, and insulin signaling through the Lepr regulatory Igfbp2, Egfr, and Ampk. Furthermore, IAL-miRs inhibit Ccnd1 not only via binding to “SMITE” but also via Lepr–Igfbp2 axis, which contribute to hepatocyte senescence. These pathological processes interact in a self-reinforcing cycle, worsening MetS in the paternal BPA-exposed offspring. The findings reveal mechanism wherein lipid metabolism reprogramming in spermatocytes-induced perturbations of sperm miRNAs, triggered by BPA, leads to intergenerational inheritance of paternal MetS through suppression of the hepatic Lepr axis in the offspring.},

This system utilizes real-time image processing to detect pheno-morphological traits in MCAs. They are then encapsulated in millimetric drops, actuated on-demand using the acoustic radiation force. The performance of ImOCAS is demonstrated by sorting spheroids with uniform sizes from a heterogeneous population, and by isolating organoids from spheroids with different phenotypes. This approach lays the groundwork for high-throughput screening and high-content analysis of MCAs with controlled morphological and phenotypical properties, which promises accelerated progress in biomedical research.},

The initial stages of bone-related immunomodulation and cellular colonization play crucial roles, but have received limited attention. Herein, a novel supramolecular co-assembled coating of strontium (Sr)-doped metal polyphenol networks (MPN) modified with c(RGDfc) is developed and well-characterized, for eliciting an early immunomodulation and cellular colonization. The results showed that the (Sr-MPN)@RGD coating significantly regulated the polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype by controllable release of Sr, and promote the initial adhesion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by RGD presented on MPN. Notably, the (Sr-MPN)@RGD attenuated osteoclast differentiation and oxidative stress as well as enhanced osteoblast differentiation and angiogenesis due to macrophage polarization toward M2 phenotype, which in turn has a profound effect on neighboring cells through paracrine signaling. In vivo results showed that the (Sr-MPN)@RGD coating manifested superior osseointegration and bone maturation to the bare Ti-rod or Ti-rod coated with MPN and Sr-MPN.

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial quality control is paramount for cellular development, with mitochondrial electron flow (Mito-EF) playing a central role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. However, unlike visible protein entities, which can be monitored through chemical biotechnology, regulating mitochondrial quality control by invisible entities such as Mito-EF has remained elusive. Here, a Mito-EF tracker (Mito-EFT) with a four-pronged probe design is presented to elucidate the dynamic mechanisms of Mito-EF&#39;s involvement in mitochondrial quality control. Heightened aggregation of Mito-EF in fiber-like healthy mitochondria compared to round-like damaged mitochondria is demonstrated, revealed Mito-EF aggregation correlated with mitochondrial morphological remodeling, particularly in regions undergoing mitochondrial fission and fusion, and show the Mito-EF signal associated with mitochondrial cristae maintained by Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP1). This underscores the importance of considering Mito-EF in assessing mitochondrial quality control parameters. A novel drug screening evaluation parameter, Mito-EF is also introduced to screen and discover mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic modulators. This tracker provides new avenues for investigating the role of Mito-EF in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and quality control, offering a potent tool for assessing mitochondrial quality and drug screening.},

  abstract     = {The anisotropic properties of materials profoundly influence their electronic, magnetic, optical, and mechanical behaviors and are critical for a wide range of applications. In this study, the anisotropic characteristics of Ni-based van der Waals materials, specifically NiTe 2 and its alloy NiTeSe, utilizing a combination of comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are explored. Unlike 1T-NiTe 2 , which exhibits trigonal in-plane symmetry, the substitution of Te with Se in NiTe 2 (resulting in the NiTeSe alloy) induces a pronounced in-plane anisotropy. This anisotropy is clear in the STM topographs, which reveal a distinct linear order of charge distribution. Corroborating these observations, ARPES measurements and DFT calculations reveal an anisotropic Fermi surface centered at the point, which is notably elongated along the k y direction, leading to directional variations in in-plane carrier velocities. Consequently, the Fermi velocity is highest along the k x direction where the linear charge distribution aligns in real space and is lowest along the k y direction. These findings offer valuable insights into the tunability of anisotropic properties in ternary transition metal dichalcogenide systems, highlighting their potential applications in the development of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

However, their structural determinants for spectral broadening and operating stability are still needed to be investigated in further. Herein, a novel multi-N-heterocycles Diindolo[3,2,1jk:3′,2′,1′jk]dicarbazole[1,2-b:4,5-b] (DIDCz) is proposed to manipulate the emission color toward pure blue region by extending π-conjugation of the N-π-N bridge. By utilizing computed spectral technique, interrelationships between indolocarbazole (ICz)-cyclization sites and spectral broadening are defined. Molecular backbone modifications involving optimized 2,3,6,7-ICz cyclization and steric hindrance substituents are conducive to restricting swing of peripheral bonds and stretching resonances of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) frameworks, thereby contributing to the reduction of shoulder emission peaks. Consequently, the DIDCz-based chromophore exhibited narrowband blue emission with a FWHM of only 15 nm, achieving highly efficient (external quantum efficiencies of 8.87% in triplet–triplet fusion fluorescence and 22.3% in sensitized fluorescence) and long-term (95% of the initial luminance of 1000 cd m −2 , T95 = 1545 h) electroluminescence performances, showing one of the most narrowband and stable blue OLEDs among the reported PAH chromophores. The current achievements offer a new perspective to manage spectral broadening precisely based on the molecular vibration limiting technique.},

  abstract     = {Skeletal muscle atrophy (sarcopenia) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis, and chronic muscle inflammation plays a pivotal role in its pathologenesis. However, the detailed mechanism through which injured liver tissues mediate skeletal muscle inflammatory injury remains elusive. Here, it is reported that injured hepatocytes might secrete mtDNA-enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs) to trigger skeletal muscle inflammation by activating the cGAS-STING pathway. Briefly, injured liver secreted increased amounts of EVs into circulation, which are then engulfed primarily by macrophages in skeletal muscle and subsequently induce cGAS-STING signaling and its-mediated inflammatory response in muscles. In contrast, suppression of hepatic EV secretion or STING signaling significantly alleviated cirrhosis-induced skeletal muscle inflammation and muscle atrophy in vivo. Circulating EVs from cirrhotic patients showed higher levels of mtDNA, and the levels of EV-mtDNA positively correlated with the severity of liver injury. In injured hepatocytes, mitochondrial damage promoted the release of cytosolic mtDNA and the subsequent secretion of mtDNA-enriched EVs. This study reveals that injured hepatocyte-derived EVs induce skeletal muscle inflammation via the mtDNA‒STING axis, while targeted blockade of liver EV secretion or STING signaling represents a potential therapeutic approach for preventing cirrhosis-associated skeletal muscle atrophy.},

  abstract     = {Heterojunctions, known for their decent separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, are promising for photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. However, a significant obstacle in traditional post-assembled heterojunctions is the high interfacial barrier for charge transfer caused by atomic lattice mismatch at multiphase interfaces. Here, as research prototypes, the study creates a lattice-matched co-atomic interface within CsPbBr 3 -CsPb 2 Br 5 polytypic nanocrystals (113-125 PNs) through the proposed in situ hybrid strategy to elucidate the underlying charge transfer mechanism within this unique interface. Compared to CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals, the 113–125 PNs exhibit a remarkable 3.6-fold increase in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity (173.3 µmol −1 g −1 within 5 h). Furthermore, Kelvin probe force microscopy results reveal an increase in the built-in electric field within this lattice-matched co-atomic interface from 43.5 to 68.7 mV, providing a stronger driving force for charge separation and directional migration. Additionally, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy uncovers the additional charge carrier transfer pathways across this lattice-matched co-atomic interface. Thus, this unique co-atomic interface significantly promotes the interfacial electronic coupling and mitigates the charge transfer barrier, thus facilitating efficient charge separation and transfer. These insights underscore the importance of interfacial structure in heterojunction design and comprehending the intricate interplay between interface and carrier dynamics.},

Herein, the study reports a supramolecular photosensitizer, BSA@TPE-BT-SCT NPs, through encapsulating aggregation-enhanced emission photosensitizer by bovine serum albumin (BSA) to significantly enhance ROS, particularly less oxygen-dependent type I ROS for photodynamic immunotherapy. The abundant type I ROS generated by BSA@TPE-BT-SCT NPs induce multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. These multifaceted cell deaths synergistically facilitate the release of damage-associated molecular patterns and antitumor cytokines, thereby provoking robust antitumor immunity. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that BSA@TPE-BT-SCT NPs elicited the immunogenic cell death, enhance dendritic cell maturation, activate T cell, and reduce myeloid-derived suppressor cells, leading to the inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Additionally, BSA@TPE-BT-SCP NPs also exhibited excellent antitumor performance in a humanized mice model, evidenced by a reduction in senescent T cells among these activated T cells. The findings advance the development of robust type I photosensitizers and unveil the important role of type I ROS in enhancing multifaceted tumor cell deaths and antitumor immunogenicity.},

A well-developed lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform has been widely explored for high-performance electro-optic (EO) modulators to bridge electrical and optical signals. However, the photonic waveguides on the x-cut LNOI platform suffer serious polarization-mode conversion/coupling issues because of strong birefringence, making it hard to realize large-scale integration. Here, low-birefringence photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on lithium-tantalate-on-insulator (LTOI) are proposed and demonstrated, which enables high-performance passive photonic devices as well as EO modulators, showing great potential for large-scale photonic chips. Analysis of mode conversion and evolution behaviors with both low- and high-birefringence shows undesired mode hybridizations can be effectively suppressed. A simple and universal fabrication process is developed and various representative passive photonic devices are demonstrated with impressive performances. Finally, a wavelength-division-multiplexed optical transmitter is developed with a data rate of 1.6 Tbps by monolithically integrating 8 EO modulators and an 8-channel arrayed waveguide grating. Therefore, the demonstrated low-birefringence LTOI platform shows strong ability in both passively and actively controlling photon behaviors on a chip, indicating great potential for ultrafast processing and communicating large-capacity data.},

There are evidences to support the role of gut microbiota as a key player in reproductive development. Unfortunately, the relationship between reproductive disorders caused by aging and gut microbiota remains largely unknown. Here, it is shown for the first time that gut microorganism Bacteroides fragilis (BF) transplantation ameliorates ovarian aging by transporting extracellular vesicles (EVs) through the gut-ovary axis. Mechanistically, miR-1246 is enriched in EVs derived from BF-treated intestinal cells, and these miR-1246-enriched EVs are transferred to ovaries, thereby effectively improving reproductive senescence by reducing oxidative stress in the ovaries. Specifically, miR-1246 reduces the ubiquitination of p62 and stabilizes the protein level of p62 by targeting E3 ligase SKP2. Then Keap1-Nrf2 complex is dissociated and Keap1 is recruited to form the p62-Keap1 complex. With the dissociation of Keap1-Nrf2 complex, Nrf2 is released and activated, thus promoting the transcription of antioxidant enzymes and relieving reproductive senescence. Collectively, the data indicates that intestinal cell-derived EVs serve as natural information carriers in the crosstalk between the gut and the ovary, and intestinal microorganism transplantation is a promising approach for the treatment of ovarian dysfunction diseases.},

  abstract     = {Most gene therapies exert their actions via manipulation of hepatocytes (parenchymal cells) and the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of synthetic mRNA in non-parenchymal cells (NPC) such as Kupffer cells (KC), and liver macrophages, remain unclear. Here, the spatio-temporal distribution of mRNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( Egfp ), siRNA, or both co-encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNP) in the liver in vivo using real-time intravital imaging is investigated. Although both KC and hepatocytes demonstrate comparable high and rapid uptake of mRNA-LNP and siRNA-LNP in vivo, the translation of Egfp mRNA occurs exclusively in hepatocytes during intravital imaging. Despite attempts such as inhibiting intracellular ribonuclease, substituting uridine bases in mRNA with pseudouridine, and using a different ionizable lipid in the LNP mixture, no substantial increase in Egfp translation by NPC is possible. The investigation reveals that hepatocytes, which are distinct from other liver cells due to their polyploidy, exhibit significantly elevated levels of total RNA and protein, along with a higher proportion of ribosomal protein per individual cell. Consequently, fundamental cellular differences account for the low mRNA translation observed in NPC. The findings therefore suggest that cellular biology imposes a natural limitation on synthetic mRNA translation that is strongly influenced by cellular ploidy.},

Herein, a highly efficient RuO 2 catalysts via a facile hydrolysis-annealing approach is reported for water electrolysis. The RuO 2 catalyst dealt with at 200 °C (RuO 2 -200) performs the highest activities on both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid with overpotentials of 200 mV for OER and 66 mV for HER to reach a current density of 100 mA cm −2 as well as stable operation for100 h. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations show that the activities of as-prepared RuO 2 rely on the hydroxide group/lattice oxygen (OH − /O 2− ) ratio, size, and crystalline of RuO 2 . The density functional theory (DFT) calculation also reveal that the OH − would enhance the activities of RuO 2 for HER and OER via modifying the electronic structure to facilitate intermediate adsorption, thereby reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. The water electrolysis by using RuO 2 -200 as the catalyst on both anode and cathode demonstrates a stable generation of hydrogen and oxygen with high Faradic efficiency at a current density of ≈30 mA cm −2 and a potential of below 1.47 V.},

  abstract     = {Hyperglycemia accelerates Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) progression, yet the role of monosaccharides remains unclear. Here, it is demonstrated that mannose, a hexose, closely correlates with the pathological characteristics of AD, as confirmed by measuring mannose levels in the brains and serum of AD mice, as well as in the serum of AD patients. AD mice are given mannose by intra-cerebroventricular injection (ICV) or in drinking water to investigate the effects of mannose on cognition and AD pathological progression. Chronic mannose overload increases β-amyloid (Aβ) burdens and exacerbates cognitive impairments, which are reversed by a mannose-free diet or mannose transporter antagonists. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics suggested that mannose-mediated N-glycosylation of BACE1 and Nicastrin enhances their protein stability, promoting Aβ production. Additionally, reduced mannose intake decreased BACE1 and Nicastrin stability, ultimately lowering Aβ production and mitigating AD pathology. this results highlight that high-dose mannose consumption may exacerbate AD pathogenesis. Restricting dietary mannose may have therapeutic benefits.},

  abstract     = {Oral diseases rank among the most prevalent clinical conditions globally, typically involving detrimental factors such as infection, inflammation, and injury in their occurrence, development, and outcomes. The concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells has been demonstrated as a pivotal player in modulating these intricate pathological processes, exerting significant roles in restoring oral functionality and maintaining tissue structural integrity. Due to their enzyme-like catalytic properties, unique composition, and intelligent design, ROS-based nanomaterials have garnered considerable attention in oral nanomedicine. Such nanomaterials have the capacity to influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of ROS within biological systems, guiding the evolution of intra-ROS to facilitate therapeutic interventions. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the design, functional customization, and oral medical applications of ROS-based nanomaterials. Through the analysis of the components and designs of various novel nanozymes and ROS-based nanoplatforms responsive to different stimuli dimensions, it elaborates on their impacts on the dynamic behavior of intra-ROS and their potential regulatory mechanisms within the body. Furthermore, it discusses the prospects and strategies of nanotherapies based on ROS scavenging and generation in oral diseases, offering alternative insights for the design and development of nanomaterials for treating ROS-related conditions.},

Zn 2+ plays a crucial role in bone formation, but excessive early release may cause cytotoxicity and inhibit osseointegration. To solve this, we developed a near-infrared (NIR) light-controlled polycaprolactone/copper-sulfur (PCL/CuS) coating that slows degradation and enhances osseointegration of Zn alloys. The zinc–lithium (Zn–Li) substrate is encapsulated with PCL, reducing Zn 2+ release and maintaing biocompatibility. Controlled Zn 2+ release and mild photothermal therapy via CuS nanoparticles promoted osteogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrated enhanced cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed improved osseointegration. Mechanistic studies using RNA sequencing and Western blotting revealed that the coating promotes osteogenesis by activating the Wnt/β-catenin and inhibiting NF-κB pathways. This NIR light-controlled PCL/CuS coating successfully regulates Zn alloy degradation, enhances osseointegration via controlled Zn 2+ release and mild photothermal therapy effct, presenting a promising avenue for orthopedic biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Activating the pyroptosis pathway of tumor cells by photodynamic therapy (PDT) for immunogenic cell death (ICD) is considered a valid strategy in pursuit of antitumor immunotherapy, but it remains a huge challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Moreover, it is often overlooked that conventional PDT can exacerbate the development of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is apparently unfavorable to clinical immunotherapy. The endoplasmic reticulum&#39;s (ER) pivotal role in cellular homeostasis and its emerging link to pyroptosis have galvanized interest in ER-centric imaging and therapeutics. Herein, using the targeted group-assisted strategy (TAGS), an intriguing cyclooxygenase-2-targeted photodynamic conjugate, Indo-Cy , strategically created, which exploits the enzyme&#39;s overabundance in the tumoral ER, especially under proinflammatory hypoxic conditions. This conjugate, with its highly precise ER imaging, embodies a trifunctional strategy: i) innovating an electron transfer mechanism, converting the hemicyanine moiety into an oxygen-independent type I photosensitizer, thereby navigating around the hypoxia constraints of traditional PDT; ii) executing precise ER-targeted PDT, amplifying caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis for ICD; 3) attenuating immunosuppressive pathways by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 downstream factors, including HIF-1α, PGE2, and VEGF. Indo-Cy &#39;s multimodal approach potently induces in vivo tumor pyroptosis and bolsters antitumor immunity, underscoring cyclooxygenase-2-targeted dyes&#39; potential as a versatile oncotherapeutics.},

In this work, StretchView is presented, a multi-axial cell-stretching platform compatible with automated, time-resolved live-cell imaging. Using StretchView, long-term image acquisition of cells in the relaxed and stretched states is shown for the first time (experimental time of 12 h) without the need for human intervention. Homogeneous and stable strain fields are demonstrated for 18 h of cyclic stretching, highlighting the platform&#39;s versatility and robustness. As proof-of-principle, the effect of stretching on cell kinematics and spatiotemporal localization of the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is examined for MDCK cells in monolayer. First evidence of a monotonic increase in junctional E-cadherin localization upon exposure to stretch is presented using live-cell imaging data acquired during cyclic stretching, suggestive of an increase in barrier integrity of the monolayer. These findings highlight the potential of StretchView in providing insights into cell mechanobiology and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), is the global leading cause of irreversible blindness. Current first-line therapeutics, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists, often yield incomplete and suboptimal vision improvement, necessitating the exploration of novel and efficacious therapeutic approaches. Herein, a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct moringin (MOR) loaded α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) coated nanoceria (M@CCNP) is constructed, where the hydroxy and newly formed carbonyl groups of α-CD interact with the nanoceria surface via O─Ce conjunction and the isothiocyanate group of MOR inserts deeply into the α-CD cavity via host–guest interaction. By exploiting the recycling reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability of nanoceria and the anti-inflammation properties of MOR, the two-level strike during AMD pathogenesis can be precisely blocked by M@CCNP. Remarkably, excellent therapeutic efficacy to CNV is observed in vivo, achieving over 80% reduction in neovascularization and over 60% reduction in leakage area. In summary, the supramolecular engineered nanoceria provides an efficient approach for amelioration of AMD by blocking the two-level strike, and presents significant potential as an exceptional drug delivery platform, particularly for ROS-related diseases.},

Although 3D printing has shown promise to flexibly fabricate 3D bioelectronics compared with conventional microfabrication, relatively-low resolution limits the printed bioelectrode for high-quality signal monitoring. Here, a novel multi-material electrohydrodynamic printing (EHDP) strategy is proposed to fabricate bioelectronics with sub-microscale 3D gold pillars for in vitro electrophysiological recordings. EHDP is employed to fabricate conductive circuits for signal transmission, which are passivated by polyimide via extrusion-based printing. Laser-assisted EHDP is developed to produce 3D gold pillars featuring a diameter of 0.64 ± 0.04 µm. The 3D gold pillars demonstrate stable conductivity under the cell-culture environment. Living cells can conformally grow onto these sub-microscale 3D pillars with a height below 5 µm, which facilitates the highly-sensitive recording of extracellular signals with amplitudes &lt;15 µV. The 3D pillars can apply electroporation currents to reversibly open the cellular membrane for intracellular recording, facilitating the measurement of subtle cellular electrophysiological activities. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, fully-printed chips with multiple culturing chambers and sensing bioelectronics are fabricated for zone-specific electrophysiological recording in drug testing.

  abstract     = {End-stage liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma or acute liver failure, critically necessitate liver transplantation. However, the shortage of available organ donors fails to meet the rapidly growing transplantation demand. Due to the high similarity of liver tissue structure and metabolism between miniature pigs and humans, xenotransplantation of pig livers is considered as a potentially viable solution to organ scarcity. In the 2024, teams from China first time have successfully transplanted a genetically modified Bama miniature pig liver into a clinically brain-dead man lasting for 10 days. This milestone in human xenotransplantation research not only confirms the feasibility of clinical application of xenotransplantation, but also underscores the daunting and protracted nature of this pathway. Despite advanced gene-editing technologies theoretically circumventing the occurrence of most transplant rejection reactions, patients still face challenges such as chronic immune rejection, coagulation disorders, and thrombotic microangiopathy after receiving xenografts. Moreover, prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs may induce irreversible immune dysfunction, leading to opportunistic infections and metabolic disorders. This article compares the similarities and differences in livers between humans and pigs, summarizes the immunometabolism of xenotransplantation based on current findings, and provides research perspectives on pre-transplantation and post-transplantation strategies for prolonging the survival time of xenografts.},

  abstract     = {The primary cilia serve as pivotal mediators of environmental signals and play crucial roles in neuronal responses. Disruption of ciliary function has been implicated in neuronal circuit disorders and aberrant neuronal excitability. However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. To study the link between the primary cilia and neuronal excitability, manipulation of somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is investigated, as an example of how alterations in ciliary signaling may affect neuronal activity. It is found that aberrant SSTR3 expression perturbed not only ciliary morphology but also disrupted ciliary signaling cascades. Genetic deletion of SSTR3 resulted in perturbed spatial memory and synaptic plasticity. The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region in the axon where action potentials are initiated. Interestingly, loss of ciliary SSTR3 led to decrease of Akt-dependent cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription at the AIS, specifically downregulating AIS master organizer adaptor protein ankyrin G (AnkG) expression. In addition, alterations of other ciliary proteins serotonin 6 receptor (5-HT6R)and intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) also induced length changes of the AIS. The findings elucidate a specific interaction between the primary cilia and AIS, providing insight into the impact of the primary cilia on neuronal excitability and circuit integrity.},

  abstract     = {The combination of photosensitizers (PSs) and nanomaterials is a widely used strategy to enhance PS efficacy and broaden their applicability. However, the current nanocarrier-based delivery strategies focus on conventional PSs, neglecting the critical issue of PS phototoxicity. In this study, DHUOCl-25, an activatable PS (aPS) activated by hypochlorous acid, is synthesized by combining a silicon source structure and an activation unit. DHUOCl-25 functions as a silica source for synthesizing activatable mesoporous silica nanostrctures (MSNs) using a standardized protocol, enabling the synthesis of aPS-covalently modified MSNs for a variety of biologic therapeutic applications. On one hand, the resulting nano-aPS maintains aPS functionality for antibacterial application by achieving synergistic antibacterial action via MB PDT and retained cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (antibacterial agent) (DHU–MSNs-2). On the other hand, the nano-aPS exhibits MSN properties for drug loading, facilitating the synergistic integration of photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy (DHU–MSNs-6) of tumors and demonstrating efficacy against the spinal metastases of lung cancer. These results validate this strategy for developing novel aPSs and expanding the application of aPSs and MSNs.},

  abstract     = {Excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is theorized as a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, with ample research focusing on elucidating its cellular manifestations. However, few studies investigate E/I imbalance at the macroscale, whole-brain level, and its microcircuit-level mechanisms and clinical significance remain incompletely understood. Here, the Hurst exponent, an index of the E/I ratio, is computed from resting-state fMRI time series, and microcircuit parameters are simulated using biophysical models. A broad decrease in the Hurst exponent is observed in pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), suggesting more excitable network dynamics. Connectome decoders point to temporolimbic and frontocentral cortices as plausible network epicenters of E/I imbalance. Furthermore, computational simulations reveal that enhancing cortical excitability in TLE reflects atypical increases in recurrent connection strength of local neuronal ensembles. Mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses show stronger E/I ratio elevation in patients with longer disease duration, more frequent electroclinical seizures as well as interictal epileptic spikes, and worse cognitive functioning. Hurst exponent-informed classifiers discriminate patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (72.4% [57.5%–82.5%]). Replicated in an independent dataset, this work provides in vivo evidence of a macroscale shift in E/I balance in TLE patients and points to progressive functional imbalances that relate to cognitive decline.},

Administration of Stichodactyla toxin (ShK), a Kv1.3 blocker, significantly inhibited cartilage degeneration and synovial inflammation in animal models of OA in vivo by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization and reducing the production of inflammatory factors. In this study, a transgenically engineered human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UCMSC) delivery system is developed that secreted a peptide ShK, a Kv1.3 potassium blocker, into the knee articular cavity. Collectively, the results identified Kv1.3 as a potential therapeutic target for OA and demonstrated the efficacy of using ShK transgenic engineered UCMSCs as a delivery for the peptide in OA treatment.},

Identifying counter receptors for Siglecs can provide valuable targets for cancer immunotherapy, but it presents significant challenges. Here, the identification of DSG2 (Desmoglein 2) as a dominant counter receptor of Siglec-9 in melanoma cells is reported, using a workflow that combines the strength of proximity labeling and the advantage of CRISPR knockout screening. It is further demonstrated that the interaction between DSG2 and Siglec-9 is mainly dependent on sialic acid-bearing N -glycans on DSG2. Importantly, blocking trans interaction between DSG2 and Siglec-9 significantly enhances macrophage phagocytosis of melanoma cells and, to a lesser extent, other cancer cells. The work thus suggests sialylated DSG2 as a potential “don&#39;t eat me” signal molecule with therapeutic potentials in cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Potassium-sulfur (K-S) batteries are severely limited by the sluggish reaction kinetics of the cyclooctasulfur (cyclo-S 8 ) electrode with low conductivity, which urgently requires a novel cathode to facilitate activity to improve sulfur utilization. In this study, using the wet chemistry method, the molecular clip of Li + is created to replace cyclo-S 8 molecular with the highly active chain-like S 6 2− molecular. The molecular clip strategy effectively lowers the reaction barrier in potassium-sulfur systems, and the stretching of S─S bonds weakens the binding between sulfur atoms, facilitating the transformation of potassium polysulfides (KPSs). The as-prepared cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 894.8 mAh g −1 at a current rate of 0.5 C. It maintains a long cycle life of 1000 cycles with a stable coulombic efficiency in the potassium–sulfur cells without cathode catalysts.
