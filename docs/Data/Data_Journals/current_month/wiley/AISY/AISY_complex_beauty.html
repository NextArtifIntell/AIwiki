  abstract     = {Sweat rate measures key physiological states such as hydration levels and heat tolerance. Incorporating wearable technology with sweat rate sensors allows individuals to conveniently monitor their health, optimize workouts, and enhance occupational safety. However, challenges persist in such integration techniques, including intricate manufacturing, nonlinear responses to changes in sweat rates, and errors from the intermediate measurement of the distance sweat travels in the sensor. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive wearable platform that includes a fully printed, flexible sensor patch, readout electronics, and a mobile app for continuous, real-time monitoring of sweat rate. We fabricate a sensor patch with an area of 700 mm 2 and a weight of 380 mg by utilizing direct 3D printing and scalable microfluidic fabrication. The microfluidic channels are 850 μm wide and 164 μm thick, with serpentine electrodes measuring sweat rate using capacitance. The custom readout electronics capture these changes in capacitance to accurately measure sweat rate, achieving a sensitivity of 0.01 μL min −1 . The sensor&#39;s performance is validated against analytical models, simulations, and on-body trials with commercial sensors. This cost-effective, flexible, and fully integrated sweat-sensing solution has significant potential in precision health.},

In this work, we develop a wristband that integrates an array of 10 skin-conformal strain sensors based on laser-induced graphene, which is optimized for continuous measurement of skin strain. The device is characterized to identify several hand gestures and tasks while simultaneously using an optical camera-based hand-tracking system to estimate the joint locations for ground truth generation. Machine learning models are developed to predict gestures as well as specific hand joint angles with high accuracy of &gt;90% and &gt;95%, respectively. The findings show that the sensors placed closer to actuation-specific anatomical features contribute more toward the high accuracy. The sensor array is also integrated with a wearable readout system that wirelessly transmits the data in real time in order to control a robotic arm as a proof of concept for human–robot interaction applications. The developed skin-conformal device is expected to find wide applications in rehabilitation, sports sciences, and human–computer interaction, paving the way for low-profile prosthetic and orthotic control systems.},

Here, the learning capabilities of analog conductance state of memristor device for the perceptron of unstructured complex dataset in multilayer neural network are analyzed in terms of the number of analog state, nonlinearity, and conductance error. It is found that the requirable number of analog state is analyzed in about ≈50 states and conductance deviation of each analog state is until ≈5% of original value with nonlinearity of ≈0.142 according to constant programming pulse scheme. With the memristor characteristics enough to mimic synaptic weight to be learnt and infer the Fashion-mnist dataset, the classification accuracy is satisfied as ≈84.36% with the loss of ≈16.8% to original level. Owing to this investigation, applicability of novel memristor device could be conveniently examined for the utilization as synaptic weight in multilayer neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Controlling soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is complex due to their ubiquitous deformation, prompting the use of reduced model-based controllers to provide sufficient state information for high dynamic response control performance. However, most modeling techniques face computational efficiency and complexity of parameter identification issues. To alleviate this, a paradigm coupling an analytical modeling approach based on pseudo-rigid body modeling and the logarithmic decrement method (PRBM + LDM) for parameter estimation is proposed. Using a soft robot hand test bed, the PRBM + LDM model for a closed-loop position controller is applied and is compared with a simple proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) static shape control of soft continuum robots using deep visual inverse kinematic models. Furthermore, the PRBM + LDM model-based force controller is compared with simple constant pressure grasping control by pinching tasks on low-weight, small objects—a screwdriver, a potato chip, and a brass coin. The PRBM + LDM-based position controller outperforms the simple PID position controller, and the PRBM + LDM-based force controller achieves a higher success rate than the constant pressure grasping control in the pinching tasks. In conclusion, the PRBM + LDM modeling technique proves to be a convenient and efficient way to model the dynamic behavior of soft actuators closely and can be applied to build high-precision position and force controllers.},

The neural networks are trained using 18 000 data points generated from numerical simulations with input powers ranging from sub-kW- to kW-class. The accuracy of the developed machine learning model is demonstrated using untrained 700 W- and 1 kW-class Hall effect ion sources, producing results with deviations of less than 10% compared to the experimentally measured thrust and discharge current, thus surpassing the accuracy of conventional scaling laws. As a high-fidelity surrogate for numerical simulations, the proposed prediction tool provides high prediction accuracy and calculation speed, offering an excellent complement to conventional scaling laws and enhancing the understanding of Hall effect ion source performance characteristics.},

SuperResNET computational modules include correction for multiple blinking of single fluorophores, denoising, segmentation (clustering), feature extraction used for cluster group identification, modularity analysis, blob retrieval, and visualization in 2D and 3D. Here, a graphical user interface version of SuperResNET was applied to publicly available direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) data of nucleoporin Nup96 and Nup107 labeled nuclear pores that present a highly organized octagon structure of eight corners. SuperResNET effectively segments nuclear pores and Nup96 corners based on differential proximity threshold analysis from 2D and 3D SMLM datasets. SuperResNET quantitatively analyzes features from segmented nuclear pores, including complete structures with eightfold symmetry, and from segmented corners. SuperResNET modularity analysis of segmented corners from 2D SMLM distinguishes two modules at 10.7 ± 0.1 nm distance, corresponding to two individual Nup96 molecules. SuperResNET is therefore a model-free tool that can reconstruct network architecture and molecular distribution of subcellular structures without the bias of a specified prior model, attaining molecular resolution from dSTORM data. SuperResNET provides flexibility to report on structural diversity in situ within the cell, providing opportunities for biological discovery.},

The deformation of smart materials directly affects the behavior of the actuator, which needs to be accurately controlled. However, existing control methods for light-driven LCE actuators often rely on empirical data or simplistic feedback systems, which can be imprecise and susceptible to interference. Developing an accurate and anti-interference control method for photoresponsive LCE actuators remains a significant challenge. Herein, a computer vision-assisted light-driven LCE for accurate control of bending actions of the LCE actuator is proposed. The control system effectively mitigates instability in the bending angle caused by environmental factors such as light, wind, and changes in the surrounding medium. Furthermore, a “lift bridge” for ants moving between two platforms and an oscillator with modulable angular interval and frequency are demonstrated. The proposed system provides a general strategy for accurate and anti-interference control for photoresponsive LCE actuators, which can be extended to complex actions, multifunctions, and multistimuli actuators, showing wide application potential in soft actuators and soft robots.},

  abstract     = {Reliable characterization of image data is fundamental for imaging applications, FAIR data management, and an objective evaluation of image acquisition, processing, and analysis steps in an image-based investigation of biological samples. Image quality assessment (IQA) often relies on human visual perception, which is not objective, or reference ground truth images, which are not often available. This study presents a method for a comprehensive IQA of microscopic images, which solves these issues by employing a set of reference-free metrics that estimate the presence of experimental artifacts. The metrics are jointly validated on a semisynthetic dataset and are tested on experimental images. Finally, the metrics are employed in a machine learning model, demonstrating their effectiveness for automatic artifact classification through multimarker IQA. This work provides a reliable reference-free method for IQA in optical microscopy, which can be integrated into the experimental workflow and tuned to address specific artifact detection tasks.},

  abstract     = {Targeted neuroimaging plays a vital role in evaluating pathologies and guiding interventions in deep brain regions, such as biopsy, laser ablation, and deep brain stimulation. However, current neuroimaging techniques face several challenges when it comes to imaging the deep brain. These challenges include limited imaging depth, a narrow field of view, low resolution, and a lack of real-time imaging and stereotactic deployment capabilities. To address these challenges, a patient-mounted neuro optical coherence tomography (neuroOCT) system that combines a lightweight 5 degrees-of-freedom skull-mounted robot (Skullbot) with a neuroendoscope measuring ≈0.6 mm in diameter is introduced. This innovative system enables targeted and minimally invasive neuroimaging with an axial resolution of ≈2.4 μm and a transverse resolution of around 4.5 μm. The Skullbot can be securely attached to the head and precisely deploys the neuroendoscope with an accuracy of ±1.5 mm in the transverse direction and ±0.25 mm in the longitudinal direction. This allows for motion-insensitive stereotactic imaging within the brain. By utilizing the neuroOCT system, targeted imaging of a tumor in a brain phantom is successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, the system&#39;s capability for in vivo micro-resolution volumetric neuroimaging of fine structures within a mouse brain is validated.},

  abstract     = {Achieving safe robotic manipulation at the microscopic scale usually requires sophisticated equipment, imposing accessibility difficulty in practice. Inspired by tiny bubbles in nature, a new paradigm is proposed for achieving multifunctional manipulation and sensing using microbubbles for biological application in aqueous environments at low cost. Without demanding the expensive cost of fabrication devices, bubbles with various sizes are easy to generate in situ, which is enabled by bubble-endowed interface interactions. It is demonstrated that bubbles acting as micro end-effectors rapidly and adaptively realize dexterous manipulation of microobjects such as biological organisms and droplets. They can function as microgrippers to grasp microobjects based on interface interaction-induced adhesion and act as soft micromanipulators to safely manipulate fragile objects. Moreover, the bubble micro end-effector can sense and perceive the designated objects for contact measurement of microforces or surface textures at a microscopic scale via the shape changes of their ultrasoft structures. The reported method successfully integrates grasping, manipulation, and measurement functions in liquid using a single microbubble of less than 1 mm 3 volume. These nondestructive functionalities showcase promising prospects for bubble-based micro end-effectors in biological manipulation and sensing applications.},

However, most of the existing methods are single-modal movement recognition, which has inherent limitations, such as limited feature representation and instability to noise, which will affect its practical performance. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel fusion approach that can integrate two biological signals, including electromyography (EMG) and bioelectrical impedance (BI). The fusion method combines EMG for capturing dynamic movement features and BI for discerning key postures representing discrete points within dynamic movements. In this method, the identification of key postures and their temporal sequences provide a guiding framework for the selection and weighted correction of probability prediction matrices in EMG-based dynamic recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the method, six dynamic upper limb movements and nine key postures are defined, and a Universal Robot that can follow movements is employed for experimental validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of the dynamic movement reaches 96.2%, representing an improvement of nearly 10% compared with single-modal signal. This study illustrates the potential of multimodal fusion of EMG and BI in movement recognition, with broad prospects for application in HMI fields.},

Their functionalities span from cell sorting to microscale fiber assembly through periodic acoustic pressure fields. Conventional methods usually require parallel acoustic emitters and reflective surfaces, producing constrained standing wave patterns. In this paper, an effective approach for creating versatile acoustic standing wave fields using an acoustic metasurface deflector and retroreflector is introduced. The deflector manipulates the direction of incoming acoustic waves coupled with the retroreflector to reflect these waves back to the source. The proposed design allows the creation of standing waves that are not constrained by the relative angles of the two surfaces involved and allows for customizable wave patterns beyond the standard limits with enhanced adaptability. The system&#39;s effectiveness is evaluated through computational simulations using finite element analysis and experimental validation based on a 3D-printed prototype. Results suggest that versatile standing waves between arbitrarily oriented surfaces can be produced through the careful design of the metasurface deflector and retroreflector. This approach can improve the performance of standing wave applications in particle manipulation, thus broadening the range of practical implementations for ultrasound and acoustofluidic technologies.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore alternative approaches that are fast, mild, and highly tunable. Herein, a novel fabrication strategy for contactless assembly of soft-robots is introduced for the first time. This technology exploits hydrodynamic instabilities at the free surface of a fluid layer, thus enabling the fabrication of centimeter-scale robots featuring diverse structural properties. These features show a wide range of deformation modes in response to magnetic fields, including folding, bending, and expanding. Furthermore, the design and assembly of novel actuators with customized shapes as fish- and butterfly-like structures is shown. The fabricated patterns exhibit different modes of motion under the influence of uniform magnetic fields. As a proof of concept, an innovative application of this technology combined with the proposed soft robots is represented by the enhanced release of extracellular vesicles.  Altogether, this novel fabrication method along with the newly developed magnetic soft robots enables the manufacturing of high-performance, multifunctional, and cytocompatible intelligent systems.},

To be able to reach a maximum travel distance in one turn of work with a full battery charge, the vehicle should follow the reference route with minimum tracking errors. One of the reasons which prevents a good path tracking is the slippage because slippage causes tracking errors in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Herein, a modeling structure for a mecanum-wheeled autonomous electric vehicle used for the heavy duties in iron–steel industry is proposed by taking the slippage information into account. The objective is to reach more travel distance and reduce the energy loss of the battery which causes to carry load less than planned. The modeling structure proposed is adapted and tested for an autonomous path tracking task in a galvanization line of an iron–steel industry. Five tons of zinc ingots are carried from the storage area to the melting pot using an autonomous electric vehicle in a predefined reference route. More than 5 km autonomous drive is performed and the experiments show that slippage causes an energy loss of 6.1786%, which means battery allows 6.1786% less distance than planned travel.},

  abstract     = {Bioinspired soft and hybrid robots provide a promising solution to developing robots that can interact and collaborate with humans safely and effectively. Bellow-like pneumatic artificial muscles can produce biological muscle-like contraction with comparable response time and force output, but closed-loop control has been a challenge without an effective length sensing solution. Herein, a self-sensing artificial muscle (SSAM), which can sense its own length regardless of the external loadings and driving pressures, is proposed. Empowered by a seamlessly integrated mutual-inductance-based length sensor (MILS), the SSAM can sense its length change as small as 0.01 mm (0.012% of the initial liength 80 mm) in a wide range. The working principle of the MILS is analyzed theoretically to provide a design guideline. An SSAM-based earthworm-like locomotion robot is developed with the capability of knowing its real-time body length change at different gaits. An artificial arm driven by one SSAM is also developed and demonstrated with humanlike capabilities of loading perception, interactive and responsive movements, and accurate positioning. This work provides a promising solution to develop muscle-driven hybrid robotic systems with embodied intelligence for skilled manipulation and sophisticated human–machine interactions.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in extended reality (XR) showcase their potential ability to enhance the user experience of traditional displays such as liquid crystal displays and organic light-emitting diode screens. To achieve this goal, the upcoming generation of head-mounted displays (HMDs) necessitates a seamless transition between different XR modes, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) modes. Herein, an innovative cholesteric liquid crystal- (CLC-) based optical combiner for HMDs is introduced. This approach enables the display device to switch between AR, VR, and transparent modes via temperature modulation. Since CLC materials demonstrate varying optical properties at different temperatures, a real-time temperature monitoring system that is paired with an external controller is integrated. This allows for dynamic temperature adjustments of the optical combiner and enables smooth transitions between display modes. Furthermore, the Berreman 4 × 4 matrix method is used to simulate the optical properties of the optical combiner, finding strong agreement with the experimental results. The performance of the tunable optical combiners using 450, 532, and 635 nm laser sources is explored. The findings demonstrate that CLC-based optical combiners can effectively switch between the three distinct modes at corresponding temperatures, paving the way for versatile applications in future HMDs.},

  abstract     = {Grasp generation methods based on force-closure analysis can calculate the optimal grasps for objects through their appearances. However, the limited visual perception ability makes robots difficult to directly detect the complete appearance of objects. Building predefined models is also a costly procedure. These reasons constrain the application of force-closure analysis in the real world. To solve it, this article proposes an interactive robotic grasping method based on promptable segment anything model and force-closure analysis. A human operator can mark a prompt on any object using a laser pointer. Then, the robot extracts the edge of the marked object and calculates the optimal grasp through the edge. To validate feasibility and generalizability, the grasping generation method is tested on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets and a novel benchmark test set of 36 diverse objects is constructed to conduct real-world experiments. Furthermore, the contributions of each step are demonstrated through ablation experiments and the proposed method is tested in the occlusion scenarios.

The classification is based on structural and conformational characteristics (mono-, bi-, or multimaterial assemblies, their orientation, chemical structures, and geometrical configurations). Additionally, this review presents an alternative formulation and extension of the pioneering Timoshenko&#39;s model, which provides an understanding of the underlying mechanical principle of bilayer bending actuation. Finally, upscaled applications of this actuation principle are described, focusing mainly on biomimetic architecture. Attention is given to previously reported real-life applications based on bio-based materials and material systems. Furthermore, this review discusses the multiple challenges for synthetic materials when an upscaling perspective is intended. In this sense, key aspects such as time responsiveness and mechanical amplification, in terms of speed, displacement, and load-bearing capability, are discussed.},

Herein, the strength of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is investigated to achieve effective distinction of ovarian cancer (OC) from other blood cell populations based on label-free morphological biomarkers rather than conventional fluorescent imaging or other molecular parameters. At this purpose, QPI is implemented in high-throughput flow cytometry mode and combined with machine learning (ML), reliable and accurate OC cell phenotyping is achieved by developing ad-hoc multi-level ML classification architectures driven by a priori clinical information. It is shown that the latter allows increasing the overall classification accuracy when compared to noninformed ML classification systems. Thanks to its simplicity, the proposed intelligent system is compatible with various clinical applications, particularly in the context of CTC-based liquid biopsy during patient follow-up, when cancer subtype and other clinical information are already known.},
