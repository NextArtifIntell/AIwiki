  abstract     = {A surge in technological advancements and innovations has spurred the rise of on-demand meal delivery platforms. Despite their widespread appeal, these platforms face two critical challenges (i.e., order batching and demand allocation) in effectively managing the delivery process while maintaining reliability. In response, this study aims to address these two challenges by examining the effects of real-time demands and restaurant density on delivery reliability, as well as how the type of driver (i.e., in-house versus crowdsourced drivers) moderates these effects. We evaluated our model with a unique dataset obtained from one of the top three on-demand meal delivery platforms in China, and our research sheds light on several key findings. Specifically, our study finds inverted U-shaped relationships between real-time demands and delivery reliability and a positive relationship between restaurant density and delivery reliability. In addition, it reveals that crowdsourced drivers perform better than in-house drivers under high real-time demands. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying how delivery reliability can be influenced by real-time demands and restaurant density. The results offer important implications for on-demand meal delivery platforms to improve delivery performance and allocate demands amid complicated market conditions.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of on-demand meal delivery platforms has heightened competition, making customer retention a critical priority. While prior research on order dispatch algorithms has largely focused on minimizing delivery time or delay, the direct impact of delivery performance on repeat purchases remains underexplored. Using transactional data from an online meal delivery platform in China, we empirically investigate the asymmetric effects of early and late deliveries on customer repurchasing behavior. To address potential endogeneity, we introduce driver experience and local knowledge, two previously overlooked factors in platform algorithms, as novel instrumental variables. The survival analysis shows that late deliveries significantly reduce future orders, while early deliveries provide only limited benefits. Guided by these empirical insights, we develop a simulation-based evaluation of different order dispatch algorithms, revealing that maximizing future orders, rather than minimizing delivery time or delays, yields the highest future orders. These insights offer actionable recommendations for platform managers, stressing the importance of strategic adjustments in dispatch algorithms and integrating heterogeneous treatment effects into algorithmic design. By merging operational delivery performance with consumer behavior insights through causal inference and optimization, this study provides a novel end-to-end framework for creating data-driven dispatch algorithms that enhance both service efficiency and customer retention.},

  abstract     = {We analyze channel integration between a last-mile delivery platform and a general merchandise retailer in two distinct stages: (1) platform delivery access (PDA), where the retailer continues to offer standard delivery through its own website but directs customers to the platform&#39;s website for new same-day delivery; and (2) integrated delivery access (IDA), where customers can continue to use same-day delivery service at the delivery platform website but can purchase products in a single order with both same-day and standard delivery options at the retailer&#39;s website. We perform a quasi-experiment using consumer spending data from retailer, target, and delivery platform, Shipt. We find that PDA provides positive impacts to the delivery platform through increased sales. IDA, on the other hand, increases the retailer&#39;s online channel sales but does not impact the delivery platform&#39;s sales. Moreover, we find that the positive effects of PDA on the delivery platform&#39;s sales are stronger in markets where online grocery penetration is lower, indicating that the effects were likely driven by increased purchases for groceries. Finally, the positive effect of IDA on the retailer&#39;s online channel sales is stronger in markets where the retailer has a greater loyal customer base and online grocery penetration is lower.},

  abstract     = {In the highly competitive e-commerce industry, customer-facing warehouses are crucial as the “order penetration points” for e-commerce last-mile operations. This research examines how warehouses use last-minute coordination, an unstructured mechanism, to ensure sufficient inventory at the order penetration points. Previous research has focused on structured mechanisms like contracts and inventory management systems to enhance warehouse performance. However, these mechanisms can be ineffective when faced with unforeseen local contingencies. To adjust inventory and adapt to changes in supply and/or demand, warehouses need to engage in unstructured, last-minute coordination with other warehouses. Using coordination and loose coupling theories, we find that coordinating with many warehouses (i.e., large coordination scope) reduces the operational efficiency of individual warehouses. At the network level, we find that a centralized coordination structure improves the operational efficiency of the entire network. We also show that demand uncertainty reinforces the existing last-minute coordination patterns, using the Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (ST-ERGM). This research highlights the importance of last-minute coordination and reveals its effects on both individual warehouses and the overall network.},
