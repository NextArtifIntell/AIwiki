  abstract     = {Accurately extracting blood vessel structures from retinal fundus images is critical for the early diagnosis and treatment of various ocular and systemic diseases. However, retinal vessel segmentation continues to face significant challenges. Firstly, capturing the boundary information of small vessels is particularly difficult. Secondly, uneven vessel thickness and irregular distribution further complicate the multi-scale feature modelling. Lastly, low-contrast images lead to increased background noise, further affecting the segmentation accuracy. To tackle these challenges, this article presents a multi-scale segmentation network that combines edge features and attention mechanisms, referred to as EANet. It demonstrates significant advantages over existing methods. Specifically, EANet consists of three key modules: the edge feature enhancement module, the multi-scale information interaction encoding module, and the multi-class attention mechanism decoding module. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method. Specifically, EANet outperforms existing advanced methods in the precise segmentation of small and multi-scale vessels and in effectively filtering background noise to maintain segmentation continuity.},

  abstract     = {The real-time and rapid recording of sport sensor data related to tennis ball trajectories facilitates the analysis of this information and the development of intelligent training regimes. However, there are three essential challenges in the task of tennis ball recognition using sport vision sensors: the small size of the ball, its high speed, and the complex match scenarios. As a result, this paper considers a lightweight object detection model named improved RTMDet-light to deal with these challenges. Specifically, it has compatible capacities in the backbone and neck, constructed by a basic building block that consists of large-kernel depth-wise convolutions. Furthermore, GhosNet and ShuffleNet are used to replace the CSPLayers which reduce the parameters of our model. The lightweight model proposed addresses the inherent challenges of detecting small objects and muti scenarios in the match. After training, the proposed model performed better on four scenarios with different shades of tennis ball match, with results visualized through heatmaps and performance metrics tabulated for detailed analysis. The recall, FLOPs and number of parameters of the improved RTMDet-light are 71.4%, 12.543G, and 4.874M, respectively. The results demonstrate robustness and effectiveness of our model in accurate tennis ball detecting across various scales. In conclusion, our model for real-time detection in tennis ball detection offers a lightweight and faster solution for sport sensors.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal, motion and channel information are pivotal in video-based behaviour recognition. Traditional 2D CNNs demonstrate low computational complexity but fail to capture temporal dynamics effectively. Conversely, 3D CNNs excel in recognising temporal patterns but at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose a generic and effective SME module composed of three parallel sub-modules, namely Spatio-Temporal Excitation (STE), Motion Excitation (ME) and Efficient Channel Excitation (ECE). Specifically, the STE module enhances the spatiotemporal representation using a single-channel 3D convolution, enabling the model to focus on both temporal and spatial features. The ME module emphasises motion-sensitive channels by calculating feature map differences at adjacent time steps, guiding the model toward motion-centric regions. The ECE module efficiently captures cross-channel interactions without dimensionality reduction, ensuring robust performance while significantly reducing model complexity. Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, the proposed method achieved Top-1 accuracy of 49.0% on the Something-Something V1 (Sth-Sth V1) dataset and 40.8% on the Diving48 dataset. Extensive ablation studies and comparative experiments further demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an optimal balance between recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Current feature matching methods typically employ a two-stage process, consisting of coarse and fine matching. However, the transition from the coarse to the fine stage often lacks an effective intermediate state, leading to abrupt changes in the matching process. This can hinder smooth transitions and precise localization. To address these limitations, this study introduces Coarse-Mid-Fine Match Net (CMFNet), a novel three-stage image feature matching method. CMFNet incorporates an intermediate-grained matching phase between the coarse and fine stages to facilitate a more gradual and seamless transition. In the proposed method, the intermediate-grained matching refines the correspondences obtained from the coarse-grained stage using Adaptive-random sample consensus (RANSAC). Subsequently, the midtransformer, which integrates sparse self-attention (SSA) mechanisms with local-feature-based cross-attention, is employed for feature extraction. This approach enhances the feature extraction capabilities and improves the adaptability to various types of image data, thereby boosting overall matching performance. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism based on local region features is introduced. The network undergoes fully self-supervised training, aiming to minimize a match loss that is autonomously generated from the training data using a multi-scale cross-entropy method. A series of thorough experiments was carried out on diverse real-world datasets, including both unaltered and extensively processed images.The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 0.776 mAUC on the HPatches dataset and 0.442 mAUC on the ISC-HE dataset.},

To resolve this problem, we propose a person retrieval framework that integrates YOLOv8s and person Re-ID. Improved YOLOv8s is employed to extract person categories from the video on a frame-by-frame basis, and when combined with the stage-wise clustering person Re-ID network (SCPN), it enables collaborative person retrieval across multiple cameras. Notably, a feature precision (FP) module is added in the YOLOv8s network to form FP-YOLOv8s, and SCPN incorporates innovative enhancements including the stage-wise learning rate scheduler, centralized clustering loss and adaptive representation joint attention module into the person Re-ID baseline model. Comprehensive experiments on COCO, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms several other leading methods. Given the scarcity of image-video person Re-ID datasets, we also provide an extended image-video person (EIVP) dataset, which contains 102 videos and 814 bounding boxes of 57 identities captured by 8 cameras. The video reasoning detection score of this framework reaches 78.8% on this dataset, indicating a 3.2% increase compared to conventional models.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for applications ranging from urban planning to environmental monitoring. However, traditional approaches struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including complex boundary delineation and intricate spatial relationships. To address these limitations, we introduce the semantic uncertainty-aware segmentation (SUAS) method, an innovative plug-and-play solution designed specifically for remote sensing image analysis. SUAS builds upon the rotated multi-scale interaction network (RMSIN) architecture and introduces the prompt refinement and uncertainty adjustment module (PRUAM). This novel component transforms original textual prompts into semantic uncertainty-aware descriptions, particularly focusing on the ambiguous boundaries prevalent in remote sensing imagery. By incorporating semantic uncertainty, SUAS directly tackles the inherent complexities in boundary delineation, enabling more refined segmentations. Experimental results demonstrate SUAS&#39;s effectiveness, showing improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics. SUAS achieves consistent enhancements in mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and precision at various thresholds, with notable performance in handling objects with irregular and complex boundaries—a persistent challenge in aerial imagery analysis. The results indicate that SUAS&#39;s plug-and-play design, which leverages semantic uncertainty to guide the segmentation task, contributes to improved boundary delineation accuracy in remote sensing image analysis.},

This paper proposes a novel tri-plane dynamic neural radiation field (Tri-NeRF) that employs an implicit radiation field to study the impacts of audio on facial movements. Specifically, Tri-NeRF propose tri-plane offset network (TPO-Net) to offset spatial positions in three 2D planes guided by audio. This allows for sufficient learning of audio features from image features in a low dimensional state to generate more accurate lip movements. In order to better preserve facial texture details, we innovatively propose a new gated attention fusion module (GAF) to dynamically fuse features based on strong and weak correlation of cross-modal features.

In high-traffic environments, traditional face recognition methods can cause crowd congestion, emphasizing the need for unconscious face recognition, which requires no active cooperation from individuals. Due to the nature of unconscious face recognition, it is necessary to capture high-quality face images. In this paper, the FSA-Net head pose estimation network is enhanced to FSA-Shared_Nadam by replacing the Adam optimizer with Nadam and improving stage fusion. In the first stage, FSA-Shared_Nadam estimates head pose angles, MediaPipe detects facial landmarks to calculate eye distance and aspect ratios, and sharpness is calculated using the Laplacian operator. Images are considered valid if they meet the criteria. A model trains a face quality scoring formula, learning how different head pose angles affect face recognition accuracy. In the second stage, face images are clustered, and the formula is applied to select the highest-scoring face within each cluster. The approach was tested across multiple datasets, and a simulated security checkpoint scenario was created for practical testing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FSA-Shared_Nadam head pose estimation algorithm and the proposed face quality assessment approach.},

However, in retinal fundus imaging, the reduction in image quality, characterized by poor local contrast and non-uniform brightness, is inevitable. Image enhancement becomes an essential and practical strategy to address these issues. In this paper, we propose a retinal fundus image enhancement method that emphasizes details and equalizes brightness, based on image decomposition. First, the original image is decomposed into three layers using an edge-preserving filter: a base layer, a detail layer, and a noise layer. Second, an adaptive local power-law approach is applied to the base layer for brightness equalization, while detail enhancement is achieved for the detail layer through saliency analysis and blue channel removal. Finally, the base and detail layers are combined, excluding the noise layer, to synthesize the final image. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with both classical and recent approaches using two widely adopted datasets. According to the experimental results, both subjective and objective assessments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances retinal fundus images by highlighting details, equalizing brightness, and suppressing noise and artifacts, all without causing color distortion.},

Second, the attenuation coefficient of the current image was estimated based on the background light using a light attenuation model. Finally, the images were restored using an underwater imaging model. The proposed algorithm is superior to state-of-the-art underwater image processing algorithms regarding subjective and objective qualities.},

  abstract     = {Image deblurring is a fundamental preprocessing technique aimed at recovering clear and detailed images from blurry inputs. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures, especially in the presence of non-uniform blur. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring. MFENet introduces a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depth-wise separable convolutions to capture rich multi-scale spatial and channel information. Furthermore, the proposed method employs a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that utilizes wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Notably, in downstream object detection tasks, our blind image deblurring algorithm significantly improves detection accuracy, further validating its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.},

In this study, we propose further improvements for endoscopic scenes based on existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods. The previous method introduce an appearance flow to address brightness inconsistencies caused by lighting changes and uses a unified self-supervised framework to estimate both depth and camera motion simultaneously. However, to further enhance the model&#39;s supervisory signals, we introduce a new feature-based perceptual loss. This module utilizes a pre-trained encoder to extract features from both the synthesized and target frames and calculates their cosine dissimilarity as an additional source of supervision. In this way, we aim to improve the model&#39;s robustness in handling complex lighting and surface reflection conditions in endoscopic scenes. We compare the performance of using two pre-trained CNN-based models and four foundational models as encoder. Experimental results show that our improve method further enhances the accuracy of depth estimation in medical imaging. Additionally, it demonstrates that features extracted by CNN-based models, which are sensitive to local details, outperform foundation models. This suggests that encoders for extracting medical image features may not require extensive pre-training, and relatively simple traditional convolutional neural networks can suffice.},

However, existing shadow detection methods tend to misidentify complex shadows and their similar patterns, such as soft shadow regions and shadow-like regions, since they treat all cases equally, leading to an incomplete structure of the detected shadow regions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a structure-aware transformer network (STNet) for robust shadow detection. Specifically, we first develop a transformer-based shadow detection network to learn significant contextual information interactions. To this end, a context-aware enhancement (CaE) block is also introduced into the backbone to expand the receptive field, thus enhancing semantic interaction. Then, we design an edge-guided multi-task learning framework to produce intermediate and main predictions with a rich structure. By fusing these two complementary predictions, we can obtain an edge-preserving refined shadow map. Finally, we introduce an auxiliary semantic-aware learning to overcome the interference from complex scenes, which facilitates the model to perceive shadow and non-shadow regions using a semantic affinity loss. By doing these, we can predict high-quality shadow maps in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the balance error rate (BER) by 4.53%, 2.54%, and 3.49% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the benchmark datasets SBU, ISTD, and UCF, respectively.},

For text localization, we explore maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) for detecting components that work by clustering pixels with similar properties. The output of component detection includes several non-text components due to the degradations of social media images. To select the best components among many, we explore the genetic algorithm by convolving different kernels with components, which results in a feature matrix that is further fed to EfficientNet for choosing actual text components. Therefore, the proposed model is called genetic algorithm based network for text localization in degraded social media images (TLDSMI). For evaluating text localization, we consider the images of the standard dataset of natural scenes by uploading and downloading from different social media platforms, namely, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram. The effectiveness of our method is shown by testing on original and degraded standard datasets. For example, for the degraded images of different complexities including degradations caused by social media platforms, the proposed method performs well in almost all situations. In addition, the proposed model achieves the best F1-Score, 0.76, 0.77, 0.70, and 0.78 for the degraded images of CUTE, ICDAR 2013, Total-Text, and CTW1500, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the majority of palmprint recognition studies have focused on feature extraction while neglecting security issues. Among the various attack types, spoofing attack poses a significant threat due to high success rates and minimal technical requirements. In this study, we explore the differences between real and fake palmprint images. Based on these differences, we propose the concept of ‘high-frequency spoofing regions’ to capture key discriminative spoofing clues. Specifically, the high-frequency spoofing regions adaptation ( HFSRA ) model is proposed to address palmprint anti-spoofing. The HFSRA consists of two key modules: the texture analysis module (TAM) and the spoofing attention module (SAM). In particular, the TAM divides the input feature map into several patches and evaluates the texture distribution within each patch. Next, the SAM dynamically constructs an attention map by mapping the texture distribution to an attention weight matrix. This adaptive structure forces the model to focus on high-frequency spoofing regions, which improves the model&#39;s ability to extract meaningful spoofing clues effectively. Furthermore, we establish three experimental protocols for evaluating the performance of palmprint anti-spoofing models. These protocols provide a standardized evaluation framework for future studies. Extensive experiments conducted under these protocols demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of HFSRA.},

This method enhances the reconstruction of high-frequency details.

To address the problems, we propose a novel YOLO framework called SF-YOLO for small object detection. Firstly, we present a spatial information perception (SIP) module to extract contextual features for different objects through the integration of space to depth operation and large selective kernel module, which dynamically adjusts receptive field of the backbone and obtains the enhanced features for richer understanding of differentiation between objects and background. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-scale feature weighted fusion strategy, which performs weighted fusion on feature maps by combining fast normalized fusion method and CARAFE operation, accurately assessing the importance of each feature and enhancing the representation of small objects.

To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight collaborative attention-enhanced accelerated unfolding network ( ), which integrates a DUN framework with a streamlined prior extractor. Our integrated approach introduces a generically accelerated half-quadratic splitting algorithm (A-HQS) for degradation estimation, overcoming the limitations of first-order optimization and enabling effective long-range dependency modeling. Within the prior extractor, we introduce cross-convergence attention, facilitating iterative information exchange between local and non-local Transformers to capture holistic features and enhance inductive capacity. Notably, the concept of collaborative cross-convergence is embedded throughout all submodules, ensuring effective information flow. The proposed not only accelerates the convergence of spectral reconstruction, but also fully exploits compressed spatial-spectral information.

  abstract     = {The severe radial distortion of ultra-wide field of view (FOV) fisheye camera results in poor model fitting and challenges in calibration board detection. In this paper, a novel calibration method for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras is proposed based on improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction. Initially, a method to extend the maximum fitting FOV of the camera model to over 180 degrees is proposed. Subsequently, a calibration board detection approach is proposed using SE(3) image pre-correction. Specifically, image pre-correction is incorporated into the camera calibration process, utilizing SE(3) to define the pre-correction plane. Calibration boards are detected within the pre-corrected images, enhancing the reliability, accuracy and speed of board detection in distorted images, consequently increasing the control point&#39;s maximum FOV. Lastly, the improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction are integrated into a feedback-based camera calibration system for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras. Operating with real-time or offline video streams as input, this system autonomously selects calibration key frames, optimizes camera parameters and calibration board poses in real-time. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to a 62% increase in the achievable maximum FOV.},

Accurately positioning the centre of OVL targets is fundamental for effective metrology. However, the identification and localization of target centres become challenging due to complex shapes and unexpected features, such as rounded corners, that can arise during manufacturing. An algorithm is proposed to tackle this challenge by employing customizable shape fitting. This method begins with the extraction of sub-pixel edge points, followed by applying a Hough transform to group and smooth these points, thereby enhancing contour quality. By parameterizing the target shape based on specific points, the algorithm integrates sub-pixel traversal techniques with an optimization objective, achieving sub-pixel accuracy in centre positioning. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm can achieve a positioning accuracy of ±0.03 pixels and demonstrates robustness against noise and blur. Finally, the proposed algorithm was used to test the OVL target pair arrays fabricated by electron beam etching, confirming an accuracy of ±0.04 pixels (±6.9 nm). These results validate the algorithm&#39;s capability to meet high precision requirements for OVL target centre positioning in wafer applications.},

  abstract     = {In high-precision image segmentation tasks, even slight deviations in the segmentation results can bring about significant consequences, especially in certain application areas such as medical imaging and remote sensing image classification. The precision of segmentation has become the main factor limiting its development. Researchers typically refine image segmentation algorithms to enhance accuracy, but it is challenging for any improvement strategy to be effectively applied to images of different objects and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a two-step refinement method for image segmentation, comprising region expansion and minor contour adjustments. First, we design an adaptive gradient thresholding module to provide gradient-based constraints for the refinement process. Next, the region expansion module iteratively refines each segmented region based on colour differences and gradient thresholds. Finally, the minor contour adjustments module leverages local strong gradient features to refine the contour positions further. This method integrates region-level and pixel-level information to refine various image segmentation results. This method was applied to the BSDS500, Cells, and WHU Building datasets. The results demonstrate that the refined closed contours align more closely with the ground truth, with the most notable improvement observed at contour inflection points (corner points). Among the results, the Cells dataset showed the most significant improvement in segmentation accuracy, with the F-score increasing from 87.51% to 89.73% and IoU from 86.83% to 88.40%.},

Color fundus photograph (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are commonly used as two non-invasive modalities for ophthalmic examination. However, the diagnosis of each modality is not entirely accurate. Compounding the challenge is the difficulty in acquiring multi-modal data, with existing datasets frequently lacking paired multi-modal data. To solve these problems, we propose multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm and cross-modal generation algorithm. The multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm first calculates the mean and variance separately for each modality, and then generates multi-modal diagnostic results in a distribution fusion manner. In order to generate the absent modality (mainly OCT data), three sub-networks are designed in the cross-modal generation algorithm: cross-modal alignment network, conditional deformable autoencoder and latent consistency diffusion model (LCDM). Finally, we propose multi-task collaboration strategy where diagnosis and generation tasks are mutually reinforcing to achieve optimal performance.

  abstract     = {Local binary patterns (LBP) play a vital role in image classification as a computationally efficient feature descriptor. A crucial reason for its limitation of discriminability is the lack of neighbourhood information description from a global perspective. Previous research has attempted to improve its performance by introducing global thresholds, but such threshold selection is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel tomography-aided local binary patterns (TLBP), inspired by the tomographic process of sample separation. TLBP considers constructing visual feature representations under multi-level non-local information to compensate for the lack of LBP possessing only a single shallow feature. In addition to the basic LBP features from local visual context, TLBP captures refined neighbourhood greyscale information through multi-quantile thresholds from a global visual perspective, thereby greatly enhancing discriminability. Experimental results in texture classification, face recognition, and hyperspectral pixel-wise classification demonstrate that the proposed TLBP descriptor outperforms the competitors, achieving 94.39% (KTH-TIPS), 81.22% (KTH-TIPS-ROT), 93.81% (Indian Pines), 99.85% (Salinas), and 99.50% (ORL) accuracy.

Due to complex backgrounds, large differences in target scales, and missed detection of small targets, remote sensing image target detection is challenging. In order to enhance the model&#39;s understanding of the global information of remote sensing images, this paper proposes the GFA module. This module can establish the global contextual connection of remote sensing images to provide rich context to help understand the complex scene and background in which the target is located, without being limited to local information. Additionally, it focuses on channel information for enhanced target feature extraction. For the purpose of alleviating the serious imbalance in foreground–background samples that is present in single-level target detection models. The loss function is reconstructed based on focal loss by redefining the balance factor α and focus factor γ , so that it can be dynamically adjusted during network training. Meanwhile, EIoU is used to further enhance the bounding box regression capability. Affine transformations were also used to augment the dataset in order to assist the model in adjusting to real-world situations. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the publicly available HRRSD dataset. In comparison with YOLO v5, the mAP of the detection results improved by 2.7%. Compared with YOLO v8 and YOLO v10, the mAP improved by 3.2% and 3.3%. The model achieves an FPS of 40.1, an optimal balance between speed and accuracy.

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely studied and applied in many fields. Although image super-resolution technology has been successfully applied to SAR imaging in recent years, there is less research on large-scale factor SAR image super-resolution methods. A more effective method is to obtain comprehensive information to guide the reconstruction of SAR images. In fact, the co-registered characteristics of high-resolution optical images have been successfully applied to improve the quality of SAR images. Inspired by this, an optical-guided multi-kernel attention based SAR image super-resolution reconstruction network (OMA-SSR) is proposed. The proposed multi-modal mutual attention (MMA) module in this network can effectively establish the dependency between SAR image features and optical image features. This network also designs a deep feature extraction module for SAR images, which includes a channel-splitted multi-kernel attention (CSMA) module and residual connections. CSMA module splits SAR image channels, extracts features in different ranges through multi-kernel convolution, and finally fuses the extracted features between different channels. Experimental results on the Sen1-2 and QXS datasets show that the proposed OMA-SSR performs well in evaluation indicators and visual effects of SAR image super-resolution reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {Recently, unsupervised image-to-image (i2i) translation methods based on contrastive learning have achieved state-of-the-art results. However, in previous works, the negatives are sampled from the input image itself, which inspires us to design a data augmentation method to improve the quality of the selected negatives. Moreover, the previous methods only preserve the content consistency via patch-wise contrastive learning, which ignores the domain consistency between the generated images and the real images of the target domain. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised i2i translation framework based on multi-cropping contrastive learning and domain consistency, called MCDUT. Specifically, the multi-cropping views are obtained with the aim of further generating high-quality negative examples. To constrain the embeddings in the deep feature space, a new domain consistency loss is formulated, which encourages the generated images to be close to the real images. In many i2i translation tasks, this method achieves state-of-the-art results, and the advantages of this method have been proven through extensive comparison experiments and ablation research.

Current image steganalysis networks still have some problems such as inappropriate feature selection and easy overfitting. Therefore, this paper proposed a new spatial image steganalysis method based on convolutional neural networks. To extract richer features while reducing useless parameters in the network, this paper introduced the Im SRM filtering kernel into the image preprocessing module. To extract effective steganography noise from images, this paper combined depthwise separable convolution and residual networks for the first time and introduces them into the steganography noise extraction module. In addition, to focus network attention on the image regions where steganography information exists, this paper integrated the coordinate attention mechanism. This module will make the network pay attention to the overall structure and local details of the image during network training, improving the network&#39;s recognition ability for steganography information. Finally, the extracted steganography features are classified through a classification module. This paper conducted a series of experiments on the BOSSBase 1.01 and BOWS2 datasets. The improvement in detection accuracy is between 1.2% and 18.2% compared to classic and recent steganalysis networks.},

Various models and algorithms have been explored by researchers to address different types of image distortions, including sparse representation, grouped sparse representation, and low-rank self-representation. The grouped sparse representation algorithm leverages the prior knowledge of non-local self-similarity and imposes sparsity constraints to maintain texture information within images. To further exploit the intrinsic properties of images, this study proposes a novel low-rank representation-guided grouped sparse representation image restoration algorithm. This algorithm integrates self-representation models and trace optimization techniques to effectively preserve the original image structure, thereby enhancing image restoration performance while retaining the original texture and structural information.

Most existing face frontalization methods rely on heavy architectures that struggle with small datasets and produce low-quality images. Additionally, although video frames provide richer information, these methods typically use single images due to the lack of suitable multi-image datasets. To address these issues, a parameter-efficient framework for high-quality face frontalization in both single and multi-frame scenarios is proposed. First, a high-quality, diverse dataset is created for single and multi-image face frontalization tasks. Second, a novel single-image face frontalization method is introduced by combining GAN inversion with transfer learning. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 91% compared to existing GAN inversion methods while achieving far more photorealistic results than GAN-based methods. Finally, this method is extended to sequences of images, using attention mechanisms to merge information from multiple frames. This multi-frame approach reduces artefacts like eye blinks and improves reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that this single-image method outperforms pSp, a state-of-the-art GAN inversion method, with a 0.15 LPIPS improvement and a 0.10 increase in ID similarity. This multi-frame approach further improves identity preservation to 0.87, showcasing its effectiveness for high-quality frontal-view reconstructions.},

The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) background modeling method is a popular and powerful motion background modeling technology owing to its ability to balance robustness and real-time constraints in various practical environments. However, when the background is complex and the target moves slowly, the traditional GMM cannot accurately detect the target and is prone to misjudging the moving background as a moving target. To address the interference from complex backgrounds, this study proposes a target detection method that combines an adaptive GMM with an improved three-frame difference method, along with an algorithm that combines grayscale statistics with an improved Phong illumination model for illumination compensation and shadow removal. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved method has better robustness, improves target detection accuracy, and reduces noise and background interference.},

The authors introduce the Controlled Diet (CD) dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,885 plume images captured using an FLIR GF77 OGI camera under varying dietary conditions. The performance of six semantic segmentation models (FCN, U-Net, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, DeepLabv3+, and Gasformer) on the CD dataset is compared. Results showed that LMD data for followed a similar pattern to the gas chromatography (GC) instrument results. The in vitro results showed that different diets and F:C ratios had an impact on gas production and rumen fermentation characteristics. Adding bromoform to the control diet fully inhibited emission. The HF diet produced more compared to all treatments ( ) when measured with GC and LMD. CBR produced the lowest values when measured with GC and LMD. The Gasformer architecture achieved the highest performance with mean IoU of 85.1% and mean F-score of 91.72%.

To address the issue of dominant features being suppressed during feature fusion in FER, this study proposes a self-learning weight network based on label distribution training (SLW-LDT). First, based on the ShuffleNet-V2 backbone model, SLW-LDT introduced a local feature extraction branch that highlights specific expression-related features by cropping the facial image into four local regions. Subsequently, the SLW algorithm is devised to allocate learnable weights to global and local features from different branches before their fusion. Moreover, considering the challenge associated with accessing emotional distribution in facial images directly, a label distribution training module (LDT) is introduced during the training phase to generate label distributions for effective training purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracies of 89.77% and 64.21% on two in-the-wild datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet-7), and 98.90% on the lab-controlled CK+ dataset.

Despite extensive research on morphing detection, limited attention has been given to restoring accomplice face images, which is critical for forensic applications. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel face de-morphing (FD) method based on identity feature transfer for restoring accomplice face images. The method encodes facial attribute and identity features separately and employs cross-attention mechanisms to extract identity features from morphed faces relative to reference images. This process isolates and enhances the accomplice&#39;s identity features. Additionally, inverse linear interpolation is applied to transfer identity features to attribute features, further refining the restoration process. The enhanced identity features are then integrated with the StyleGAN generator to reconstruct high-quality accomplice facial images. Experimental evaluations on two morphed face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, improving the average restoration accuracy by at least 5% compared with other methods.

  abstract     = {Currently, the detection and identification of surface defects in polyimide foam products mainly rely on on-site work experience, which has issues such as low detection accuracy, strong subjectivity, and low efficiency. Existing research on foam product defect detection primarily targets internal defects, lacking studies on the detection, identification, and classification of surface defects. Therefore, this article proposes a method for identifying and classifying surface defects in polyimide foam based on an improved GoogLeNet, aiming to quickly and accurately detect and identify surface defects in foam products. By optimizing the Inception blocks, introducing the ECA attention mechanism, and adding an LSTM network module, the model&#39;s recognition accuracy and generalization ability are effectively improved. In experiments, the model proposed in this article performed excellently on the foam surface defect dataset, showing a significant advantage in detection accuracy compared to other convolutional neural network models. The detection accuracy for pits and cracks reached 98.24% and 98.25%, respectively, providing a reliable reference for the detection of surface defects in industrial foam production.},

  abstract     = {Conventional optical flow estimation methods typically recover two-dimensional motion from RGB image sequences. Recently, due to the rise and widespread use of spike cameras, learning optical flow from spiking cameras has become a hot topic in the field of two-dimensional motion estimation. Although existing methods have been designed to learn optical flow by designing feature processing methods for spike streams, there is still insufficient consideration for flow field post-processing, resulting in limited accuracy of optical flow estimation. To address this problem, an optical flow estimation method based on directional disassembly is proposed. Specifically, the estimated flow fields along the horizontal and vertical directions are disassembled and the motion vectors along the two directions are denoised separately to reduce the burden of post-processing for complex two-dimensional motion information. In addition, contextual information is introduced in the post-processing so that the scene information can effectively contribute to the results of the flow post-processing. Experimental results show that this proposed method is capable of achieving comparable performance on spike-based public datasets.},

For the enormous volume of road surveillance images generated daily, traditional manual screening is highly time-intensive and resource-draining. Therefore, this article proposes an improved detection model YOLOv7-SFWC for illegally manned trucks. First of all, the pictures of illegal manned vehicles obtained by relevant departments are expanded and labeled, and the dataset of illegal manned vehicles is created. Building upon the foundational YOLOv7 model, this study replaces the traditional convolution module with the FasterNet convolution module and SCConv module, and introduces the Wise-IoU (WIoU) loss function algorithm and Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism. The results show that the mAP value of the YOLOv7-SFWC model is improved by 4.15% and FPS by 7.6 compared with the original YOLOv7 model, and the computational complexity is reduced to adapt to the deployment. Moreover, the model&#39;s effectiveness is validated through extensive comparison experiments. Finally, the visual results show the accurate performance of the model and verify the progress of YOLOv7-SFWC. This advancement has the potential to transform traffic violation enforcement by reducing reliance on manual screening, effectively combating traffic violations, and purifying traffic order.},

In response, a small target detection algorithm that fuses multi-scale complementary features, named MCFNet is proposed. Firstly, in order to independently extract the unimodal features of visible light and infrared images and effectively enhance the complementary information between images, a dual-stream backbone network with a terminal fusion mechanism is proposed. Secondly, the complementary feature information residual module is utilized to optimize the integration process of residual features. Subsequently, by designing a multi-scale feature enhancement module the network&#39;s capability to capture multi-scale features is enhanced. Finally, for targets of varying sizes, a lightweight Transformer feature extraction module is proposed to improve the detection accuracy of small targets from a drone&#39;s perspective. Test results on the drone-vehicle dataset show that this method achieved an average detection accuracy of 67.92%, while the detection accuracy on the self-constructed UAV-data dataset reached 96.4%.

  abstract     = {As one of the world&#39;s most popular beverages, tea plays a significant role in improving tea production efficiency and quality through the identification of tea shoots during the tea manufacturing process. However, due to the complex morphology, small size, and susceptibility to factors like lighting and obstruction, traditional identification methods suffer from low accuracy and efficiency. In this study, image enhancement techniques such as HSV transformation, horizontal flipping, and vertical flipping were applied to the training dataset to improve model robustness and enhance generalization across varying lighting and angles. To address these challenges in the context of tea buds detection, deep-learning-based object detection methods have emerged as promising solutions. Nevertheless, current object detection technologies still face limitations when detecting tea buds under these conditions. To enhance identification performance, this article proposed an improved YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once version 5 small model) algorithm. In the improved YOLOv5s algorithm, CBAM, SE, and CA attention mechanisms were incorporated into the backbone network to augment feature extraction, and a weighted Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed in the neck network to boost performance, resulting in the YOLOv5s_teabuds model. Experimental results indicated that the improved model significantly outperformed the original in terms of precision, recall, mAP and F1-score, with the CA attention mechanism providing the most notable improvement—enhancing precision, recall, mAP and F1-score by 18.119%, 9.633%, 16.496% and 13.524%, respectively. After integrating BiFPN, the YOLOv5s_teabuds model further strengthened performance and robustness, with precision, recall, mAP and F1-score increased by 19.346%, 11.388%, 18.620%, and 15.059%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Images can be corrupted during capture or transmission due to clouds, overlaps, and other interferences, deviating from their original state. Image inpainting techniques restore such images, but different types—Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), RGB, and infrared—require varying field-of-view sizes. SAR and infrared images, with less information, need a larger field of view, leading to uncorrelated interference in distant areas. RGB images, richer in information, are constrained by a limited local field of view, hindering access to full semantic details. To address these challenges, an aggregated convolution progressive network is proposed. This model employs a coarse-grained inpainting module for initial restoration, enhanced by an aggregated convolution module to capture contextual information. Local and global details are then used to refine the output, improving restoration quality. Additionally, existing datasets predominantly focus on RGB images, lacking diversity. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive dataset covering SAR, RGB, and infrared images under cloud, overlap, and corruption conditions is constructed. This method achieves superior performance, with MAE of 0.05, SSIM of 0.95, and PSNR of 36.68 within a 20–30% mask size range, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across diverse image types and size ranges.

CTGP combines co-training and the Mean-Teacher strategy, where predictions generated by teacher models are filtered and utilized as high-quality pseudo-labels to train the other student models, thus facilitating co-training. Additionally, a medical image-specific augmentation method, MIAugment, is introduced to better adapt to the unique characteristics of medical data. Experiments on a real-life clinical dataset demonstrate that CTGP achieves high segmentation accuracy with minimal labelled data. Using only 10% of labelled data, the framework achieves a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.03% for four tissue types, a decrease of just 2.85% compared to fully supervised learning. This approach provides a promising solution for automated muscle and adipose tissue segmentation with limited annotations.},

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial target detection tasks, two main challenges exist: the limited computational resources of UAV terminals, which are not conducive to running complex models, and the prevalence of small targets, which can easily lead to missed detections and false positives. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight and high-accuracy small-object detection algorithm for UAV aerial imagery that is based on YOLOv5s. First, the network structure is optimized by removing the layers in YOLOv5s primarily used for detecting large targets (P4 and P5) and adding layers primarily used for detecting small targets (P2 and P3). This enables the model to focus more on extracting small-object features. A lightweight dynamic convolution is subsequently introduced in the C3 module, and the lightweight LW_C3 and LW_downsampling modules are designed for feature extraction and downsampling operations. This enhances the model&#39;s feature extraction capability while achieving a lightweight design. Finally, the adaptive multi-scale spatial feature fusion (AMSFF) module is designed to adaptively learn the spatial weights of the feature maps at different levels, thereby further strengthening the effective fusion of multi-scale features. Experimental results show that the improved YOLO-Tiny model has higher accuracy and lower complexity, hence validating its excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image super-resolution by addressing issues such as transition smoothing, insufficient high-frequency information, and training instability encountered in regression-based and GAN-based models. However, challenges persist when applying diffusion models to image super-resolution, including randomness, inadequate conditional information, high computational costs, and network architecture complexities. In this article, the authors introduce a diffusion model based on Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE), and propose the use of ENAFBlocks instead of traditional ResBlocks to enhance model performance in noise prediction. The Mean-Reverting SDE effectively mitigates the randomness of the diffusion model by leveraging low-resolution images as means. Additionally, an LR Encoder is introduced to capture hidden information from LR images, providing a more robust condition for stable result generation by the noise predictor. To efficiently handle high-resolution images within limited GPU memory, the method employs adaptive aggregate sampling, which merges overlapping regions smoothly using weighted averaging. Furthermore, color variations are addressed during diffusion model sampling through color correction. Extensive experiments on CelebA, DIV2K, and Urban100 demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models like IDM, with a PSNR improvement of 0.22 dB, FID reduction of 2.35, and LPIPS reduction of 0.05 on the DIV2K dataset, along with a reduced parameter count and faster inference time.},

  abstract     = {The primary challenge of the multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) task is the modal fusion, and the lack of modalities may exist in the fusion process, which leads to poor prediction results. Most of the previous research on multimodal fusion is single-stage fusion, disregarding how various modality subsets interact, as well as rarely considering relative position relationship of modality sequences, causing the fragmentation of context info. Considering the aforementioned issues, this study introduces an MSA method based on the multi-stage graph fusion network (MSGFN) under random missing modality conditions to improve the robustness of the model to MSA under the random missing modality conditions. Firstly, for each modality, its inter-modal and intra-modal multi-head attention are used to learn robust representation of the modality sequence. Meanwhile, the relative position encoding (RPE) is introduced into mechanism of attention that enables model to perceive and learn the relative position before and after the modality sequence when calculating attention, thereby better understanding the contextual info of the sequence. After that, the transformer encoder receives the learned modality features and uses the pre-trained model to supervise the reconstruction of the missing modality information. Finally, the feature representations of different modalities have effectively fused using multi-stage graph fusion network, and the output is used for the ultimate sentiment classification. Wide experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP, and the findings indicate that the proposed method can better handle the challenges caused by modality fusion and modality missing compared with several baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {The multi-class single-model detection paradigm is a prevalent design for industrial anomaly detection, exhibiting suitability for varying industrial classes and dynamic, flexible production scenarios. This approach not only enhances model adaptability but also minimizes maintenance costs. However, the current popular methods are susceptible to the ‘copying shortcut’ phenomenon, which constrains their performance on benchmark datasets. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a multi-class anomaly detection model: UniRD, based on the reverse distillation method. This model creates an image corruptor that expands the dataset and generates ‘normal-corrupt’ image pairs. During the training process, their correspondence is used to optimize the reverse distillation. This process greatly exploits and releases the potential of the student decoder. Furthermore, a teacher feature adaptation module is devised to enhance the compatibility between the pre-trained model and the anomaly detection task. This has the effect of reducing the discrepancy between teacher and student features while ensuring the consistency of normal sample features. The comprehensive evaluation results in two mainstream datasets, MVTec and VisA, and demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits improvement in all indicators compared to benchmark methods. The proposed method attains the state-of-the-art, substantiating its effectiveness and advancement.},

However, many existing algorithms neglect the registration of non-rigid point cloud. Recent studies have focused on scene flow, which can achieve non-rigid point cloud registration by estimating the scene flow of two point clouds. The presence of occlusion in a scene is primarily attributed to variations in viewpoint and access time, thereby posing a significant challenge in accurately predicting scene flow. In the endeavour to mitigate this issue, the focus is on the propagation of scene flow originating from non-occluded points towards occlusion points while concurrently estimating the occlusion map. The proposed network, a non-rigid point cloud registration method based on scene flow estimation, achieves exceptional performance for the EPE3D metric on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI scene flow datasets, and it demonstrates strong generalization on the railroad dataset.},

Firstly, a dataset for salt-and-pepper noise image classification is constructed, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for judging noise image (CNN-J) is trained. Image classified as normal by CNN-J is not processed, while the classified noisy image is denoised. In the denoising process, a marking image and a rough denoised image are generated by CNN for noise mask (CNN-M) and CNN for denoising (CNN-D), respectively. Subsequently, the refined denoised image is output using the proposed refining mechanism. The middle layers of CNN-M and CNN-D are constructed by depth-separable CNN to reduce the network complexity. Experimental results show that the misjudging rate of CNN-M marking is reduced by 19.94% compared with the best existing marking method. Compared with the traditional methods, the peak signal to noise ratio of the proposed method is increased by 2.95% and the information loss is reduced by 21.46%. In addition, the computational complexity is at least 11.18% lower than that of the traditional CNN. Finally, the display of salt-and-pepper denoised images on the flexible AMOLED is realized.},

To address these two issues, the YOLOv7-PSAFP network structure was first proposed. Based on YOLOV7, the progressive Spatial Adaptive Feature Pyramid (PSAFP) was introduced. Second, a combination of the Varifocal Loss and Loss Rank Mining loss functions was used for calculating the object loss, which reduces the interference of useless negative examples during training.

For these reasons, Remote-Sensing Single-Image Super-Resolution (RS-SISR) techniques have gained significant interest. In this paper, Swin2-MoSE model is proposed, an enhanced version of Swin2SR. The model introduces MoE-SM, an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to replace the Feed-Forward inside all Transformer block. MoE-SM is designed with Smart-Merger, and new layer for merging the output of individual experts, and with a new way to split the work between experts, defining a new per-example strategy instead of the commonly used per-token one. Furthermore, it is analyzed how positional encodings interact with each other, demonstrating that per-channel bias and per-head bias can positively cooperate. Finally, the authors propose to use a combination of Normalized-Cross-Correlation (NCC) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) losses, to avoid typical MSE loss limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that Swin2-MoSE outperforms any Swin derived models by up to 0.377–0.958 dB (PSNR) on task of , and resolution-upscaling ( and OLI2MSI datasets). It also outperforms SOTA models by a good margin, proving to be competitive and with excellent potential, especially for complex tasks.

Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and computationally efficient objective-mathematical model based on statistical perceptual features. The structural and textural features are computed using the modified regularized heaviside local binary pattern (RH-LBP) approach and the concept of entropy. The higher-order probability coefficients of images are considered to extract features that are highly correlated to the human visual system features. Further, the additivity property of Renyi entropy is used to show the randomness of the information combining two terms: One extracts the images spatial intensity changes, and therefore their texture qualities, and the other attain structural details. The features in the proposed approach are jointly optimized to achieve better robustness, monotonicity and match human assessments on image quality, while minimizing the computational complexity and run time. Experiments are conducted with three synthetically distorted datasets, KonIQ-10K, BIQ2021, and LIVE (wild), and two intentionally distorted datasets, TID2013 and CSIQ and are used to evaluate performance index.

An 18-layer ResNet model was trained using ground truth leaf width values for regression in leaf width estimation. Experiments used a dataset of 4960 images representing 8 rice diseases. The leaf width prediction model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 11.18% and was used to generate a tiled dataset for training advanced rice disease detection models.

To address the challenges of pothole detection in complex road environments, this paper proposes a model focusing on shape features (pothole detection you only look once, PD-YOLO). The model aims to overcome the limitations of multi-scale feature learning caused by the use of fixed convolutional kernels in the baseline model, by constructing a feature extraction module that better adapts to variations in the shape of potholes. Subsequently, a cross-stage partial network was designed using a one-time aggregation method, simplifying the model while enabling the network to fuse information between feature maps at different stages. Additionally, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism is introduced to select relevant features, reducing redundancy and suppressing background noise. Experiments conducted on the VOC2007 and GRDDC2020_Pothole datasets reveal that compared to the baseline model YOLOv8, PD-YOLO achieves improvements of 3.9% and 2.8% in mean average precision, with a frame rate of approximately 290 frames per second, effectively meeting the accuracy and real-time requirements for pothole detection.

First, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) with geometric transformations is designed, which uses rotated labels as supervision to obtain lower-level characteristics that more accurately capture various orientations and then makes use of a spectral-spatial characteristic extraction network to maximize the utilization of HSI&#39;s spectrum and spatial information. Next, a class anchor open-set classification module based on a twin clustering network is designed, which uses SCL and FSL to extract more specific personal information by mining the category-invariant characteristics present in the known versus unknown class data. Finally, multiple convolution and open-set recognition (OSC) is performed on the feature blocks. Experimental results on three classical HSI datasets show that FSSCL-OSC provides a significant improvement over existing methods, under a sample size of only 10%, the overall accuracy reached 82.38%, 90.76% and 84.70%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Compared with common urban landscape semantic segmentation, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image semantic segmentation is more challenging because small targets have very low pixel percentages and multi-scale features due to the influence of flight altitude. Yet, the commonly used successive grid downsampling strategy in the current transformer-based methods omits some important features of small targets. Furthermore, due to the complex background interference, it can lead to even worse results. In reaction to this, existing strategies aim to maintain superior resolution. Nevertheless, the application of this method incurs considerable computational costs, which brings challenges for the practical applications of UAVs. So it is significant to design a novel framework to balance retaining more pixels representing small objects during downsampling and reducing computational costs. For this, the Channel Selection and the Local Attention Transformer Model (CSLFormer) are proposed. During the overlap patch embedding process of feature maps, the model allocates half of the important channels to global attention and local attention. These two types of attention focus on different aspects: one learns the relationships and importance among various patches, while the other emphasizes the features of individual patches. The method shows superior performance on two public datasets: AeroScapes and Vaihingen, achieving mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 75.57% and 78.93%, respectively.

To overcome these limitations, a novel real-time intelligent retrievable object-tracking system is designed. The system incorporates a retrievable object-tracking algorithm that combines DeepSORT and sliding window techniques to enhance tracking capabilities. Additionally, the YOLOv7-small-scale model is proposed for small-object detection, integrating a specialized detection layer and the convolutional batch normalization LeakyReLU spatial-depth convolution module to enhance feature capture for small objects. TensorRT and INT8 quantization are used for inference acceleration on edge devices, doubling the frames per second. Experiments on a Jetson Nano (4 GB) using YOLOv7-small-scale show an 8.9% improvement in recognition accuracy over YOLOv7-tiny in video stream processing. This advancement significantly boosts the system&#39;s performance in efficiently and accurately locating lost objects in indoor home settings.},

In accordance with the U-shaped network structure, multi-scale feature fusion is employed to obtain comprehensive contextual features. Subsequently, taking into account the differences between base and texture information in the images, the recovered image is reconstructed by fusing feature information through the information decoupling branches. Finally, the information decoupling is supervised by a loss function. In addition, a series of comparative experiments are conducted on a self-constructed multispectral dataset and a publicly available dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher fusion accuracy but also has superior visualization results.},

  abstract     = {Fisheye cameras are widely used in surveillance, automotive systems, virtual reality, and panoramic photography due to their wide-angle perspective. However, images captured by fisheye cameras suffer from significant geometric distortions, affecting image analysis and understanding. This distortion bends straight lines into curves, resulting in a barrel-shaped appearance of the image. To mitigate these effects and transform fisheye images into a regular perspective, fisheye image correction is necessary, enabling more accurate and reliable performance in applications like object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and visual navigation. While convolutional neural networks based fisheye image correction has progressed, it has not fully utilized the global distribution and local symmetry of distortions due to the limitations of fixed receptive fields. This paper introduces a new model based on the Swin Transformer that effectively utilizes both global and local distortion features to adapt automatically to fisheye lens distortions. It also incorporates image restoration functionality to enhance texture details in the corrected images. A novel approach to synthetic dataset generation is proposed to improve the network&#39;s generalization capabilities.},

Most of the current medical segmentation models use the traditional U-shaped network structure, but they suffer from the problem of information loss during the encoding and decoding of images. To advance towards an autonomous model for detailed polyp segmentation, the authors propose a new framework for polyp segmentation called U-shaped cross-fusion network with attention mechanism (UCFA-Net), which employs a pyramid vision transformer as encoder to extract image features at multiple scales. Furthermore, the multi-scale cross-fusion module cross-fuses the different scale features and then goes through the multi-scale convolutional parallel feedforward transformer module for modelling the global and local information. Finally, progressive attentional up-sampling module acts as a decoder for up-sampling with progressive attention to get the final polyp segmentation result. The authors comprehensive testing demonstrates that their network achieves superior average scores across the five datasets and exhibits greater robustness in the face of diverse and demanding scenarios, when compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Gallbladder cancer is a fatal disease, and its early diagnosis can significantly impact patient treatment. Ultrasound imaging is often the initial diagnostic test for gallbladder cancer, making the enhancement of cancer detection accuracy from these images crucial. Despite the promising results of artificial intelligence techniques in disease diagnosis, their black-box nature hinders the reliability of their results and their practical application. Therefore, it is essential not to rely solely on a single model&#39;s output and to further investigate for more reliable outcomes. This study presents a step-by-step structural investigation of forming an end-to-end model, a conjunction of two convolutional neural network based methods, for detecting gallbladder conditions. The final model, leveraging feature fusions and hierarchical classification, achieved a high accuracy of 92.62% for detecting normal, benign, and malignant gallbladders. It also achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.36% for classifying normal and non-normal instances and 92.22% for classifying benign and malignant cases. Finally, comprehensive post-processing investigations, including cross-validation, temperature scaling, and uncertainty estimation, along with error analysis, are conducted to gain more insights into the model&#39;s output. Among these insights, the model demonstrated resilience of its results to active dropout and augmentation at the inference phase. Furthermore, when applied with test-time data augmentation, uncertainty estimation methods have better distinguishability between the uncertainties of correctly and incorrectly classified instances, which provides additional information about the model&#39;s output.

Handcrafted methods have poor segmentation results while deep learning-based methods lack the labeled mitochondrial data. However, although the number of labeled mitochondrial images is limited, the unlabeled fluorescent data is easy to obtain. The authors aim to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to learn mitochondrial morphological features. The approach begins with self-supervised learning from a vast set of unlabeled images through masked image modeling. This technique involves presenting images with randomly masked patches, prompting the model to predict the content of these masked areas. By doing so, the model learns the distinctive features of mitochondria. In the subsequent phase, the trained encoder is transferred to the segmentation task, replacing the original reconstruction decoder with the Segformer segmentation decoder. The model is then fine-tuned using a small labeled dataset. By reconstructing mitochondria in the masked regions, the model learns features more effectively on unlabeled samples, and improves segmentation performance even with limited labeled data. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing an 11.8% improvement in Intersection over Union metrics compared to existing fluorescence mitochondrial segmentation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis of brain tumors significantly enhances treatment success. However, accurate detection and segmentation of tumors, essential for diagnosis, rely heavily on costly manual annotation by experts. To mitigate these costs, weakly supervised methods have gained traction. This paper introduces a novel weakly supervised brain tumor segmentation approach utilizing point and scribble supervision. Experts annotate only the slice with the largest tumor area by marking a single point near the tumor center or drawing a scribble within the tumor region. The method operates in two phases. First, labels are propagated to unlabelled pixels, generating a pseudo-ground-truth with three labels: tumor, non-tumor, and marginal pixels (unlabelled pixels surrounding the initial segmentation). Second, a segmentation model is trained using the pseudo-ground-truth and a loss function combining level-set and binary cross-entropy losses. Marginal pixels contribute to level-set loss computation, refining the segmentation process. The approach is validated on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes from BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show Dice scores comparable to fully supervised methods for whole tumor segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed weakly supervised strategy. This method reduces annotation effort while maintaining competitive segmentation performance, making it valuable for clinical applications.},

Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) aims to improve generalization across unseen domains by leveraging multiple source domains without supervision. Traditional methods focus on extracting domain-invariant features, potentially at the expense of feature space integrity and generalization potential. We presents a Multi-Domain Representation Network (MDRN) for unsupervised multi-domain learning. MDRN innovates by disentangling and preserving both domain-invariant and domain-specific features through an unsupervised cross-domain reconstruction task. It employs content encoders for domain-invariant features and multi-domain style encoders for domain-specific characteristics. By merging these features based on domain similarity, MDRN constructs a comprehensive feature space that enhances image reconstruction across domains. Additionally, MDRN integrates domain-specific classifiers, which learn domain classification and provide weighted fusion of domain-specific features. This design facilitates effective inter-domain distance measurement and feature integration. Experiments on PACS and DomainNet show MDRN&#39;s superior performance over existing state-of-the-art UDG approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in handling distribution shifts between source and target domains.},
