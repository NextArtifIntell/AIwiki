  abstract     = {The deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) panel systems, as renewable energy sources, has seen a rise recently. Consequently, it is imperative to implement efficient methods for the accurate detection and diagnosis of PV system faults to prevent unexpected power disruptions. This paper introduces a potential strategy for fault identification and classification through the utilization of machine learning (ML) techniques. The study aimed to use ML algorithms to identify and classify normal operations, seven different types of faults, in two operational modes (maximum power point tracking and intermediate power point tracking). Four machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods (decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting) were employed, followed by hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to determine the best configuration. The results indicated that ensemble methods, particularly XGBoost, excelled in detecting and classifying faults in PV systems, achieving a 99% accuracy rate after hyperparameter adjustments. The TPR values show a high sensitivity of 0.999, with some achieving a perfect score of 1.000. The FPR shows very low values, with the majority of metrics indicating FPRs at or close to 0%. This performance is crucial in the solar energy context, as failing to detect faults can result in significant energy loss and increased maintenance costs.},

  abstract     = {In spite of the high potential shown by spiking neural networks (e.g., temporal patterns), training them remains an open and complex problem. In practice, while in theory these networks are computationally as powerful as mainstream artificial neural networks, they have not reached the same accuracy levels yet. The major reason for such a situation seems to be represented by the lack of adequate training algorithms for deep spiking neural networks, since spike signals are not differentiable, that is, no direct way to compute a gradient is provided. Recently, a novel training method, based on the (digital) simulation of certain quantum systems, has been suggested. It has already shown interesting advantages, among which is the fact that no gradient is required to be computed. In this work, we apply this approach to the problem of training spiking neural networks, and we show that this recent training method is capable of training deep and complex spiking neural networks on the MNIST data set.},

Manual processing of fundus images for the automated identification of ocular disorders is laborious, error-prone, and time-consuming. This necessitates computer-assisted technologies that can automatically identify different ocular illnesses from fundus images. The interpretation of the photos also plays a massive role in the diagnosis. Automating the diagnosing procedure reduces human mistakes and helps with early cataract detection. The oneDNN library available in the oneAPI Environment provided by Intel has been used to optimize all transfer learning models for better performance. The suggested approach is verified through a range of metrics in experiments using the openly accessible Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition dataset. The MobileNet Model outperformed other transfer learning techniques with an accuracy of 0.9836.},

However, they still have challenges when extracting information from highly specific internal technical documentation. One specific area of real-world technical documentation is telecommunications engineering, which could benefit from domain-specific LLMs. In this article, we expand the notion of Technical Language Processing (TLP) to the telecommunications domain by introducing and analyzing the format of technical specifications from a leading telecommunications equipment vendor. Additionally, we highlight the importance of use case definitions by introducing requirement property mapping for maximizing information extraction. Also, we recommend actions to mitigate the effect of the internal specifications format on information extraction, which can lead to LLM-friendly internal specifications. Finally, a PoC is built to showcase the improvements of our proposed framework.},

Inspired by the hierarchical structures of natural materials like spider silk, a strategy is developed to enhance both toughness and environmental tolerance in conductive hydrogels. By leveraging multiscale dynamics including pores, crystallization, and intermolecular interactions, a dense hierarchical structure is created that significantly improves toughness, reaching ≈90 MJ m⁻ 3 . This hydrogel withstands temperatures from −150 to 70 °C, pressure of 12 psi, and one-month storage under ambient conditions, while maintaining a lightweight profile of 0.25 g cm⁻ 3 . Additionally, its tunable rheological properties allow for high-resolution printing of desired shapes down to 220 µm, capable of supporting loads exceeding 164 kg m⁻ 2 . This study offers a versatile framework for designing durable materials for various applications.},

  abstract     = {Daytime radiative cooling presents a compelling technology, noted for its efficiency and environmental friendliness. Recent studies have focused on not only the cooling capacity but also the applicability and versatility of this technology. This study introduces a daytime radiative cooler as a sheet with exceptional cooling performance. Its matrix is composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which are emerging organic materials suitable for radiative cooling. Furthermore, aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is employed as a supporting dielectric particle to enhance cooling performance. An Al 2 O 3 -assisted organic composite (AOC) is created through electrospinning and hot-pressing, resulting in a bendable sheet form. The AOC sheet demonstrates a light reflectance of 97.9% across the solar spectral region (0.3–2.5 µm) and an emissivity of 95.2% within the atmospheric transparency window (ATW) of 8–13 µm. The cooling power, derived from optical properties, is calculated to be 120.1 Wm −2 . Experimental findings confirm the AOC sheet&#39;s capability to achieve 4.9 °C below ambient temperature and, when applied to a car model, to reduce the interior temperature by 12.7 °C.},

  abstract     = {Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a promising approach for cancer treatment. Compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT offers increased penetration depth and higher precision. However, the practical application of SDT is constrained by the low water solubility, poor tumor specificity, and metabolic susceptibility of most sonosensitizers. Recent research has explored the use of piezoelectric materials as sonosensitizers in cancer treatment and inhibition of bacterial growth. Upon ultrasound excitation, the separation of electron–hole (e − –h + ) pairs occurs within the piezoelectric material. By improving the crystal structure of the material or incorporating other nanoparticles to prevent rapid recombination of e − –h + pairs, the piezoelectric material accumulates charges in the conduction band and valence band, achieving the redox potential of O 2 /·O 2 − . This enables the piezoelectric material to serve as a sonosensitizer, leading to the concept termed Sono-Piezo Dynamic Therapy (SPDT). This review aims to define the concept of SPDT, provide a systematic overview of the historical development of piezoelectric materials in the application of SDT, and elucidate the potential mechanisms by which piezoelectric materials act as sonosensitizers. Importantly, various piezoelectric materials will be discussed in terms of their feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages as sonosensitizers, offering new perspectives for identifying potential sonosensitizers.},

Antitumor immunity refers to the innate and adaptive immune responses that regulate cancer development and proliferation. Tumor immune evasion represents a major hindrance to effective anticancer treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized and lipid-bilayer-enclosed particles that are secreted to the extracellular space by all cell types. They are critically involved in numerous biological functions including intercellular communication. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) can transport a variety of cargo to modulate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review provides the latest update about how tumor cells evade immune surveillance by exploiting TEVs. First, the biogenesis of EVs and the cargo-sorting machinery are discussed. Second, how tumor cells modulate immune cell differentiation, activation, and function via TEVs to evade immune surveillance is illustrated. Last but not least, the novel antitumor strategies that can reverse immune escape are summarized.},

The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, coordinating metabolism and immune responses to adapt to stress triggered by exogenous exposure. However, the impact of activating CAR on aging remains unknown. In this study, Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ), drug-induced premature aging mice, and senescence accelerated P8 (SAMP8) mice are used as models to explore the effects of CAR activation on lifespan and healthspan, along with the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that hCAR agonist CITCO and mCAR agonist TCPOBOP prolonged the lifespan and healthspan in model organism. The longevity effects of CITCO and TCPOBOP were attenuated in CAR homozygous nhr-8/daf-12 mutant C. elegans as well as CAR −/− mice. In C. elegans , CITCO activated both anti-stress and detoxification genes, and increased the resistance to environmental adversities. Additionally, the lifespan-extending and xenobiotic resistant effects of CITCO might be related to the regulation of age-related pathways. Furthermore, CITCO improved age-related neurodegeneration in C. elegans models. Taken together, the results suggest that the longevity effects of CAR agonists may be related to the enhancement of xenobiotic resistance of animals.},

Muscle cell apoptosis is considered one of the main causes of muscle atrophy, while several recent studies argued that muscle cells do not die during muscle atrophy. Here, sensor zebrafish are generated to visualize muscle cell apoptosis and the engulfment of dead muscle cells by macrophages. Using these sensor zebrafish, starvation, and natural aging-induced muscle atrophy models are established. The data showed that the diameters of muscle cells decreased in both models; however, muscle cell apoptosis is not found in the process of muscle atrophy. In starvation-induced muscle atrophy, it also showed that the number of nuclei in muscle cells remained constant, and there is no increase in the number of macrophages in muscle tissues, both of which further confirmed that muscle cells do not die. In both models, transcriptional analysis showed that the apoptosis pathway is down-regulated, and autophagy and protein degradation pathways are up-regulated. All these data indicated that although there is a great reduction of muscle mass during starvation or aging-induced muscle atrophy, muscle cells do not die by apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into muscle atrophy and can benefit the treatments for muscle atrophy-related diseases.},

However, its application is often limited by damage caused by electrode movement, as flexible sensors are typically attached to joints, which can be greatly alleviated by placing the two electrodes on the same side. Inspired by the hydrogen bonds in the double-helical structure of DNA, the double-helical electrode design is commonly found and applied in fiber-based batteries and supercapacitors into fibrous flexible sensors through coaxial wet-spinning and further treatment. The double helical sensor exhibits high strength and maintains stable operation and is prepared under over 300% strain with gauge factors (GF) of 0.9, 39.5, and 349, respectively, in its working ranges. This unique single-sided electrode structure also enabled applications such as water flow sensing. The sensor into a smart glove capable of real-time is further integrated, five-channel finger motion detection, and used a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning algorithm to achieve 98.8% accuracy in recognizing six common gestures. This study provides a novel approach to optimize the electrode distribution in fiber-based flexible sensors through an internally encapsulated double-helical structure, making a significant contribution to the field of flexible sensing.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cells cope with oxidative stress for their proliferation and metastasis by equipping antioxidant systems, among which the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) play crucial roles. However, whether PRDXs exhibit nonenzymatic functions remains unclear. Here, it is shown that the 1-cysteine PRDX (PRDX6) upregulates nicotinamide N -methyltransferase (NNMT) to promote the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, independently of PRDX6&#39;s enzymatic activities. Mechanistically, PRDX6 interacts with NNMT to prevent its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite-motif protein 56 (TRIM56), leading to the inhibition of NNMT ubiquitination at lysine 23 and 210 and suppression of subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition, PRDX6-mediated NNMT upregulation activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, PRDX6 overexpression is associated with higher NNMT protein levels in human ovarian cancer tissues and is predictive of poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Overall, the findings illustrate a critical oncogenic mechanism of the antioxidant enzyme PRDX6 in promoting ovarian cancer progression beyond its enzymatic mechanisms.},

For instance, in mammals, the chaperones ANP32A and ANP32B share a common evolutionary line and have some exchangeable functions based on their similar N-terminal domains. Nevertheless, their C-terminal low-complexity-acidic-regions (LCARs) display substantial sequence differences, unveiling some degree of variability between them, in agreement with their different tissue-specific expression patterns. These structural and computational results indicate that a substitution in the vicinity of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), of Pro in ANP32A for Thr in ANP32B, determines the overall compactness of the C-terminal LCAR. The different structural properties of the disordered region affect the binding mode of ANP32 members to their targets. This type of divergent binding mode is exemplified with the extra-mitochondrial cytochrome c (C c ), a well-known ANP32B partner and which now determine also binds to ANP32A; and with the RNA binding protein HuR, whose export to the cytoplasm is mediated by ANP32 proteins under stress. Therefore, differential expression patterns of ANP32A or ANP32B may affect the regulation of C c and HuR and can help to explain the distinct roles of these proteins in diseases.},

Protein arginine methyltransferases 5 (PRMT5) plays a crucial role in regulating homeostasis of various mammalian tissues. However, its function in intestinal homeostasis remains elusive. In this study, conditional knockout of Prmt5 in the mouse intestinal epithelium leads to a reduction in stem cell population, suppression of cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis within the intestinal crypts, accompanied with shortened gut length, decreased mouse body weight, and eventual animal mortality. Additionally, Prmt5 deletion or its enzymatic inhibition in intestinal organoids in vitro also shows resembling cellular phenotypes. Methylome profiling identifies 90 potential Prmt5 substrates, which are involved in RNA-related biological processes and cell division. Consistently, Prmt5 depletion in intestinal organoids leads to aberrant alternative splicing in a subset of genes related to the mitotic cell cycle. Furthermore, Prmt5 loss triggers p53-mediated apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium. Collectively, the findings uncover an indispensable role of PRMT5 in promoting cell proliferation and survival, as well as maintaining stem cells in the gut epithelium.},

Here an efficient sintering method is presented using ultralow power UV by leveraging the photocleavable ligand, o -nitrobenzyl thiol (NT), – functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The controlled removal of NT ligands upon UV irradiation enhances light absorption by reducing the filling factor of voids in the printed layer, increasing the layer temperature, and facilitating further ligand desorption. This positive feedback mechanism accelerates nanoparticle sintering at several orders of magnitude lower energy than IPL, achieving an electrical conductivity of 7.0 × 10 6 S m −1 .

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial transfer emerges as a promising therapy for the restoration of mitochondrial function in damaged cells, mainly due to its limited immunogenicity. However, isolated mitochondria rapidly lose function because they produce little energy outside cells. Therefore, this study investigates whether near infrared (NIR)-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) pre-treatment enhances mitochondrial function and stability in mitochondria-donor cells prior to transplantation. Clinical applications of NADH, an essential electron donor in the oxidative phosphorylation process, are restricted due to the limited cellular uptake of NADH. To address this, a photo-mediated method optimizes direct NADH delivery into cells and increases NADH absorption. L6 cells treated with NADH and irradiated with NIR enhanced NADH uptake, significantly improving mitochondrial energy production and function. Importantly, the improved functional characteristics of the mitochondria are maintained even after isolation from cells. Primed mitochondria, i.e., those enhanced by NIR-mediated NADH uptake (P-MT), are encapsulated in fusogenic liposomes and delivered into muscle cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. Compared to conventional mitochondria, P-MT mitochondria promote greater mitochondrial recovery and muscle regeneration. These findings suggest that NIR-mediated NADH delivery is an effective strategy for improving mitochondrial function, and has the potential to lead to novel treatments for mitochondrial disorders and muscle degeneration.},

  abstract     = {Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials are attractive due to their unique applications in fields such as 3D displays, information encryption, and chiroptical switches. Natural biomolecules-based CPL materials are gaining plenty of attention due to their chiral diversity and sustainability. However, it is still challenging to construct CPL materials with opposite CPL signs from a single natural biomolecule due to its inherent chirality. Here, chiral assemblies with opposite CPL signs using chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) and achiral luminescent dyes are successfully prepared. It is found that COS can serve as a chiral template to induce the ordered assembly of the dyes along the polymer chain through electrostatic attraction interaction. It is demonstrated experimentally that the structural planarity of the dye molecules is crucial for the formation of chiral co-assemblies. Interestingly, the left-handed COS-templated co-assemblies can emit CPL with opposite handedness, which is controlled by the helicity degree of the co-assemblies. This study not only deepens the understanding of the complex assembly of natural biomacromolecules but also provides new insights into the design and construction of CPL materials.},

However, this vascular neogenesis takes place at a microscopic scale that cannot be observed with current clinical imaging techniques. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) allows us to observe micro-vessels of the order of a few microns at depths of several centimeters. This can be done using conventional clinical ultrasound scanners and contrast sequences (CEUS). In this study, ULM is used to observe the human microvasculature in neonatal patients undergoing treatment for life-threatening malformations forming direct connections between the cerebral arterial and venous systems. It is observed that neuroendovascular treatment of neonatal arteriovenous malformations causes remodeling and reorganization of the cerebral vasculature by also activating corticomedullary vascular connections. ULM enables us to follow microvascular changes in human neonates with high spatio-temporal resolution. ULM may provide a novel clinical translatable tool, particularly including cerebral imaging in very young patients.},

The Golgi apparatus (GA) of tumor cells is a key organelle in the formation of a tumor immunosuppressive network. However, there are no studies to show whether interfering with the GA of tumor cells can reshape the immunosuppressive network to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, the tumor cell GA-targeting self-assembled peptide (NF-1) is tailored, and confirmed that NF-1 treatment can achieve an effective immunotherapy and found that tumor cell-derived GA-dependent migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mediates the formation of immunosuppressive network in breast cancer (BRCA) through multi-omics analysis, in vivo, and in vitro experiments. NF-1 treatment-induced MIF reduction can reshape the immunosuppressive network and convert a “cold” tumor into a “hot” tumor, thus enabling immunotherapy in BRCA and enhancing the ICB efficacy in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). This study presents a general strategy for interfering with tumor GA for effective immunotherapy in BRCA, COAD, and other cancers characterized by a “cold” immune microenvironment.},

However, there is a lack of a facile method to realize the controllable growth of large-scale, high-quality, and high-resolution perovskite single crystal arrays on diverse types of substrates, which hinders their application in practical scenarios. Here, a one-step wettability-guided blade coating approach is reported for the rapid in situ crystallization of large-scale, multicolor, and sub-100 nm perovskite single-crystal arrays in the ambient environment. By this strategy, the physical dimensions of perovskite single crystals can be precisely regulated from 90 to 260 nm, with a size variation coefficient &lt; 10% and an area of over 900 mm 2 . All three typicalhalogen perovskites for multi-color luminescence, CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I) and their mixtures (Cl/Br or Br/I systems), are appliable to this fabrication process through the demonstration of complex RGB patterns with remarkable photoluminescence properties. Moreover, various rigid substrates such as silicon oxide (SiO 2 ), silicon (Si), and glass can also be used to construct the wettability-constrast templates where perovskite crystal nucleate and grow. After that, the perovskite single-crystal arrays or complex patterns can be transferred onto flexible substrates, for instance, COC. This method combines convenient solution processing with conventional photolithography to prepare the high-resolution, large-area, and superior-quality perovskite single crystal arrays in a high-throughput manner, showing great potential in the integration of perovskite nano-optoelectronic devices and chips.},

However, the limited cyclability of vanadium-based oxide cathodes, especially at low current densities, impedes their practical application. Here, it is revealed that proton insertion is responsible for the limited lifetime of vanadium oxides. Proton insertion promotes the dissolution of vanadium oxides, deteriorating electrochemical performance. Propylene carbonate (PC) is introduced into Zn(CF 3 SO 3 ) 2 electrolyte to regulate the coordination environment of water, forming PC-coordinated Zn 2+ solvation structure and [H 2 O-CF 3 SO 3 − -PC] complex. The optimized coordination environment of water weakens the adsorption energy between water molecules and vanadium oxides, inhibiting proton insertion. As a result, vanadium-based oxides cathode without proton insertion can maintain the stability of crystal structure and avoid the dissolution of V. Taking CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O as cathode, Zn||CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O battery without proton insertion performs enhanced cycling performance.

However, the weak photostability always leads to inevitable photolysis of GO during the use, storage, and application. Indirect photolysis has a significant impact on the structure of GO via causing fragmentation and degradation, while the pathway can be divided into two stages. In the early stage, photoreduction is the dominant reaction to generate porous reduction GO (PrGO). Then H 2 O 2 breaks PrGO into fragments, and eventually, the fragmented GO is converted into CO 2 by OH radicals. The generation of porous structures in early photoreduction is a crucial premise for the subsequent photodegradation, while GO flakes without porous structure cannot be broken by H 2 O 2 and OH. In this work, a deep insight into the indirect photolysis pathway and the committed step is provided, which may bring some advanced ideas for enhancing GO stability in practical application.},

The SN-doped electrolyte successfully inhibits the lithium dendrite growth and facilitates the SEI layer formation, as determined by the operando nanofocus wide-angle X-ray scattering (nWAXS), meanwhile, stably cycled over 500 h in Li/SN-PEO/Li cell. Apart from the observation of lithium dendrite, the robust SEI layer formation mechanism in the first cycle is investigated in the SN-enhanced composite electrolyte by nWAXS. The inorganic electrochemical reaction products, LiF and Li 3 N, are found to initially deposit on the electrolyte side, progressively extending toward the lithium metal anode. This growth process effectively protected the metallic lithium, inhibited electron transfer, and facilitated Li⁺ transport.

Effective treatment is, however, challenging due to the physical barrier of the cornea, which restricts drug penetration in the eye, as well as the presence of eye injury that necessitates continuous delivery of growth factors on the ocular surface for cornea healing. Here, we introduce a transformative wearable corneal microneedle (MN) patch designed for efficient therapy of ocular injury and infection. The MN patch comprises water-soluble tips that encapsulate antibacterial nanoparticles (NPs), along with a transformative backing layer that contains epidermal growth factor (EGF). Upon insertion into the eye, the MN tips dissolve swiftly within the cornea stroma, resulting in the release of the antimicrobial NPs to efficiently eradicate bacteria. Meanwhile, the residual backing layer undergoes rapid in situ transformation upon contact with mildly acidic fluid from infected corneal edema, converting into a contact lens that conforms to the eye&#39;s surface, which facilitates sustained release of EGF on the ocular surface over 8 h to promote corneal healing. Benefiting from these features, the designed transformative corneal MN patch demonstrates superior efficacy in treating ocular injuries and infections in vivo, offering a promising therapeutic strategy to manage eye diseases.},

Here, multi-color fluorescence microscopy is applied to track the assembly of both liposomes and mRNA simultaneously in clinical mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy. Imaging reveals that the assembly occurs in discrete steps: initially, RNA adsorbs onto the liposomes; then, the RNA-coated liposomes cluster into heterogeneous structures ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The clustering process is consistent with a Smoluchowski model with a Brownian diffusion kernel. The transition between the two steps of assembly is determined by the orientation of RNA-mediated interactions.

  abstract     = {Sound-evoked wakefulness from sleep is crucial in daily life, yet its neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is found that CaMKIIα+ neurons in the temporal association cortex (TeA) of mice are not essential for natural awakening from sleep. However, optogenetic activation of these neurons reliably induces wakefulness from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but not from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In vivo electrophysiological and calcium recordings further demonstrated that TeA neurons are monotonically tuned to sound intensity but not frequency. More importantly, it is found that the activity of CaMKIIα+ neurons in TeA can gate sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, which is further confirmed by optogenetic manipulations. Further investigation reveals that the baseline excitability of TeA CaMKIIα+ neurons and the delta oscillations in the electroencephalogram are particularly important in regulating the evoked activity of TeA neurons. Anatomical and functional screening of downstream targets of TeA reveals that excitatory projections from TeA glutamatergic neurons to glutamatergic neurons in the basolateral/lateral amygdala are critical for modulating sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep. These findings uncover a top-down regulatory circuit that selectively governs sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, with the TeA functioning as a key connecting cortex to subcortical regions.},

  abstract     = {Bionic neural devices often feature complex structures with multiple interfaces, requiring extensive post-processing. In this paper, a neural device with intrinsic perception and decision-making (NDIPD), inspired by neuronal oscillatory activity is introduced. The device utilizes alternating signals generated by coupling the human body with the power-frequency electromagnetic field as both a signal source and energy source, mimicking neuronal oscillatory activity. The peaks and valleys of the alternating signal are differentially modulated to replicate the baseline shift process in neuronal oscillatory activity. By comparing the amplitude of the peaks and valleys in the NDIPD&#39;s electrical output signal, the device achieves intrinsic perception and decision-making regarding the location of mechanical stimulation. This is accomplished using a single interface, which reduces data transmission, simplifies functionality, and eliminates the need for an external power supply. The NDIPD demonstrates a low-pressure detection limit (&lt;0.02 N), fast response time (&lt;20 ms), and exceptional stability (&gt;200 000 cycles). It shows great potential for applications such as game control, UAV navigation, and virtual vehicle driving. The innovative energy supply method and sensing mechanism are expected to open new avenues in the development of bionic neural devices.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts to replace expensive carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction remains an important challenge. Recently, an innovative catalyst, composed of ruthenium single atoms (Ru 1 ) integrated with small Ru nanoclusters (Ru NC ), has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community. However, because of its complexity, this catalyst remains a topic of some debate. Here, a method is reported of precisely controlling the ratios of Ru 1 to Ru NC on a nitrogenated carbon (NC)-based porous organic framework to produce Ru/NC catalysts, by using different amounts (0, 5, 10 wt.%) of reducing agent. The Ru/NC–10 catalyst, formed with 10 wt.% reducing agent, delivered the best performance under alkaline conditions, indicating that Ru NC played a significant role in actual alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) system using the Ru/NC–10 catalyst required a significantly lower operating voltage (1.72 V) than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (1.95 V) to achieve 500 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the system can be operated at 100 mA cm −2 without notable performance decay for over 180 h. Theoretical calculations supported these experimental findings that Ru 1 contributed to the water dissociation process, while Ru NC is more actively associated with the hydrogen recombination process.},

  abstract     = {The incidence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. However, the underlying mechanism of the process of kidney stone formation and the kidney damage caused are not well understood. Here, it is observed that Lgals3, a β-galactoside-binding protein, is significantly increased in tissues with calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, and in both in vivo and in vitro models. Lgals3 expression is positively correlated with the deposition of CaOx crystals. Knockout of Lgals3 markedly reduces the deposition of CaOx crystal and renal fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, Lgals3 deficiency decrease the glycolytic rate and lactate production during the process of CaOx deposition and inhibited histone lactylation of H3K18la. Mechanistic studies shows that Lgals3 directly interacted with the key glycolysis protein pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and promoted its expression by modulating E3 ligase Trim21, preventing the ubiquitination of PKM2. Furthermore, H3K18 lactylation promoted CaOx crystal deposition and kidney injury in vivo and in vitro. Lgals3 deficiency inhibites the transcription, activation, and expression of FGFR4 through inhibition of H3K18la. These findings suggest that Lgals3 may play a key role in CaOx stone formation and kidney injury by interacting with PKM2 and promoting both H3K18la-mediated gene transcription and activation.},

Although β -Ga 2 O 3 has attracted extensive research interest in advanced electronics, its high-temperature and high-speed volatile memory applications in harsh environment has been largely overlooked. Herein, a high-performance hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterostructure junction field-effect transistor (HJFET) is fabricated, exhibiting an off-state current as low as ≈10 fA, a high on/off current ratio of ≈10 8 , a low contact resistance of 5.6 Ω·mm, and an impressive field-effect electron mobility of 156 cm 2 （Vs） −1 . Notably, the current h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET exhibits outstanding thermal reliability in the ultra-wide temperature range from 223 to 573 K, as well as long-term environmental stability in air, which confirms its inherent capability of operation in harsh environments. Moreover, the h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET demonstrates successful applications for accelerator-in-memory computing fields, including dynamic random-access memory structure and neural network computations. These superior characteristics position β -Ga₂O₃-based electronics as highly promising for applications in extreme environments, with particular relevance to the automotive, aerospace, and sensor sectors.},

By employing the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN), the transition of the network&#39;s Poisson&#39;s ratio from positive to negative as the hexagonal structural element shifts from a convex polygon to a concave polygon was accurately predicted. The KAN provides a clear mathematical framework that describes this transition, revealing the connection between the Poisson&#39;s ratio and the geometric properties of the hexagonal element, and accurately identifying the geometric parameters at which the Poisson&#39;s ratio equals zero.

This study enrolled 2279 patients across 12 centers and develops a novel multi-modality model integrating longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spatial habitat radiomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing for predicting pCR. By analyzing tumor subregions on multi-timepoint MRI, the model captures dynamic intra-tumoral heterogeneity during NAT. It shows superior performance over traditional radiomics, with areas under the curve of 0.863, 0.813, and 0.888 in the external validation, immunotherapy, and multi-omics cohorts, respectively. Subgroup analysis shows its robustness across varying molecular subtypes and clinical stages. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that high model scores correlate with increased immune activity, notably elevated B cell infiltration, indicating the biological basis of the imaging model. The integration of imaging and molecular data demonstrates promise in spatial habitat radiomics to monitor dynamic changes in tumor heterogeneity during NAT. In clinical practice, this study provides a noninvasive tool to accurately predict pCR, with the potential to guide treatment planning and improve breast-conserving surgery rates. Despite promising results, the model requires prospective validation to confirm its utility across diverse patient populations and clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {2D metal-chalcogenide nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibit promising photocatalysis properties due to their ultrathin morphology, high surface-to-volume ratio, and enhanced in-plane electron transport mobility. However, NPLs, especially cadmium chalcogenides, encounter challenges in CO 2 photoreduction due to insufficient solar energy utilization and fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Defect engineering offers a potential solution but often encounters difficulties maintaining structural integrity, mechanical stability, and electrical conductivity. Herein, by taking two monolayers (2ML) CdSe NPLs as a model system, selenium (Se) vacancies confined in atomic layers can enhance charge separation and conductivity. A straightforward approach to create Se vacancies in various monolayers CdSe NPLs (2, 4, and 5ML) has been developed, enabling efficient CO 2 photoreduction with a 4-fold increase in CO generation compared to their defect-free counterparts. Significantly, accounting for higher charge density and efficient carrier transport due to Se vacancies, defective 2ML CdSe NPLs (V Se -2ML CdSe) exhibit CO evolution performance up to 2557.5 µmol g − ¹ h − ¹ with no significant decay over 5 h, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of common semiconductor catalysts.

Despite the great complexity of kinetics, it is clear that lithium-ion desolvation and a subsequent step of crossing through cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial to high-rate performance, in which the two key steps depend heavily on the working electrolyte formula. In this work, a customized electrolyte is developed to coordinate ion desolvation and interphase formation by introducing vinylene carbonate (VC), triphenylboroxin (TPBX), and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) but excluding ethylene carbonate (EC). Serving Ni-rich cathodes, the customized electrolyte generates a double-layered CEI, LiF-dominated inorganics inner layer, and ROCOOLi-dominated organics outer layer, which is not only stable and very efficient for lithium ion transport. Meanwhile, a -dominated solvation structure is induced and effectively decreases the desolvation energy to 29.72 kJ mol −1 , supporting fast lithium ion transport in the cathode interfacial processes. Consequently, the Ni-rich lithium-ion battery achieves a stable long cycle at a superior high rate of 10 C.},

Methods: Herein, the biological roles of TUG1 and HuR in angiogenesis are first confirmed. Following that, HuR-binding VEGFA mRNAs are identified via the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays. Actinomycin D and polysomal assays are also employed to confirm VEGFA mRNA stability. The co-localization of TUG1 with HuR is confirmed using FISH, while the RIP and RNA pull-down assays are employed to elucidate their interplay. The direct binding between TUG1 and HuR is confirmed through the CLIP assay. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and rescue experiments are performed to further elucidate TUG1-HuR interactions. Results: While TUG1 repressed angiogenesis and aggravated CIRI, HuR exerted contrary effects. Specifically, HuR bound directly to VEGFA mRNA, a phenomenon that enhanced VEGFA mRNA stability. Conversely, TUG1 binds to HuR directly, inhibiting its nuclear translocation and promoting its ubiquitination, ultimately reducing VEGFA mRNA stability. Conclusions: It is found that TUG1 can inhibit angiogenesis in CIRI through the HuR/VEGFA mRNA axis.},

  abstract     = {Sustained β-adrenergic activation induces cardiac fibrosis characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) receptor EP4 is essential for cardiovascular homeostasis. This study aims to investigate the roles of cardiomyocyte (CM) and cardiac fibroblast (CF) EP4 in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis. By crossing the EP4 f/f mice with α-MyHC-Cre or S100A4-Cre mice, this work obtains the CM-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ ) or CF-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ ) mice. The mice of both genders are subcutaneously injected with ISO (5 mg kg −1 day −1 ) for 7 days. Compared to the control mice, both EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ and EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ mice show a significant improvement in cardiac diastolic function and fibrosis as assessed by echocardiography and histological staining, respectively. In the CMs, inhibition of EP4 suppresses ISO-induced TGF-β1 expression via blocking the cAMP/PKA pathway. In the CFs, inhibition of EP4 reversed TGF-β1-triggers production of ECM via preventing the formation of the TGF-β1/TGF-β receptor complex and blocks CF proliferation via suppressing the ERK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, double knockout of the CM- and CF-EP4 or administration of EP4 antagonist, grapiprant, markedly improves ISO-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction and fibrosis. Collectively, this study demonstrates that both CM-EP4 and CF-EP4 contribute to β-adrenergic activation-induced cardiac fibrosis. Targeting EP4 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for cardiac fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Trophic interactions in micro-food webs, such as those between nematodes and their bacterial prey, affect nitrogen cycling in soils, potentially changing nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production and consumption. However, how nematode-mediated changes in soil bacterial community composition affect soil N 2 O emissions is largely unknown. Here, microcosm experiments are performed with the bacterial feeding nematode Protorhabditis to explore the potential of nematodes in regulating microbial communities and thereby soil N 2 O emissions. Removal of nematodes by defaunation resulted in increased N 2 O emissions, with the removal of Protorhabditis contributing most to this increase. Further, inoculation with Protorhabditis altered bacterial community composition and increased the relative abundance of Bacillus , and the abundance of the nosZ gene in soil. In vitro experiments indicated that Protorhabditis reinforce the reduction in N 2 O emissions by Bacillus due to suppressing competitors and producing bacteria growth stimulating substances such as betaine. The results indicate that interactions between nematodes and bacteria modify N 2 O emissions providing the perspective for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions via manipulating trophic interactions in soil.},

  abstract     = {Localized liquid secretion, being an important process in nature such as the secretion of tears or mucus, has been an attractive point in developing biomimetic materials. However, precise localization remains challenging due to the cohesive and mobile nature of liquids. In this paper, light-induced localized liquid secretion is demonstrated on the scale of tens of micrometers by a liquid crystal polymer coating with an alternating homeotropic-planar alignment. The light responsiveness is achieved by the incorporation of azobenzene derivative. The localization is achieved by applying regional through-thickness electric fields to the monomeric liquid crystals before polymerization. The polymerized coating preserves both homeotropic and planar alignment. Upon actuation, the liquid can be locally secreted from the homeotropic region while suppressed in the planar area. This method allows precise control over various secretion patterns based on different pre-designed electrodes, which paves the way for the development of responsive devices in a multitude of fields, such as targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, and microfluidic devices.},

Unlike traditional heterojunction photocatalysts, homojunction features different energy bandgaps with interchangeable compositions that can significantly trigger charge carrier dynamics, but their precise construction remains an ongoing challenge owing to quick lattice-level modulations. Herein, TiO 2 -based homojunction (HT M-OH ) holding dissimilar yet discernible crystalline phases (anatase and rutile) are rationally constructed by a straightforward alkali-induced strategy which enables controllable lattice-transition/orientation. The resulting HT M-OH exhibits speedy separation and well-guided flow of e − -h + over redox sites with extended carrier lifetime, leading to high-rate hydrogen generation (HER, 34.35 mmol g −1 h −1 ) under simulated sunlight. Moreover, a self-made thin film of HT M-OH indicates a notable scale-up potential under real-time sunlight. This work furnishes a new non-complex homojunction strategy for speeding charge carrier kinetics, credibly extendable to a diverse range of catalysts and applications.},

Moreover, the rougher fiber surface morphology and weaken hydrophilicity cause the adjacent bubbles are slower to detach from the electrode and are more likely to fusion. The measured diameter of bubbles leaving the electrode almost doubles, while the total number of bubbles decreases by about two-thirds, causing the increase of plug flow in the flow field and deteriorating the performance and long-term stability of AEMWE.},

Quercetin, one of the most important dietary flavonoids, is being explored as an effective therapy for obesity with its mechanism remains understudied. Here in this study, it is demonstrated that quercetin intervention significantly reverses obesity-related phenotypes through reshaping the overall structure of microbiota, especially boosting colonization of the beneficial gut commensal Akkermansia muciniphila ( A. muciniphila ). Enrichment of A. muciniphila leads to generate more indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) to upregulate the expression of 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) via fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)/ N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)/YTHDF2 manner, thereby facilitating cholesterol converts to cholic acid (CA). CA in turn drastically suppresses lipid accumulation via activating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in adipose tissue. This work introduces a novel therapeutic target for addressing obesity and expands upon the current limited understanding of the mediator function of m 6 A modifications in microorganism-influenced bile acid (BA) metabolism.},

Here, it is shown that a plant-specific RAV-type transcription factor, OsRAV15, is specifically targeted by several distinct viral proteins for facilitating viral infection. OsRAV15 is found to activate jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated broad-spectrum antiviral immunity by physically associating with JA signaling essential components OsMYC2-OsJAZ complex. To facilitate viral infection, evolutionarily distinct viral proteins encoded by diverse rice viruses generally disrupt the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 complex to attenuate activation of JA signaling. Together, the results reveal a common counter-defense strategy used by different viruses to suppress the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 module that plays a vital role in fine-tuning JA-mediated antiviral defense.},

In this work, a model laser-fabricated rotating lattice Sb 2 S 3 crystal grown in stoichiometric glass is used to demonstrate fabrication of novel macroperiodic metastructures that utilize intrinsic lattice curvature superimposed with subtle crystallographic influences. The limited availability of slip systems drives the lattice curvature magnitude to vary with crystal growth direction, maximizing for lattices aligned with the predominant Burgers vector along with corresponding increases in dislocation density. Misaligned lattice orientations form smaller secondary lattice curvatures arising from misaligned Burgers vectors with further elastic contributions. Over extended crystal growth, these secondary components align the lattice to rotate about either the &lt;001&gt; or &lt;010&gt; crystal axes forming repeating metastructures of lattice orientation with periodicity 20–160 microns in length.

Despite the facile design of DNA hybridization probes, their limited specificity poses challenges in clinical applications. Here, a differential reaction pathway probe (DRPP) based on a dynamic DNA reaction network is presented. DRPP leverages differences in reaction intermediate concentrations between SNV and WT groups, directing them into distinct reaction pathways. This generates a strong pulse-like signal for SNV and a weak unidirectional increase signal for wild-type (WT). Through the application of machine learning to fluorescence kinetic data analysis, the classification of SNV and WT signals is automated with an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly exceeding the 80.7% accuracy of conventional methods. Additionally, sensitivity for variant allele frequency (VAF) is enhanced down to 0.1%, representing a ten-fold improvement over conventional approaches. DRPP accurately identified D614G and N501Y SNVs in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 variants in patient swab samples with accuracy over 99% (n = 82). It determined the VAF of ovarian cancer-related mutations KRAS-G12R , NRAS-G12C , and BRAF-V600E in both tissue and blood samples (n = 77), discriminating cancer patients and healthy individuals with significant difference ( p &lt; 0.001).

This phenomenon provides a potential basis for the development of treatment strategies for tissue damage and degeneration. This study aims to evaluate whether mitochondria isolated from osteoblasts can promote osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mitochondria from MSCs, which primarily utilize glycolysis, are compared with those from MG63 cells, which depend on oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria from both cell types are then encapsulated in cationic liposomes and transferred to MSCs, and their impact on differentiation is assessed. Mitochondria delivery from MG63 cells to MSCs grown in both two- and three-dimensional cultures results in increased expression of osteogenic markers, including Runt-related transcription factor 2, Osterix, and Osteopontin, and upregulation of genes involved in Bone morphogenetic protein 2 signaling and calcium import. This is accompanied by increased calcium influx and regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Transplantation of spheroids containing MSCs with MG63-derived mitochondria in bone defect animal models improves bone regeneration. The results suggest that delivery of MG63-derived mitochondria effectively guides MSCs toward osteogenesis, paving the way for the development of mitochondria-transplantation therapies.},

The findings revealed opposing alterations in the expression levels of the cellular senescence pathway after radiotherapy in patients with local and distant relapses. In contrast, an increase in the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition module after radiotherapy in both relapse groups is observed. Cell–cell interactions, drug-target expression analyses in malignant cells after radiation, and multiplex immunofluorescence of tumor tissue identified interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) as a potential therapeutic target.

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major factor contributing to poor treatment outcomes. This resistance markedly affects the effectiveness of surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy and leads to post-surgical tumor recurrence. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM is crucial for understanding its progression and improving therapeutic options. This study found that moesin (MSN) acts as a key promotor of chemoradiotherapy resistance in glioma stem cells (GSCs), enhancing their proliferation and stemness maintenance. Mechanistically, MSN activates the downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, driving the proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) in GSCs. This process enhances the repair of DNA damage caused by radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), thereby increasing the resistance of GSCs to chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, GNE-317, a small molecule drug capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, specifically inhibits MSN and suppresses the activation of downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling. Importantly, the combination of GNE-317 with RT and TMZ exhibits a strong synergistic effect both in vivo and in vitro, achieving better efficacy compared to the traditional combination of RT and TMZ. This study not only advances understanding of the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM but also provides a promising new approach for enhancing treatment outcomes.},

Herein, the broad-spectrum capture and detection capability of the antibody-free electropositive nanoprobe are clarified for bacteria for the first time and an ultrasensitive fluorescent ICA platform is constructed for the simultaneous diagnosis of multiple pathogens. A magnetic multilayer quantum dot nanocomposite with an amino-embedded SiO 2 shell (MagMQD@Si + ) is designed to enrich bacteria from solutions effectively, offer high luminescence, and reduce background signals on test strips, thus greatly improving the sensitivity and stability of ICA technique for pathogen. The superior performance of the MagMQD@Si + -based ICA through the multiplex detection of three common pathogens is demonstrated, namely, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Salmonella typhimurium , showing that this ICA possesses high sensitivity (8–40 cells mL −1 ), good reproducibility (relative standard deviation &lt; 5.4%), and high specificity for the three target bacteria. The clinical utility of the proposed method is verified through the detection of 30 real sputum samples from patients with bacterial respiratory infections, revealing that the MagMQD@Si + -based ICA has massive potential as a powerful inspection tool for the rapid, sensitive, and ultrasensitive diagnosis of bacterial infections.

In this study, pancreatic lesions in patients diagnosed as either type 1 AIP or type 2 AIP are examined, and these patients’ peripheral blood at single-cell level. Furthermore, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and functional assays are performed to verify the identified cell subtypes. In type 1 AIP, there is a notable increase in the amount of B cells and plasma cells, and IgG4+ plasma cells are key pathogenic cells of AIP. The differentiation path of naïve-stage B cells into IgG4+ produced plasma cells is observed, and an increased amount of T helper cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. This study also reveals that HIF-1α, an activated transcriptional factor, can directly bind to promoter site of NAMPT, promoting higher levels of visfatin production in HIF1A+ classical monocytes. Pancreatic stellate cells can be activated by extracellular visfatin and promote the development of fibrotic response in pancreatic lesions across both AIP subtypes. The current findings shed light on the exploration of dynamic alterations in peripheral blood cells and cell subgroups in pancreatic lesions of AIP, while elucidating a pathogenic cell subset and potential fibrosis mechanism of AIP.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of public and private goods production is essential for bacterial adaptation to environmental changes. Quorum sensing (QS) regulates this balance by mediating the trade-off between the communal benefits of “public goods,” such as siderophores and antibiotics, and the individual metabolic needs fulfilled by “private goods,” such as intracellular metabolites utilized for growth and survival. Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 harbors a LasI/LasR-type QS system, MupI/MupR, which regulates mupirocin production through signaling molecules. This study explores how QS coordinates carbon and nitrogen metabolism to optimize the production of key secondary metabolites, including 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), mupirocin, and siderophores, which serve as public goods. Loss of QS disrupts this balance by enhancing the Krebs cycle, denitrification, pyruvate anaplerosis, and ammonium assimilation, lead to halted 2,4-DAPG and mupirocin synthesis and increased siderophore production. In the absence of QS, elevated siderophore production compensates for iron acquisition, ensuring rapid cellular growth. Under nutrient-limited or high cell density conditions, MupR regulates carbon and nitrogen fluxes to sustain public goods production. These findings highlight QS as a key environmental sensor that fine-tunes resource allocation, bacterial fitness, and adaptation to ecological and nutritional conditions, suggesting the potential for QS-targeted approaches to enhance antibiotic production and agricultural sustainability.},

Forkhead box P1 (Foxp1) regulates embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart development. However, whether Foxp1 participates in postnatal-injury cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration remains unclear. This study demonstrates that Foxp1 is downregulated at border zone cardiomyocytes of both neonatal apical resection and adult myocardial infarction. Analysis of the Single-cell transcriptome database reveals reduced Foxp1 expression in the cardiomyocyte population with high regenerative capacity. Cardiomyocyte-Foxp1 loss-of-function significantly promotes, whereas cardiomyocytes-Foxp1 gain-of-function suppresses cardiomyocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, Foxp1 directly regulates ubiquitin specific peptidase 20 (USP20), a de-ubiquitinase that prevents hypoxia inducible factor 1ɑ (HIF1α) degradation. Thus, Foxp1 regulates HIF1α and downstream heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1 (Hand1) to control the cardiomyocyte proliferation via metabolic transition from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. Finally, cardiac type troponin T2 (cTnT)-promoter-driven adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) for Hand1 induction in cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiac regeneration and functional recovery. These findings may provide novel molecular strategies to promote heart regeneration and therapeutic interventions for heart failure.},

  abstract     = {Doxorubicin, an anthracycline commonly used for treating cancer patients, is known for its cardiotoxic side-effects. Although dose-dependent, but susceptibility remains variable among patients, and childhood-exposure-adult-onset remains challenging. Besides topoisomerase toxicity, Doxorubicin is also toxic to the mitochondria yet the underlying late onset mechanism remains elusive. Here, it is observed that the mitochondrial copy number in PBMCs of patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy is negatively correlated with the change in plasma BNP levels after treatment. Isogenic hiPSC-CMs are generated with high, norm, and low mitochondrial copy numbers using mitochondrial transplantation and the YFP-Parkin system. Remarkably, lower mitochondria copy number translates to lower IC 50 , suggesting increased susceptibility. Mitochondria supplementation by intramyocardial injection prevents doxorubicin induced heart failure. Mechanistically, doxorubicin treatment leads to mPTP opening and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. This mtDNA leakage event activates the cGAS-STING pathway and drives inflammation and myocardial senescence. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Sting (Myh6-Cre/Sting flox/flox ; Sting CKO ) and over expression of mitochondrial tagged DNase1 in mice partially rescue doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. In conclusion, the work establishes a negative correlation between cardiomyocyte mitochondrial copy number and doxorubicin toxicity. Molecularly, it is demonstrated that mtDNA leakage activates cGAS-STING pathway and accelerates myocardial dysfunction. These insights offer new co-administration strategies for cancer patients.},

Although several key plasmid elements that balance mcr-1 persistence and bacterial growth are identified, the regulatory interactions between mcr-1 and host bacteria remain poorly understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi crRNA library, it is identified that DNA polymerase IV, dinB , is essential for controlling the fitness cost associated with mcr-1 in Escherichia coli . The absence of dinB operon enhances mcr-1 -mediated colistin resistance but simultaneously compromises bacterial growth and competitiveness. Meanwhile, dinB deficiency mitigates inflammatory response in RAW267.4 cells and enhances bacterial colonization in murine tissues. Further investigation reveals that mcr-1 actively upregulates dinB expression, with the increased reactive oxygen species induced by mcr-1 being crucial for this activation.   These findings suggest that dinB modulates mcr expression and bacterial fitness via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. Leveraging this regulatory relationship, a Toxin-Intein is engineered under the control of dinB promoter to selectively target and kill mcr -positive E. coli both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the work uncovers a novel adaptive mechanism underlying mcr persistence and provides a precise antimicrobial strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Metastasis remains a significant challenge in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) in HCC is still uncertain, although it has been reported to have contradictory effects on some cancers. Here, it is demonstrated that RNASET2 knockout leads to significant accumulation of cholesterol, which in turn promotes MET-mediated HCC metastasis. Mechanistically, the absence of RNASET2 hinders the degradation of RNA into uridine, thereby reducing the conversion to UTP. This reduction restrains glucuronate metabolism and the expression of the related enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol due to decreased formation of glucuronidated-bile acids. The administration of cholesterol induces the migration and invasion of HCC cells through MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) activation. However, the deficiency of RNASET2-induced HCC metastasis can be reversed by blocking MET with shRNA or savolitinib. The study identifies RNASET2 as a key regulator that coordinates RNA, glucuronate, and cholesterol metabolism. Its deficiency drives HCC metastasis through cholesterol-triggered MET activation. These findings highlight the potential of targeting RNASET2 and MET in improving the prognosis of HCC.},

  abstract     = {Targeting cholesterol metabolism is a novel direction for tumor therapy. Unfortunately, the current use of statins for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Herein, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) is identified as a novel target for treating HCC and a potential alternative to statins. Twenty-three key genes in cholesterol biosynthesis are screened, and FDFT1 is identified via public databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, International Cancer Genome Consortium and Gene Expression Omnibus). Clinical samples reveal that FDFT1 is highly expressed in HCC tissues, and this phenotype is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally, FDFT1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells and suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo, whereas FDFT1 overexpression promotes HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, FDFT1 downregulation decreases cholesterol and bile acid levels and then increases hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) transcriptional activity. Experiments indicate that HNF4A combines with the promoter of aldolase B ( ALDOB) and promotes the ALDOB transcription and that ALDOB combines with AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and inhibits AKT1 phosphorylation. Moreover, FDFT1 knockdown combined with AKT inhibitor (AZD5363) treatment shows remarkable therapeutic potential. FDFT1 inhibition reduces cholesterol and bile acid levels to delay HCC progression through the HNF4A/ALDOB/AKT1 axis. Thus, targeting FDFT1 may be a novel potential strategy for treating HCC.},

These molecules are prevalent in eukaryotes and play key roles in cancer. Here, the function of a new circRNA, circMETTL6, in ovarian cancer is identified and investigated. The prognostic significance of circMETTL6 is assessed using RNA in situ hybridization. Functional studies involving circMETTL6 overexpression are performed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations are performed using RNA-seq, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, protein degradation assay and dual-luciferase reporter assays. circMETTL6 is significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer, and its lower expression correlates with worse prognosis. Overexpression of circMETTL6 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cell in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, circMETTL6 recruited the non-POU domain containing octamer binding protein (NONO) by binding to its Coiled-coil domain and disrupted its binding with RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), and consequently inhibiting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) transcription, thereby suppressing ovarian cancer progression.

  abstract     = {Malonic acid (MA) is a high-value-added chemical with significant applications in the polymers, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Microbial production of MA presents enzyme inefficiencies, competitive metabolic pathways, and dispersive carbon flux, which collectively limit its biosynthesis. Here, the non-conventional oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is genetically engineered to enhance MA production. Initially, the malonyl-CoA pathway, comprising a malonyl-CoA hydrolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is confirmed as the most efficient for MA production in Y. lipolytica . To further enhance MA production, two novel malonyl-CoA hydrolases exhibiting higher activity than the hydrolase from S. cerevisiae , are identified from Y. lipolytica and Fusarium oxysporum , respectively. The introduction of the malonyl-CoA hydrolase from F. oxysporum increases the MA titer to 6.3 g L −1 . Subsequently, advanced metabolic engineering strategies are performed to ensure a sufficient flux of the precursors acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA for MA production, resulting in a production of 13.8 g L −1 MA in shaking-flasks. Finally, by employing the fermentation conditions and feeding strategies, a maximum concentration of 63.6 g L −1 of MA is achieved at 156 h with a productivity of 0.41 g L −1 h −1 in fed-batch fermentation. This study provides a new way for engineering Y. lipolytica to enhance MA production at high titer.},

The key challenge resides in the development of efficient sensing systems with high sensitivity, selectivity, humidity resistance, and profuse color change. Herein, a strategy is reported for the direct visualization of VOCs sensing by mimicking human olfactory function and integrating colorimetric COF-on-MOF sensors with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted data analysis techniques. The Dye@Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework@Covalent Organic Framework (Dye@ZIF-8@COF) sensor takes advantage of the highly porous structure of MOF core and hydrophobic nature of the COF shell, enabling highly sensitive colorimetric sensing of trace number of VOCs. The Dye@ZIF-8@COF sensor exhibits exceptional sensitivity to VOCs at sub-parts per million levels and demonstrates excellent humidity resistance (under 20–90% relative humidity), showing great promise for practical applications. Importantly, AI-assisted information fusion and perceptual analysis greatly promote the accuracy of the VOCs sensing processes, enabling direct visualization and classification of seven stages of matcha drying processes with a superior accuracy of 95.74%. This work paves the way for the direct visualization of sensing processes of VOCs via the integration of advanced humidity-resistant sensing materials and AI-assisted data analyzing techniques.},

However, the focus on continuously improving the joint motors and control systems of existing legged robots not only increases costs and complicates maintenance but also results in failure to accurately mimic the functionality of the human skeletal‒muscular system. This study introduces a bionic legged robot structure that leverages the tensegrity principle, drawing inspiration from the human leg&#39;s structural morphology and kinematic mechanisms. By designing a system that distinguishes between rolling and sliding movements, the human knee&#39;s variable instantaneous center of rotation (ICR), is successfully replicated showcasing its capabilities in achieving gait resemblance and vibration absorption. The tensegrity unit&#39;s features, including remarkable deformability, self-recovery, and the four-bar mechanism&#39;s singular position characteristic, alongside a rope unlocking mechanism reminiscent of human muscles, facilitate in situ compliance–rigid–compliance transitions of the knee joint without the need for knee joint motors, relying solely on ground contact through the foot. This innovation overcomes the conventional dependency of legged robots on joint motors, as the system requires only a single DC motor positioned at the hip joint and a straightforward control program to seamlessly execute a complete cycle of a single leg&#39;s movement.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with oxidative stress and redox signaling disruption. It is recently reported that proautophagic autophagy/beclin-1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1) is a positive modulator of the NF-κB pathway that promotes intestinal inflammation. However, its effect on intestinal redox state and whether AMBRA1 is regulated by oxidative stress remain unknown. In this study, it is found that AMBRA1 functions as a pro-oxidative factor that increases oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the N-terminal F1 domain is required for AMBRA1 to competitively interact with the N-terminal domain of NRF2, thereby antagonizing the interaction between deubiquitinating protein 3 (DUB3) and NRF2, suppressing DUB3-mediated NRF2 deubiquitination, and leading to NRF2 degradation. In response to H 2 O 2 stimulation, the interaction between AMBRA1 and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is enhanced, facilitating USP7 to deubiquitinate AMBRA1 at K83 and K86 and stabilize AMBRA1. Notably, the USP7 inhibitor, P5091, inhibits oxidative stress and colitis in vivo. Elevated AMBRA1 expression in inflamed colon tissues from ulcerative colitis patients is negatively correlated with decreased NRF2 protein levels. Overall, this study identifies AMBRA1 as a pro-oxidative factor in IECs and provides a redox-modulating therapeutic strategy for targeting USP7/AMBRA1 in IBD.},

  abstract     = {A major characteristic of ovarian cancer (OC) is its unique route of metastasis via ascites. The immune microenvironment in ascites remains understudied, leaving the mechanism of ascites-mediated abdominal metastasis obscure. Here, a single-cell transcriptomic landscape of CD45 + immune cells across multiple anatomical sites is depicted, including primary tumors, metastatic lesions, and ascites, from patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). A novel subset of perilipin 2 high (PLIN2 hi ) macrophages are identified that are enriched in ascites and positively correlated with OC progression, hence being designated as “ascites-associated macrophages (AAMs)”. AAMs are lipid-loaded with overexpression of the lipid droplet protein PLIN2. Overexpression or suppression of PLIN2 can enhance or inhibit tumor cell migration, invasion, and vascular permeability in vitro, which is also confirmed in vivo. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that PLIN2 boosts HIF1α/SPP1 signaling in macrophages, thereby exerting pro-tumor functions. Finally, a PLIN2-targeting liposome is designed to efficiently suppress ascites production and tumor metastasis. Taken together, this work provides a comprehensive characterization of the cancer-promoting function and lipid-rich property of ascites-enriched PLIN2 hi macrophages, establishes a link between lipid metabolism and hypoxia within the context of the ascites microenvironment, and elucidates the pivotal role of ascites in trans-coelomic metastasis of OC.},

This process aligns the oxide grains with their easy-magnetization c -axis parallel to the applied magnetic field. Depending on the magnetic field&#39;s direction relative to the slip casting, grains orient either with their a , b -plane or c -axis parallel to the normal direction of the disk-shaped ceramic, thus aligning with the oxygen permeation direction. Without the magnetic field, a non-textured bulk membrane is formed. The microstructure and texture of the ceramic membranes are meticulously analyzed using advanced techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as related methods. Evaluation of the texturing effect on the oxygen permeation performance shows that the a , b -plane textured Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ bulk membrane achieves the highest oxygen permeation fluxes between 1023–1223 K. Additionally, it demonstrates impressive CO₂ stability, maintaining effective performance for at least 140 h due to preferential oxygen transport along the a , b -plane. These characteristics make Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ an auspicious material for industrial applications as an oxygen transport membrane, outperforming more susceptible perovskite-based materials. Magnetic alignment thus proves to be an effective method for achieving membrane texturing, enabling precise regulation of oxygen transport properties.},

Here, an amphiphilic microparticle with four discrete hydrophilic patches embedded at the inner corners of a square-shaped hydrophobic outer ring of the particle (4C particle) is fabricated. Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations predict droplet formation dynamics and differing equilibrium conditions depending on the patterning configuration. Experiments recapitulate equilibrium conditions, enabling tunable dropicle configurations with reproducible volumes down to ≈200 pL templated by the amphiphilic particles. The dropicle configurations depend predominantly on the size of the hydrophilic patches of the 4C particles. This validates that the modeling approach can inform the design of dropicles with varying volumes and numbers per particle, which can be harnessed in new amplified bioassays for greater sensitivity, dynamic range, and statistical confidence.},

Herein, it is shown that aging-associated reduction of commensal Parabacteroides goldsteinii ( P. goldsteinii ) in both aged mice and humans critically contributes to worse outcomes of bacterial infection. The colonization of live P. goldsteinii conferred protection against aging-associated bacterial infections. Metabolomic profiling reveals a protective compound, apigenin, generated by P. goldsteinii , antagonizes bacterial clearance defects in aged mice. AMP-binding protein ( ampB ) is identified as a key gene involved in apigenin synthesis in P. goldsteinii using homologous recombination in bacteria. Mechanistically, apigenin binds directly to the potential sites on Fgr (M341 and D404), preventing its inhibitory role on Vav1 phosphorylation, and therefore promoting the activation of Cdc42/Rac1, Arp2/3 expression and subsequent actin reorganization, which contributes to the enhanced phagocytosis of macrophages to bacteria. Collectively, the findings suggest that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may impair host defense mechanisms and increase susceptibility to bacterial infections in older adults and highlight the microbiota-apigenin-Fgr axis as a possible route to ameliorate aging-associated antibacterial defects.},

The cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, involving cGAMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), has emerged as a key mediator of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanisms through which cGAS activation influences AD progression remain poorly understood. In this study, we observed significant up-regulation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway in AD. Notably, this increase is primarily attributed to microglia, rather than non-microglial cell types. Using an inducible, microglia-specific cGAS knockout mouse model in the 5xFAD background, we demonstrated that deleting microglial cGAS at the onset of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology profoundly restricts plaque accumulation and protects mice from Aβ-induced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, our study revealed cGAS promotes plaque-associated microglia accumulation and is essential for inflammasome activation. Moreover, we showed that restricting cGAS-mediated innate immunity is crucial for preserving inter-cellular communication in the brain and induces pleiotrophin, a neuroprotective factor. These findings offer novel insights into the specific roles of the innate immune system in AD employing a cell-type-specific approach. The conclusions provide a foundation for targeted interventions to modulate the microglial cGAS-STING signaling pathway, offering promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Suppressing the non-radiative loss in the organic solar cells (OSCs) through molecular design remains a significant challenge. Typically, triplet state of organic semiconductors is lower than the charge transfer (CT) state, contributing to substantial non-radiative loss via the triplet state. Herein, a set of terpolymers is prepared by introducing a simple Pt complex block into the PM6 polymer backbone. These metalated terpolymers exhibit high triplet energy ( E T1 ) and small singlet–triplet energy gap (∆ E ST ), facilitating fast intersystem crossing (ISC) process to generate triplet excitons. Consequently, the metalated terpolymers show enhanced exciton lifetime and diffusion length, and most importantly, effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination via terminal triplet loss channels. Moreover, the Pt complex modifies the molecular aggregation of the polymer, hence optimizing the morphology of the active blends. The PM6-Pt1:L8-BO devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.54% (certified as 18.32%), the highest reported for metalated terpolymers to date. The PCE is further increased to a record high 19.24% in the PM6-Pt1:PM6:L8-BO (0.8:0.2:1.2, wt/wt/wt) ternary devices. Overall, this work provides a feasible approach to designing terpolymers with high E T1 , thereby reducing non-radiative loss in the OSCs.},

  abstract     = {The accurate assembly of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is fundamental for the replication and transcription of rhabdoviruses, which are known for their broad pathogenic impact. A novel 119-amino-acid protein, NLRP12-119aa is identified, encoded by the circular RNA circNLRP12, that effectively disrupts the formation of rhabdovirus RNP complexes through two distinct mechanisms and significantly reduces their replication. NLRP12-119aa exhibits a strong affinity for the conserved 18-nucleotide sequence at the start of the leader RNA of rhabdoviruses VSV, SCRV, and RABV, outcompeting their native N protein interactions, thereby disrupting the assembly of RNP complexes and inhibiting viral replication. NLRP12-119aa exerts anti-rhabdoviral effects by directly binding to the viral N protein, leading to its destabilization and accelerated degradation, and consequently hindering the formation of the viral RNP complex. To assess the therapeutic potential of circNLRP12 against rhabdovirus infections, a zebrafish model of VSV infection is established and noted a substantial reduction in viral load after-treatment with circNLRP12, as well as the recovery of spleen&#39;s to a normalized state from its previously enlarged and hemorrhagic state. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel dual anti-RNP assembly strategy mediated by NLRP12-119aa, offering valuable insights for further exploration and clinical management of rhabdoviral infections.},

  abstract     = {Particle-stabilized emulsions, also known as Pickering emulsions, have shown promise in areas that require long-term stability with minimum use of surfactants. While most work has focused on densely covered Pickering emulsions, such emulsions are known to retain stability even when the interfaces are sparsely covered with particles. Here, the formation, dynamics, and stability of poorly covered model Pickering emulsions are studied in a controlled manner by utilizing a microfluidic platform. The formed Pickering emulsions remain highly stable, over at least 12 h, even with a surface area coverage below 3%. By directly visualizing the droplet interface at various stages, the exceptional stability is attributed to the highly spatially heterogeneous distribution of adsorbed particles which exclusively form particle bridges at the contact point between the droplets. Remarkably, these bridges are assembled in the form of crowns between the droplet interfaces, as visualized by confocal microscopy. The assembly behavior of the adsorbed particles in response to hydrodynamic forces and the formation of non-uniform particle distribution are discussed by analyzing the different forces present during emulsification, corroborated by numerical simulations. In conclusion, using a lab-on-a-chip approach, this work provides further understanding toward the fabrication of Pickering emulsions via preferential interfacial localization of particles.},

  abstract     = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent bone marrow disorder. The challenges in managing MM include selecting chemotherapy regimens that effectively modulate the myeloma microenvironment and delivering them to the bone marrow with high efficacy and minimal toxicity. Herein, a novel bone marrow targeting strategy using c(RGDfk) peptide-modified liposomes loaded with chemotherapeutics is developed, which can specifically recognize and hitchhike neutrophils following systemic administration, capitalizing on their natural aging process to facilitate precise drug delivery to the bone marrow, thus minimizing off-target effects. On the one hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes containing carfilzomib (CRLPs) successfully transformed macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype, enhancing immunotherapeutic responses. On the other hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes encapsulating BMS-202 (BRLPs), a small molecule checkpoint inhibitor, interrupted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and promoted the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. The co-administration of CRLPs and BRLPs successfully delivered drugs to bone marrow, leading to significant modulation of the myeloma microenvironment, reduced tumor growth, and improved survival time of MM-bearing mouse models. These findings introduced an alternative approach to modulating the myeloma microenvironment and underscored the efficacy of hitchhiking neutrophils for bone marrow drug delivery. This strategy show advantages over traditional drug delivery methods in terms of improved efficacy and lowered toxicity.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is a promising anti-tumor therapeutic strategy; however, its efficacy in solid tumors is limited. Chromosome missegregation is common in various solid tumors; however, its role in tumor progression remains poorly understood, and its correlation with ICI is yet to be explored. Here, it is found that increased chromosome missegregation promotes tumor immune microenvironment, and eventually immunotherapeutic efficacy, by triggering pyroptosis. yin yang 2 (YY2) is identified as a mitotic checkpoint regulator, which promotes chromosome missegregation by upregulating BUB1B transcription. Increased chromosome missegregation promoted the formation of micronuclei and release of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into the cytosol, triggering an AIM2-mediated cytosolic dsDNA response. The subsequent pyroptosis strengthened the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing immunoinfiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, while preventing their exhaustion. Finally, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that combining YY2 overexpression-induced chromosome missegregation/cytosolic dsDNA response and PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced the efficacy of ICI immunotherapy in microsatellite instable and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer cells. Together, these findings provide new insights on the role of chromosome missegregation in triggering cytosolic dsDNA response-mediated pyroptosis and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, suggesting a novel strategy for improving ICI therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer.},

  abstract     = {Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AS-AIH) is characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis, with a current lack of effective targeted treatments. Stem cell therapy has demonstrated significant therapeutic promise across various autoimmune diseases. However, the intricate pathogenesis of AS-AIH has hindered the widespread utilization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in this domain. Herein, it is demonstrated that necroptosis, as the primary mode of cell death in AIH, is crucial in causing AS-AIH. Inflammatory macrophages are the primary cell population involved in necroptosis. Inhibition of the specificity protein 1/sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine-1-phosphate (SP1/SK1/S1P) axis is responsible for this phenomenon, leading to excessive activation of the intrahepatic immune system and aggravating liver damage. Furthermore, the S1P/S1PR2/YAP axis is the key pathway in initiating liver regeneration during AS-AIH. S1P synthesized by hepatocytes is the primary source, and this process is also regulated by the SP1/SK1 axis. MSCs promote S1P synthesis by macrophages through the delivery of SP1, which inhibits necroptosis and synergistically enhances liver regeneration. In addition, MSCs also promote S1P synthesis in hepatocytes through the same mechanism, further aiding liver regeneration. These findings unveil the core pathogenesis of AS-AIH and provide a theoretical foundation for using MSCs as a potential targeted therapeutic modality.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly resistant to ferroptosis, which hinders the application of anti-ferroptosis therapy. Through drug screening, it is found that histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) significantly sensitized CRC to ferroptosis. The combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers synergically suppresses CRC growth both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, HDACi reduces ferroptosis suppressor protein (FSP1) by promoting its mRNA degradation. Specifically, it is confirmed that HDACi specifically targets HDAC1 and promotes the H3K27ac modification of fat mass- and obesity-associated gene (FTO) and AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase (ALKBH5), which results in significant activation of FTO and ALKBH5. The activation of FTO and ALKBH5 reduces N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification on FSP1 mRNA, leading to its degradation. Crucially, lactylation of HDAC1 K412 is essential for ferroptosis regulation. Both Vorinostat (SAHA) and Trichostatin A (TSA) notably diminish HDAC1 K412 lactylation in comparison to other HDAC1 inhibitors, exhibiting a consistent trend of increasing susceptibility to ferroptosis. In conclusion, the research reveals that HDACi decreases HDAC1 K412 lactylation to sensitize CRC to ferroptosis and that the combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers can be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC.},

However, there is a need to develop multiplexed assays capable of analyzing multiple genes simultaneously to expand its application. To address this, a multiplexed RT-qPCR using a double emulsion (DE)-based carrier and a polymer microparticle reactor, termed primer-incorporated network tailored with Taqman probe (TaqPIN) is developed. The DE securely stores nucleic acid reagents like primers and probes within the polymer network until heating releases them for the reaction. The TaqPIN RT-qPCR demonstrates an amplification efficiency of 93.8% and can detect as few as 20 copies/µL. By loading the multiple microparticles into a single reaction, a multiplexed assay with only one optical channel is enabled. In practice, a nine-plex assay is designed to distinguish between variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even subtle variations of a single nucleotide can be simultaneously detected. Testing on 75 nasopharyngeal swab samples yields 100% sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection and 94% accuracy in variant discrimination.},

  abstract     = {The immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic cancer, characterized by low tumor-specific T cells and excessive fibrosis, limits the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here, three datasets and multi-immunofluorescence staining of tissue microarrays in pancreatic cancer indicate that mesothelin (MSLN) expression negatively correlates with cytotoxic T cells in tumor. Anti-MSLN antibody ( α MSLN) treatment of pancreatic cancer in vivo can significantly increase T cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the combination of α MSLN and neoantigen peptide vaccine identified from pancreatic cancer cell lines is demonstrated to be more effective in inducing neoantigen-specific T cell generation and infiltration at subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models for enhancing antitumor efficacy. Single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that the combined treatment significantly reduces the proportion of fibroblasts, improves the infiltration of IFN- γ + CD4 + and GZMK + CD8 + T cells, as well as reduces the interaction of antigen presentation-associated ligands and receptors between antigen-presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (apCAFs) and naive CD4 + T cells. The negative correlations between apCAFs and CD8 + T cells/IFN- γ + CD4 + T cells are further confirmed in human pancreatic cancer tissues. Overall, this study demonstrates that targeting MSLN can improve neoantigen vaccine induced immune efficacy by reducing apCAFs to interrupt the conversion of naive CD4 + T cells to Tregs, and therefore increase the infiltration of tumor-specific T cells.},

Targeting CD47 reduced tumor growth, suggesting improved cancer cell sensitization to the immune system post-ICP editing. The study positions LNPs as a robust tool for in vivo validation of ICPs as therapeutic targets in clinically relevant GBM models.

  abstract     = {Re-epithelialization constitutes a critical stage in the intricate process of wound healing, yet its mechanisms in the context of diabetic wounds remain elusive. In this study, the role of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) vis-à-vis the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of keratinocytes in diabetic wound re-epithelialization is investigated. The findings reveal an impediment in the MET process, rather than EMT, which significantly compromised re-epithelialization in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, Desmoplakin ( DSP ) gene expression, encoding a key desmosome protein, is down-regulated in diabetic rats. This down-regulation coincided with aberrant hypo-demethylation of the DSP promoter. The inhibition of DSP expression is linked to reduced occupancy of Ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET3) at the DSP promoter, consequently suppressing TET3-dependent DNA demethylation. Additionally, a novel lncRNA termed DSP-AS1is identified, which is antisense to DSP . Notably, DSP-AS1 expression is down-regulated in diabetic skin wounds, and it interacted with TET3, a DNA demethylase. Notably, DSP-AS1 is found to form R-loops, triple-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids, at the DSP promoter, facilitating TET3 localization to the DSP promoter. Collectively, the findings suggest that reduced R-loop formation by DSP-AS1 impairs DSP gene transcription by repressing TET3-mediated DNA demethylation. This disruption of the orchestrated re-epithelialization process contributes to refractory diabetic wound healing.},

  abstract     = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. UC treatments are limited by significant adverse effects associated with non-specific drug delivery, such as systematic inhibition of the host immune system. Endoscopic delivery of a synthetic hydrogel material with biocompatible gelation that can efficiently cover irregular tissue surfaces provides an effective approach for targeted drug delivery at the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. An ideal integration of synthetic material with intestinal epithelium entails an integrated and preferable chemically bonded interface between the hydrogel and mucosal surface. In this study, a photo-triggered coupling reaction is leveraged as the crosslinking platform to develop a mucosal-adhesive hydrogel, which is compatible with endoscope-directed drug delivery for UC treatment. The results demonstrated superior spatiotemporal specificity and drug pharmacokinetics with this delivery system in vivo. Delivery of different drugs with the hydrogel leads to greatly enhanced therapeutic efficacy and significantly reduced systemic drug exposure with rat colitis models. The study presents a strategy for targeted and persistent drug delivery for UC treatment.},

  abstract     = {The patch clamp technique is a fundamental tool for investigating ion channel dynamics and electrophysiological properties. This study proposes the first artificial intelligence framework for characterizing multiple ion channel kinetics of whole-cell recordings. The framework integrates machine learning for anomaly detection and deep learning for multi-class classification. The anomaly detection excludes recordings that are incompatible with ion channel behavior. The multi-class classification combined a 1D convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention mechanism to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of the recordings. The framework achieves an accuracy of 97.58% in classifying 124 test datasets into six categories based on ion channel kinetics. The utility of the novel framework is demonstrated in two applications: Alzheimer&#39;s disease drug screening and nanomatrix-induced neuronal differentiation. In drug screening, the framework illustrates the inhibitory effects of memantine on endogenous channels, and antagonistic interactions among potassium, magnesium, and calcium ion channels. For nanomatrix-induced differentiation, the classifier indicates the effects of differentiation conditions on sodium and potassium channels associated with action potentials, validating the functional properties of differentiated neurons for Parkinson&#39;s disease treatment. The proposed framework is promising for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of ion channel kinetics analysis in electrophysiological research.},

  abstract     = {Current understanding of micropapillary (MP)-subtype lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains confined to biological activities and genomic landscapes. Unraveling the major regulatory programs underlying MP patterned malignancy offers opportunities to identify more feasible therapeutic targets for patients with MP LUAD. This study shows that patients with MP subtype LUAD have aberrant activation of the MYC pathway compared to patients with other subtypes. In vitro and xenograft mouse model studies reveal that MP pattern in malignancy cannot be solely due to aberrant MYC expression but requires the involvement of M2-like macrophages. Excessively expressed MYC leads to the accumulation of M2-like macrophages from the bone marrow, which secretes TGFβ, to induce the expression of FOSL2 in tumor cells, thereby remodeling chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of MP-pattern genes to promote the MYC-mediated de novo transcriptional regulation of these genes. Additionally, the MP-pattern in malignancy can be effectively alleviated by disrupting the TGFβ-FOSL2 axis. These findings reveal new functions for the M2-like macrophage-TGFβ-FOSL2 axis in MYC-overexpressing MP-subtype LUAD, identifying targetable vulnerabilities in this pathway.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, targeting programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), has exhibited amazing clinical outcomes in various types of cancers. However, only a small portion of patients benefit from ICB therapy, indicating that the mechanism underlying immune checkpoint is still unclear. Here, it is reported that motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1), a homeobox domain-containing transcription factor, contributes to the tumor immune escape. MNX1 increases PD-L1 expression in cancer cells by stabilizing PD-L1 mRNA rather than activating transcription. Mechanistically, MNX1 exists in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and interacts with Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), a multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein, to enhance the binding of YBX1 to PD-L1 mRNA. MNX1 ablation activates cytotoxic T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and sensitizes CTLA-4 blockade therapy. Moreover, MNX1 also facilitates tumor progression in an immune-independent manner in cancer cells. In addition, MNX1 is upregulated by its adjacent long non-coding RNA MNX1-AS1 via HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (HERC2). Together, these results reveal MNX1 as a novel immune checkpoint regulator with promising therapeutic potential.},

Within this cavity, second coordination sphere functionalities are precisely positioned to optimize the rate, selectivity, and energy cost of catalytic reactions. Inspired by this strategy, an artificial distal pocket defined by a preorganized 3D strap is introduced on an iron-porphyrin catalyst ( sc-Fe ) for the CO 2 -to-CO electrocatalytic reduction. Combined electrochemical, kinetic, and computational studies demonstrate that the adequate positioning of a carboxylate/carboxylic group acting in synergy with a trapped water molecule within this distal pocket remarkably enhances the reaction turnover frequency (TOF) by four orders of magnitude compared to the perfluorinated iron-tetraphenylporphyrin catalyst ( F 20 Fe ) operating at a similar low overpotential. A proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is found to be the key process responsible for the unexpected protonation of the coordinating carboxylate, which, upon CO 2 insertion, shifts from the first to the second coordination sphere to play a possible secondary role as a proton relay.},

  abstract     = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role in wound healing. They act as crucial signaling molecules and antimicrobial agents when present at moderate levels. However, excessive levels of ROS can hinder the healing process for individuals with diabetes. As a result, targeting ROS levels to maintain redox balance has become a promising strategy for improving wound recovery. Currently, no biomaterials have been reported to simultaneously up-regulate and down-regulate ROS to achieve broad-spectrum antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Inspired by the site-dependent effect of nanomaterials, a micron-sized ferroferric oxide (Fe 3 O 4 )/MXene (FM) heterojunction is synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The FM heterojunction could scavenge extracellular ROS by activating catalase (CAT)-like and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like nanozyme activities. Meanwhile, FM heterojunction could release ferric ions and ferrous ions by defect engineering to induce bacterial ferroptosis, up-regulating intercellular ROS, and lipid peroxidation. For applications in vivo, FM heterojunction is incorporated into the tips of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based microneedle (termed as GFM microneedle) using a two-step casting technique. The results showed that GFM microneedle combined with photothermal therapy could improve S. aureus -infected skin regeneration in diabetic rats. The effectiveness and safety of GFM microneedle are not less favorable than that of a commercial wound dressing. This study provides a proof-of-concept for heterojunction-mediated regenerative medicine via a site-dependent ROS-targeting strategy.},

Diverse reducing agents for Li supplements, such as quinone molecules, have been considered to homogenize the Li distribution in the cathode materials obtained after cycling; however, the detailed reaction mechanism is still unknown. Herein, the ideal electrochemical potential factor and reaction mechanism of the redox mediator 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone (DTBQ) for the chemical relithiation of high-Ni-layered cathodes are elucidated. Here, 100% efficiency of DTBQ-assisted chemical relithiation is achieved by adjusting the direct immersion time of Li-deficient cathode electrodes. The reversible reaction features of the physical and chemical structures of both the regenerated cathodes and the DTBQ molecules are investigated using advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations. These findings emphasize the potential of redox-mediator-assisted chemical relithiation for realizing direct recycling processes and offer a facile and sustainable solution for battery recycling.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous clusters are gaining prominence as prospective hosts for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs), but their efficacy is still affected by atomic coordination. Optimization of ion storage and charge transport can be achieved through high coordination and bimetallic configurations. Herein, high-coordination amorphous P 6 -Nb-W-P 5 (Nb/W-P) clusters are skillfully tailored by bridging Nb into the second shell of W in the W-P 5 configuration, nested in situ in conductive and stable N, P co-doped carbon nanospheres (Nb/W-P@NPC). Such clusters with high atom utilization can offer profuse Na + storage sites due to their high coordination. As an electron donor, Nb-bridging can subtly modify the electronic structure of clusters, and broaden the hybridization of d-p orbitals, thus improving charge transfer efficiency and fostering diversified active sites. Compared with the low-coordinated W-P L @NPC and the high-coordinated W-P@NPC, the reversible capacity of Nb/W-P@NPC upgrades to 556.3 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , alongside exceptional cycling stability at high rates. When integrated into SIHCs, the high energy density and high-power output (223.6 and 9800 W kg −1 ) are achieved. By systematically exploring the effect of high coordination and bimetallic design on the storage efficacies of amorphous clusters, this study has greatly advanced the development of SIHC technologies.},

Herein, by employing high-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), five rock chip samples from the CE-5 lunar soil are characterized in-depth, which reveal micro-morphological and compositional features. From the elemental/molecular ion distribution images, minerals such as pyroxene, ilmenite, feldspar, K-rich glass, silica, and silicate minerals are identified, along with their occurrence states and distribution results. More importantly, uncommon vesicle-like patterns are probed via TOF-SIMS, which may not be captured by conventional electron microscopy. The possible origins of vesicles are also proposed.

However, the rice interactome has barely been studied due to the lack of massive, reliable, and cost-effective methodologies. Here, the development of a barcode-indexed PCR coupled with HiFi long-read sequencing pipeline (BIP-seq) is reported for high throughput Protein Protein Interaction (PPI)identification. BIP-seq is essentially built on the integration of library versus library Y2H mating strategy to facilitate the efficient acquisition of random PPI colonies, semi-mechanized dual barcode-indexed yeast colony PCR for the large-scale indexed amplification of bait and prey cDNAs, and massive pac-bio sequencing of PCR amplicon pools. It is demonstrated that BIP-seq could map over 15 000 high-confidence (≈62.5% could be verified by Bimolecular fluorescence Complementation (BiFC)) rice PPIs within 2 months, outperforming the other reported methods. In addition, the obtained 23 032 rice PPIs, including 22,665 newly identified PPIs, greatly expanded the current rice PPI dataset, provided a comprehensive overview of the rice PPIs networks, and could be a valuable asset in facilitating functional genomics research in rice.},

To tackle energy and environmental challenges, the exploration of innovative green and sustainable technologies for NH 3 synthesis is imperative. Rapid advances in electrochemical technology have created fresh prospects for researchers in the realm of environmentally friendly NH 3 synthesis. Nevertheless, the intricate intermediate products and sluggish kinetics in the reactions impede the progress of green electrochemical NH 3 synthesis (EAS) technologies.

  abstract     = {Pulmonary hypertension (PH) increases the mortality of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). There are no curative therapies for this disease. Lung endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme of the carnitine shuttle system, is reduced in a rodent model of BPD. It is unknown whether endothelial Cpt1a reduction causes pulmonary vascular (PV) remodeling. The latter can be the result of endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Here, endothelial cell (EC)-specific Cpt1a KO and WT mice (&lt;12 h old) are exposed to hyperoxia (70% O 2 ) for 14 days and allow them to recover in normoxia until postnatal day 28. Hyperoxia causes PH, which is aggravated in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Upregulating endothelial Cpt1a expression inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Hyperoxia causes lung EndoMT, detected by immunofluorescence, scRNA-sequencing, and EC lineage tracing, which is further increased in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Blocking EndoMT inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Male mice under the same high oxygen conditions develop a higher degree of PH than females, which is associated with reduced endothelial Cpt1a expression. Conclusively, neonatal hyperoxia causes PH by decreasing endothelial Cpt1a expression and upregulating EndoMT. This provides a valuable strategy for developing targeted therapies by upregulating endothelial Cpt1a levels or inhibiting EndoMT to treat BPD-associated PH.},

  abstract     = {Stem cell implantation holds promise for enhancing bone repair, but risks of pathogen transmission and malignant cell transformation should not be ignored. Compared to stem cell implantation, recruitment of endogenous stem cells to injured sites is more critical for in situ bone regeneration. In this study, based on the acidic microenvironment of bone injury, an HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel with a dual-control intelligent switch function is developed by incorporating stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1α), arginine carbon dots (Arg-CDs), and calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) into the oxidized hyaluronic acid/gelatin methacryloyl (HG) hydrogel. The acidic microenvironment triggers the first switch (Schiff base bond is broken between HG-AA 1:1 and SDF-1α) of HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel to continuously release SDF-1α. Compared to the neutral (pH 7.4) media, the cumulative release of SDF-1α in acidic (pH 5.5) media is ≈2.5 times higher, which enhances the migration and recruitment of endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The recruited MSCs immediately initiate the second switch and metabolize Arg-CDs into the bioactive nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of Ca 2+ , activating NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the engineered HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel shows promising potential to achieve “coupling osteogenesis and angiogenesis” for bone regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-performance dielectric materials remains a significant challenge due to the inherent trade-offs between high energy storage density and low energy loss. A central difficulty lies in identifying a suitable dipolar unit that can enhance the polarity and dielectric constant of the material while effectively suppressing the high energy losses associated with polarization relaxation, charge injection, and conduction. To address this, a novel strategy is proposed that introduces electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents on the benzene ring of polystyrene-based polymers, creating bulky dipole groups that are resistant to reorientation under an electric field. This approach mitigates relaxation losses associated with dipole reorientation and manipulates the band structure via substituent modification to suppress conduction losses. Additionally, the deformation of the π -electron cloud under an electric field enhances the dielectric constant and energy storage density. Ultimately, the optimized chlorostyrene-methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymer exhibits an 85% discharge efficiency and an energy storage density of 18.3 J cm − 3 , nearly three times that of styrene-based copolymers under the same conditions. This study introduces a new approach for designing high-energy density, low-loss polymer dielectric materials by precisely controlling electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects to modulate the distribution of π -conjugated electron clouds.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen usually exists in the form of diatomic molecules at ambient conditions. At high pressure, it undergoes a series of phase transitions from diatomic O 2 to O 8 cluster and ultimately dissociates into a polymeric O 4 spiral chain structure. Intriguingly, the commonly found cyclic hexameric molecules in other group VIA elements (e.g., S 6 and Se 6 ) are never reported in the bulk oxygen. Through extensive computational crystal structure search, herein it is reported that such hexameric O 6 molecules can exist in a stable compound HeO 3 above 1.9 TPa. The first-principles calculations reveal that, during the reaction by mixing oxygen with helium, the insertion of helium does not only expand the lattice volume, but also relieves the electron lone pair repulsion among diatomic O 2 , and thus significantly promoting the formation of cyclic O 6 molecules. Furthermore, the transition pathway calculations demonstrate that molecular O 2 is dissociated first, and then six oxygen atoms form a polymeric digital 2-shaped intermediate O 6 . Subsequently, each unstable intermediate O 6 decomposes into two intermedia O 3 trimers. Finally, O 3 trimers transform into cyclic O 6 molecules at high pressure. This study expands the known molecular forms of oxygen and suggests a route to the synthesis of intriguing cyclic O 6 molecules.},

However, the inherent characteristics of metal droplets, including high surface tension, elevated viscosity, and extreme temperatures, pose significant challenges for wetting and spreading on nonwetting substrates. Herein, this work proposes a strategy that employs a two-dimensional (2D) orthogonal ultrasonic field to construct a vibration deposition substrate with radial vibration amplitude gradient, thereby enhancing the wettability and adhesive strength of impacting metal droplets ejected by a piezoelectric micro-jet device. First, a 2D ultrasonic vibration device is designed based on the combination of longitudinal vibration modes. Additionally, oblique and circular vibration trajectories are synthesized. The vibration amplitude distributions and trajectories of the deposition substrate are verified utilizing the finite element method. Subsequently, the experimental results demonstrate that the contact angle is decreased by 24.7%, the spreading diameter is increased by 10.3%, and the adhesive strength is enhanced by 5.4 times compared to deposition on a static substrate. The 2D ultrasonic field facilitates the transition of metal droplets from a non-wetting state to a wetting state on the nonwetting substrate, which highlights the versatility and adaptability of ultrasonic strategy for expanding the applications of metal droplets.},

  abstract     = {The efficacy of cancer immunotherapy is significantly influenced by the heterogeneity of individual tumors and immune responses. To investigate this phenomenon, a microfluidic platform is constructed for profiling immune-cancer cell interactions at the single-cell proteomics level for the first time. Based on the platform, a comprehensive workflow is proposed for achieving accurate single-cell pairing of an immune cell and a cancer cell with low cell damage and high success rate up to 95%, cell pair co-culture, and real-time microscopic monitoring of the cell-pair interactions, cell pair retrieval, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of singe cell pairs, and decoupling of the proteomic information for each cell within the cell pair with the stable-isotope labeling method. With the workflow, the interactions of single natural killer (NK) cells and single K562 tumor cells are investigated based on real-time images and single cell-pair proteomics. Notably, an identification depth of over 1000 protein groups in a single cell-pair is achieved, leading to the discovery of sub-clusters of NK cells with different functions and the identification of important biomarkers for cancer treatments. This demonstrates the unique capability of the present platform in providing substantial and comprehensive datasets for profiling immune-cancer cell interactions, discovering heterogeneous immune responses, and predicting biomarkers in the study of cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Graves&#39; disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder with a high incidence rate, particularly affecting women of reproductive age. Current treatment modalities for GD carry significant disadvantages, especially for pregnant or nursing women. As a novel extracorporeal therapeutic technique, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) shows great promise for treating GD; however, its low treatment efficacy impedes clinical application. In this study, a thyroid-targeted nano-bomb system (PD-PLGA@Si-Ab/PDA-I, PSAPI) is developed to enhance HIFU efficacy and improve therapeutic outcomes for GD. The core structure of PSAPI encapsulates a phase-transition material, perfluorohexane, and the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac within a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and silica shell. A polydopamine coating enhances biocompatibility, while iodine loading and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies grafting ensure targeted delivery to the thyroid. Robust in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that PSAPI is highly biocompatible, accumulates in the thyroid within 24 h after administration, and significantly potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of HIFU, resulting in markedly reduced inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a cellular defense mechanism activated in PSAPI-treated cells following HIFU irradiation, highlighting potential molecular targets for the future development of HIFU-sensitizing agents. The biocompatible PSAPI nano-bomb developed in this study holds great transformative potential, addressing critical gaps in current therapeutic practices for GD.},

The peak aggregation of nanoprobes in the MIRI region is monitored by near-infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. The maximal fluorescence and photoacoustic signals of the HI@PSeP-IMTP group in the MIRI region rise ≈32% and 40% respectively compared with that of HI@PSeP group. Moreover, HI@PSeP-IMTP effectively mitigates MIRI due to a synergistic integration of diselenide bonds and hesperadin, which can eliminate ROS and suppress cardiac inflammation. Specifically, the expression levels of p-CaMKII, p-IκBα, and p65 in the MIRI region in the HI@PSeP-IMTP group demonstrate a reduction of 30%, 46%, and 42% respectively compared to that of the PBS group.

These compounds crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) space group, R 32, and are composed of distorted octahedral [CdX 3 F 3 ] (X═Cl or Br) units, which extend into a 3D framework. Remarkably, both compounds demonstrate strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiencies—3.0 and 8.0 times that of KH 2 PO 4 for the Cl- and Br-containing analogs, respectively—with phase-matching behavior observed. The SHG efficiency is attributed to the highly distorted coordination environment of the polarizable d 10 Cd 2+ ions, with (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 benefiting further from Br&#39;s greater polarizability. Furthermore, these compounds exhibit wide bandgaps exceeding 4.2 eV, making them the first d 10 metal mixed halide systems incorporating fluoride that are suitable for UV NLO applications. With UV absorption cut-off edges as short as 203 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Cl 3 F 3 and 243 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 , these materials represent a significant advancement in the development of UV-transparent NLO materials.

Although various methods exist to adjust the polarization-sensitive photocurrent, a universal and effective approach for continuous control of MHPs’ optoelectronic and polarized properties is lacking. A universal strategy to electrically modulate the polarization ratio (PR) of self-powered polarized PDs using the ferro-pyro-phototronic effect (FPPE) in 2D perovskites is presented. By varying the amplitude and direction of ferroelectric polarization voltage, the built-in electric field in the heterojunction can be modulated, allowing for controllable PR regulation and adjustable polarization characteristics. Moreover, the polarized pyroelectric photoresponses are realized, significantly enhancing the responsivity, response speed of the polarized PDs. Both the pyroelectric currents and photocurrents exhibit obvious polarization characteristics. This method&#39;s versatility is demonstrated by creating three additional quasi-2D MHP ferroelectric-based polarized-sensitive PDs. A proof-of-concept for encrypted optical communication is achieved using the UV-sensitive PDs as light-sensing units. These findings highlight FPPE&#39;s potential to enhance ferroelectric device polarization control, enabling high-performance and self-powered polarization photodetection.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal batteries are considered the holy grail for next-generation high-energy systems. However, lithium anode faces poor reversibility, unsatisfying cyclability and rate capability due to its uncontrollable plating/stripping behavior. While galvanostatic conditions are extensively studied, the behavior under more realistic application scenarios with variable inputs are less explored. Here, an in situ imaging platform using in-plane microdevice configurations is developed to effectively investigate Li plating/stripping behavior under dynamic conditions. This platform offers high detectivity for analyzing the nuclei size, density, distribution, and growth location, rate, and mode. It is for the first time revealed that nuclei density and growth locations remain constant and are solely determined by the initial nucleation overpotentials during dynamic plating. A transition in growth modes from uniform granular growth to tip-induced dendrite growth, and finally to directional growth among the dendrites is also observed. Guided by these findings, a dynamic plating protocol is proposed, which can greatly improve the Li reversibility and cycling stability. This work not only provides a novel approach to visualize the evolution of key nucleation and growth parameters, especially under variable inputs, but also offers valuable guidance for the future industrialization of metal batteries and the rational design of charging facilities.},

  abstract     = {The human visual nervous system excels at recognizing and processing external stimuli, essential for various physiological functions. Biomimetic visual systems leverage biological synapse properties to improve memory encoding and perception. Optoelectronic devices mimicking these synapses can enhance wearable electronics, with layered heterojunction materials being ideal materials for optoelectronic synapses due to their tunable properties and biocompatibility. However, conventional synthesis methods are complex and environmentally harmful, leading to issues such as poor stability and low charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a more efficient, convenient, and eco-friendly method for preparing layered heterojunction materials. Here, a one-step ultrasonic method is employed to mix fullerene (C60) with graphene oxide (GO), yielding a homogeneous layered heterojunction composite film via self-assembly. The biomimetic optoelectronic synapse based on this film achieves 97.3% accuracy in dynamic visual recognition tasks and exhibits capabilities such as synaptic plasticity. Experiments utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier–transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms stable π-π interactions between GO and C60, facilitating electron transfer and prolonging carrier recombination times.

  abstract     = {Recipients often suffer from hyperlactatemia during liver transplantation (LT), but whether hyperlactatemia exacerbates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after donor liver implantation remains unclear. Here, the role of hyperlactatemia in hepatic IRI is explored. In this work, hyperlactatemia is found to exacerbate ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Lactate-primed lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8) is determined to directly lactylate mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) at Lys100 and augments PCK2 kinase activity. By using gene-edited mice, evidence indicating that PCK2 exacerbates hepatic ferroptosis during IRI is generated. Mechanistically, PCK2 lactylate at Lys100 acts as a critical inducer of ferroptosis during IRI by competitively inhibiting the Parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (OXSM), thereby leading to metabolic remodeling of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) and the potentiation of oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. More importantly, targeting PCK2 is demonstrated to markedly ameliorate hyperlactatemia-mediated ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Collectively, the findings support the use of therapeutics targeting PCK2 to suppress hepatic ferroptosis and IRI in patients with hyperlactatemia during LT.},

Compared to the reference molecule C8-IT4F, which lacks outer side chains, SC8-IT4F displays notable differences in molecule geometry (as shown by simulations), thermal behavior, single-crystal packing, and film morphology. Blend films of SC8-IT4F and the polymer donor PM6 exhibit larger carrier mobilities, longer carrier lifetimes, and reduced recombination compared to C8-IT4F, resulting in improved device performance. Binary photovoltaic devices based on the PM6:SC8-IT4F films reveal an optimal efficiency over 15%, which is one of the best values for non-Y type small molecule acceptors (SMAs). The resultant devices also show better thermal and operational stability than the control PM6:L8-BO devices. SC8-IT4F and its blend exhibit a higher relative degree of crystallinity and π coherence length, compared to C8-IT4F samples, beneficial for charge transport and device performance.

Traditional topical ocular drug delivery methods often fail to effectively reach the meibomian glands (MGs). To address this, the study has developed a soluble microneedles (MN) patch comprising poly(vinyl alcohol), cyclodextrin modified polyacrylic acid, and new indocyanine green. This innovative MN patch facilitates the transdermal release of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonists, such as rosiglitazone in response to near-infrared ray induced temperature changes. By safely optimizing temperature, the patch effectively liquefied meibum lips, thereby alleviating duct obstruction while releasing the drug. MN patches exhibit sufficient mechanical strength for effective skin penetration, and its biosafety for eyelid application has been rigorously assessed in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic efficiency of rosiglitazone loaded MN (ROSI-MN) treatment for MGD is evaluated in high-fat mice. After three months of treatments, ROSI-MN administration significantly alleviated MGD clinical manifestations, including ocular surface damage, lipid deposits, glandular hypertrophy, and inflammatory infiltration, ultimately improving the microstructure and biofunction of MGs. In conclusion, the soluble MN patches hold promise as an effective drug delivery strategy for treating ocular surface diseases beyond MGD.},

Numerous attempts have been made to develop agrochemicals that inhibit biofilms, however, their ineffective foliar deposition and difficulty in removing mature biofilms remain major challenges. Herein, multifunctional three-component supramolecular nano-biscuits (NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD) are successfully engineered via ordered self-assembly between two macrocycles [cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), β -cyclodextrin ( β -CD)] and ( R )-2-naphthol-based bis-imidazolium bromide salt (NI6R). This macrocycles-involved bactericidal material combines many advantages. 1) Alleviate the off-target movement of droplets on hydrophobic blade surfaces. 2) Enhance the biofilm-disrupting ability. At a low-dose of 4.44 µg mL −1 , the inhibition rate of biofilm formation reached 78.3%. At 35.5 µg mL −1 , the potency to remove mature biofilms reached 77.6%. 3) Efficiently hinder bacterial reproduction, swimming, extracellular polysaccharide production, extracellular enzyme secretion, and virulence to plants. These superior characteristics are undoubtedly transmitted to the in vivo control effect. At 200 µg mL −1 , this smart material exhibits superior control efficiencies of 49.6%/65.0%/85.4% against three kinds of bacterial diseases (rice leaf blight, citrus canker, and kiwifruit canker), respectively, surpassing the commercial bactericide—thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (33.6%/41.5%/43.2%) and NI6R (40.3%/51.2%/71.2%). Furthermore, NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD is biosafe to non-target organisms. This study is instructive for constructing multifunctional agrochemicals in sustainable crop protection.},

Multiple conductance states are achieved in α-In 2 Se 3 -based FeSFETs by controlling the ferroelectric polarization. The on/off current ratio (I on /I off ) is ≈10 5 with a dark current of ≈10 −11 A by applying a single positive gate voltage pulse. Moreover, the device shows excellent endurance and retention performance. In a further step, the carrier transports and corresponding physics mechanism in various polarization states are studied by using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and optoelectronic measurements. Finally, the α-In 2 Se 3 -based FETs can be trained. It can recognize handwritten digit images from MNIST dataset with a successful recognition accuracy of ≈95.5%. This work provides a new design idea and theoretical support for advanced optoelectronic devices in the field of in-memory sensing and computing.},

Yet, little is known about the interactions between NPs and proteins, and its role in enhanced depth of serum proteomics. Herein, a series of protein spike-in experiments are conducted to systematically investigate protein depletion and enrichment during NPC formation. Proteomic depth is serum concentration-dependent, and NPC exhibits powerful tolerance to ultra-high abundant proteins. In addition, protein-protein interactions (PPI), especially those involving albumin, play a pivotal role in promoting proteomic depth. Furthermore, a triple-protein assay is established to interrogate the relationship between protein binding affinity and concentration. NPC formation is a product of balancing binding affinity, concentration, and PPI. Overall, this study elucidates how NPs achieve protein depletion and enrichment for enhanced serum proteomic depth to gain a better understanding of NPC as an essential tool of proteome profiling.},

  abstract     = {Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis worldwide. The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC-infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA-seq and SMART-seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z-DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1-knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1-pRIP3-pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.},

In the presence of the modulation (near-infrared) light, the Fermi level of the graphene channel shifts, allowing for the tuning of the visible light response speed as well as achieving a broad responsivity range from negative (-3376 A/W) to positive (3584 A/W) response. Based on this, logical operations are performed by adjusting the power of the modulation light superimposed with the signal light. This facilitates more covert, all-optical, high-speed encrypted communication. The ultrahigh tunability and nearly symmetric positive and negative photoconductivity of all-optical modulation photodetectors significantly enhance the computational capacity of neuromorphic hardware. The proposed device exhibits substantial advantages in applications requiring high fault tolerance for integrated sensing-computing （ISC） and high-resolution motion object recognition, providing insights for the development of next-generation high-bandwidth, low-power-consumption ISC devices.},

However, predicting the epigenetic consequences of non-coding mutations at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. Existing tools have limited prediction capacity and struggle to capture dynamic, cell-type-specific regulatory changes that are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Here, Methven, a deep learning framework designed is presented to predict the effects of non-coding mutations on DNA methylation at single-cell resolution. Methven integrates DNA sequence with single-cell ATAC-seq data and models SNP-CpG interactions over 100 kbp genomic distances. By using a divide-and-conquer approach, Methven accurately predicts both short- and long-range regulatory interactions and leverages the pre-trained DNA language model for enhanced precision in classification and regression tasks. Methven outperforms existing methods and demonstrates robust generalizability to monocyte datasets. Importantly, it identifies CpG sites associated with rheumatoid arthritis, revealing key pathways involved in immune regulation and disease progression. Methven&#39;s ability to detect progressive epigenetic changes provides crucial insights into gene regulation in complex diseases. These findings demonstrate Methven&#39;s potential as a powerful tool for basic research and clinical applications, advancing this understanding of non-coding mutations and their role in disease, while offering new opportunities for personalized medicine.},

Phytomelatonin&#39;s signal transduction is discovered in wound-induced root formation, identifying SlPMTR1/2 as phytomelatonin receptors, transmitting signals to SHOOT BORNE ROOTLESS 1 (SlSBRL1), a key regulator of wound-induced root regeneration, via the G protein α subunit 1 (SlGPA1). Additionally, SlPMTR1/2 is activated by JA, and targeted by SlMYC2.

Nevertheless, achieving full-polarization, arbitrary amplitude, and phase modulation of radiation scattering remains a challenge. In this paper, a strategy that realizes space-time coding of radiation scattering within the same frequency band, which enables the simultaneous and independent modulation of amplitude and phase, is proposed. To address the limitations of the high sideband levels (SBLs) of conventional space-time-coding metasurfaces, a strategy comprising nonuniform modulation periods and stochastic coding is proposed. Consequently, beam scanning with ultra-low sidelobe levels (SLLs) and suppressed SBLs is achieved in the radiation mode (RM). In scattering mode (SM), in-band low scattering characteristics are achieved within the same operating frequency band as RM. A prototype of a space-time-coding radiation-scattering metasurface (STCRSM) is fabricated and the aforementioned functionalities are validated by measurements. Furthermore, the proposed strategy does not necessitate the utilization of optimization algorithms and exhibits low SLLs and low SBLs, which will make it flourish in RF stealth applications, such as covert communication systems.},

Here, the micro size CsPbCl 3 perovskite crystals (MCs) are reported with uniform Mn 2+ ions doping by self-assembly of Mn 2+ ions doped CsPbCl 3 perovskite NCs. The electron–phonon coupling strength is enhanced in the perovskite self-assembled CsPbCl 3 MCs, which remarkably accelerates the PL decay of Mn 2+ ions in room temperature. Furthermore, the phonon-involved PL emission splits to two peaks at low temperature of 80 K, due to the phonon emission and absorption-induced energy exchange for exciton recombination in Mn 2+ ions. These findings not only demonstrate a novel material system but also introduce a new theoretical framework for phonon-modulated PL manipulation in Mn 2+ -doped perovskite materials.},

Despite their widespread in nature, the integration into engineered materials is limited by the lack of study on their complex architectures. This study addresses the challenge by investigating the structure-property relationships and stability of biomimetic 3D-DFNS using large datasets generated through procedural modeling, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning. Based on these datasets, a network deep reinforcement learning (N-DRL) framework is developed to optimize its stability, effectively balancing weight reduction with the maintenance of structural integrity. The results reveal a pronounced correlation between the total fiber length in 3D-DFNS and its mechanical properties, where longer fibers enhance stress distribution and stability. Additionally, fiber orientation is also considered as a potential factor influencing stress growth values. Furthermore, the N-DRL model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional approaches in optimizing network stability while minimizing mass and computational cost. Structural integrity is significantly improved through the addition of triple junctions and the reduction of higher-order nodes.

Therefore, this study employs network toxicology and network pharmacology to comprehensively analyze the hepatotoxic mechanism of As and the hepatoprotective mechanism of LA, and further verifies the mechanisms of peroxisomal β-oxidation and lipophagy in the process. The network analysis results show that As induces liver damage mainly through autophagy, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress, whereas LA exerts its hepatoprotective properties mainly by regulating lipid metabolism. Further verifications find that As inhibits SIRT1 expression, activates the P53 and Notch pathways, damages mitochondria, inhibits peroxisomal β-oxidation, increases lipid accumulation, and enhances lipophagy in the liver, while LA intervention alleviates As-induced lipid accumulation and enhances lipophagy by targeting SIRT1, ameliorating mitochondrial damage, enhancing peroxisomal β-oxidation, thereby alleviating As-induced liver damage.

In addition to natural extraction, hispidin can be obtained by chemical or enzymatic synthesis. In this study, the identification and characterization of an undescribed enzyme, PheG, from Phellinus igniarius ( P. igniarius ), which catalyzes the construction of a key C─C bond in the enzymatic synthesis of hispidin are reported. It is demonstrated in vitro that PheG generates hispidin by catalyzing C─C bond formation in the aldol condensation reaction. Based on these results, a plausible pathway for hispidin biosynthesis is proposed by utilizing the primary triacetic acid lactone (TAL, 2 ) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde ( 3 ). The mechanisms for the aldol condensation reaction of PheG are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations, density functional theory, and site-specific mutations. The locations of the key amino acid residues that catalyze the conversion of substrates 2 and 3 to hispidin at the active site of PheG-1 are identified.

Pq3-O-UGT2, an important UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT), catalyzes the production of Ginsenoside Rg3 and Rd by extending the glycan chain of Ginsenoside Rh2 and F2, respectively, with higher selectivity for F2. However, the mechanism underlying its substrate recognition remains unclear. In this study, the crystal structures of Pq3-O-UGT2 in complex with its acceptor substrates are solved. The structures revealed a Nα5-oriented acceptor binding pocket in Pq3-O-UGT2, shaped by the unique conformation of the Nα5-Nα6 linker. Hydrophobic interactions play a pivotal role in the recognition of both Rh2 and F2, while hydrogen bonds specifically aid in F2 recognition due to its additional glucose moiety. The hydrophobic nature of the acceptor binding pocket also enables Pq3-O-UGT2 to recognize flavonoids. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the substrate recognition mechanisms of ginsenoside UGTs, advancing the understanding of their function and specificity.},

  abstract     = {Emerging research has highlighted the significant role of the gut microbiota in atherosclerosis (AS), with microbiota-targeted interventions offering promising therapeutic potential. A central component of this process is gut-derived metabolites, which play a crucial role in mediating the distal functioning of the microbiota. In this study, a comprehensive microbiome-metabolite analysis using fecal and serum samples from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and volunteers with risk factors for coronary heart disease and culture histology is performed, and identified the core strain Bacteroides ovatus ( B. ovatus ). Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments further demonstrated that the gut microbiota significantly influences AS progression, with B. ovatus alone exerting effects comparable to volunteer feces from volunteers. Notably, B. ovatus alleviated AS primarily by restoring the intestinal barrier and enhancing bile acid metabolism, particularly through the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a tryptophan-derived metabolite. IAA inhibited the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in M1 macrophages, promoted M2 macrophage polarisation, and restored the M1/M2 polarisation balance, ultimately reducing aortic inflammation. These findings clarify the mechanistic interplay between the gut microbiota and AS, providing the first evidence that B. ovatus , a second-generation probiotic, can improve bile acid metabolism and reduce inflammation, offering a theoretical foundation for future AS therapeutic applications involving this strain.},

Additionally, mitochondrial proteins have not previously been reported to be secreted into hosts by pathogens. Here, it is found that the Meloidogyne javanica elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) (MjEF-Tu) located in the nematode mitochondria is up-regulated and secreted into the host plant during nematode parasitism. MjEF-Tu interacts with the PRR Arabidopsis thaliana EF-Tu receptor (AtEFR), triggering the plant hallmark defence responses mediated by AtEFR. An 18-aa sequence (Nelf18) in the N terminus of the nematode EF-Tu contributes to the immunogenic activity. M. javanica water extract and mitochondrial extract also induce plant immunity sensed by AtEFR, owing to the presence of MjEF-Tu. In addition, Nelf18 enhances plant resistance to nematode, virus, and bacterial infections depending on AtEFR. These findings first demonstrate that mitochondrial proteins from pathogens can be secreted into hosts and function as a cross-kingdom signal and identified the first plant-parasitic animal-derived proteinaceous PAMP/PRR pair, providing novel insights into host-pathogen interactions.},

Targeting ferroptosis regulation presents a promising therapeutic strategy for OA; however, current research primarily focuses on single targets associated with ferroptosis. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanoparticle is developed by linking deferasirox (DEF) and pterostilbene (PTE) with thioketal and incorporating cerium ions (Ce), creating Ce@D&amp;P nanoparticles (NPs), which offer multitarget regulation of ferroptosis. The characteristics of Ce@D&amp;P NPs are evaluated and their therapeutic effects on IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes are verified. Results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs reduce ROS levels, mitigate inflammation, chelate iron to inhibit ferroptosis, and balance extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses suggest that Ce@D&amp;P NPs exerted their effects by regulating oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in chondrocytes. To better treat destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA in mice, Ce@D&amp;P NPs via intra-articular injection are delivered. The results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs alleviate cartilage matrix damage and slow OA progression. Overall, the findings indicate that Ce@D&amp;P NPs represent a promising multitarget drug delivery system, and Ce@D&amp;P NPs may be an effective strategy for OA treatment.},

Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, utilizing their physical properties to achieve controllable cell-layer transport will be of fundamental importance. In this study, the ratchet effect is harnessed to control the collective motion of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro. NPCs travel back-and-forth and do not specify head or tail, and therefore regarded as nematics alike liquid crystals. Ratchet and splay-shaped confinements are crafted to modulate collective cell dynamics in dense environments, while jamming is not explicitly spotted. The adaptation of an agent-based simulation further revealed how the ratchet&#39;s asymmetry and active forces from nematic order synergistically reinforce the directional cell flow. These findings provide insights into topotaxis in cell populations when restricted to crowded 2D ratchets and the mechanisms that regulate collective behavior of the cells.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease and the leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Recent studies have shown that stroke development and prognosis are closely related to abnormal tryptophan metabolism. Here, significant downregulation of 3-hydroxy-kynurenamine (3-HKA) in stroke patients and animal models is identified. Supplementation with 3-HKA improved long-term neurological recovery, reduced infarct volume, and increased ipsilateral cerebral blood flow after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis, functional blood vessel formation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) repair. Moreover, 3-HKA inhibited A1-like (neurotoxic) astrocyte activation but promoted A2-like (neuroprotective) astrocyte polarization. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-HKA inhibited AIM2 inflammasome activation after stroke, and co-labeling studies indicated that AIM2 expression typically increased in astrocytes at 7 and 14 days after stroke. Consistently, in co-cultures of primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). AIM2 overexpression in astrocytes abrogated 3-HKA-driven vascular remodeling in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that 3-HKA may regulate astrocyte-mediated vascular remodeling by impeding AIM2 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, 3-HKA may promote post-stroke vascular remodeling by regulating A1/A2 astrocyte activation, thereby improving long-term neurological recovery, suggesting that supplementation with 3-HKA may be an efficient therapy for stroke.},

  abstract     = {Efficiency, stability, and cost are crucial considerations in the development of photovoltaic technology for commercialization. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising third-generation photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low-cost potential. However, the stability of organohalide perovskites remains a significant challenge. Inorganic perovskites, based on CsPbX ₃ (X = Br − /I − ), have garnered attention for their excellent thermal stability and optoelectronic properties comparable to those of organohalide perovskites. Nevertheless, the development of inorganic perovskites faces several hurdles, including the need for high-temperature annealing to achieve the photoactive α-phase and their susceptibility to transitioning into the nonphotoactive δ-phase under environmental stressors, particularly moisture. These challenges impede the creation of high-efficiency, high-stability devices using low-cost, scalable manufacturing processes. This review provides a comprehensive background on the fundamental structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties of inorganic lead-halide perovskites. It discusses the latest advancements in fabricating inorganic PSCs at lower temperatures and under ambient conditions. Furthermore, it highlights the progress in state-of-the-art inorganic devices, particularly those manufactured in ambient environments and at reduced temperatures, alongside simultaneous advancements in the upscaling and stability of inorganic PSCs.},

Perovskite (CsPbBr 3 ) quantum dots (QDs) passivated by ligands with long alkyl chains are mixed with a conjugated polymer in a solution phase to form polymer-QD blend films. Solution sequential doping of the blend film with AuCl 3 solution not only doped the conjugated polymer but also decomposed the QDs, resulting in a doped conjugated polymer film embedded with separated ions dissociated from the QDs. For the doped polymer-molten QD blend films with the optimal QD content, it is found that a greatly enhanced Seebeck coefficient is achieved compared to that of the doped polymer film without QDs, while the doping level and electrical conductivity are not significantly reduced by the QD incorporation. Consequently, the power factor is enhanced, reaching a remarkably high value of up to 401.9 µW m −1 K −2 (≈155% increase with the QDs). The applicability of this method to a variety of conjugated polymers is also demonstrated. The enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient is attributed to ion-induced local variations in the polymer work function, which generates an internal energy barrier for charge transport and causes an energy filtering effect.},

This crystal exhibits a band structure with both positive (positive group velocity) and negative slopes (negative group velocity), exciting and directing the water waves to produce forward and backward radiating wakes through a mechanism similar to CR.

In this study, advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique is employed to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moiré potentials. The application of displacement field via in situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moiré potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ≈20 meV. Theoretical calculations effectively capture the experimental observations.

Here, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is conducted on NPC, leveraging gene expression prediction models based on epithelial tissues and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 1577 NPC cases and 6359 controls of southern Chinese descent. The TWAS identifies VAMP8 on chromosome 2p11.2 as a novel susceptibility gene for NPC. Further fine-mapping analyses pinpoint rs1058588, located within VAMP8 , as a causal variant through eQTL colocalization, and GWAS analyses across multiple cohorts, achieving GWAS significance (OR = 1.18, P = 3.09 × 10 −10 ). Functional assays demonstrate that VAMP8 exerts a tumorigenic role in NPC, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. Mechanically, it is uncovered that rs1058588 modulates VAMP8 expression by altering its binding affinity to miR-185 . Furthermore, the results show that VAMP8 interacts with DHX9 to facilitate the nuclear recruitment of p65, activating the NF-κB pathway. Collectively, the findings shed light on the genetic predisposition to NPC and underscore the critical role of the functional axis involving miR-185, VAMP8, DHX9, and the NF-κB pathway in NPC pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and animal models of depression, key pathological hallmarks include activation of microglia as well as atrophy and loss of astrocytes. Under certain pathological conditions, microglia can inflict damage to neurons and astrocytes. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how activated microglia induced astrocyte atrophy and loss remain enigmatic. In this study, a depression model induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is utilized. The results show that CSDS induces significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, along with notable astrocyte atrophy and apoptosis, microglial activation, and elevated levels of microglial interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subsequent studies demonstrate that IL-6 released from activated microglia promotes astrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in microglia, which is implicated in the stress response, reduces stress-induced microglial activation, IL-6 release, and astrocyte apoptosis. Direct inhibition of microglia by minocycline corroborates these effects. The selective knockdown of IL-6 in microglia and IL-6 receptors in astrocytes effectively mitigates depression-like behaviors and reduces astrocyte atrophy. This study identifies microglial IL-6 as a key factor that contributes to astrocyte apoptosis and depressive symptoms. Consequently, the IL-6/IL-6R pathway has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of depression.},

  abstract     = {Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), however, the metabolic shifts during the UC-to-CRC transition remain elusive. In this study, an AOM-DSS-induced three-stage colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) model is constructed and targeted metabolomics analysis and pathway enrichment are performed, uncovering the metabolic changes in this transition. Spatial metabolic trajectories in the “normal-to-normal adjacent tissue (NAT)-to-tumor” transition, and temporal metabolic trajectories in the “colitis-to-dysplasia-to-carcinoma” transition are identified through K-means clustering of 74 spatially and 77 temporally differential metabolites, respectively. The findings reveal two distinct metabolic profile categories during the inflammation-to-cancer progression: those with consistent changes, either increasing (e.g., kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid) or decreasing (e.g., long-chain fatty acids, LCFAs), and those enriched at specific disease stages (e.g., serotonin). Further analysis of metabolites with consistent temporal trends identifies eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as a key metabolite, potentially exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects by inhibiting insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). This study reveals novel metabolic mechanisms underlying the transition from UC to CAC and suggests potential targets to delay the progression.},

  abstract     = {Flexible memristors are promising candidates for multifunctional neuromorphic computing applications, overcoming the limitations of conventional computing devices. However, unpredictable switching behavior and poor mechanical stability in conventional memristors present significant challenges to achieving device reliability. Here, a reliable and flexible memristor using zirconium-oxo cluster (Zr 6 O 4 OH 4 (OMc) 12 ) as the resistive switching layer is demonstrated. The optimization of the structural rigidity of the hybrid oxo-cluster network by thermal polymerization allows the precise formation of dispersed conductive cluster networks, enhancing the repeatability of the resistive switching with mechanical flexibility. The optimized memristor exhibits endurance of ∼10 4 cycles and stable memory retention performance up to 10 4 s, maintaining a high I ON / I OFF ratio of 10 4 under a bending radius of 2.5 mm. Moreover, the device achieves a pattern recognition accuracy of 97.44%, enabled by highly symmetric analog switching with multilevel conductance states. These results highlight that hybrid metal-oxo clusters can provide novel material design principles for flexible and reliable neuromorphic applications, contributing to the development of artificial neural networks.},

  abstract     = {METTL3, a key enzyme in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, plays a crucial role in the progression of renal fibrosis, particularly in chronic active renal allograft rejection (CAR). This study explored the mechanisms by which METTL3 promotes renal allograft fibrosis, focusing on its role in the macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT). Using a comprehensive experimental approach, including TGF-β1-induced MMT cell models, METTL3 conditional knockout (METTL3 KO) mice, and renal biopsy samples from patients with CAR, the study investigates the involvement of METTL3/Smad3 axis in driving MMT and renal fibrosis during the episodes of CAR. We found that elevated m6A modification and METTL3 levels strongly correlated with enhanced MMT and increased fibrotic severity. METTL3 knockout (METTL3 KO) significantly increased the m6A modification of Smad3, decreased Smad3 expression, and inhibited M2-driven MMT. Smad3 knockdown with siRNA (siSmad3) further inhibited M2-driven MMT, while Smad3 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effects of METTL3 silencing, restoring M2-driven MMT and fibrotic tissue damage. Additionally, the METTL3 inhibitor STM2457 effectively reversed M2-driven MMT and alleviated fibrotic tissue damage in CAR. These findings highlight that METTL3 enhances M2-driven MMT in renal fibrosis during CAR by promoting the TGF-β1/Smad3 axis, suggesting that METTL3 is a promising therapeutic target for mitigating renal fibrosis in CAR.},

  abstract     = {Hemodynamic stabilization is crucial in managing acute cardiac events, where compromised blood flow can lead to severe complications and increased mortality. Conditions like decompensated heart failure (HF) and cardiogenic shock require rapid and effective hemodynamic support. Current mechanical assistive devices, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), offer temporary stabilization but are limited to short-term use due to risks associated with prolonged blood contact. This research presents a novel proof-of-concept soft robotic device designed with the aim of achieving low-risk, medium-term counterpulsation therapy. The device employs a nature-inspired growing mechanism for potentially minimally invasive deployment around the ascending aorta, coupled with hydraulic artificial muscles for aortic compression. It demonstrated a maximum stroke volume of 16.48 ± 0.21 mL (SD, n = 5), outperforming all other non-pneumatic extra-aortic devices. In addition, in vitro tests with a mock circulation loop (MCL) show a drop in aortic end-diastolic pressure by 6.32 mmHg and enhance coronary flow under mild aortic stenosis, which attenuate the device&#39;s assistive effect. These findings highlight the device&#39;s strong potential for optimization as a promising solution to improve outcomes for hemodynamically unstable HF patients.},

  abstract     = {Polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) molecules reveal narrowband emission, making them very promising emitters for high color purity display. Nevertheless, they still have challenges such as aggregation-induced emission quenching and spectral broadening. Overcoming these obstacles requires an in-depth understanding of the correlations among the alterations in their geometries, packing structures, and molecular vibrations and their corresponding changes in their photoluminescence (PL) properties. Herein, it is demonstrated that high-pressure infrared, UV−visible absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies can be combined with computational results to elucidate the influence of the subtle structural variations on the exciton‒vibration couplings and their PL properties. An ortho-carborane-decorated MR emitter (BNC) is a piezochromic molecule and exhibits emission enhancement under high pressure. A thorough analysis of the in situ experimental measurements and calculated results reveals that the pressure-induced changes in the exciton binding energy and exciton‒vibration couplings are responsible for the unusual piezochromism. This research provides insights into the structure‒fluorescence relationship and potential for high-pressure techniques to optimize MR materials for advanced organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications.},

In this paper, an unsupervised approach is presented to enhance AFM image contrast by analyzing the nonlinear response of a cantilever interacting with a material&#39;s surface using a wavelet-based AFM. This method simultaneously measures different frequencies and harmonics in a single scan, without the need for additional hardware and exciting multiple cantilevers&#39; eigenmodes. This developed AFM image contrast enhancement (AFM-ICE) approach employs unsupervised learning, image processing, and image fusion techniques. The method is applied to interpret complex multilayer structures consist of defects, deposited nanoparticles and heterogeneities. Its substantial capability is demonstrated to improve image contrast and differentiate between various components.

By inducing localized inflammation within tumors using lipopolysaccharide, it significantly amplify the recruitment of drug-laden neutrophils to tumor sites, irrespective of specific tumor markers. This strategy not only enhances targeted drug delivery but also triggers the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, further potentiating the anti-tumor effect. Crucially, this study demonstrates that potential systemic inflammatory responses can be effectively mitigated through neutrophil transfusion, ensuring the safety and clinical viability of this approach. In a murine breast cancer model, the method significantly impedes tumor growth compared to conventional treatments. This work offers a versatile strategy for precise drug delivery across diverse tumor types.

Herein, the potential of GH in disulfidptosis regulation, a novel form of programmed cell death induced by disulfide stress is explored. The omics results indicated that NRF2 signaling could be significantly activated by GH. The potential targets are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and cell death. Moreover, both glutathione (GSH) metabolism and NADP + -NADPH metabolism are affected by GH, indicating the potential in disulfidptosis regulation. It is also observed that GH enhanced the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to disulfidptosis, which is dependent on the activation of NRF2-SLC7A11 pathway. GH significantly increased the levels of NRF2 and promoted the transcription of NRF2 target gene, SLC7A11, through autophagy-mediated non-canonical mechanism. Under the condition of glucose starvation, GH-induced upregulation of SLC7A11 aggravated uptake of cysteine, disturbance of GSH synthesis, depletion of NADPH, and accumulation of disulfide molecules, ultimately leading to the formation of disulfide bonds between different cytoskeleton proteins and disulfidptosis eventually. Collectively, the findings underscore the potential role of GH in promoting cancer cell disulfidptosis, thereby offering a promising avenue for the treatment of drug-resistant HCC in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Gram-positive bacteria pose significant threats to human health, necessitating the development of targeted bacterial detection and eradication strategies. Nevertheless, current approaches often suffer from poor targeting specificity. Herein, the study utilizes purple rice lixivium to synthesize biomass carbon dots (termed BCDs) with wheat germ agglutinin-like residues for precisely targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Subsequently, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules are grafted onto BCDs to yield FITC-labeled BCDs (termed CDFs), which can selectively and rapidly (≤5 min) stain bacterial cell wall and particularly target the peptidoglycan component. Strikingly, CDFs achieve superselective visualization of Gram-positive bacteria even in the presence of mammalian cells and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, protoporphyrin (PpIX) molecules are conjugated onto BCDs to yield PpIX-modified BCDs (termed CDPs), which can induce bacterial aggregation and in situ generate singlet oxygen for realizing enhanced antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT). At the minimum bactericidal concentration of CDPs (PpIX: 5 µg mL −1 ), CDP-mediated PDT disrupts bacterial structure and metabolism pathways, thereby affecting bacterial interactions to eradicate biofilms. Importantly, CDP-mediated PDT efficiently modulates antiinflammatory responses to promote wound healing in the bacteria-infected mice. This study underscores the significance of harnessing renewable and cost-effective biomass resources for preparing Gram-positive bacteria-targeting theranostic agents, which may find potential clinical applications in the future.},

By accessing the single-cell spatial transcriptome of over 25 million neuron cells across the entire macaque cortex, it is discovered that the distribution of neurons within cortical layers is highly non-random. Strikingly, over three-quarters of these neurons are located in distinct neuronal clusters. Within these clusters, different cell types tend to collaborate rather than function independently. Typically, excitatory neuron clusters mainly consist of excitatory-excitatory combinations, while inhibitory clusters primarily contain excitatory-inhibitory combinations. Both cluster types have roughly equal numbers of neurons in each layer. Importantly, most excitatory and inhibitory neuron clusters form spatial partnerships, indicating a balanced local neuronal network and correlating with specific functional regions. These organizational principles are conserved across mouse cortical regions. These findings suggest that different brain regions of the cortex may exhibit similar mechanisms at the neuronal population level.},

However, such a phenomenon has not been explicitly observed in 3D device semiconductors at the nanoscale. Here, by employing a tip-enhanced Raman thermal measurement approach, substantial phonon nonequilibrium in gallium nitride near sub-10 nm laser-excited hotspots is directly revealed for the first time. As further evidence, quantitative agreements between measurements and accurate first-principles-based phonon Boltzmann transport equation calculations are obtained. The large nonequilibrium is attributed to the strong Fröhlich coupling of electrons with longitudinal optical phonons and the large acoustic-optical phonon frequency gap in gallium nitride, which is further demonstrated in other common III-V semiconductors. This work establishes a viable approach for understanding nanoscale nonequilibrium phonon transport and can potentially benefit the future modulation of hot carrier dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Plutonium-238 ( 238 Pu) is a scarce heat-source radioisotope used in nuclear batteries, which is produced by in-reactor irradiation of Americium-241 ( 241 Am) or Neptunium-237 ( 237 Np). Optimizing the neutron spectrum can improve the production efficiency of 238 Pu, but currently, it is still a lack of knowledge about the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production. Genetic algorithms and burnup algorithms are combined to identify optimal neutron spectra for 238 Pu production under various irradiation times and flux levels, and build an optimal neutron spectrum database, which answers the questions “What is the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production?” and “What is the maximum efficiency for 238 Pu production” once and for all. This database can be referred to for determining the optimal neutron spectrum, guiding the neutron spectrum regulation process to improve the yield of 238 Pu. Moreover, these results find that the production method of in-reactor irradiation 237 Np not only has a higher yield but also achieves a higher purity of 238 Pu than that of in-reactor irradiation 241 Am, which conflicts with the traditional experiences, providing with previously unknown insights and helping break through the efficiency limit of traditional methods, maximizing 238 Pu production.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in dispersal mechanisms and risk assessment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), how plants influence ARG contamination in agricultural soils remains underexplored. Here, the impacts of plant species and diversity on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in three agricultural soils are comprehensively investigated in a pot experiment. The results indicate that increased plant diversity reduces ARGs and MGEs abundance by 19.2%–51.2%, whereas plant species exhibit inconsistent and soil-dependent effects. Potential bacterial hosts harboring abundant ARGs have greater relative abundance than nonhosts, and both their richness and cumulative relative abundance are reduced by plant diversity. Notably, hosts inhibited by plant diversity present a greater relative abundance than the other hosts. The enriched compounds in root exudates due to plant diversity play a more important role in the metabolic network and contribute to rebalancing of the abundance of potential hosts and nonhosts. An independent test using pure organics reveals that higher resource diversity, resulting from increased plant diversity, reduces the relative abundance and mobility of abundant and high-risk ARGs. This study highlights the resource-mediated mitigation of the risks posed by ARG contamination and indicates that ensuring plant and resource diversity is a promising strategy for controlling ARGs in agroecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Dietary high salt intake is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies have identified a population of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA)-like astrocytes closely linked to amyloid deposition and tau pathology in an AD mouse model. However, the presence and role of these astrocytes in high-salt diet (HSD) models remain unexplored. In this study, it is demonstrated that HSD significantly induces enhanced reactivity of DAA-like astrocytes in the hippocampal CA3 region of mice, with this reactivity being critically dependent on neuronal tau pathology. Neuronal tau pathology activates adenosine A1R signaling, exacerbating tau pathology by inhibiting the Cers1 pathway, which sustains astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, neurons burdened with tau pathology promote astrocyte reactivity via releasing Proteins Associated with Promoting DAA-like Astrocyte Reactivity (PAPD), with Lcn2 playing a pivotal role. Knockout of Lcn2 or its receptor 24p3R significantly mitigates HSD-induced DAA reactivity and neuroinflammation. These findings suggest a vicious cycle between tau pathology and A1R signaling, driving DAA-like astrocyte reactivity. Targeting the Tau-A1R axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing HSD-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative joint disease, prominently influenced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Although elevated IL-6 levels in joint fluid are well-documented, the uneven cartilage degeneration observed in knee OA patients suggests additional underlying mechanisms. This study investigates the role of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) in mediating IL-6 signaling and its contribution to OA progression. Here, significantly elevated IL-6R expression is identified in degenerated cartilage of OA patients. Further, in vivo experiments reveal that intra-articular injection of recombinant IL-6R protein or activation of gp130 (Y757F mutation) accelerates OA progression. Conversely, knockout of IL-6R or JAK2, as well as treatment with a JAK inhibitor, alleviates OA symptoms. Mechanistically, chondrocytes derived from degenerative cartilage exhibit impaired nuclear localization of SOX9, a key regulator of cartilage homeostasis. JAK inhibition stabilizes SIRT1, reduces SOX9 acetylation, and thereby facilitates SOX9 nuclear localization, promoting cartilage repair. Additionally, the JAK inhibitor-induced apoptosis in p21-positive senescent cells, and their targeted clearance successfully alleviates OA in p21-3MR mice. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which inhibiting the IL-6R/JAK2 pathway can alleviate OA. Furthermore, this study proposes targeting p21-positive senescent cells as a new therapeutic strategy for OA.},

Although various physical and biological effects of FUS have been well-documented, there is still a lack of understanding and direct evidence on the biological mechanism of therapeutic cell ablation caused by high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) and the subsequent wound healing responses. This study develops an enclosed cell culture device that synergistically combines non-invasive FUS stimulation and real-time, on-the-fly live-cell imaging, providing an in vitro platform to explore short and long-term biological effects of ultrasound. The process, mechanism, and wound healing response of cell ablation induced by HIFU are elucidated, revealing a unique mechanism, termed ultrasound-inflicted cellular mechanolysis, that is mediated by growing subcellular cavitation air bubbles under confined contact with cells. This provides a previously unappreciated mechanism for understanding the biomechanical principles of ultrasound-based ablative therapy. A post-ablation phantom layer is also revealed that serves as a guiding cue for collective cell migration during wound healing, thereby providing a biomimetic model for studying wound healing after HIFU-inflicted damage. Together, this study provides theoretical and technological basis for advancing the understanding of the biological effects of ultrasound-based ablative therapy and inspiring clinically relevant applications in the future.},

  abstract     = {The advent of biomacromolecules antagonizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). However, frequent intravitreal injections of these biomacromolecules impose an enormous burden on patients and create a massive workload for healthcare providers. This causes patients to abandon therapy, ultimately leading to progressive and irreversible vision loss. In order to address this unmet clinical need, a noninvasive treatment for nAMD is developed. An optimized cell-penetrating peptide derivative, bxy Penetratin (bxyWP), is used to non-covalently complex with the anti-VEGF protein aflibercept (AFL) via reversible hydrophobic interaction. The interaction is crucial for AFL delivery, neither impairing the affinity of AFL to pathological VEGF, nor being interfered by endogenous proteins in tear fluids. AFL/bxyWP eye drops exhibit prolonged retention on the eye and excellent absorption into the posterior ocular segment following topical administration, with significant drug distribution to the retina and choroid. In a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model on cynomolgus monkeys, AFL/bxyWP eye drops efficiently reduce lesion size and leakage comparable to conventional intravitreal injection of AFL. These results suggest that AFL/bxyWP eye drops are feasible self-administered treatment for neovascular retinal diseases and potentially become a substitute for intravitreal injections.},

In particular, the importance of i) controlling the dissolved oxygen at 10% O 2 to reduce reactive oxygen species production and upregulate genes involved in cell proliferation, resulting in higher expansion rates (tenfold) compared to normoxic conditions, and ii) maintaining constant power input per volume as a scale-up criteria is demonstrated. After expansion, hiPSC-CM further mature in culture, revealing more mature transcriptional signatures, higher sarcomere alignment and improved calcium handling.

The micro- and nanoscale architecture critically influences the mechanical and electrochemical performance of these electrodes. However, achieving a balance between high compressive strength, electrochemical stability, and cost-effective sustainable production remains challenging. Here, a superelastic wood nanocarbon sponge (WNCS) with a wrinkled multilayer structure is developed via a facile “top–down” design on natural wood. These unique wrinkled nanolayers effectively alleviate stress concentration through elastic deformation, resulting in a high compressive strength of 580.6 kPa at 70% reversible strain. The significantly increased specific surface area, coupled with abundant micro-mesopores and highly graphitized nanocarbon, promotes rapid ion/electron transport, enabling the WNCS to achieve an ultrahigh capacitance of 4.21 F cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 , along with excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using a WNCS anode and a NiCo-layered double hydroxide cathode retains 71.8% of its initial capacitance after 1000 compression cycles and withstands stress up to 1.03 MPa without capacitance degradation. This sustainable, cost-effective WNCS shows great promise for flexible, compressible, and wearable electrochemical energy systems.},

The membrane serves as the interface between the circulating air-flow and the ambient water, preventing water flux while allowing an oxygen flux across the membrane, driven by a partial oxygen pressure gradient. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, a prototype system was built based on guidelines derived from a mathematical model that was developed to describe the oxygen transfer process. A computational fluid dynamics model is developed and validated against the measurements from the prototype, resulting in a digital twin.

Here, a new catalyst with an inverse structure of a supported metal catalyst that consists of metallic iron particles loaded with an aluminum hydride species is reported. The iron catalyst is readily prepared from an α-Fe 2 O 3 precursor and ammonia could be synthesized at more than twice the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst volume of the conventional industrial iron catalyst, even though the specific surface area of the former is only half that of the latter. In addition, ammonia synthesis over the catalyst is observed with a small apparent activation energy at 50 °C. Mechanistic studies suggested that an increase in the active sites with strong electron-donating capability on the iron catalyst significantly increased the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst surface area, which resulted in high catalytic activity/catalyst volume.},

  abstract     = {Navigating complex extracellular environments requires extensive deformation of cells and their nuclei. Most in vitro systems used to study nuclear deformations impose whole-cell confinement that mimics the physical crowding experienced by cells during 3D migration through tissues. Such systems, however, do not reproduce the types of nuclear deformations expected to occur in cells that line tissues such as endothelial or epithelial cells whose physical confinement stems principally from the topography of their underlying basement membrane. Here, it is shown that endothelial cells and myoblasts cultured on microgroove substrates that mimic the anisotropic topography of the basement membrane exhibit large-scale 3D nuclear deformations, with partial to complete nuclear penetration into the microgrooves. These deformations do not lead to significant DNA damage and are dynamic with nuclei cyclically entering and exiting the microgrooves. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that these deformation cycles are accompanied by transient changes in perinuclear stiffness. Interestingly, nuclear penetration into the grooves is driven principally by cell-substrate adhesion stresses, with a limited need for cytoskeleton-associated forces. Finally, it is demonstrated that myoblasts from laminopathy patients exhibit abnormal nuclear deformations on microgrooves, raising the possibility of using microgroove substrates as a novel functional diagnostic platform for pathologies that involve abnormal nuclear mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Vascular calcification is a highly regulated process in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality, especially in the adverse stage of vascular remodeling after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). However, the pathogenesis of vascular graft calcification, particularly the role of endothelial-smooth muscle cell interaction, is still unclear. To test how ECs interact with SMCs in artery grafts, single-cell analysis of wild-type mice is first performed using an arterial isograft mouse model and found robust cytokine-mediated signaling pathway activation and SMC proliferation, together with upregulated endothelial tripartite motif 35 (TRIM35) expression. Unexpectedly, severe SMC calcification in artery grafts is found in TRIM35 conditional endothelial knockout (cKO) mice. Calcified medium (comprising calcium chloride and beta-glycerophosphate)-induced calcium deposition in vitro is also found in SMCs cocultured with TRIM35 knockout endothelium. This extraordinary phenomenon is further confirmed to be induced by increased MMP10 secretion. Mechanistically, endothelial TRIM35 inhibits MMP10 expression and secretion by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RelB and maintaining its nuclear localization, consequently inhibiting nuclear transcription of MMP10 through the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Targeting MMP10 in situ in arterial isografts can effectively alleviate vascular calcification caused by conditional endothelial TRIM35 knockout. These findings demonstrated that TRIM35 inhibited vascular calcification during arterial isograft remodeling, a process that is driven by the aberrant secretion of endothelial MMP10. Targeting MMP10 pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for vascular calcification in vessel grafts.},

  abstract     = {Adjuvants are non-specific immune enhancers commonly used to improve the responsiveness and persistence of the immune system toward antigens. However, due to the undefined chemical structure, toxicity, non-biodegradability, and lack of design technology in many existing adjuvants, it remains difficult to achieve substantive breakthroughs in the adjuvant research field. Here, a novel adjuvant development strategy based on stapling peptides is reported to overcome this challenge. The nano-vaccine incorporating peptide adjuvant and recombinant HBsAg protein not only induced strong antibody titers that are equivalent to aluminum adjuvanted vaccines but also simultaneously activated T-cell immune response. Similar results are also observed in herpes zoster vaccine and more complex influenza vaccine. The mechanism analysis demonstrates that antigen is efficiently carried into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by peptide, further promoting the secretion of cytokines and activation of APCs. In addition, by redesigning the adjuvant, it is found that the sulfonium centers, rather than the sequence of peptide played an important role in immune activation. This discovery may provide a new paradigm for the rational design of peptide-based adjuvants. In brief, this study demonstrates that stapling peptides with sulfonium centers can provide a well-defined, programmable, biocompatible, and effective adjuvant for multiple types of vaccines.},

  abstract     = {Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier results in increased permeability and is a key factor in the onset and progression of Crohn&#39;s disease (CD). The protein SPARC is primarily involved in cell interaction and migration, but its specific role in the intestinal epithelial barrier remains unclear. This study demonstrates that SPARC is significantly overexpressed in both CD patients and murine models of colitis. Furthermore, mice deficient in SPARC exhibits resistance to chemically induced colitis, a phenomenon associated with the modulation of barrier-associated proteins. Mechanistically, it is elucidated that SPARC competitively binds to OTUD4 in conjunction with MYD88, facilitating the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and subsequent activation of the p65-MLCK/MLC2 pathway, thereby compromising barrier integrity. Additionally, it is identified that the elevated expression of SPARC in CD is regulated via the METTL3-YTHDF1 axis. These findings indicate that SPARC levels are elevated in patients with CD and in colitis-induced mice, leading to intestinal barrier damage through direct interaction with OTUD4 and subsequent activation of the MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 signaling pathway. Consequently, targeting SPARC or the OTUD4/MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 axis may offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CD and represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Plants activate defense machinery when infested by herbivorous insects but avoid such costs in the absence of herbivory. However, the key signaling pathway regulators underlying such flexibility and the mechanisms that insects exploit these components to disarm plant defense systems remain elusive. Here, it is reported that immune repressor 14-3-3e in rice Oryza sativa (OsGF14e) regulates immune homeostasis. Infestation with brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens decreased OsGF14e expression; however, the level of downregulation is limited both by the short duration and the specific feeding location. OsGF14e interacts with Enhanced Disease Resistance 1-like (OsEDR1l), a Raf-like MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), and repressed jasmonic acid, jasmonic acid-isoleucine, and H 2 O 2 accumulation by enhancing OsEDR1l abundance and signaling ability. OsGF14e and OsEDR1l overexpression renders rice susceptible to BPH, whereas their knockout increases plant resistance but compromises rice growth and grain yield. Intriguingly, BPH 14-3-3e protein (Nl14) that shares high sequence homology and structural similarity with OsGF14e is identified from BPH saliva and egg-associated secretions. Mediated through BPH feeding and oviposition, Nl14, similar to OsGF14e, interacts with OsEDR1l and triggers the OsEDR1l signaling, thereby suppressing plant defenses and facilitating BPH infestation. Apparently, structural and functional mimicry makes it possible for this newly discovered BPH effector to exploit rice OsGF14e-EDR1l immune suppression module. The results reveal a novel mechanism deployed by herbivorous insects, in a manner similar to certain pathogen effectors, to evade host plant defenses by mimicking host immune regulators.},

  abstract     = {MXenzymes, a promising class of catalytic therapeutic material, offer great potential for tumor treatment, but they encounter significant obstacles due to suboptimal catalytic efficiency and kinetics in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, this study draws inspiration from the electronic structure of transition metal vanadium, proposing the leverage of TME specific-features to induce structural transformations in sheet-like vanadium carbide MXenzymes (TVMz). These transformations trigger cascading catalytic reactions that amplify oxidative stress, thereby significantly enhancing multimodal tumor therapy. Specifically, the engineered HTVMz, coated with hyaluronic acid, exhibits good stability and generates a thermal effect under NIR-II laser irradiation. The thermal effect, combined with TME characteristics, facilities a structural transformation into ultra-small vanadium oxide nanozymes (VO x ). The enlarged surface area of VO x substantially enhances ROS regeneration and amplifies oxidative stress, which promotes lysosomal permeability and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. The high-valent vanadium in VO x interacts with intracellular glutathione, disrupting redox homeostasis and intensifying oxidative stress further. These amplifications accelerate tumor apoptosis, induce ferroptosis, and suppress HSP90 expression. Consequently, the heightened thermal sensitivity of HTVMz synergistically promotes tumor cell death via multimodal therapeutic pathways. This study presents an innovative strategy for tumor catalytic therapy by manipulating MXenzymes structures, advancing the field of catalytic therapy.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are commonly considered accomplices in tumorigenesis and tumor development. However, the precise mechanism by which tumor cells prompt TAMs to aid in evading immune surveillance remains to be further investigated. Here, it is elucidated that tumor-secreted galectin-1 (Gal1) conferred immunosuppressive properties to TAMs. Specifically, patient specimens and a public database is first used to analyze the clinical relevance of Gal1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Then, it is demonstrated that TAMs functioned as a critical mediator in the Gal1-induced progression of HCC and the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing determined that Gal1 promoted the upregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) in TAMs via activating the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Employing an anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibody and Foxp3DTR mice, it is demonstrated that CCR6 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruited by Gal1-induced TAMs contributed to reduced infiltration and dysfunctional state of CD8 + T cells, subsequently facilitating tumor progression. Targeting Gal1 dampened the secretion of CCL20 and inhibits the recruitment of Tregs, thereby activating anti-tumor immunity and ameliorating anti-PD-1 resistance. Together, this findings revealed that Gal1-induced TAMs recruited Tregs through the CCL20-CCR6 axis. Inhibition of Gal1 improves the effectiveness of anti-PD1 therapy, shedding important new light on the combination immunotherapy of HCC.},

However, the properties of the hAECs and their proliferative mechanisms remain unclear. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is performed on hAECs obtained from amniotic tissues at different gestational ages and passages during in vitro culture. The results showed that the proliferation of hAECs is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) during amniogenesis. Freshly isolated, full-term hAECs are identified as mature epithelial cells. Once cultured in vitro, they are observed to rapidly undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enter a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) state to regain their EMP properties and proliferation capacities. With the continuous development of EMT, hAECs eventually enter a senescent state. The addition of SB431542 and microcarrier screening enabled the effective 3D expansion of hAECs by 50 fold while maintaining the EMP status in hAECs for further proliferation. This study not only elucidated the central proliferation mechanism of hAECs during development and expansion but also optimized the in vitro culture system so that it is sufficient to generate hAECs for 50 patients from a single donor amniotic membrane.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in obese patients remains challenging. Recent studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of TNBC and malignancies. Through multiomic analysis and experimental validation, a dysfunctional Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit H (EIF3H)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) proteolytic axis is identified as a pivotal junction mediating the interplay between cancer-associated adipocytes and the response to anti-cancer drugs in TNBC. Mechanistically, cancer-associated adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in an upregulated hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This aberrant upregulation of HBP promotes YAP O-GlcNAcylation and the subsequent recruitment of EIF3H deubiquitinase, which stabilizes YAP, thus promoting tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. It is found that Retatrutide, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits HBP and YAP O-GlcNAcylation leading to increased YAP degradation through the deprivation of EIF3H-mediated deubiquitylation of YAP. In preclinical models of obese TNBC, Retatrutide downregulates HBP, decreases YAP protein levels, and consequently decreases tumor size and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. This effect is particularly pronounced in obese mice bearing TNBC tumors. Overall, these findings reveal a critical interplay between adipocyte-mediated metabolic reprogramming and EIF3H-mediated YAP proteolytic control, offering promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on TNBC progression.},

However, the development of nasal mRNA vaccines has been hampered by the lack of effective means to overcome the mucus barrier. Herein, ionizable lipid-incorporated liquid lipid nanoparticles (iLLNs) capable of delivering mRNA cargo across airway mucosa are designed. Adjusting the ratios of ionizable and cationic lipids allows fine-tuning of the p K a of iLLNs to the range of nasal mucosal pH (5.5–6.5), thus facilitating mucus penetration via the formation of near-neutral, PEGylated muco-inert surfaces. When nasally administered to mice, the top candidate iLLN-2/mRNA complexes enable about 60-fold greater reporter gene expression in the nasal cavity, compared to the benchmark mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (ALC-LNP) having the same lipid composition as that of BNT162b2 vaccine. Moreover, a prime-boost intranasal immunization of iLLN-2/mRNA complexes elicits a greater magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific mucosal IgA and IgG response than ALC-LNP, without triggering any noticeable inflammatory reactions. Taken together, these results provide useful insights for the design of nasally deliverable mRNA formulations for prophylactic applications.},

Previous studies indicated that disrupted lipid homeostasis can lead to lipid peroxidation damage and inflammation, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the study demonstrates that hyperlipidemia is a key driver of mIRI. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) is upregulated in both hyperlipidemia and AMI patients. ACSL1 expression is induced by a high-fat microenvironment (oxLDL and palmitic acid) in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, the protein level is positively correlated with total cholesterol level and thromboinflammatory biomarkers. Furthermore, ACSL1 reprogrammed lipid metabolism in monocytes, leading to the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)/lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The monocytic LPC/LPA axis accelerated lipid peroxidation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-induced thromboinflammation via the paracrine effect. The main LPA producer Autotaxinis is also induced under high-fat conditions and then exerts thromboinflammation response through converted LPC to LPA. Finally, ACSL1 knockdown or NETs release inhibitor (DNase I or GSK484) significantly alleviated mIRI in mice. These findings highlight ACSL1 and NETosis as potential key targets for preventing mIRI and underscore the lipid peroxidation in the mechanisms of ACSL1-mediated thromboinflammation.},

  abstract     = {Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is related to increased susceptibility to secondary infections and death. Lung is the most vulnerable target organ in sepsis, but the understanding of the pulmonary immunosuppression state is still limited. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is performed to map the landscape of immune cells, revealing a neutrophil-driven immunosuppressive program in the lungs of patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Although immunosuppressive genes are upregulated in different immune cells, only neutrophils dramatically increase in the BALF of patients in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Five neutrophil subpopulations in BALF are identified, among which CXCR2 + and CD274 ( PD-L1 coding gene) + IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulations increased significantly during septic immunosuppression. Interestingly, a developmental trajectory from CXCR2 + to CD274 + IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulation is disclosed. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CXCR2 blockade is observed on the survival of septic mice, along with a decreased number of PD-L1 + neutrophils. Taken together, the CXCR2 + neutrophil subpopulation is discovered as a contributor to immunosuppression in sepsis and identified it as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis treatment.},

  abstract     = {Repairing large bone defects remains a significant clinical challenge. Stem cell is of great importance in bone regeneration, and periosteum is rich in periosteal stem cell, which has a great influence on repairing bone defects. Bioengineered periosteum with excellent biocompatibility and stem cell homing capabilities to promote bone regeneration is of great clinical significance. The E7 peptide (EPLQLKM), which exhibits a specific affinity for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), is beneficial for modulating cellular functions. In this study, a unique microporous structured carboxymethyl chitosan/sodium alginate membrane with a proper mass ratio is developed by the addition of Poloxam 407 （P407）, which is then functionalized with the E7 affinitive peptide. This membrane, characterized by its microporous structure and E7 peptide functionalization (CSSA/P/E), not only demonstrated favorable mechanical properties, enhanced hydrophilicity, satisfactory biodegradation profile, and excellent biocompatibility, but also synergistically enhanced MSCs recruitment. It is found to promote the proliferation, spreading, and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro and to accelerate early periosteal regeneration, bone matrix deposition, and vascularization in vivo, leading to effective regeneration of critical-sized bone defects. Overall, this study presents a robust, cell and growth factor-free strategy for bioengineering periosteum, offering a potential solution for the challenging large size bone defects.},

  abstract     = {Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly prevalent yet neglected health burden for women. Strengthening the pelvic floor with bioactive tissue-engineered meshes is an emerging concept. This study investigates tissue regenerative design parameters, including degradability, porosity, and angulation, to develop alternative degradable melt electrowritten (MEW) constructs for surgical applications of POP. MEW constructs were fabricated in hierarchical geometries by two-way stacking of the fibers with three different inter layer angles of 90°, 45°, or 22.5°. Implants printed at 22.5° have higher tensile strength under dry conditions and show better vaginal fibroblast (VF) attachment in vitro. In vivo assessment using preclinical mouse and ovine models demonstrates more effective degradation and improved tissue integration in 22.5° angular meshes compared to 90° and 45° meshes, with evidence of neo-collagen deposition within implants at 6 weeks. The pattern and geometry of the layered MEW implants also influence the foreign body response, wherein the anti-inflammatory phenotype shows a greater ratio of anti-inflammatory CD206+ M2 macrophages/pro-inflammatory CCR7+ M1 macrophages. This presents an attractive strategy for improving the design and fabrication of next-generation vaginal implants for pelvic reconstructive surgery.},

  abstract     = {Aspartate (Asp) metabolism-mediated antioxidant functions have important implications for neonatal growth and intestinal health; however, the antioxidant mechanisms through which Asp regulates the gut microbiota and influences RIP activation remain elusive. This study reports that chronic oxidative stress disrupts gut microbiota and metabolite balance and that such imbalance is intricately tied to the perturbation of Asp metabolism. Under normal conditions, in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that exogenous Asp improves intestinal health by regulating epithelial cell proliferation, nutrient uptake, and apoptosis. During oxidative stress, Asp reduces Megasphaera abundance while increasing Ruminococcaceae . This reversal effect depends on the enhanced production of the antioxidant eicosapentaenoic acid mediated through Asp metabolism and microbiota. Mechanistically, the application of exogenous Asp orchestrates the antioxidant responses in enterocytes via the modulation of the RIP3-MLKL and RIP1-Nrf2-NF-κB pathways to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species and maintain mitochondrial functionality and cellular survival. These results demonstrate that Asp signaling alleviates oxidative stress by dynamically modulating the gut microbiota and RIP-dependent mitochondrial function, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress disease treatment.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc ion batteries are often adversely affected by the poor stability of zinc metal anodes. Persistent water-induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth have seriously damaged the long-term service life of aqueous zinc ion batteries. In this paper, it is reported that a zinc sulfide with optimized electron arrangement on the surface of zinc anode is used to modify the zinc anode to achieve long-term cycle stability of zinc anode. The effective active sites of the zinc metal anode surface are first significantly improved by a simple ultrasound-assisted etching strategy, and then the in situ zinc sulfide interface phase further guides the zinc ion deposition behavior on the surface of the zinc metal anode. The zinc sulfide protective layer well regulates the interfacial electric field and the migration of Zn 2+ , thereby significantly promoting the homogenization of zinc ion flux to achieve dendrite-free deposition. In addition, the aqueous zinc ion full cell assembled based on ZnS@3D-Zn anode achieves better output performance in long-term cycles. In summary, this work sheds light on the importance of reasonable interfacial modification for the development of dendrite-free and stable zinc anode chemistry, which opens up a new path for promoting the development of zinc-based batteries.},

  abstract     = {High temperature-proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFC) call for ionomers with low humidity dependence and elevated-temperature resistance. Traditional perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomers encounter challenges in meeting these stringent requirements. Herein, this study reports a perfluoroimide multi-acid (PFMA) ionomer with dual active centers achieved through the incorporation of sulfonimide and phosphonic acid groups into the side chain. The fluorocarbon skeleton and multi-acid side chain structure facilitate the segregation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic microphases, augmenting the short-range ordering of hydrophilic nanodomains. Furthermore, the introduction of a rigid segment-benzene ring is employed to decrease side chain flexibility and raise the glass transition temperature. Notably, the prepared membrane exhibits a conductivity of 41 mS cm −1 at 40% relative humidity, showcasing a 1.8 times improvement over that of PFSA. Additionally, the power output of the H 2 -air fuel cell based on this membrane reaches 1.5 W cm −2 at 105 °C, marking a substantial 2.3 times enhancement compared to the PFSA. This work demonstrates the unique advantages of perfluorinated ionomers with multiple protogenic groups in the development of high-performance high-temperature electrolyte materials.},

Within this platform, activation of keratinocyte inflammation promotes monocyte migration out of the vascular channel and into the dermal and epidermal compartments. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals dynamic and cell-specific patterns of gene expression that are characteristic of acute activation and resolution of an inflammatory immune response, and the gene signatures of the monocyte-derived cells closely matches the differentiation trajectory of the monocytes into mature dermal macrophages. The microfluidic HSE is also applied to modeling age-associated immune dysfunction and accurately replicates elevated monocyte recruitment in aged skin. Thus, the microfluidic HSE presented here replicates key aspects of dynamic inflammatory immune responses and represents a tractable experimental tool for interrogating mechanisms of human skin immunology.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves the recombination of diamagnetic hydroxyl (OH) or water (H 2 O) into the paramagnetic triplet state of oxygen (O 2 ). The spin conservation of oxygen intermediates plays a crucial role in OER, however, research on spin dynamics during the catalytic process remains in its early stages. Herein, β -Ni(OH) 2 and Fe-doped β -Ni(OH) 2 (Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 ) are utilized as model catalysts to understand the mechanism of spin magnetic effects at iron (III) sites during OER. Combined with magnetic characterization, it is founded that the introduction of Fe transforms the antiferromagnetic Ni(OH) 2 into a ferromagnetic material. Testing the magnetic response of the catalyst under an external magnetic field, the OER activity of Ni 5 Fe 1 (OH) 2 is significantly enhanced in comparison to Ni(OH) 2 . This improvement is likely due to the introduction of iron sites, which promote spin magnetic effects and enhance reaction kinetics, thereby increasing catalytic efficiency. Combining experimental and theoretical characterization, it is discovered that the iron sites accelerate the formation of heterogeneous dual-site O─O bridging, represented as ─Ni─O─O─Fe─, thereby effectively enhancing the kinetics of the OER reaction. This study provides a magnetic perspective on the structure-function relationship of magnetic iron-based catalysts and has significant implications for the design of new catalysts.},

Despite its potential, progress in this domain is constrained by material limitations and the intricate nature of the underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have achieved efficient regulation of ferroelectric polarization and thermal conductivity in chiral ferroelectric thin films through the application of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light (LCP and RCP). Differential absorption of circularly polarized light (CPL) induces nonequilibrium carrier dynamics, generating distinctive interfacial electrostatic fields that enable precise control of ultrathin ferroelectric films. For (R)-BINOL−DIPASi and (S)-BINOL−DIPASi (C 26 H 26 O 2 Si), polarization changes surpass 23%, exhibiting opposite response under LCP and RCP excitation. In R chiral films, remnant polarization decreases from 1.05 µC cm − 2 under LCP to 0.85 µC cm − 2 under RCP, whereas in S chiral films, polarization increases from 0.85 µC cm − 2 under LCP to 0.98 µC cm − 2 under RCP.

There is a significant need to develop an alloy-based anode that can be industrially manufactured and offers high reversible capacity. This necessitates a profound understanding of the interplay between structural changes and electrochemical performance. Here, operando X-ray imaging is used to correlate the morphological evolution to electrochemical performance in foil and foam systems. The 3D Sn-foam-like structure electrode is fabricated in-house as a practical approach to accommodate the volume expansion and alleviate the mechanical stress experienced upon alloying/dealloying. Results show that generating pores in Sn electrodes can help manage the volume expansion and mitigate the severe mechanical stress in thick electrodes during alloying/dealloying processes.

The experimental results demonstrate that the deoxygenation dynamics are governed by the interaction between the hydrogen partial pressure and the surface area of the hydrogen plasma arc irradiation range. Furthermore, the results of the detailed characterization of the recycled titanium alloys indicate that hydrogen plasma arc technology not only reduces the oxygen content to levels compliant with industrial standards for Ti-6Al-4 V but also substantially enhances the tensile strength and ductility of Ti-6Al-4 V compared with those of conventional cast titanium alloys. The results of microstructural analysis show that hydrogen tends to concentrate in the β phase, whereas oxygen is predominantly found in the α phase.

To appropriately regulate AMI-associated inflammation, HM4oRL is herein designed, an innovative bifunctional therapeutic nanoplatform capable of inhibiting cardiomyocyte pyroptosis while reprogramming inflammatory signaling.

The unique properties of this hybrid membrane layer facilitated HM4oRL targeting to the injured myocardium during early-stage AMI in mice, whereupon the release of 4-Ol and modified MPN synergistically inhibited cardiomyocyte pyroptosis while suppressing inflammatory monocytes/macrophage responses at the infarcted site. Mechanistically, HM4oRL preserved cardiac metabolic homeostasis through AMPK signaling activation, establishing favorable microenvironmental conditions for the reprogramming of CRM-mediated inflammation. Ultimately, HM4oRL treatment is able to resolve inflammation, enhance neovascularization, and suppress myocardial fibrosis, reducing the infarct size and enhancing post-AMI cardiac repair such that it is an innovative approach to the targeted treatment of AMI.},

  abstract     = {Ruthenium (Ru)-based electrocatalysts have shown promise for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) due to their ability to facilitate water dissociation in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, their performance is limited by strong hydrogen binding, which hinders hydrogen desorption and water re-adsorption. This study reports the development of RuNi nanoalloys supported on MoO 2 , which optimize the hydrogen binding strength at Ru sites through modulation by adjacent Ni atoms. Theoretical simulations reveal that substituting Ni atoms for adjacent Ru atoms reduces the high hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy on Ru while maintaining a low energy barrier for water dissociation. As a result, the RuNi/MoO₂ catalyst shows excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of 51 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm⁻ 2 , outperforming commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, RuNi/MoO₂ demonstrates high turnover frequency (7.06 s −1 ), mass activity (13.4 A mg −1 ), and price activity (1030.77 A dollar −1 ). In an AEMWE cell, RuNi/MoO₂ as the cathode catalyst achieves a current density of 1 A cm −2 at 60 °C with just 1.7 V using 1 m KOH.

Among the series, the sample prepares at 300 A for 10 s exhibits the best performance, with an overpotential of only −31 mV for HER and +240 mV for OER to reach the current density of 10 mA cm⁻ 2 . Additionally, the catalyst demonstrates excellent durability, with minimal impacts of electrolyte salinity. With the sample as the bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.43 V is needed to reach 10 mA cm⁻ 2 , 160 mV lower than that with a commercial 20% Pt/C and RuO₂/C mixture. These results highlight the significant potential of MIH in the ultrafast synthesis of high-performance catalysts for electrochemical water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production from seawater.},

  abstract     = {Polybromo-1 (PBRM1) serves as a crucial regulator of gene transcription in various tumors, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). However, the exact role of PBRM1 in iCCA and the mechanism by which it regulates downstream target genes remain unclear. This research has revealed that PBRM1 is significantly downregulated in iCCA tissues, and this reduced expression is linked to aggressive clinicopathological features and a poor prognosis. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that PBRM1 can impede iCCA progression, and a gene therapy nanomedicine is developed to treat iCCA in vivo by modulating PBRM1 expression. The heightened expression of PBRM1 induces by the nanomedicine substantially inhibited tumor growth in iCCA. Conversely, the decrease in PBRM1 results in the abnormal activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, a reduction in p16, p53/p21, and cellular senescence, thereby promoting iCCA advancement. Treatment with U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, effectively halted iCCA progression by regulating the PBRM1-ERK1/2-cellular senescence pathway. These findings underscore the significant role of PBRM1 in controlling iCCA progression and predicting prognosis. Targeting the PBRM1-ERK1/2-cellular senescence pathway with U0126 shows promise for clinical applications in treating iCCA.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable batteries are central to modern energy storage systems, from portable electronics to electric vehicles. The cathode material, a critical component, largely dictates a battery&#39;s energy density, capacity, and overall performance. This review focuses on the application of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study cathode materials in Li-ion, Na-ion, Li–S, and Na–S batteries. Operando XAS provides real-time insights into the local electronic structure, oxidation states, and coordination environments, which are crucial for understanding complex electrochemical processes, such as redox reactions, phase transitions, and structural degradation. The review highlights the strengths of hard and soft XAS techniques in probing transition metal (TM) and anionic redox processes, particularly in layered oxide cathodes, where reversible oxygen redox and TM behavior are pivotal. The role of operando XAS is also explored in analyzing conversion-type S-based cathodes, where it helps unravel the intricate reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges of in situ cell design for operando XAS, especially under ultrahigh vacuum conditions for soft XAS. By discussing recent advancements and future directions, this review underscores the critical role of operando XAS in driving innovation and improving the design and performance of next-generation battery technologies.},

  abstract     = {Although a fraction of functional peptides concealed within long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is identified, it remains unclear whether lncRNA-encoded peptides are involved in the malignancy of cervical cancer (CC). Here, a 92-amino acid peptide is discovered, which is named TUBORF, encoded by lncRNA TUBA3FP and highly expressed in CC tissues. TUBORF inhibits ferroptosis to promote the malignant proliferation of CC cells. Mechanistically, human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6 and E7 upregulate TUBORF through CREB-binding protein (CBP)/E1A-binding protein p300 (p300)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) of lncTUBA3FP enhancer. Furthermore, E6 and E7 elevate and recruit acetyltransferase establishment of sister chromatid cohesion N-acetyltransferase 1 (ESCO1) to bind to and acetylate TUBORF, which facilitates the degradation of immunity-related GTPase Q (IRGQ) via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in the inhibition of ferroptosis and promotion of the malignant proliferation of CC cells. Importantly, silencing ESCO1 or TURORF amplifies anticancer effects by paclitaxel both in CC cells and in vivo. These novel findings reveal oncopeptide TUBORF and its acetyltransferase ESCO1 as important regulators of ferroptosis and tumorigenesis during cervical cancer pathogenesis and establish the scientific basis for targeting these molecules for treating CC.},

  abstract     = {T-cell lymphoma (TCL) is a group of non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma with high heterogeneity and unfavorable prognosis. Current standard treatments have demonstrated limited efficacy in improving the outcomes for TCL patients. Therefore, identification of novel drug targets is urgently needed to improve the prognosis of TCL patients. Through multi-omics analysis, aberrant expression of threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK) in TCL is identified. High expression of TTK is closely associated with poor prognosis in TCL patients. Targeting TTK through gene knockdown exerts anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo, including inhibiting the cell proliferation, inducing G2/M phase arrest, enhancing DNA damage and cell apoptosis. Mechanically, p38α is identified as the potential phosphorylation substrate of TTK through phosphoproteomic quantification and motif prediction. Furthermore, inhibition of TTK suppresses activation of p38α through dephosphorylating it at Thr180/Tyr182, thereby promoting the activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway. In addition, targeting TTK enhances the autophagy in TCL cells through dephosphorylating p38α. CFI-402257, a specific inhibitor of TTK, is found to exhibit anti-tumor effects and exerted synergistic efficacy with PI3K inhibitor, Duvelisib, in TCL. The study shows that TTK contributes to the development of TCL by regulating p38α-mediated AMPK/mTOR pathway. CFI-402257 is expected to be a promising strategy for TCL treatment.},

Assessment of inflammatory bowel disease has emerged as a promising clinical application of optoacoustic tomography. In this context, preclinical studies in animal models are essential to identify novel disease-specific imaging biomarkers and understand findings from emerging clinical pilot studies, however to-date, these studies have been limited by the precise identification of the bowel wall. Herein, a transrectal-absorber guide is applied, serving as a high-contrast landmark for 3D optoacoustic tomography of the colon. This study shows that guided multispectral optoacoustic tomography is able to measure changes in blood oxygenation status over the course of acute, chemically-induced colitis in mice and correlates with standard disease activity scores. This novel approach depicts intestinal hemoglobin composition non-invasively during murine inflammation.

  abstract     = {Imaging luminescence kinetics is invaluable in many fields, including biology and chemistry. However, the luminescence lifetime of most photo-activated states is in the low ns-µs range and its measurement requires adding costly image intensifiers to cameras to access the fast phenomena present. Here, the Rectified Imaging under Optical Modulation (RIOM) and Heterodyne Imaging under Optical Modulation (HIOM) protocols make this possible with standard low-cost cameras only, even under ambient light. RIOM and HIOM originate from a thorough theoretical analysis, which showed that modulated illumination of any reversibly photoactivable luminophore probed at high frequency generates components of the luminescence response that are detectable at low frequency: RIOM harnesses the mean luminescence response to modulated light at a single frequency, whereas HIOM exploits the luminescence response to modulated light at two close frequencies. When the luminophore behavior obeys a two-state model, the frequency dependence of the RIOM and HIOM observables can be used to extract a photoactivation time. In this work, their ability to retrieve maps of the luminescence lifetime of a reversibly photoswitchable protein, and phosphorescent microsensors are demonstrated. Where the luminophore does not obey a two-state model, RIOM and HIOM can still retrieve rich information, as here exemplified by the recovery of kinetic fingerprints of the physiological state of a plant.},

Herein, we first report that secernin 2 (SCRN2), an uncharacterized gene in human cancer, acts as a novel tumor suppressor in TNBC to inhibit cancer progression and enhance therapeutic sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. SCRN2 is downregulated in TNBC through chaperone-mediated autophagic degradation, and its downregulation is associated with poor patient prognosis. Moreover, SCRN2 impedes the proteasomal degradation of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) by recruiting Bcl2-associated athanogene 2 to block the interaction of KMT2C with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP. Consistently, SCRN2 transcriptionally activates Bcl2-modifying factor by amplifying histone H3 monomethylation at lysine 4 at its enhancer, thereby inducing intrinsic apoptosis. Notably, KMT2C knockdown restores the impaired TNBC progression caused by SCRN2 overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SCRN2 decreases the expression of key DNA repair-related genes and induces endogenous DNA damage, thus conferring therapeutic sensitivity of TNBC cells to PARP inhibition.   Collectively, these findings identify SCRN2 as a novel suppressor of TNBC, reveal its mechanism of action, and highlight its potential role in TNBC therapy.},

Here, it is found that pristimerin significantly triggered the activation of autophagy initiation and induced apoptosis in TNBC. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing revealed that pristimerin activated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracelluar regulated protein kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway. Drug affinity responsive target stability and mass spectrometry techniques are employed to confirm the direct binding target of pristimerin. Heat shock protein family A member 8 (HSPA8) is identified and verified by cellular thermal shift assays and surface plasmon resonance assays. The further results suggested that pristimerin promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of HSPA8, leading to a decrease in the degradation of Vac Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 1 (VAV1), a downstream client protein of HSPA8 which plays a crucial role in activating the ERK pathway. Importantly, knockdown of HSPA8 or VAV1 significantly impaired the anticancer activity of pristimerin on TNBC cells. Additionally, pristimerin significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of TNBC cells and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to doxorubicin. Collectively, this study provides the initial evidence that pristimerin directly targets HSPA8 to activate the VAV1/ERK pathway, thereby promoting cell autophagy and apoptosis.},

It has a crucial role in various biological processes, such as oxidative stress, cell cycle, heme homeostasis, and immune regulation. Recent research highlights BACH1&#39;s significant regulatory roles in a series of conditions, including stem cell pluripotency maintenance and differentiation, growth, senescence, and apoptosis. BACH1 is closely associated with cardiovascular diseases and contributes to angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, pathological cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. BACH1 promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis by altering tumor metabolism and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. Moreover, BACH1 appears to show an adverse role in diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, leukemia, pulmonary fibrosis, and skin diseases. Inhibiting BACH1 may be beneficial for treating these diseases.

  abstract     = {Sepsis is a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often leading to high mortality rates. The intestine, owing to its distinct structure and physiological environment, plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. It functions as the “central organ” or “engine” in the progression of sepsis, with intestinal injury exacerbating the condition. Despite the availability of current therapies that offer partial symptom relief, they fall short of adequately protecting the intestinal barrier. In this study, an advanced nanodrug formulation (OLA@MΦ NPs) is developed by coating macrophage membranes onto polymeric organic nanoparticles encapsulating olaparib. When loaded into pH-responsive capsules, an intestine-decipher engineered capsule (cp-OLA@MΦ NPs) is successfully formulated. Upon oral administration in septic mice, these capsules withstand gastric acid and release their contents in the intestine, specifically targeting injured tissues. The released OLA@MΦ NPs effectively neutralize pro-inflammatory cytokines via macrophage membrane receptors, while olaparib inhibits intestinal epithelial parthanatos (a form of programmed cell death) by suppressing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation. This strategy significantly reduces bacterial translocation, slows the progression of sepsis, and enhances survival in septic mice, thus presenting a promising therapeutic approach for sepsis in clinical applications.},

This study aimed to develop an interpretable model for predicting survival in NSCLC patients with brain metastases (BM) integrating radiomic features and RNA sequencing data. 292 samples are collected and analyzed utilizing T1/T2 MRIs. Bidirectional stepwise logistic regression is employed to identify significant variables, facilitating the construction of a prognostic model, which is benchmarked against four machine learning algorithms. BM tissue samples are processed for RNA extraction and sequencing. The optimal model achieved an AUC of 0.96 and a C-index of 0.89 in the train set and an AUC of 0.84 with a C-index of 0.78 in the test set, indicating strong predictive performance and generalizability. Patients from Xiangya Hospital are stratified into high-risk (n = 11) and low-risk (n = 30) groups. RNA sequencing revealed an enrichment of immune-related pathways, particularly the interferon (IFN) pathway in the low-risk group. Immune cell infiltration analysis identified a significant presence of CD8 + -T cells, IFNγ-6/-18 in the low-risk group, suggesting an immunologically favorable tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the potential of combining radiomic and RNA sequencing data for improved survival predictions and personalized treatment strategies in BM patients from NSCLC.},

This study introduces a novel collagen-lignin sponge (CLS), a renewable biomass-based material that combines collagen&#39;s acoustic properties with lignin&#39;s structural benefits. CLSs demonstrate high porosity (&gt;0.97), lightweight (10 mg cm − 3 ), and exceptional broadband noise absorption performance (sound absorption coefficient exceeding 0.9 across 2000–6300 Hz). Due to their unique hierarchical and aligned pore structure, CLSs display superior low-frequency sound-absorbing capabilities and a high noise-reduction coefficient of 0.64 (for a 30-mm-thick sample). A geometric model is also developed to evaluate and predict the sound absorption performance with high consistency to the experimental results. Additionally, the inclusion of lignin as a green crosslinker has significantly improved the thermal stability and compressive strength by ≈600% compared to collagen sponges alone. The innovative integration of collagen and lignin in this study not only leverages the benefits of renewable resources but also presents a cost-effective and straightforward preparation process, positioning CLS as a promising alternative for the construction of sound-absorbing materials seeking sustainable solutions.},

  abstract     = {Circularly Polarized Light (CPL)-dependent anomalous photovoltaic effect (APVE), characterized by light helicity-manipulated steady photocurrent and above-bandgap photovoltage, has demonstrated significant potential in the fields of photoelectronic and photovoltaics. However, exploiting CPL-dependent APVE in chiral hybrid perovskites, a promising family with intrinsic chiroptical activity and non-centrosymmetric structure, remains challenging. Here, leveraging the flexible structural design of chiral alternating cations intercalation-type perovskites, CPL-dependent APV, for the first time, is achieved in chiral perovskites. Specifically, by introducing lone pair electrons into the organic layers to greatly amplify the polarization, [(R)-PPA](MOPA)PbBr 4 ( 2-R ) (PPA = 1-phenylpropylammonium, MOPA = 3-methoxypropylammonium) exhibit intrinsic APVE with an above-bandgap photovoltage of 6.50 V ( E g = 3.01 eV) under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination. Strikingly, profiting from the natural chiral optical activity of chiral perovskites, unprecedented UV CPL-dependent APV is realized in 2-R , driving the high distinguishability between right-hand and left-hand CPLs with a large anisotropy factor ( g Iph ) of 0.33.

They feature an uneven and narrow and tunable lineshape and are ideally suited for optical spectroscopy. Many Fano resonance structures have been suggested in nanophotonics over the last ten years, but reconfigurability and tailored design remain challenging. Herein, an all-optical “pick-and-place” approach aimed at assembling Fano metamolecules of various geometries and compositions in a reconfigurable manner is proposed. Their coupling behavior by in situ dark-field scattering spectroscopy is studied. Driven by a light-directed opto-thermoelectric field, silicon nanoparticles with high-quality-factor Mie resonances (discrete states) and low-loss BaTiO 3 nanoparticles (continuum states) are assembled into all-dielectric heterodimers, where distinct Fano resonances are observed. The Fano parameter can be adjusted by changing the resonant frequency of the discrete states or the light polarization. Tunable coupling strength and multiple Fano resonances by altering the number of continuum states and discrete states in dielectric heterooligomers are also shown. This work offers a general design rule for Fano resonance and an all-optical platform for controlling Fano coupling on demand.},

  abstract     = {Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by reduced platelet levels and heightened susceptibility to bleeding resulting from augmented autologous platelet destruction and diminished thrombopoiesis. Although antibody-mediated autoimmune reactions are widely recognized as primary factors, the precise etiological agents that trigger ITP remain unidentified. The pathogenesis of ITP remains unclear owing to the absence of comprehensive high-throughput data, except for the belated emergence of autoreactive antibodies. In this study, using flow cytometry (FCM), proteomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing of samples from patients with ITP, it is shown that exosome-mediated lectin complement pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of ITP, which triggers and enlarges the complement activation cascade without effective regulation because of downregulated CD55. The activated complement system enhances the immune response and resistin and further Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) triggers several proinflammatory signaling pathways, which contribute to the survival of hyperactivated immune cells and dysfunctional arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. The resistin and MIF are also identified as potential contributors to resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Taken together, the findings indicate that the lectin pathway of the complement system, resistin, MIF, and AA metabolism may serve as promising targets for ITP treatment, offering novel perspectives on potential therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {Sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction is an emerging class of click chemistry reaction. Owing to its efficient reactivity under physiological conditions, SuFEx reaction is used to construct covalent protein drugs. Herein, a covalent affibody-molecular glue drug conjugate nanoagent is reported, which can irreversibly bind with its target protein through proximity-enabled SuFEx reaction. As a proof of concept, a latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid fluorosulfate-L-tyrosine (FSY) is first introduced at site 36 of the affibody with cysteine mutation (Z HER2:342 -Cys) to produce Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -Cys. Subsequently, Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -Cys is coupled with a molecular glue drug (CR8) to yield an amphiphilic conjugate of Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8, which can self-assemble into affibody–drug conjugate nanoagent (Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN) in PBS. When Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN specific binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on cancer cells, the FSY36 of Z HER2:342 approaches to the His490 of HER2 and ultimately reacts with each other to form a covalent bond via SuFEx reaction. Such a covalent binding mode endows Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN with permanent binding ability to effectively increase the concentration of drugs in tumor. Eventually, the covalent Z HER2:342 -36 FSY -CR8 ADCN exhibits an outstanding tumor inhibition ratio of 90.03 ± 4.29% in HER2-positive ovary tumor models, strikingly higher than that of the noncovalent one (64.25 ± 7.71%).},

While extracellular vesicles (EVs) offer promise for treating muscle atrophy, their therapeutic potential is hindered by challenges in delivery and bioactivity within the complex microenvironment of the injury site. To address this issue, an injectable hydrogel is developed that is responsive to both ultrasound and pH, with inherent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, designed to improve the targeted delivery of stem cell-derived EVs. This hydrogel system allows for controlled release of EVs from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs), adapting to the specific conditions of the injury environment. In vivo studies using a rat model of nerve injury demonstrated that the EV-loaded hydrogel (EVs@UR-gel) significantly preserved muscle function. Six weeks post-nerve reconstruction, treated rats exhibited muscle strength, circumference, and wet weight reaching 89.53 ± 0.96%, 76.02 ± 7.49%, and 88.0 ± 2.65% of healthy controls, respectively, alongside an improvement in the sciatic nerve index (−0.11 ± 0.09).

The solubility of methane is increased by putting it in contact with water containing dissolved KCl or NaCl (3%). Being fully dispersed as microbubbles (20–40 µm in diameter), methane reacts more fully with hydroxyl radicals (OH·) at the gas-water interface. The alternating voltage (100 mV) generates two synergistic POM processes dominated by Cl − → Cl· + e − and O 2 + e − → O 2 −• under positive and negative potentials, respectively. By tuning the frequency and amplitude, the extent and path of the POM process can be precisely controlled so that more than 90% methanol is selectively formed compared to the two byproducts, dichloromethane, and acetic acid. The methane to methanol conversion yield is estimated to be 57% at a rate of approximately 887 µM h −1 . This method appears to have potential for removing methane from air using seawater or for converting higher-concentration methane sources into value-added methanol.},

  abstract     = {Current treatments for ulcerative colitis (UC) remain limited, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Trilobatin (TLB), a naturally derived food additive, exhibits potential anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced animal model is used to investigate the effects of TLB on UC. It is found TLB significantly alleviates DSS-induced UC in mice, as evidenced by a reduction in the disease activity index, an increase in colon length, improvement in histopathological lesions. Furthermore, TLB treatment results in a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines. TLB mitigates UC by modulating the intestinal microbiota, particularly Akkermansia , which enhances tryptophan metabolism and upregulates the production of xanthurenic acid (XANA). To confirm the role of TLB-induced microbiota changes, experiments are performed with pseudogerm-free mice and fecal transplantation. It is also identified XANA as a key metabolite that mediates TLB&#39;s protective effects. Both TLB and XANA markedly activate the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Administration of an AhR antagonist abrogates their protective effects, thereby confirming the involvement of AhR in the underlying mechanism. In conclusion, the study reveals a novel mechanism through which TLB alleviates UC by correcting microbiota imbalances, regulating tryptophan metabolism, enhancing XANA production, and activating AhR.},

The results showed that reduced oxygen levels in the small intestine of neonatal rats induced by Saccharomyces boulardii accelerated microbiome colonization and type 3 immunity development, which protected against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection. Microbiome maturation increased the abundance of microbiome-encoded bile salt hydrolase ( BSH ) genes and hyocholic acid (HCA) levels. Furthermore, reducing oxygen levels in the intestine increased the abundance of Limosilactobacillus reuteri , a bacterium encoding BSH , and promoted intestinal type 3 immunity. However, inhibition of BSH blocked the L. reuteri- induced development of intestinal type 3 immunity. Mechanistically, HCA promoted the development of gamma-delta T cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells by stabilizing the mRNA expression of RAR-related orphan receptor C via the farnesoid X receptor–WT1-associated protein-N6-methyl-adenosine axis. These results reveal that gut microbiota-derived HCA plays a crucial role in promoting the development of intestinal type 3 immunity in neonates. This discovery introduces potential therapeutic avenues for strengthening intestinal immunity in early life or treating bacterial infections by targeting microbial metabolites.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial keratitis (BK) is a type of corneal inflammation resulting from bacterial infection in the eye. Although nanozymes have been explored as promising materials in corneal wound healing, currently available nanozymes lack sufficient catalytic activity and the ability to penetrate bacterial biofilms, limiting their efficacy against the treatment of BK. To remedy this, ZnFe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe-LDH) nanosheets are loaded with Cu single-atom nanozymes (Cu-SAzymes) and aminated dextran (Dex-NH 2 ), resulting in the formation of the nanozyme DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu, which possesses peroxidase (POD)-, oxidase (OXD)-, and catalase (CAT)-like catalytic activities. This enables the nanozyme to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals ( • OH), superoxide anion radical (O 2 •− ), and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) from hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), thereby killing the bacteria causing the infections. The surface Dex-NH 2 enabled the DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu to penetrate the biofilm and adsorb onto extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria in the biofilm. Additionally, the DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu successfully repaired P. aeruginosa -infected corneal injury in a BK rabbit model more effectively than commercially available tobramycin eye drops. This was enabled, in part, by the ability of DT-ZnFe-LDH@Cu to reduce inflammation by promoting the polarization of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) to anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and decrease the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) to promote wound healing without scar formation. This study provides an innovative concept for the treatment of BK and holds great scientific value and clinical application potential.},

  abstract     = {MXene is widely used in the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding field. However, the high electromagnetic reflectivity of pure MXene causes potential secondary EMI pollution. This study presents a hollow egg-box structure used in MXene composite film, by which the reflectivity (R) could decrease from 0.98 to 0.54 and absorbance (A) increased from 0.02 to 0.45, effectively decreasing the high electromagnetic reflectivity of pure MXene. Additionally, compared to pure MXene films, the MXene composite films exhibit improved electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) and SSE/t. The prepared films achieve a peak EMI SE of 69.19 dB at 12.4 GHz, which is 1.3 times higher than pure MXene, and a peak SSE/t of 27 888 dB cm 2 g⁻¹ at 12.4 GHz, 1.4 times that of pure MXene. The hollow egg-box structure not only enhances the electromagnetic shielding performance beyond pure MXene but also demonstrates outstanding performance compared to most reported MXene films, balancing lightweight material properties with effective shielding. Furthermore, the prepared MXene composite films with the hollow egg-box structure show improved water resistance. Therefore, MXene composite films with hollow egg-box structures are promising candidates for advanced EMI devices in future lightweight materials.},

  abstract     = {Feeding behavior changes induced by opioid addiction significantly contribute to the worsening opioid crisis. Activation of the reward system has shown to provoke binge eating disorder in individuals with opioid use disorder, whereas prolonged opioid exposure leads to weight loss. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these phenomena is essential for addressing this pressing societal issue. This study demonstrates that weight loss resulting from feeding behavior changes during morphine addiction requires the activation of the ventral tegmental area dopamine (DA) system, which suppresses the orexin feeding center. Specifically, DA exerts an inhibitory effect on orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus area (LHA) through a feedforward inhibition mediated by GABA neurons in the LHA, involving D1 receptors (D1R) and T-type Ca 2+ channels. Moreover, the morphine addiction-induced reduction in body weight and food intake can be reversed by the D1R antagonist SCH23390 and chemogenetic silencing of GABA neurons in the LHA. These findings delineate a neuromodulatory mechanism underlying morphine addiction-associated feeding behavior changes and weight loss.},

This study involves 19 patients with pharmacologically resistant epilepsy who participate in a delayed match/mismatch sample task designed to separately assess their ability to discriminate between low-arousal and high-arousal emotions. Three groups of 11 brain subregions, with dominant lateralization, compose a network, which is identified as responsible for discriminating arousal-dependent emotions. The connection of these subregions, leading by the left insula and right middle temporal gyrus, defines the pathways for discriminating emotions with different arousals. Further, the separated network patterns related to emotional discrimination are face-independent. Overall, the left insula and the right middle temporal gyrus emerge as core components in the network, which plays key roles in the dynamic course for discriminating low- and high-arousal emotions in the human brain.},

This study explores multiple enzyme interaction process of typhactyloside (TYP) with gut microbiota and its lipid-lowering pharmacological activity. TYP, with bioavailability of only 2.78%, is an active component of Typha angustifolia L . and Pushen capsules which is clinically treated for hyperlipidemia. The metabolic process of TYP is identified, and key enzymes involved in TYP metabolism are validated through gene knockout and overexpression techniques. Through overexpressing α-rhamnosidase (Rha) in Escherichia coli , TYP is verified to metabolize into isorhamnetin-3- O -neohesperidin (M1) and isorhamnetin-3- O -glucoside (M2) after removing rhamnose through Rha. Besides, knockout of β-glucosidase (Glu) confirms that TYP generates M3 through Glu after removing glucose. Combined with molecular docking, M3 is transformed to generate 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (M4), protocatechuic acid (M5), and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (M6) through flavonoid reductase (Flr) and chalcone isomerase (Chi). In conclusion, multiple enzymes involved in TYP metabolism (Rha/Glu→Flr→Chi) are identified. Through in vivo experiments, combined use of M3 and M5 also shows excellent anti-hyperlipidemia efficacy. This is the first study on complex metabolism mechanism and pharmacological activity of natural flavonoids mediated by multiple enzymes, which provide insight to investigate analogous natural products.},

Response to the same drug varies across patients, and the timing of treatment is an important factor in determining prognosis. Therefore, development of patient-specific preclinical models that can predict a patient&#39;s drug response within a short period is imperative. In this study, a printed gastric cancer (pGC) model is developed for preclinical chemotherapy using extrusion-based 3D bioprinting technology and tissue-specific bioinks containing patient-derived tumor chunks. The pGC model retained the original tumor characteristics and enabled rapid drug evaluation within 2 weeks of its isolation from the patient. In fact, it is confirmed that the drug response-related gene profile of pGC tissues co-cultured with human gastric fibroblasts (hGaFibro) is similar to that of patient tissues. This suggested that the application of the pGC model can potentially overcome the challenges associated with accurate drug evaluation in preclinical models (e.g., patient-derived xenografts) owing to the deficiency of stromal cells derived from the patient. Consequently, the pGC model manifested a remarkable similarity with patients in terms of response to chemotherapy and prognostic predictability. Hence, it is considered a promising preclinical tool for personalized and precise treatments.},

Itaconate, a macrophage-derived metabolite, has been implicated in inflammation and metabolic regulation. This study investigates the protective role of itaconate derivatives against IR injury. Using a mice model of IR injury, the impact of 7-day 4-Octyl itaconate (4-OI) administration on cardiac function is assessed. Exogenous administration of 4-OI significantly reduces myocardial damage, enhances angiogenesis, and alleviates myocardial hypoxia injury during reperfusion. RNA sequencing and molecular docking techniques are used to find the target of itaconate, and changes in cardiac function are observed in Immune-Responsive Gene1 (IRG1) global knockout mice. In cell culture studies, 4-OI promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration, mediated by Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway activation, particularly through Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) signaling. Inhibition of ERK blocks these beneficial effects on endothelial cells. Furthermore, itaconate synthesis inhibition worsens myocardial damage, which is mitigated by 4-OI supplementation. The results indicate that 4-OI promotes angiogenesis by activating MAPK signaling via FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt1), highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for myocardial IR injury.},

Here, by regulating the Ta wire treatment time, as well as the annealing time and temperature, larger diamond grians (5–20 nm) are successfully synthesized, and the transition process of graphite to diamond is revealed to vary with Ta concentration. Specifically, short Ta wire treatments (5–10 min) induce graphite to form a “circle” structure and transforms into diamond directly after annealing. Long Ta wire treatments (15–25 min) produce larger and more “circle” structures, containing an increased number of graphite layers. After annealing at 1100 °C for 30–120 min, graphite first transforms into amorphous carbon, then to i-Carbon and n-Diamond, and finally to diamond. Notably, a large amount of n-Diamond and diamond are formed after 120 min annealing. By modulating the annealing temperature from 500 to 1200 °C for 30 min, diamond is already obtained at 500 °C, and hexagonal diamond up to 20 nm in size at 1200 °C.

In this study, we cloned a gene, CTB6 , encoding a lipid transfer protein involved in cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice, based on our previous fine-mapped quantitative trait locus (QTL) qCTB10-2 . CTB6 is mainly expressed in the tapetum and young microspores of the anther. CTB6 interacts with catalases (CATs) to maintain their stability, thereby scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in anthers and facilitating tapetum development under cold stress conditions. Additionally, CTB6 has lipid-binding ability and affects the lipid content in anthers to regulate cold tolerance at the booting stage. Haplotype analysis and promoter activity assay revealed a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-489 variation in the promoter of CTB6 , which enhances its expression and results in improved cold tolerance in Hap1-K varieties. The CTB6 near-isogenic line (NIL) exhibited enhanced cold tolerance at the booting stage, with no significant effects on other agronomic traits. Our findings uncover a natural variation of CTB6 for cold tolerance at the booting stage and provide new genetic resources for cold tolerance breeding in rice.},

A functionally graded oxide scale comprising an outer dense layer and an underlying fine granular layer formed. The former is a better oxygen barrier owing to fewer cracks and the latter has high strain tolerance due to finer grain size. The uniform dissolving of ≈4 mol% Ti in the inner layer results in grain refinement via sluggish diffusion and thus stress release. For the outer layer, Ti segregation at the nanoscale leads to a metastable cubic (Hf,Zr,Ti)O 2 and local severe lattice distortion, inhibiting the propagation of cracks. Ti ions’ unique dissolving in the oxide scale enables a strong oxygen diffusion barrier with high strain tolerance, which is responsible for superior performance.

Herein, a nanocapsuled delivery system that scavenges NETs dual-responsively to near-infrared light as a switch and to NETs themselves as a microenvironment sensor is designed. Besides, the photothermal and photodynamic effects endow the nanocapsules with antibacterial properties. Together with the ability to clear NETs, these features facilitate the restoration of the normal host response. The immunocorrective properties and inherent pro-osteogenic effects finally promote local bone repair. Together, the NET scavenging nanocapsules address the challenge of impaired bone repair in chronic infections due to biased host response caused by excessive NETs. This study provides new concepts and strategies for repairing bone destruction attributable to chronic infections via correcting biased host responses in chronic infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {MicroRNA (miRNA)-based therapy holds significant potential; however, its structural limitations pose a challenge to the full exploitation of its biomedical functionality. Framework nucleic acids are promising owing to their transportability, biocompatibility, and functional editability. MiRNA-125 is embedded into a nucleic acid framework to create an enzyme-responsive nanoparachute (NP), enhancing the miRNA loading capacity while preserving the attributes of small-scale framework nucleic acids and circumventing the uncertainty related to RNA exposure in conventional loading methods. An enzyme-sensitive sequence is designed in NP as a bioswitchable apparatus for cargo miRNAs release. NP is compared with conventional delivery modes and delivery vehicles, confirming its excellent transportability and sustained release properties. Moreover, NP confers good enzyme and serum resistance to the cargo miRNAs. Simultaneously, it can easily deliver miRNA-125 to liver and kidney lesions owing to its passive targeting properties. This allows for Keap1/Nrf2 pathway regulation and p53 protein targeting in the affected tissues. Additionally, NP negatively regulates the expression of Bax and Caspase-3. These combined actions help to inhibit oxidation, prevent cell cycle arrest, and reduce the apoptosis of liver and kidney cells. Consequently, this strategy offers a potential treatment for acute liver and kidney injury.},

Here, a core–shell strategy involving a soft-core hexahistidine metal assembly (HmA) is innovatively developed and characterized with encapsulated enzymes (catalase (CAT), horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase (GOx), and cascade enzymes (CAT+GOx)) and hard porous shells (zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), ZIF-8, ZIF-67, ZIF-90, calcium carbonate, and hydroxyapatite). The enzyme-friendly environment provided by the embedded HmA proves beneficial for enhanced catalytic activity, which is particularly effective in preserving fragile enzymes that will have been deactivated without the HmA core during the mineralization of porous shells. The enzyme encapsulated within a core–shell particle exhibits noteworthy resilience against harsh external conditions, including heat, organic solvents, and proteinase K. Additionally, no significant alteration in the catalytic behavior of the enzyme is observed after multiple cycles of usage. This study offers a novel approach for immobilizing enzymes and rendering them resistant to harsh external conditions, with potential applications in diverse fields, including biocatalysis, bioremediation, and biomedical engineering.},

Although hydrogel-based therapies have shown potential for mucosal repair, challenges remain due to inadequate targeting and low hydrogel density, leading to ongoing infiltration of harmful substances and delayed mucosal healing. In this study, an inflammation-targeting-triggered healing hydrogel (ITTH hydrogel) is developed, composed of polyvinyl alcohol-alginate microgels (PALMs) and a cyclodextrin polymer crosslinker (CPC). This hydrogel specifically targets inflamed colonic sites and crosslinks in situ to form a dense network. The results demonstrate that the ITTH hydrogel adheres effectively to inflamed colonic tissue in both IBD mouse models and human samples. The dense crosslinked network acts like the mucosal barrier, preventing the penetration of detrimental substances such as bacteria and small molecules, thereby protecting the underlying mucosal tissue. Furthermore, the ITTH hydrogel significantly improved therapeutic outcomes in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. These findings suggest that the ITTH hydrogel is a promising candidate for in situ reconstruction of colonic mucosa and the treatment of IBD.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is increasingly recognized as a whole-organ disease predominantly affecting the elderly, characterized by typical alterations in subchondral bone and cartilage, along with recurrent synovial inflammation. Despite the availability of various therapeutics and medications, a complete resolution of OA remains elusive. In this study, novel functional hydrogels are developed by integrating natural bioactive molecules for OA treatment. Specifically, baicalin (Bai) is combined with 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) to form a polymerizable monomer (HEA-Bai) through esterification, which is subjected to reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to produce Bai-based polymer (P m ). These macromolecules are incorporated into Schiff-base hydrogels, which demonstrate excellent mechanical properties and self-healing performance. Notably, the Bai-based formulations are taken up by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), where they regulate glycolysis. Mechanistically, inhibition of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) by the formulations suppressed the FLSs glycolysis and reduced the secretion of inflammatory factors, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8. Furthermore, the functional hydrogel (AG-P m )-OC, severing as a lubricant and nutrient, prolonged joint retention of Bai, thereby reducing cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation. Meanwhile, (AG-P m )-OC alleviated joint pain by targeting the YAP1 signaling and inhibiting macrophage recruitment and polarization.

  abstract     = {The conductivity of AgNWs electrodes can be enhanced by incorporating Ag grids, thereby facilitating the development of large-area flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs). Ag grids from vacuum evaporation offer the advantages of simple film formation, adjustable thickness, and unique structure. However, the complex 3D multi-component structure of AgNWs electrodes will exacerbate the aggregation of large Ag particles, causing the device short circuits. To address this issue, the relationship between the surface energy of modification layers and the morphology and conductivity of ultrathin Ag on AgNWs is studied. The amorphous ZnO (α-ZnO) layer promotes Ag growth from Volmer–Weber (VW) to Frank–Van der Merwe (FM), reducing particle aggregation. The 1 µm thick PET/AgNWs/Ag grid electrode with α-ZnO exhibited low contact resistance and high conductivity. As a result, 1 cm 2 FOSCs with Ag grids achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.01%. As the area increased to 4 and 9 cm 2 , the performance of the monolithic FOSCs is 14.70% and 12.69%, showing less efficiency loss during upscaling. The 8 and 16 cm 2 modules constructed by series and parallel connection of the monolithic devices yield PCEs of 14.47% and 12.92%, respectively. This study offers valuable insights into constructing Ag grids on AgNWs electrodes for highly efficient large-area FOSCs.},

In this study, for the first time, two new GDAs, DYF-V and DY2F-V are designed and synthesized for OSC operation, by connecting one vinylene linker with the mono-/di-fluorinated end group on two Y-series monomers, respectively. After fluorination, both DYF-V and DY2F-V exhibit bathochromic absorption and denser packing modes due to the stronger intramolecular charge transfer effect and torsion-free backbones. Through precise fluorination, the DYF-V-based devices exhibit the highest performance of 18.63% among the GDA-based OSCs, outperforming its non-fluorinated counterpart, DY-V-based ones (16.53%). Theoretical and morphological results demonstrate that proper fluorination in DYF-V-based devices strengthens intra/intermolecular interactions for enhanced crystallinity, superior phase segregation, and less energy disorder, which is beneficial for fast exciton dissociation, rapid carrier transport, and suppressed charge recombination. The work demonstrates that proper fluorination on GDAs with rigid coplanar backbones is effective for broader photon harvesting, stronger packing, and robust stability in GDA-based OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Podocyte injury and proteinuria in glomerular disease are critical indicators of acute kidney injury progression to chronic kidney disease. Renal mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated by intracellular calcium levels and oxidative stress, is a major contributor to podocyte complications. Despite various strategies targeting mitochondria to improve kidney function, effective treatments remain lacking. This study investigates the potential of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in mitigating renal fibrosis and elucidates their underlying mechanisms. In animal models of Adriamycin-induced nephropathy and 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy, GQDs treatment exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-apoptotic effects by restoring podocyte actin structure. These therapeutic benefits are associated with the downregulation of transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) activity, which is related to kidney fibrosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In vitro, GQDs suppress TRPC5, enhancing anti-fibrotic and anti-apoptotic effects by lowering calcium levels under oxidative stress and mechanical pressure. Anti-oxidative and anti-senescent effects are also confirmed. Most significantly, transcriptomics and electron microscopy analyses reveal that GQD treatment enhances mitochondrial respiration-related gene profiles and improves mitochondrial cristae morphology. These findings suggest that GQDs are a promising therapeutic nanomaterial for renal cell damage, capable of modulating calcium-dependent apoptosis associated with mitochondrial injury, potentially slowing fibrosis progression.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical CO 2 reduction in acidic media attracts extensive research attention due to its potential in increasing carbon efficiency. In most reports, alkali cations are introduced to suppress hydrogen evolution and to promote CO 2 reduction. However, the mass transport of alkali cations through cation exchange membrane induces the change of electrolyte compositions. Herein, the variation of electrolyte compositions and the flow of carbon during CO 2 reduction are analyzed quantitatively by simulation and experiments. If the initial amount of alkali cations in the anolyte is higher than the initial amount of H + in the catholyte, the pH of the catholyte increases remarkably in long-term CO 2 reduction electrolysis, resulting in the decrease of carbon efficiency. Bicarbonate salt precipitation on the cathode with alkali cation-containing catholyte is another origin of the decrease of CO 2 reduction Faradaic efficiency and carbon efficiency. To maintain high carbon efficiency, the electrolyte should contain low concentration of alkali cations or even be free of alkali cations. Decorating the catalyst of cathode with ionomer with high density of cation sites enables CO 2 reduction in pure acid solution, achieving 30-h stable carbon efficiency.},

To target these cells, a previously identified CD206 (mannose receptor)-binding peptide, mUNO was engineered to enhance its affinity and proteolytic stability. The new rationally designed peptide, MACTIDE, includes a trypsin inhibitor loop, from the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor-I. Binding studies to recombinant CD206 revealed a 15-fold lower K D for MACTIDE compared to parental mUNO. Mass spectrometry further demonstrated a 5-fold increase in MACTIDE&#39;s half-life in tumor lysates compared to mUNO. Homing studies in TNBC-bearing mice shows that fluorescein (FAM)-MACTIDE precisely targeted CD206 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) upon intravenous, intraperitoneal, and even oral administration, with minimal liver accumulation. MACTIDE was conjugated to Verteporfin, an FDA-approved photosensitizer and YAP/TAZ pathway inhibitor to create the conjugate MACTIDE-V. In the orthotopic 4T1 TNBC mouse model, non-irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice exhibited anti-tumoral effects comparable to those treated with irradiated MACTIDE-V, with fewer signs of toxicity, prompting further investigation into the laser-independent activity of the conjugate. In vitro studies using bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages showed that MACTIDE-V excluded YAP from the nucleus, increased phagocytic activity, and upregulated several genes associated with cytotoxic anti-tumoral macrophages. In mouse models of TNBC, MACTIDE-V slowed primary tumor growth, suppressed lung metastases, and increased markers of phagocytosis and antigen presentation in TAM and monocytes, increasing the tumor infiltration of several lymphocyte subsets. MACTIDE-V is proposed as a promising peptide-drug conjugate for modulating macrophage function in breast cancer immunotherapy.},

Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed that these mutations disrupt normal neurodevelopment gene regulatory networks resulting in changes in cellular composition and spatial organization. Upon xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice, eGBOs form tumors that recapitulate the transcriptional and spatial landscape of human GBM samples. Integrative single-cell trajectory analysis of both eGBO-derived tumor cells and patient GBM samples reveal the dynamic gene expression changes in developmental cell states underlying tumor progression.

  abstract     = {Ferrites are an essential material in modern industry due to their exceptional magnetic properties and high resistivity. Many applications of ferrites necessitate exposure to high energy electrons, particularly space science and particle accelerators, where charging, multipacting, and electron clouds (ECs) are major issues. ECs are of particular concern around the Ni/Zn soft ferrite kicker magnets as the large hadron collider (LHC) undergoes its high luminosity upgrade. Here, laser engineered surface structures (LESS) are used to reduce the secondary electron yield (SEY) of Ni/Zn ferrites from 2.1 to its experimentally determined minimum of 0.81, eliminating the ferrites ability to contribute to the formation of ECs. This demonstrates the applicability of LESS outside of metals and its broader applicability to reducing the SEY of technical materials.},

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) dysmetabolism, a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). This study unveiled a novel miRNA, microRNA-32533 (miR-32533), featuring a distinctive base sequence identified through RNA sequencing of the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse brain. Its role and underlying mechanisms were subsequently explored. Bioinformatics and confirmatory experiments revealed that miR-32533 had a novel 23-base sequence with minimal coding potential, functioning within the Drosha ribonuclease III (Drosha)/Dicer 1, ribonuclease III (Dicer)-dependent canonical pathway and identifiable via northern blot. miR-32533 was abundantly brain-distributed and downregulated in diverse AD-related models, including APP/PS1 and five familial AD (5×FAD) mouse brains and AD patient plasma. Overexpression or inhibition of miR-32533 led to improvements or exacerbations in cognitive dysfunction, respectively, by modulating Aβ production, apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation through targeting cAMP-responsive element binding protein 5 (CREB5), which interacted with α disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin 1 (PS1) promoters, thereby enhancing Aβ production through BACE1 and PS1 upregulation while suppressing non-amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing via ADAM10 downregulation. Furthermore, modulation of the miR-32533/CREB5 axis ameliorated or worsened cognitive impairment by inhibiting or amplifying Aβ overproduction through the BACE1-involved amyloidogenic and ADAM10-involved non-amyloidogenic pathways. Overall, the findings suggest miR-32533 as a regulator of Aβ metabolism, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, establishing the miR-32533/CREB5 signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets for combating Aβ accumulation and cognitive deficits in AD.},

Drawing inspiration from cardiac muscle fiber arrangement, a three-dimensional (3D)-printed multi-layered microporous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold is created with interlayer angles set at 45° to replicate the precise structure of native cardiac tissue. Compared with the control group and 90° PCL scaffolds, the 45° PCL scaffolds exhibited superior biocompatibility for cell culture and improved hiPSC-CM maturation in calcium handling. RNA sequencing demonstrated that the 45° PCL scaffold promotes the mature phenotype in hiPSC-CMs by upregulating ion channel genes. Using the 45° PCL scaffold, a multi-cellular EHT is successfully constructed, incorporating human cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. These complex EHTs significantly enhanced hiPSC-CM engraftment in vivo, attenuated ventricular remodeling, and improved cardiac function in mouse myocardial infarction. In summary, the myocardium-specific structured EHT developed in this study represents a promising advancement in cardiovascular regenerative medicine.},

A fascinating and less explored aspect involves the immunomodulatory behaviors of macrophage (MΦ)-derived exosomes induced by biomaterial surfaces. Herein, untreated surface, nanostructured surface, and type I collagen (Col-I)-decorated nanostructured surface of titanium implants are chosen to culture MΦs, followed by extraction of MΦ-derived exosomes and investigation of their immunomodulatory functions and mechanisms. The results show that the exosomes in the untreated group carried plenty of inflammatory cytokines, predominantly C ─ C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). After targeting recipient cells, the CCL2 on the exosomes can specifically bind to its receptor C ─ C motif chemokine receptor 2, triggering downstream signaling pathways to induce internalization of membrane integrin β1 and targeted lysosomal degradation, consequently suppressing the functions of recipient cells. In contrast, the exosomes in the nanostructured group, especially Col-I-decorated nanostructured group carried few CCL2, moderating their inhibition on the functions of recipient cells. These findings not only clearly show that CCL2 is a key constituent of exosomes involved in the interaction between biomaterials and host immune system, but also potentially a key target for designing advanced biomaterials to promote tissue repair and regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising agents for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Although discovering novel AMPs is crucial for combating multidrug-resistant bacteria and biofilm-related infections, their clinical potential relies on precise, real-time evaluation of efficacy, toxicity, and mechanisms. Optical diffraction tomography (ODT), a label-free imaging technology, enables real-time visualization of bacterial morphological changes, membrane damage, and biofilm formation over time. Here, a computational analysis of the leech transcriptome using an advanced AI-based peptide screening strategy with ODT to identify potential AMPs is employed. Among the 19 potential AMPs identified, hirunipin 2 demonstrates potent antibacterial activity, low mammalian cytotoxicity, and minimal hemolytic effects. It demonstrates efficacy comparable to melittin, resistance to physiological salts and human serum, and a low likelihood of inducing bacterial resistance. Microscopy and 3D-ODT confirm its disruption of bacterial membranes and intracellular aggregation, leading to cell death. Notably, hirunipin 2 effectively inhibits biofilm formation, eradicates preformed biofilms, and synergizes with antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) by enhancing membrane permeability. Additionally, hirunipin 2 significantly suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages, highlighting its anti-inflammatory properties. These findings highlight hirunipin 2 as a strong candidate for developing novel antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antibiofilm therapies, particularly against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.},

  abstract     = {Repair of infectious bone defects remains a serious problem in clinical practice owing to the high risk of infection and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the early stage, and the residual bacteria and delayed Osseo integrated interface in the later stage, which jointly creates a complex and dynamic microenvironment and leads to bone non-union. The melatonin carbon dots (MCDs) possess antibacterial and osteogenesis abilities, greatly simplifying the composition of a multifunctional material. Therefore, a multifunctional hydrogel containing MCDs (GH-MCD) is developed to meet the multi-stage and complex repair needs of infectious bone injury in this study. The GH-MCD can intelligently release MCDs responding to the acidic microenvironment to scavenge intracellular ROS and exhibit good antibacterial activity by inducing the production of ROS in bacteria and inhibiting the expression of secA2 . Moreover, it has high osteogenesis and long-lasting antimicrobial activity during bone repair. RNA-seq results reveal that the hydrogels promote the repair of infected bone healing by enhancing cellular resistance to bacteria, balancing osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis, and regulating the immune microenvironment. In conclusion, the GH-MCD can promote the repair of infectious bone defects through the programmed transformation of the microenvironment, providing a novel strategy for infectious bone defects.},

However, its functional role and molecular mechanism in mitochondrial function regulation and aged bone regeneration remain insufficiently elucidated. This proteomic analysis has revealed a greater abundance of proteins supporting mitochondrial function in the young ECM (Y-ECM) secreted by young bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) compared to the aged ECM (A-ECM). Further studies demonstrate that Y-ECM significantly rejuvenates mitochondrial energy metabolism in adult BMMSCs (A-BMMSCs) through the promotion of mitochondrial respiratory functions and amelioration of oxidative stress. A-BMMSCs cultured on Y-ECM exhibited enhanced multi-lineage differentiation potentials in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo. Mechanistically, silencing of silent information regulator type 3 (SIRT3) gene abolished the protective impact of Y-ECM on A-BMMSCs. Notably, a novel composite biomaterial combining hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel microspheres with Y-ECM is developed, which yielded substantial improvements in the healing of bone defects in an aged rat model. Collectively, these findings underscore the pivotal role of Y-ECM in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis and present a promising therapeutic strategy for the repair of aged bone defects.},

  abstract     = {The most prevalent types of lymphomas are B cell lymphomas (BCL). Newer therapies for BCL have improved the prognosis for many patients. However, approximately 30% with aggressive BCL either remain refractory or ultimately relapse. These patients urgently need other options. This study shows how calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMKIIδ) is pivotal for BCL development. In BCL cells, ablation of CAMKIIδ inhibits both lipolysis from lipid droplets and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). With lipolysis blocked, BCL progression is markedly suppressed in two distinct BCL mouse models: MYC-driven EµMyc mice and Myc/Bcl2 double-expressed mice. When CAMKIIδ is present, it destabilizes transcription factor Forkhead Box O3A (FOXO3A) by phosphorylating it at Ser7 and Ser12. This then permits transcription of downstream gene IRF4 – a master transcription factor of lipid metabolism. The CAMKIIδ/FOXO3A axis bolsters lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and tumor fitness in BCL under metabolic stress. This study also evaluates Tetrandrine (TET), a small molecule compound, as a potent CAMKIIδ inhibitor. TET attenuates metabolic fitness and elicits therapeutic responses both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study highlights how CAMKIIδ is critical in BCL progression. The results also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies for treating aggressive BCL.},

  abstract     = {Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) is extensively used in waterproof coatings and fire-fighting foams, and several studies have found it to be a potential health hazard, but there is still unknown about its effects on spermatogenesis. Our results showed that PFHxS-treated mice have significant reproductive toxicity, including a decrease in sperm count and motility, and the levels of sex hormones ( P &lt; 0.05). Concurrently, structural abnormalities are observed in sperm, affecting ≈60–75% of those in the PFHxS-treated group. Additionally, it is found that the structure of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) is damaged after PFHxS treatment, leading to higher expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the microenvironment for spermatogenesis. Moreover, the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, including PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), is dysregulated in the testes after PFHxS treatment. Based on metabolome data, the differential metabolite 3-hydroxybutanoic acid is identified in the PFHxS-treated group, which can regulate the histone Kac levels, especially H3K4ac and H3K9ac. In summary, the results of this study suggest that in the testes of PFHxS-treated mice, inflammatory factors disrupt the mitochondrial function and metabolic profiles and hinder the progress of gene transcription through histone Kac, ultimately causing sperm dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {The commercialization of metasurfaces is crucial for real-world applications such as wearable sensors, pigment-free color pixels, and augmented and virtual reality devices. Nanoparticle-embedded resin-based nanoimprint lithography (PER-NIL) has shown itself to be a low-cost, high-throughput manufacturing method enabling the replication of high-index nanostructures. It has been extensively integrated into the fabrication of hologram metasurfaces, metalenses, and sensors due to its procedural simplicity. Most research on PER-NIL has been limited to exploring appropriate materials to enhance the efficiency of imprinted metasurfaces, but the intrinsic issue of PER-NIL lies in the high-index residual layer remaining on the substrate. This high-index residual layer generates undesired noise, limiting the efficiency and functionality of imprinted metasurfaces. Despite the need for the removal of the residual layer, it has never been experimentally achieved owing to the different etching rates between the nanoparticles and resin. Here, a new methodology named tape-assisted PER-NIL is proposed, achieving one-step removal of the residual layer using a tape. This novel method enables the replication of residual layer-free, high-index metasurfaces. As a result, imprinted residual layer-free metasurfaces prove their potential in high-purity dielectric structural colorations by achieving a sharp reflectance peak unattainable with conventional NIL, and in vivid hologram metasurfaces by covering a full 2π phase without unwanted scattering.},

  abstract     = {Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a formidable challenge in oncology, demands innovative biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This research highlights the importance of the circular RNA (circRNA) circPCSK6 and its peptide derivative circPCSK6-167aa in ICC. CircPCSK6 is significantly downregulated in both ICC patients and mouse primary ICC models, and its lower expression is linked to adverse prognosis, highlighting its pivotal role in ICC pathogenesis. Functionally, this study elucidates the regulatory effect of circPCSK6-167aa on IκBα ubiquitination within the NF-κB pathway, which is mediated by its competitive binding to the E3 ligase RBBP6. This complex interaction leads to reduced activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby curbing tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, stemness, and hepatic-lung metastasis in vivo. This groundbreaking discovery expands the understanding of circRNA-driven tumorigenesis through atypical signaling pathways. Additionally, this investigation identified EIF4A3 as a detrimental regulator of circPCSK6, exacerbating ICC malignancy. Importantly, by leveraging patient-derived xenograft (PDX), organoids, and organoid-derived PDX models, higher levels of circPCSK6-167aa enhance sensitivity to gemcitabine, indicating its potential to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. These insights emphasize the therapeutic promise of targeting circPCSK6-167aa, offering vital biological insights and clinical directions for developing cutting-edge therapeutic approaches, thus revealing innovative strategies and targets for future treatments.},

  abstract     = {A previous study classifies solid tumors based on collagen deposition and immune infiltration abundance, identifying a refractory subtype termed armored &amp; cold tumors, characterized by elevated collagen deposition and diminished immune infiltration. Beyond its impact on immune infiltration, collagen deposition also influences tumor angiogenesis. This study systematically analyzes the association between immuno-collagenic subtypes and angiogenesis across diverse cancer types. As a result, armored &amp; cold tumors exhibit the highest angiogenic activity in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal close interactions and spatial co-localization of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In vitro experiments demonstrate that collagen stimulates tumor cells to express vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and directly enhances vessel formation and endothelial cell proliferation through sex determining region Y box 18 (SOX18) upregulation. Collagen inhibition via multiple approaches effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, armored &amp; cold tumors display superior responsiveness to anti-angiogenic therapy in advanced LUAD cohorts. Post-immunotherapy resistance, the transformation into armored &amp; cold tumors emerges as a potential biomarker for selecting anti-angiogenic therapy. In summary, collagen deposition is shown to drive angiogenesis across various cancers, providing a novel and actionable framework to refine therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic treatments.},

While pooling enhances RT-PCR throughput, reducing costs and resources, it dilutes positive samples with negative ones, lowering sensitivity and increasing false negatives. This study proposes a new method to address the trade-off between pool sizes and RT-PCR accuracy. This method integrates large-scale pooling with sample enrichment using a nano-hybrid membrane, preventing the pooling-induced decrease in viral concentration and maintaining cycle threshold (Ct) values close to individual positive samples. The nano-hybrid membrane, named SIMPLE (streamlined, simple, and inexpensive method for preconcentration, lysis, and nucleic acid extraction), comprises layered red blood cell membranes, polyethersulfone, and silica membranes. Using SIMPLE, a Ct value reduction to ≈2.6 is demonstrated in pooled COVID-19 samples with a pool size of 6 and found Ct values from larger pool sizes (8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) comparable to individual positive samples.},

MLLT3 interacted with HMGB1 to inhibit its entry into the nucleus, MLLT3 interacted with YBX1 to inhibit its reading of m 5 C of MAGEA1 , thereby inhibiting the mRNA stability of MAGEA1 , and directly transcribed P53 to inhibit the stemness, proliferation and metastasis of melanoma cells.

The application of these therapies is highly dependent on the evaluation of tumor HER2 status. However, there are many risks and challenges in HER2 assessment in GC. Therefore, an economically viable and readily available instrument is requisite for distinguishing HER2 status among patients diagnosed with GC. The study has innovatively developed a deep learning model, HER2Net, which can predict the HER2 status by quantitatively calculating the proportion of HER2 high-expression regions. The HER2Net is trained on an internal training set derived from 531 hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) whole slide images (WSI) of 520 patients. Subsequently, the performance of HER2Net is validated on an internal test set from 115 H&amp;E WSI of 111 patients and an external multi-center test set from 102 H&amp;E WSI of 101 patients. The HER2Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9043 on the internal test set, and an accuracy of 0.8922 on an external test set from multiple institutes. This discovery indicates that the HER2Net can potentially offer a novel methodology for the identification of HER2-positive GC.},

Their light-to-electricity or thermal-to-electricity conversion is strongly determined by the dynamics of the corresponding lattice vibrations. Here, the measurement of lattice dynamics is presented in a prototypical lead-free halide double perovskite(Cs 2 NaInCl 6 ). The quantitative measurements and first-principles calculations show that the scatterings among lattice vibrations at room temperature are at the timescale of ≈1 ps, which stems from the extraordinarily strong anharmonicity in Cs 2 NaInCl 6 . Further the degree of anharmonicity of each type of atom is quantitatively characterized in the Cs 2 NaInCl 6 single crystal, which stems from the interatomic forces, and demonstrate that this strong anharmonicity is synergistically contributed by the bond hierarchy, the tilting of the NaCl 6 and InCl 6 octahedral units, and the rattling of Cs + ions. Consequently, the crystalline Cs 2 NaInCl 6 possesses an ultralow thermal conductivity of ≈0.43 W mK −1 at room temperature, and a weak temperature dependence of T −0.41 . These findings uncovered the underlying mechanisms behind the dynamics of lattice vibrations in double perovskites, which can largely benefit the design of optoelectronics and thermoelectrics based on halide double perovskites.},

  abstract     = {L-Aspartic acid (L-Asp) poses a dual function, which can affect the evaporation and crystallization process of the high-salinity brine by altering the physical or chemical properties of the salts. MSWI (municipal solid waste incineration) fly ash washing leachate, as a typical high-salinity brine, is utilized here to validate this hypothesis under the simulation guidance. Since L-Asp has stronger adsorption energy on the (110) crystal face of CaCO 3 , L-Asp can facilitate the preferential growth of more valuable vaterite during the softening process (pretreatment before crystallization). Subsequently, the resulting solution undergoes a stable interfacial solar-driven crystallization process under the L-Asp, with a high salt recovery ratio of 0.14 kg m −2 h −1 within 40 h under 1 sun. Finally, to harness the “cradle to grave” full life cycle utilization of washing leachate, the extracted mixed salts are utilized for moisture-enabled electricity generation. L-Asp can significantly enhance this process by reducing the critical relative humidity of mixed salts, thereby exhibiting a stable open circuit potential and short-cut current of ≈ 0.51 V and 10.6 µA within continuous 800 min. In conclusion, this work not only provides innovative approaches for upcycling high-salinity wastewater but also explores novel applications for L-Asp.},

  abstract     = {3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2 (HACD2), an obesity-related gene involved in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids, is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer (PC) and is associated with patient prognosis. Interestingly, the study reveals that HACD2 mediated the proliferation of PC cells in a dehydratase-independent manner, affecting the downstream glycolytic pathway. Mechanistically, HACD2 promotes PC cells proliferation by binding to E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin (PRKN) and enhancing pyruvate kinase PKM (PKM2) dissociation from PRKN, resulting in reduced ubiquitination of PKM2 and increased dimerization of PKM2, which subsequently promote c-Myc expression and tumor growth. Moreover, HACD2 overexpression-induced PC growth is mitigated by knockdown of PKM2 or overexpression of PRKN. Furthermore, the weight loss drug orlistat, which potentially binds to HACD2, disrupted the interaction between HACD2 and PRKN and further increased the ubiquitination of PKM2. Therefore, this study elucidates the mechanism by which the obesity-related gene HACD2 regulates PC cells proliferation through a noncanonical signaling pathway, which may provide a potential new target and strategy for the individualized clinical treatment of PC.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) usually creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby hindering immunotherapy response. Effective treatment options remain elusive. Using scRNA-seq analysis in a tumor-bearing murine model, it is found that lobeline, an alkaloid from the herbal medicine lobelia, promotes polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward M1-like TAMs while inhibiting their polarization toward M2-like TAMs. Additionally, lobeline upregulates mRNA expression of secreted Ly-6/UPAR-related protein 1 ( Slurp1 ) in cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of lobeline on tumor load and TAM polarization are almost completely eliminated when Slurp1-deficient MC38 cells are subcutaneously injected into mice, suggesting that lobeline exerts an antitumor effect in a Slurp1-dependent manner. Furthermore, using target-responsive accessibility profiling, MAPK14 is identified as the direct target protein of lobeline. Mechanistically, upon binding to MAPK14 in colon cancer cells, lobeline prevents nuclear translocation of MAPK14, resulting in decreased levels of phosphorylated p53. Consequently, negative transcriptional regulation of SLURP1 by p53 is suppressed, leading to enhanced transcription and secretion of SLURP1. Finally, combination therapy using lobeline and anti-PD1 exhibits stronger antitumor effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment using small-molecule lobeline may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC.},

Recent efforts in this area have highlighted the utility of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as drug carriers, given that they naturally occur in bloodstream and tissues, and can be loaded with a wide range of therapeutic molecules. However, biodistribution and tissue tropism of EVs remain difficult to study systematically. Here, a multiplexed approach is developed for simultaneous tracking of EVs from various cell lines within a single in vivo experiment. EVs are used from 16 different cell lines, and through controlled fusion with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying single-stranded DNA barcodes, uniquely barcoded hybrid EV particle (hEV) library is generated. These hEVs are combined for a multiplexed in vivo biodistribution profiling in mice, and discovered that HAP1-derived hEVs demonstrated lung tropism, suggesting that these hEVs may be used for targeted drug delivery into lung tissue. To examine this possibility further, it is shown that HAP1 hEV loaded with Cre mRNA displayed functional delivery to the lungs. Overall, the barcoded hEV technology enables rapid profiling of biodistribution across EV cell sources, which is poised to improve throughput and extent of EV studies, while reducing the number of animals required for research.},

The role of MDVs in DFU is yet to be reported. Using single-cell datasets, it is discovered that the increase in MDVs may be regulated by Sorting Nexin 9 (SNX9). In vitro experiments revealed that MDVs secreted by fibroblasts cultured in high glucose medium exhibited similar composition and protein enrichment results to those in DFU tissues, suggesting their potential as an ideal in vitro surrogate. These MDVs promoted apoptosis and intracellular oxidative stress, disrupted mitochondrial structure, and reduced aerobic metabolism in target cells. In vivo experiments also showed that MDV drops hindered wound healing in diabetic mice; however, this effect is rescued by SNX9 inhibitors, restoring mitochondrial dynamics and balance. Under high glucose conditions, MDVs significantly upregulated oxidative stress levels and induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

  abstract     = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic systemic autoimmune disease that often results in irreversible joint erosion and disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line drug against RA, but the significant side effects of long-term administration limit its use. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed for treating RA. Here, dual-targeting biomimetic carrier-free nanomaterials (BSA-MTX-CyI nanosystem, BMC) is developed for synergistic photo-chemotherapy of RA. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which has high affinity with SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) in the RA joint microenvironment, is selected as the hydrophilic end and coupled with MTX and the phototherapeutic agent CyI to self-assemble into BMC. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that BMC accumulated significantly at the joint site in collagen antibody-induced arthritis mice and could be specifically recognized and taken up by folate receptors in proinflammatory M1 macrophages. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation, CyI exerted photodynamic and photothermal effects, whereas MTX not only inhibited cell proliferation but also increased cell sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, enhancing the apoptotic effect induced by CyI and achieving synergistic photo-chemotherapy. Moreover, BMC could induce macrophages to reprogram into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. This study provides innovative approaches for RA treatment via macrophage apoptosis and re-polarization.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates segregate nuclei into discrete regions, facilitating the execution of distinct biological functions. Here, it is identified that the WW domain containing adaptor with coiled-coil (WAC) is localized to nuclear speckles via its WW domain and plays a pivotal role in regulating alternative splicing through the formation of biomolecular condensates via its C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. WAC acts as a scaffold protein and facilitates the integration of RNA-binding motif 12 (RBM12) into nuclear speckles, where RBM12 potentially interacts with the spliceosomal U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). Importantly, knockdown of RBM12, or deletion of the WAC CC domain led to altered splicing outcomes, resulting in an elevated level of BECN1-S, the short splice variant of BECN1 that is shown to upregulate mitophagy. Thus, the findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for the nuclear regulation of mitochondrial function through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and provide insights into the pathogenesis of WAC-related disorders.},

  abstract     = {Lysine demethylase 7A (KDM7A) catalyzes the removal of dimethylation from histone H3 lysine 9 and lysine 27, both of which are associated with transcription repression. Previous study indicates that Kdm7a mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) increases after drug exposure, yet its role in drug-related behaviors is largely unknown. In a morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, these findings reveal a specific increase of Kdm7a expression in the mPFC 7 days after drug withdrawal. Subsequently, these results demonstrate that knockdown of Kdm7a in the mPFC do not affect the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP, but it attenuate memory consolidation. To further explore Kdm7a-mediated transcriptomic changes, this work employs Nanopore direct RNA sequencing. Transcriptome profiling unveils several gene expression alterations impacted by KDM7A, which are enriched in relevant neural function categories. Notably, this work identifies and validates fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (Fscn1) as a downstream molecular target. Knockdown of Fscn1 has a similar impact on CPP to Kdm7a, along with corresponding decrease of dendritic spine density and neuronal activity in the mPFC. Additionally, silencing Kdm7a decreases enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 at the Fscn1 promoter region, suggesting that KDM7A may act as a crucial regulator of transcriptional responses to morphine-related reward memory via Fscn1.},

In this study, a single-component self-assembling hydrogel is developed using the recombinant protein CsgA, and its successful application for spinal cord injury repair is demonstrated. Gelation is achieved by the physical entanglement of CsgA nanofibrils, resulting in a self-supporting hydrogel at low concentrations (≥5 mg mL −1 ). By leveraging the programmability of the CsgA gene sequence, the bioactive hydrogel is enhanced by fusing functional peptide GHK. GHK is recognized for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurotrophic factor-stimulating properties, making it a valuable addition to the hydrogel for spinal cord injury repair applications. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the CsgA-GHK hydrogel can modulate microglial M2 polarization, promote neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells, and inhibit astrocyte differentiation. Additionally, the hydrogel shows efficacy in alleviating inflammation and promotes neuronal regeneration at the injury site, leading to significant functional recovery in a rat model with compression injury spinal cord cavity. These findings lay the groundwork for developing a modular design platform for recombinant CsgA protein hydrogels in tissue repair applications.},

  abstract     = {The fungal Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) protein Bdf1 is a potential antifungal target against invasive fungal infections. However, the need to selectively inhibit both Bdf1 bromodomains (BDs) over human orthologs and the lack of molecular tools to assess on-target antifungal efficacy hamper efforts to develop Bdf1 BD inhibitors as antifungal therapeutics. This study reports a phenyltriazine compound that inhibits both Bdf1 BDs from the human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata with selectivity over the orthologous BDs from the human BET protein Brd4. On-target antifungal activity is established by devising two yeast-based inhibition assays: a growth assay using humanized Candida strains in which the Bdf1 BDs are replaced by their Brd4 counterparts, and a NanoBiT assay that evaluates the BD-mediated association of Bdf1 with chromatin. These assays additionally enable the discovery that BET inhibitor I-BET726 targets both Bdf1 BDs, inhibits the growth of a broad spectrum of Candida species, including antifungal-resistant clinical isolates, and displays efficacy in an invertebrate animal model of infection. These collective findings highlight the promising potential of Bdf1 BD inhibitors as an innovative class of antifungal therapeutics and the pivotal role of yeast-based assay development toward achieving this end.},

  abstract     = {The initiation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stone formation is highly likely to stem from injury to the renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) induced by stimulation from an aberrant urinary environment. CHAC1 plays a critical role in stress response mechanisms by regulating glutathione metabolism. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ferroptosis are demonstrated to be involved in stone formation. This study attempted to elucidate the mechanism of ER stress-dependent ferroptosis and the role of CHAC1 in CaOx kidney stones. Here, regulating ER stress and CHAC1 expression are performed in in vivo and in vitro stone models. These findings indicated that 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)treatment and CHAC1 deficiency alleviated the ferroptotic status, including restoring GSH content, suppressing Fe 2+ and lipid peroxidation accumulation, as well as regulating ferroptosis-related proteins. Notably, 4-PBA treatment and CHAC1 deficiency both attenuated oxidative damage, improved renal function, importantly, decreased crystal deposition. Additionally, ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR analyses demonstrated that CHAC1 is the vital downstream target gene of ATF4. The results indicated that ATF4 depletion inhibited the upregulation of CHAC1 and pro-ferroptotic response induced by Ox stimulation. Overall, ATF4/CHAC1 axis mediating ER stress-dependent ferroptosis may be a promising research direction for identifying potential strategy to prevent and treat CaOx kidney stones.},

  abstract     = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is usually considered associate with immune inflammation and synaptic injury within specific brain regions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the neural deterioration resulting in depression remain unclear. Here, it is found that miR-204-5p is markedly downregulated in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induce rat model of depression. Knockdown of miR-204-5p in the vmPFC of normal rats results in depression and anxiety-like behaviors accompanied with the activation of microglia, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased numbers of neural apoptotic cells, effects which appear to be mediated by activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Electrophysiological recordings further demonstrate that knockdown of miR-204-5p induces abnormal excitability of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, upregulation of miR-204-5p in the vmPFC of CUMS rats significantly causes inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, improvements in neuronal impairments, and an abolition of the depression and anxiety-like behaviors. Moreover, pharmacological blocking of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway significantly ameliorates abnormal behaviors resulting from miR-204-5p deficiency within the vmPFC. Collectively, these results provide robust evidence that the miR-204-5p/JAK2/STAT3 pathway may critically involve in the pathogenesis of depression, which may serve as potentially critical therapeutic target in the treatment of MDD.},

Herein a novel approach is introduced utilizing MOF-derived nanoporous metal/carbon composites as precursors to circumvent this traditional trade-off. The resulting bulk graphite, composed of densely packed multilayered graphene sheets functionalized with diverse cobalt forms (nanoparticles, single atoms, and clusters), exhibits unprecedented electrical conductivity in all directions (in-plane: 7311 S cm⁻¹, out-of-plane: 5541 S cm⁻¹) and excellent mechanical strength (flexural: 101.17±5.73 MPa, compressive: 151.56±2.53 MPa). Co nanoparticles act as autocatalysts and binders, promoting strong interlayer adhesion among highly graphitized graphene layers via spark plasma sintering. The strong nano-interfaces between graphite and Co-create critical bridges between graphene nanosheets, facilitating highly efficient electron migration and enhanced strength and stiffness of the assembled bulk nanocomposites. Leveraging these exceptional properties, practical demonstrations highlight the immense potential of the robust material for applications demanding superior electromagnetic interference shielding and efficient heating. An innovative approach, which effectively decouples electrical conductivity from mechanical properties, paves the way for the creation of HPBGs tailored for diverse application sectors.},

  abstract     = {Far-red phosphors have emerged as a desirable research hotspot owing to their critical role in promoting plant growth. Especially, Eu 3+ ions typically present the 5 D 0 → 7 F J (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions, which overlap with the far-red light required for plant photosynthesis. However, achieving high-efficiency far-red emission of Eu 3+ remains challenging due to weak 5 D 0 → 7 F 4 transition and concentration quenching. The study constructs two anomalously efficient far-red garnet phosphors A 3 Sc 2 C 3 O 12 (A = Y 3+ , Gd 3+ . C = Al 3+ , Ga 3+ ):Eu 3+ . A high-resolution STEM measurement equipped with an aberration corrector provides the direct proofs for both the [EuO 8 ] configuration-dependent strong 5 D 0 → 7 F 4 and the origin of high quenching concentration. Excitedly, a two-component substitution (replacing Y 3+ -Al 3+ with Gd 3+ -Ga 3+ ) triggers a near-unity internal quantum efficiency (IQE = 99.01%) and high external quantum efficiency (EQE = 38.73%) in Gd 3 Sc 2 Ga 3 O 12 :60%Eu 3+ , resulting from the effective modulation of 5 D 0 → 7 F 4 / 7 F 2 transitions. A far-red LEDs device based on Gd 3 Sc 2 Ga 3 O 12 :60%Eu 3+ exhibits an output power of 113 mW at 300 mA. Subsequently, practical applications for promoting plant growth underscore the significance of these findings. This work opens a new path for the development of highly efficient far-red phosphors via the synergistic effect of Eu 3+ square antiprism configuration and high quenching concentration.},

Herein, a NaHCO 3 etching strategy is developed to introduce abundant in-plane pores within the carbon substrates that further enable the construction of low-coordinated and asymmetric Co─N 3 sites with nearby vacancy defects in a Co─N─C catalyst. This catalyst exhibits a high HER activity with an overpotential ( η ) of merely 78 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , a Tafel slope of 45.2 mV dec −1 , and a turnover frequency of 1.67 s −1 (at η = 100 mV). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the vacancy defects neighboring the Co─N 3 sites can modulate the electronic structure of the catalyst and alter the adsorption configuration of the H intermediate from the typical atop mode to the side mode, resulting in weakened H adsorption strength and thus improved HER activity. This work provides an efficient strategy to regulate the coordination environment of SACs for improved catalytic performance and sheds light on the atomic-level understanding of the structure-activity relationships.},

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of electronic structure and the relationships between structure and properties to develop magneto-structural correlations that are currently unexplored in the literature. Herein, a series of five-coordinate distorted square pyramidal Co II complexes [Co(L)(X 2 )].CHCl 3 (where X = Cl ( 1 ), Br ( 2 ), or I ( 3 )) is reported, all exhibiting easy-axis magnetic anicotropy. The size of the zero field splitting axial parameter ( D ) is quantitatively determined ( 1 = −72; 2 = −67 and 3 = −25 cm −1 ) using a cantilever torque magnetometry which is further firmly supported by magnetic susceptibility, and EPR measurements. The study of the magnetization relaxation dynamics reveals field-induced slow relaxation of magnetization due to the predominant Raman relaxation process. Theoretical calculations on 1 – 3 and optimized model complexes of 1 reveal insights into the electronic structure and highlight the impact of steric and electronic effects on modulating the D values. Overall, the studies reported pave the way for designing a new generation of Co II complexes with enhanced  axiality and a lower rhombicity.},

However, achieving high sensitivity, self-powered operation, and reliable performance at room temperature within a miniaturized form factor remains a formidable challenge, largely due to constraints in MIR light absorption and the intricacies of embedding encryption at the device level. Here, a novel on-chip metamaterial-enhanced, 2D tantalum nickel selenide (Ta₂NiSe₅)-based photodetector, meticulously designed with a custom-engineered plasmonic resonance microstructure to achieve self-powered photodetection in the nanoampere range is unveiled. Gold cross-shaped resonators are demonstrated that generate plasmon-induced ultrahot electrons, significantly enhancing the absorption of MIR photons with energies far below the bandgap and boosting electron thermalization in Ta₂NiSe₅, yielding a 0.1 V bias responsivity of 47 mA/W—an order of magnitude higher than previously reported values. Furthermore, the implementation of six reconfigurable optoelectronic logic computing (“AND”, “OR”, “NAND”, “NOR”, “XOR”, and “XNOR”) are illustrated via tailored optical and electrical input-output configurations, thereby establishing a platform for real-time infrared-encrypted communication. This work pioneers a new direction in secure MIR communications, advancing the development of high-performance, encryption-capable photonic systems.},

  abstract     = {Multimode luminescent materials exhibit tunable photon emissions under different excitation or stimuli channels, endowing them high encoding capacity and confidentiality for anti-counterfeiting and encryption. Achieving multimode luminescence into a stable single material presents a promising but remains a challenge. Here, the downshifting/upconversion emissions, color-tuning persistent luminescence (PersL), temperature-dependent multi-color emissions, and hydrochromism are integrated into Er 3+ ions doped Cs 2 NaYbCl 6 nanocrystals (NCs) by leveraging shallow defect levels and directed energy migration. The resulting NCs display strong static and dynamic colorful luminescence in response to ultraviolet, 980-nm laser, and X-ray. Additionally, the NCs exhibit distinct luminescent colors as the temperature increases from 330 to 430 K. Surprisingly, it also demonstrates the ability of the reversible emission modal and color in response to water. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations reveal that self-trapped exciton state (STEs), chlorine vacancy defects, and ladderlike 4f energy levels of Er 3+ ions contribute to multimodal luminescence. More importantly, it has extremely remarkable environmental stability, which can be stored in the air for more than 18 months, showing promising commercial prospects. This work not only gives new insights into lanthanide-based metal halide NCs but also provides a new route for developing multimodal luminescent nanomaterials for anti-counterfeiting and encryption.},

Here, using Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based crystal structure prediction including zero-point energy, it is that proton superoxide (HO 2 ), the lightest superoxide, can be stabilized energetically at high pressure and temperature conditions. HO 2 is metallic at high pressure, which originates from the 𝜋 * orbitals overlap between adjacent superoxide anions (O 2 − ). By lowering pressure, it undergoes a metal-to-insulator transition similar to LiO 2 . Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations reveal that HO 2 becomes superionic with high electrical conductivity. The possibility of creating hydrogen-mixed superoxide at lower pressure using a (Li x ,H 1-x )O 2 hypothetical structure is also proposed. This discovery bridges gaps in superoxide and superionicity, guiding the design of various H-O compounds under high pressure.},

Site-directed mutagenesis assisted by molecular dynamics simulations resulted in the variant L354 M with up to 13.2-fold increased sesterterpene production. These structurally diverse products suggest a comprehensive cyclization mechanism for plant sesterterpenes and provide compelling evidence for the initial cyclization of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate via a crucial 15-membered monocyclic carbocation. The activities of these sesterterpenes against liver fibrosis is inferred from the inhibition of the transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling pathway and collagen synthesis.

  abstract     = {In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in complex gene regulatory networks together with the transcription factors (TFs) in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. To date, analyses of miRNAs-induced transcriptome remodeling are at the whole plant or tissue levels. Here, Arabidopsis ’s ABA-induced single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is performed at different stages of time points–early, middle, and late. Single-cell level primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) atlas supported the rapid, dynamic, and cell-type specific miRNA responses under ABA treatment. MiRNAs respond rapidly and prior to target gene expression dynamics, and these rapid response miRNAs are highly cell-type specific, especially in mesophyll and vascular cells. MiRNA-TF-mRNA regulation modules are identified by identifying miRNA-contained feed-forward loops (M-FFLs) in the regulatory network, and regulatory networks with M-FFLs have higher co-expression and clustering coefficient (CC) values than those without M-FFLs, suggesting the hub role of miRNAs in regulatory networks. The cell-type-specific M-FFLs are regulated by these hub miRNAs rather than TFs through sc-RNA-seq network analysis. MiR858a-FBH3-MYB module inhibited the expression of MYB63 and MYB20, which related to the formation of plant secondary wall and the production of lignin, through M-FFL specifically in vascular. These results can provide prominent insights into miRNAs&#39; dynamic and cell-type-specific roles in plant development and stress responses.},

Visible-light-driven fluorescent photoswitches are highly desirable, but achieving high cyclization yield remains challenging. Herein, it is reported that all visible-light-driven turn-on fluorescence in dimethoxyphenyl functionalized diarylethene isomers. The open-ring form of o - DMPB and p - DMPB exhibits near quantitative conversion yields (up to 94%) under 405 nm visible light, attributed to the strong electron-donating character. In contrast, the meta isomer m - DMPB shows limited response to visible light, with a ring-closing yield of 22%. Furthermore, all photoswitches display good thermal stability, photostability, and fatigue resistance. Notably, o - DMPB demonstrates promising applications in anti-counterfeiting, information encryption, and photorewritable patterns.

Importantly, the functionality of these dyes defines the ultimate application. Herein, CsPbBr 3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are interfaced with zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) dyes featuring carboxylic acid. The functionality is the photosensitization of singlet oxygen. The CsPbBr 3 @ZnPc nanohybrid is to the best of our knowledge the first example, in which an unusual Dexter-type singlet energy transfer between metal halide perovskite nanocrystals and phthalocyanine dyes enables singlet oxygen generation as a proof-of-concept application. A detailed temporal picture of the singlet energy transfer mechanism is made possible by combining key time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, that are, femtosecond, nanosecond, and microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy as well as time-correlated single photon counting, and target analyses. In fact, three excitonic components in the NCs govern a concerted Dexter-type energy transfer. The work illustrates the potential of CsPbBr 3 @ZnPc as a singlet photosensitizer of ZnPc to produce singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) almost quantitatively while photoexciting CsPbBr 3 .},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phases marks a major breakthrough in soft matter research. An intermediate phase, often observed between the nonpolar and the ferroelectric nematic phase, shows a distinct antiferroelectric response to electric fields. However, its structure and formation mechanisms remain debated, with flexoelectric and electrostatics effects proposed as competing mechanisms. By controlling the magnitude of electrostatic forces through ion addition in two representative ferroelectric nematic materials, it is shown that the primary mechanism for the emergence of antiferroelectric order is the flexoelectric coupling between electric polarization and splay deformation of the nematic director. The addition of ions significantly expands the temperature range over which the antiferroelectric phase is observed, with this range increasing with increasing ion concentration. Polarizing optical microscopy studies and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy reveal the splayed structure modulated in 2D, while SHG interferometry confirms its antiferroelectric character. The model previously used to describe pretransitional behavior is extended by incorporating the electrostatic contribution of ions. The model shows qualitative agreement with the experiments, accurately reproducing the phase diagram and temperature-dependent evolution of the modulation period of the observed structure.},

Herein, a CRISPR/Cas13d system for broad-spectrum targeting of influenza A virus (IAV) from human, avian, and swine sources is designed, incorporating Cas13d mRNA and a tandem CRISPR RNA (crRNA) specific for the highly conserved regions of viral polymerase acidic (PA), nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix (M) gene segments, respectively. Given that the virus targets cells with specific receptors but is not limited to a single organ, a Susceptible Cell Selective Delivery (SCSD) system is developed by modifying a lipid nanoparticle with a peptide mimicking the function of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus to target sialic acid receptors. The SCSD system can precisely deliver an all-RNA-based CRISPR/Cas13d system into potentially infected cells. This drug is shown to reduce the viral load in the lungs by 2.37 log 10 TCID 50 mL −1 and protect 100% of mice from lethal influenza infection.

  abstract     = {Efficient removal of 99 TcO 4 − from radioactive effluents while recovering drinking water remains a challenge. Herein, an excellent ReO 4 − (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99 TcO 4 − ) scavenger is presented through covalently bonding imidazolium poly(ionic liquids) polymers with an ionic porous aromatic framework (iPAF), namely iPAF-P67, following an adsorption-site density-addition strategy. It shows rapid sorption kinetics, high uptake capacity, and exceptional selectivity toward ReO 4 − . Notably, the residual concentration of TcO 4 − /ReO 4 − in the radioactive wastewater after iPAF-P67 treatment is as low as 0.046 ppb, fully meeting the drinking water standards of World Health Organization (WHO, 0.159 ppb) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA, 0.053 ppb). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the imidazolium groups in iPAF-P67 provide stronger electrostatic interactions and higher binding energies between iPAF-P67 and TcO 4 − anions, leading to its superior adsorption performance. Furthermore, the scale-up synthesized iPAF-P67 materials are shaped with polyethersulfone (PES) to fabricate PAF-P67/PES beads and nanofibers via phase inversion method and electrospinning technique, respectively. Both composites demonstrate outstanding ultra-purification abilities toward ReO 4 − to meet the WHO criteria even after multiple dynamic adsorption/desorption cycles. This work develops a design strategy for adsorbents applicable in the sequestration of low-concentration radioactive pollutants.},

However, the birefringence, which is one of the most important optical parameters in electro-optic devices, is not large enough (&lt;0.25) in most ferroelectric nematic materials. Here, a polar liquid crystal molecule library containing more than 60 molecules with a highly rigid and fluorinated nature is developed. The introduction of triple bonds constructs a long π-electron conjugated mesogen skeleton, significantly improving the birefringence of polar liquid crystal phases. The birefringence and dispersion properties are systematically studied, demonstrating a strong dependence on chemical structures and the type of polar phases. Furthermore, through multi-component mixing, polar liquid crystal mixtures with ultra-wide temperature range and excellent stability at or near room temperature are obtained. They possess much higher birefringence than the existing ferroelectric liquid crystal materials. The unique combination of high birefringence and fluidic ferroelectricity is expected to promote the application of polar liquid crystals in electro-optic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary metastasis represents one of the most prevalent forms of metastasis in advanced melanoma, with mortality rates reaching 70%. Current treatments including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy frequently exhibit limited efficacy or present high costs. To address these clinical needs, this study presents a biomimetic drug delivery system (Ce6-pTP-CsA) utilizing cryoshocked adipocytes (CsA) encapsulating the prodrug triptolide palmitate (pTP) and the photosensitizer Ce6, exploiting the characteristic of tumor cells to recruit and lipolyze adipocytes for energy. CsA substantially enhances the drug-loading capacity of adipocytes, with its particle size characteristics enabling targeted delivery of pTP to the lungs. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and pTP activates the caspase cascade, promoting apoptosis in tumor cells. Notably, the cleavage of disulfide bonds in pTP depletes glutathione (GSH), reducing its scavenging effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing the efficacy of PDT. Results demonstrate that Ce6-pTP-CsA effectively inhibits the proliferation and invasion of pulmonary metastatic melanoma cells in vitro and induces apoptosis, while significantly suppressing lung metastasis of SCID mice models in vivo. In conclusion, this novel biomimetic drug delivery system based on adipocytes provides a promising strategy for targeted therapy in pulmonary metastatic melanoma.},

However, conventional IEMs are limited to separating only monovalent cations or anions, presenting a significant challenge in achieving concomitant H⁺/OH⁻ permselectivity for simultaneous acid and alkali recovery. To address this issue, the charged microporous polymer framework membranes are developed, featuring rigid Tröger&#39;s Base network chains constructed through a facile sol-gel process. The intrinsic ultramicropore confinement and quaternary ammonium-charged functional groups provide ultrahigh size-sieving capability and enhanced Donnan exclusion for H⁺/OH⁻ selectivity; meanwhile, the internal protoplasmic channels of the polymer frameworks serve as highways for rapid ion transfer. The resulting membrane achieves high H⁺/Fe 2 ⁺ and OH⁻/WO₄ 2 ⁻ selectivities of 694.4 and 181.0, respectively, for concurrent acid and alkali separation in diffusion dialysis and electrodialysis processes over extended operational periods (exceeding 1600 and 600 h, respectively), while maintaining remarkable transport rates. These results outperform most literature-reported and nearly all commercially available membranes.

However, achieving balanced detection across a broad spectrum—from X-rays to infrared—within a single perovskite photodetector presents challenges. These challenges stem from conflicting requirements for different wavelength ranges, such as the narrow bandgap needed for infrared detection and the low dark current necessary for X-ray sensitivity. To address this, this study have designed a type-II FAPbI 3 perovskite-based heterojunction featuring a large energy band offset utilizing narrow bandgap tellurium (Te) semiconductor. This innovative design broadens the detection range into the infrared while simultaneously reducing dark current noise. As-designed device allows for the detection of near infrared band, achieving a detectivity of 6.8 × 10 9 Jones at 1550 nm. The low dark current enables X-ray sensitivity of up to 1885.1 µC Gy⁻¹ cm⁻ 2 . First-principles calculations confirm the type-II band structure alignment of the heterojunction, and a self-driven response behavior is realized. Moreover, this study have developed a scalable 40 × 1 sensor array, demonstrating the potential for wide-spectrum imaging applications.

  abstract     = {Traditional window glazing, with inherently adverse energy-efficient optical properties, leads to colossal energy losses. Energy-saving glass requires a customized optical design for different climate zones. Compared with the widely researched radiative cooling technology which is preferable to be used in low-altitude hot regions; conversely in high-latitude cold regions, high solar transmittance ( T sol ) and low mid-infrared thermal emissivity ( ε MIR ) are the key characteristics of high-performance radiative warming window glass, while the current low-emissivity (low-e) glass is far from ideal. To address this issue, Drude&#39;s theory is used to numerically design a near-ideal film with specified electron density ( n e ) and electron mobility ( µ e ). The fabricated hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IHO) could achieve high T sol (0.836) and low ε MIR (0.117). Energy-saving simulations further reveal a substantial decrease in annual heating energy consumption up to 6.6% across high-latitude regions (climate zones 6 to 8), translating to a corresponding reduction in CO 2 emissions (20.0 kg m −2 ), outperforming 1165 high performance commercial low-e glass. This radiative warming glass holds the promise of making a significant contribution to sustainable building energy savings specifically for high-latitude cold regions, advancing the goal of carbon neutrality.},

  abstract     = {Developing low-cost unipolar n-type organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) is necessary for logic circuits. To achieve this objective, the usage of new electron-deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthetic route is desirable. Among all electron-deficient building units, N -oxide-functionalized bipyridines can be prepared through a simple oxidized transformation of bipyridines. However, employing N -oxide-functionalized bipyridines as the building unit to construct efficient N-type polymers has been overlooked. This gap strongly encourages us to design and synthesize two new N -oxide building blocks, 5,5&#39;-dibromo-[2,2&#39;-bipyridine] 1-oxide (BPyO) and 5,5&#39;-dibromo-[2,2&#39;-bipyridine] 1,1&#39;-dioxide (BPyDO), through the oxidation of sp 2 - N in 2,2ʹ-bipyridine. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction shows that BPyO and BPyDO possess planar structure with strong π-stacking, which is beneficial for charge transport. Incorporation of these building blocks into acceptor–acceptor backbones leads to two new polymers, namely P(DPP-BPyO) and P(DPP-BPyDO). Both P(DPP-BPyO) and P(DPP-BPyDO) possess lower frontier molecular orbital energy levels than the non-oxide polymer P(DPP-BPy). Consequently, the transition from P(DPP-BPy) (without oxide group) to P(DPP-BPyO) (mono-oxide group) and then to P(DPP-BPyDO) (dioxide group) can decrease hole-transport performance and gradually switch the transport nature from p-type to n-type via ambipolar. These results prove that the introduction of sp 2 - N oxide groups in building units would be a promising strategy to approach high-performance n-type polymers.},

However, traditional PCMs present challenges in modification, with commonly used physical methods facing stability and compatibility issues. This study introduces a simple and effective chemical method by synthesizing seven ester-based PCMs through chemical reactions involving lauric acid (LA) and seven different alcohols. These materials notably broaden the phase change temperature range, exhibiting melting temperature from −8.99 to 46.60 °C, expanding by 203.18% compared to raw alcohol materials. In addition, these samples exhibit excellent thermal stability and high latent heat, with a maximum latent heat value of 182.98 J g −1 . In subsequent application studies, this material demonstrates outstanding energy storage characteristics and proposed an innovative thermal management method for batteries based on the PCM immersion technique, allowing the battery to maintain a temperature below 60 °C for 20.5 h, while the blank group rapidly reached 60 °C within 0.82 h and increased to 75 °C within 2.35 h. This approach greatly improves temperature regulation, enhances battery safety, and boosts operational efficiency, highlighting the immense potential of the material in advanced energy storage applications.},

This progress enables the creation of devices capable of uniquely manipulating light, with applications ranging from optical communications to remote biosensing. Metasurfaces are engineered by rational assembly of subwavelength elements, defined as meta-atoms, giving rise to unique physical properties arising from the collective behavior of meta-atoms. These meta-atoms are typically organized using effective, reproducible, and precise nanofabrication methods that require a lot of effort to achieve scalable and cost-effective metasurfaces. In contrast, bottom–up methods based on colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) have developed in the last decade as a fascinating alternative for accelerating the technological spread of metasurfaces. The present review takes stock of recent advances in the fabrication and applications of hybrid metasurfaces prepared by bottom-up methods, resulting in disordered metasurfaces. In particular, metasurfaces prepared with plasmonic NPs are emphasized for their multifold applications, which are discussed from a biotechnology perspective. However, some examples of organized metasurfaces prepared by merging bottom–up and top–down approaches are also described. Finally, leveraging the historical disordered metasurface evolution, the review draws new perspectives for random metasurface design and applications.},

On that note, redox-active metal complexes are explored as innovative electrode materials for LIBs. Redox-active metal(II) chloride complexes (MCC) demonstrate promising potential as anode materials, exhibiting high capacity and excellent rate capability. In particular, zinc(II) chloride complexes, referred to as ZCC, achieve a capacity of 1720 mAh g −1 at 2.0 A g −1 over 200 cycles. Additionally, the lithium-ion storage mechanism of MCC is elucidated using ex situ analyses of MCC anode&#39;s surface in its fully discharged state. The high capacity of the MCC anode is attributed to conversion reaction with Li + ions forming LiCl and electrodeposition of metallic lithium from the over-lithiated Li + ions. These findings support the potential use of redox-active metal complexes as novel anode materials for LIBs.},

Here, the study introduces a PCM-only metasurface that exclusively consists of voxel units crafted from different phases of phase-change materials. Micro-nano regions, with varying phase states, are directly utilized as resonant elements and embedded in the material, forming the metasurface voxel meta-atoms. By manipulating the morphology, size, and arrangement of these meta-atoms, the study achieves both the fabrication and modulation of the PCM-only metasurface. Additionally, a 3D high-precision voxelated beam deflection method based on femtosecond laser phase modulation is introduced to streamline the fabrication and modulation of PCM-only metasurface. By using a spatial light modulator to load the blazed grating phase manipulation beam for precise deflection, high-precision deflection processing of individual meta-atom on metasurfaces can be achieved, with a deflection accuracy of up to 200nm. By loading Fresnel phase manipulation beams to move along the z-axis, perfect modulation of PCM sub-meta-atoms can be achieved.

  abstract     = {Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are emerging environmental pollutants characterized by their extreme stability and resistance to degradation. Among them, tetrafluoromethane (CF 4 ) is the simplest and most abundant PFC in the atmosphere. However, the highest C─F bond energy and its highly symmetrical structure make it particularly challenging to decompose. In this work, a yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor is developed to enhance the catalytic hydrolysis performance of CF 4 by creating a local autothermic environment. Finite element simulations predict that the yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor captures the heat released during the catalytic hydrolysis of CF 4 , resulting in a local autothermic environment within the yolk–shell structure that is 50 °C higher than the set temperature. The effectiveness of this local autothermic environment is experimentally confirmed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. As a result, the obtained yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor achieves 100% CF 4 conversion at a considerably low temperature of 580 °C for over 150 h, while hollow and solid Al 2 O 3 structures required higher temperatures of 610 and 630 °C, respectively, to achieve the same conversion rate, demonstrating the potential of yolk–shell Al 2 O 3 micro-reactor to significantly reduce the energy requirements for PFCs degradation and contribute to more sustainable and effective environmental remediation strategies.},

Apart from conventional welding, a variant involving a dynamic beam modulation superimposed onto the linear motion is studied.

Here the conformational dynamics of IDPs and the correlations therein are analyzed, using µs-scale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. The existence of typical scale-free spatio-temporal correlations in IDP conformational fluctuations is demonstrated. Their conformational evolutions exhibit “1/ f noise” power spectra and are accompanied by the appearance of residue domains following a power-law size distribution. Additionally, the motions of residues present scale-free behavioral correlation. These scale-free correlations resemble those in physical systems near critical points, suggesting that IDPs are poised at a critical state. Therefore, IDPs can effectively respond to finite differences in sequence compositions and engender considerable structural heterogeneity which is beneficial for IDP interactions and phase formation.},

  abstract     = {Nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) senescence contributes to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, it is demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counteracted the aging of NPCs and IVDD at the cellular and physiological levels. The expression of ACE2 correlates negatively with the degree of NPC senescence and IVDD. Using both loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, it is revealed that ACE2 deficiency increased the senescence of NPCs and exacerbated injury- or instability-induced IVDD, whereas ACE2 overexpression counteracted these detrimental effects. Mechanistically, integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk transcriptomics shows that ACE2 deficiency results in the activation of TGFβ2/Smads signaling pathway and the transcription of Serpine1, ultimately triggering NPC senescence and IVDD. A nanomedical delivery system (virus-like nanovectors, VNs) composed of nanovectors with a virus-like surface topology and small interfering RNA targeting Serpine1 (VN-siSer) is developed. With nanotopology-enhanced transfection efficiency, RNA-interfering treatment by VN-siSer effectively alleviated NPC senescence and IVDD at both the cellular and animal levels. Overall, the data reveal the underlying mechanisms of ACE2 in NPC senescence and IVDD pathogenesis and propose a distinct paradigm of precise nanomedical senescence-blockade RNAi for IVDD treatment.},

Field-of-view-tunable edge detection is particularly significant for detecting a broader range of objects, enhancing both practicality and flexibility. In this work, a novel approach—adaptive optical spatial differentiation is proposed for field-of-view-tunable edge detection. This method improves the ability to acquire spatial information and facilitates edge detection over a wider angular range. The adaptive optical spatial differentiation meta-device relies on two core components: the spatial differentiation dielectric metasurface and the adaptive liquid prism. The meta-device is shown to function as a highly efficient (≈85%) isotropic spatial differentiator, operating across the entire visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm) within a wide-angle object space, expanding up to 4.5 times the original field of view. The proposed scheme presents new opportunities for efficient, flexible, high-capacity integrated data processing and imaging devices. And simultaneously provides a novel optical analog computing architecture for the next generation of wide field-of-view phase contrast microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Mycotoxins, a category of fungal secondary metabolites, frequently contaminate food products and pose a severe threat to human health. Aspergillus , a genus of fungi, is capable of producing mycotoxins, with aflatoxins (AFs) and ochratoxins being its principal types. Aspergillus mycotoxins can contaminate a wide range of crops and their derivatives, such as maize, wheat, rice, minor cereals, and peanuts, thereby threatening food and feed safety. In the paper, the related biosynthesis genes and multifaceted biosynthesis pathways of these mycotoxins are first discussed in detail, and elucidated several global regulators, including growth conditions, oxidative stress, and cell signal. Furthermore, how global shifts in temperature and water availability, driven by climate change (including rising temperatures, increased heavy rainfall frequency, prolonged droughts, and elevated carbon dioxide levels), are key determinants of Aspergillus proliferation and mycotoxin production are explored. Finally, to safeguard animal and human health from the detrimental impacts of Aspergillus mycotoxins, the effective and convenient analytical techniques and management strategies for the detection and prevention of contamination are analyzed. Overall, this review provides effective detection techniques and promising solutions to the global contamination of food with Aspergillus mycotoxins, which is of great significance to ensuring food security and protecting people&#39;s lives and health.},

  abstract     = {Dentin hypersensitivity (DH), marked by exposed dentinal tubules, presents as a sharp toothache triggered by stimuli and subsides when the stimuli are removed. To address the limitations of current commercial desensitizers in terms of acid resistance, friction resistance, and stability, a black phosphorus nanosheet-composited methacrylate gelatin hydrogel (GelMA/BP) is developed for DH treatment, leveraging the synergistic effects of photothermal therapy and biomineralization. Incorporating the BP nanosheet provided GelMA/BP with a stable photothermal response and the continuous release of phosphate anions, which blocked dentinal tubules by converting light energy into heat and initiating biomineralization. In vitro desensitizing therapy showed that the dentinal tubule diameter in the GelMA/BP50 group (0−1.13 µm) is significantly reduced compared to that in the DH-model group (0−3.14 µm). The GelMA/BP50 group achieved an 86% tubule occlusion rate, with acid resistance of 80%, friction resistance of 76%, and long-term stability of 74%. In vivo studies further validated the efficacy of GelMA/BP50, showing a reduction in tubule diameter (0−0.37 µm) and an occlusion rate of 79%, which alleviated toothache and increased intake and weight. These results demonstrate that this desensitizing hydrogel acts as an effective dentinal tubule sealant, offering promising clinical benefits for the topical treatment of DH.},

  abstract     = {Impaired autophagy is reported to promote osteoarthritis (OA). However, the mechanism by which autophagy in regulating meniscus degeneration and OA remains unclear. Here, unconvered aberrant energetic metabolism pattern in meniscus cells with OA is uncovered first, which results in lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. And these phenomena are induced by impaired autophagy in meniscus cells with OA. It is further revealed that the suppression of m 6 A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) inhibits autophagy and causing lower ATP production by reducing oxidative phosphorylation. Specific deletion of FTO in meniscus cells by generating FTO flox/flox ; COL1A1-Cre ERT2 (FTO cko ) mice impair autophagy and promote meniscus degeneration and OA, while intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus of FTO (AAV-FTO) restores autophagy and alleviates meniscus degeneration and OA. Mechanistically, FTO regulates the mRNA stability of ATG16L1 by targeting the m 6 A methylation sites on ATG16L1 in a YTHDF2-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes and causing an imbalance in energetic metabolism. Intra-articular injection of AAV-FTO reverses the catabolic phenotype of meniscus degeneration and OA in FTO cko mice. In summary, these findings reveal FTO orchestrates autophagy and energetic metabolism by regulating ATG16L1 in a m 6 A-dependent manner. Therefore, targeting FTO might be a potential therapeutic strategy for meniscus degeneration and early-stage OA.},

Intriguingly, patients using cochlear implants (CIs) have reported significant relief from tinnitus symptoms, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and intracochlear implantation risks cochlear damage and hearing loss. This study demonstrates that targeted intracochlear electrical stimulation (ES) in guinea pigs with noise-induced hearing loss reversed tinnitus-related maladaptive plasticity in the cochlear nucleus (CN), characterized by reduced auditory innervation, increased somatosensory innervation, and diminished inhibitory neural networks. Additionally, a customized extracochlear ES delivered by a newly designed extracochlear electrode array to guinea pigs with salicylate-induced tinnitus also reversed the aforementioned maladaptive plasticity and alleviated tinnitus without causing additional cochlear damage or hearing loss. These findings suggest that CI-delivered ES may alleviate tinnitus by reversing maladaptive CN plasticity.

  abstract     = {Neo-vascularization plays a key role in achieving long-term viability of engineered cells contained in medical implants used in precision medicine. Moreover, strategies to promote neo-vascularization around medical implants may also be useful to promote the healing of deep wounds. In this context, a biocompatible, electroconducti v e b o rophene–poly(ε-capro l ac t one) (PCL) 3D platform is developed, which is called VOLT, to support designer cells engineered with a direct-current (DC) voltage-controlled gene circuit that drives secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). The VOLT platform consists of a 3D-printed borophene-PCL honeycomb-shaped matrix decorated with borophene-PCL nanofibers by electrospinning. The honeycomb structure provides mechanical stability, while the nanofibers facilitate the adhesion, migration, and proliferation of the engineered cells. The cells incorporate a DC-powered reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensing gene circuit wired to an engineered synthetic promoter that triggers secretion of VEGFA to promote vascularization in the adjacent extracellular matrix. Cells engineered with this gene circuit and enclosed in the VOLT matrix, termed the VOLT VEGFA system, can be simply triggered using off-the-shelf AA batteries, utilizing the established ability of a brief DC bias to generate non-cytotoxic levels of ROS. For proof-of-concept, a subcutaneous wound-healing model in rats is chosen. Electrostimulation of a VOLT VEGFA implant (5 V, 20 s per day) induced secretion of VEGFA, and significantly accelerated neovascularization and granulation tissue formation, resulting in faster wound closure compared with non-stimulated controls. Complete re-epithelialization and dermal regeneration are observed within 15 days of application.},

Results demonstrate that the system can eliminate biofilm, reduce cytotoxicity, promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration by the multiple advantages of chemodynamic therapy (CDT), enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT), and improved degradation process from BP NSs to phosphate for promoting cell proliferation. Notably, the balance between excellent photodynamic stability and rapid degradability of BP NSs is maintained, and the improved degradation mechanism of BP NSs is vividly elucidated by density functional theory (DFT)-based molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Furthermore, the transcriptional changes of treated MRSA-infected skin are studied using RNA-seq technology to reveal the potential therapeutic mechanism.

To address these issues, an infection-mimicking gel (IM-Gel) is developed that is designed to emulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of immune stimulation in acute viral infections through in situ supramolecular self-assembly of nanoparticulate-TLR7/8a (NP-TLR7/8a) and an antigen with tannic acid (TA). Through collagen-binding properties of TA, the IM-Gel enables sustained delivery and enhanced retention of NP-TLR7/8a and protein antigen in the lymph node subcapsular sinus of mice for over 7 days, prolonging the exposure of vaccine components in both B cell and T cell zones, leading to robust humoral and cellular responses. The IM-Gel system with the influenza A antigen confers cross-protection against multiple influenza subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H3N2, H7N3, and H9N2) with long-term immune responses. Combination of the IM-Gel with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein also elicits strong cross-reactive antibody responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, NY510+D614G, Gamma, Kappa, and Delta).

However, it is unclear whether maternal gut inflammation (MGI) during lactation influences mother-to-infant microbial transmission and offspring microbiota and disease susceptibility. In this study, it is found that MGI during lactation altered the gut microbiota of suckling pups by shaping the maternal microbiota in the gut and mammary glands. MGI-induced changes in the gut microbiota of suckling pups lasted into adulthood, resulting in the exacerbation of acute liver failure (ALF) caused by acetaminophen (APAP) in offspring. Specifically, MGI reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri ( L. reuteri ) and its metabolite indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level in adult offspring. L. reuteri and IAA alleviated ALF in mice by promoting intestinal IL-22 production. Mechanistically, IL-22 limits APAP-induced excessive oxidative stress and ferroptosis by activating STAT3. The intestinal abundances of L. reuteri and IAA are inversely associated with the progression of patients with ALF. Overall, the study reveals the role of MGI in mother-to-infant microbial transmission and disease development in offspring, highlighting potential strategies for intervention in ALF based on the IAA-IL-22-STAT3 axis.},

The material set for 3D printing traditionally is focused on structural materials rather than functional materials suitable for electronic and electrochemical applications. In this review the fundamental challenges are considered for transforming 3D printed materials into conductive, multifunctional electrodes suitable for electrical and electrochemical devices by printing nanocomposites, infusing molecular precursors and post-processing these structures via carbonization. To understand the design of 3D electrodes toward their use in both sensors and electrochemical devices such as catalysts, this review summarizes recent advances in hierarchical design of porous metastructures, the engineering of mass transport and electronic transport in 3D structures, and the application of high-throughput materials design by machine learning and artificial intelligence.

  abstract     = {Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a major zoonotic pathogen, with mammary gland infections contributing to mastitis, a condition that poses significant health risks to lactating women and adversely affects the dairy industry. Therefore, understanding the immune mechanisms underlying mammary infections caused by S. aureus is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies against mastitis. This study identified hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) as a potential regulator of S. aureus infection in mammary glands. It is demonstrated that HCAR2 deficiency exacerbates the inflammatory response and disrupts the blood-milk barrier in the mammary gland during S. aureus infection, with NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis playing a central role. Activation of HCAR2, on the other hand, suppressed CMPK2 expression, thereby mitigating mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis in mouse mammary epithelial cells (mMECs) induced by S. aureus . Additionally, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released from S. aureus -infected mMECs activates the cGAS/STING signaling pathway in macrophages, impairing their bactericidal activity. In conclusion, this study highlights the critical role of HCAR2 in S. aureus infection of the mammary gland and provides a theoretical basis for identifying potential therapeutic targets for such infections.},

  abstract     = {The infiltration and excessive polarization of M1 macrophages contribute to the induction and persistence of low-grade inflammation in joint-related degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). The lipid metabolism dysregulation promotes M1 macrophage polarization by coordinating the compensatory pathways of the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Here, a self-assembling, licofelone-loaded nanoparticle (termed LCF-CSBN), comprising chondroitin sulfate and bilirubin joined by an ethylenediamine linker, is developed to selectively reprogram lipid metabolism in macrophage activation. LCF-CSBN is internalized by M1 macrophages via CD44-mediated endocytosis and targets the Golgi apparatus accompanied with the reactive oxygen species-responsive release of licofelone (LCF, dual inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism). LCF-CSBN effectively promotes M1 to M2 macrophage transition by reprogramming the Golgi apparatus-related sphingolipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. Intra-articularly injected LCF-CSBN retains in the joint for up to 28 days and accumulates into M1 macrophages. Moreover, LCF-CSBN can effectively attenuate joint inflammation, oxidative stress, and cartilage degeneration in OA model rats. These findings indicate the promising potential of lipid-metabolism-reprogramming LCF-CSBN in the targeted therapy of OA.},

  abstract     = {In the face of exponential data growth, DNA-based storage offers a promising solution for preserving big data. However, most existing DNA storage methods, akin to traditional block printing, require costly chemical synthesis for each individual data file, adopting a sequential, one-time-use synthesis approach. To overcome these limitations, a novel, cost-effective “DNA-movable-type storage” system, inspired by movable type printing, is introduced. This system utilizes prefabricated DNA movable types-short, double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides encoding specific payload, address, and checksum data. These DNA-MTs are enzymatically ligated/assembled into cohesive sequences, termed “DNA movable type blocks,” streamlining the assembly process with the automated BISHENG-1 DNA-MT inkjet printer. Using BISHENG-1, 43.7 KB of data files are successfully printed, assembled, stored, and accurately retrieved in diverse formats (text, image, audio, and video) in vitro and in vivo, using only 350 DNA-MTs. Notably, each DNA-MT, synthesized once (2 OD ), can be used up to 10000 times, reducing costs to $122/MB—outperforming existing DNA storage methods. This innovation circumvents the need to synthesize entire DNA sequences encoding files from scratch, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages. Furthermore, it has considerable untapped potential to advance a robust DNA storage system, better meeting the extensive data storage demands of the big-data era.},

Such sensors offer the dual benefits of operational simplicity and high-function adaptability. Herein, a novel wireless sensor is fabricated using radio frequency (RF) technology for passive, wireless measurement of mechanical strains. Previously introduced concept of coupling piezoresistive electrodes is utilized with capacitive sensors to ensure high-sensitivity capacitive sensing. For the first time, it is implemented and demonstrated here as a fully printable, inexpensive, and ready-to-use device utilizing the recent advances in piezoresistive inks and screen-printing technologies. The near-field communication (NFC) tag features an inductor - capacitor (LC) resonant circuit with a distinct resonant frequency. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity and detects substantial variations in capacitance, with a gauge factor (GF) of ≈16 at 20 MHz for strain levels below 5%. Within the wireless framework, the sensor achieves a significant shift in resonance frequency (GF of ≈2.2). It also exhibited excellent performance in wirelessly monitoring the strain in a glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) specimen during the bending test. The results confirm the potential applicability of the sensor as an embedded sensor for monitoring various types of composite structures.

  abstract     = {Studying the molecular basis of intestinal infections caused by enteric pathogens at the tissue level is challenging, because most human intestinal infection models have limitations, and results obtained from animals may not reflect the human situation. Infections with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) have different outcomes between organisms. 3D tissue modeling of primary human material provides alternatives to animal experimentation, but epithelial co-culture with immune cells remains difficult. Macrophages, for instance, contribute to the immunocompetence of native tissue, yet their incorporation into human epithelial tissue models is challenging. A 3D immunocompetent tissue model of the human small intestine based on decellularized submucosa enriched with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) is established. The multicellular model recapitulated in vivo-like cellular diversity, especially the induction of GP2 positive microfold (M) cells. Infection studies with STm reveal that the pathogen physically interacts with these M-like cells. MDMs show trans-epithelial migration and phagocytosed STm within the model and the levels of inflammatory cytokines are induced upon STm infection. Infected epithelial cells are shed into the supernatant, potentially reflecting an intracellular reservoir of invasion-primed STm. Together, the 3D model of the human intestinal epithelium bears potential as an alternative to animals to identify human-specific processes underlying enteric bacterial infections.},

One hundred and eighty-six twins are recruited and played as responders in the Ultimatum Game (UG) while undergoing fMRI scanning in their early adulthood (Study-1) and are measured on depressive symptoms eight years later (Study-2). With computational modeling, the process of norm adaptation is differentiated from that of fairness valuation in UG. The two processes both have moderate levels of heritability. The anterior insula has a significant phenotypic correlation, whereas the Supplementary Motor Area/Medial Frontal Gyrus (SMA/mSFG) shows both a significant phenotypic correlation and a shared genetic influence with the learning rate, an index for norm adaptation. The dopaminergic DRD2 polymorphisms correlate with both the learning rate and the SMA/mSFG encoding of prediction error, constituting of their common genetic basis. Regional gene expression analysis reveals the high expression of dopamine-related genes in the SMA/mSFG. Moreover, the learning rate can predict depressive symptom severity eight years later, with the DRD2 polymorphisms constituting their shared genetic basis. This suggests that heritability is a non-negligible driving force behind norm adaptation, which facilitates the learning of social norms in changing environments and preserves long-term mental health.},

In MCAO mice, the nanoformulation (polymer: 3.2 mg·kg −1 , BAPTA-AM: 400 µg·kg −1 ) reversibly opened the BBB and achieved high brain biodistribution up to 12.7%ID/g of the total administered dose after 3 h post single injection, effectively restoring intracellular Ca 2+ and redox homeostasis, improving cerebral histopathology, and inhibiting mitochondrial PI3K/Akt/Bcl-2/Bax/Cyto-C/Caspase-3,9 apoptosis pathway for rescuing dying neurons (reduced apoptosis cell from 59.5% to 7.9%). It also remodeled the inflammatory microenvironment in cerebral ischemic penumbra by inhibiting astrocyte over-activation, reprogramming microglia polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and blocking NF-κB/TNF- α /IL-6 signaling pathways. These interventions eventually reduced the cerebral infarction area by 96.3%, significantly improved neurological function, and restored blood flow reperfusion from 66.2% to ≈100%, all while facilitating BBB repair and avoiding brain edema.

  abstract     = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is an “environmental obesogen” and this study aims to investigate the intergenerational impacts of BPA-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS), specifically focusing on unraveling mechanisms. Exposure to BPA induces metabolic disorders in the paternal mice, which are then transmitted to offspring, leading to late-onset MetS. Mechanistically, BPA upregulates Srebf1, which in turn promotes the Pparg-dependent transcription of Dicer1 in spermatocytes, increasing the levels of multiple sperm microRNAs (miRNAs). Several of these miRNAs are highly expressed in a synchronized manner in liver of the offspring. miR149-5p, miR150-5p, and miR700-5p target a specific region in the Lepr 3′UTR, termed “SMITE” (“ S everal Mi RNAs T argeting E lements”), to negatively regulate Lepr. These i nherited a nti- L epr miRNAs, also referred to i nherited a nti- L epr miRNAs (IAL-miRs), modulate hepatic steatosis, and insulin signaling through the Lepr regulatory Igfbp2, Egfr, and Ampk. Furthermore, IAL-miRs inhibit Ccnd1 not only via binding to “SMITE” but also via Lepr–Igfbp2 axis, which contribute to hepatocyte senescence. These pathological processes interact in a self-reinforcing cycle, worsening MetS in the paternal BPA-exposed offspring. The findings reveal mechanism wherein lipid metabolism reprogramming in spermatocytes-induced perturbations of sperm miRNAs, triggered by BPA, leads to intergenerational inheritance of paternal MetS through suppression of the hepatic Lepr axis in the offspring.},

  abstract     = {Urinalysis is one of the predominant tools for clinical testing owing to the abundant composition, sufficient volume, and non-invasive acquisition of urine. As a critical component of routine urinalysis, urine protein testing measures the levels and types of proteins, enabling the early diagnosis of diseases. Traditional methods require three separate steps including strip testing, protein/creatinine ratio measurement, and electrophoresis respectively to achieve qualitative, quantitative, and classification analyses of proteins in urine with long time and cumbersome operations. Herein, this work demonstrates a “three-in-one” protocol to analyze the urine composition by combining multifunctional nanoparticles with machine learning. This work constructs a sensor array to analyze proteinuria by employing nanoparticles with unique optical properties, outstanding catalytic activity, diverse composition, and tunable structure as probes. Different proteins interacted with nanoprobes differently and are classified by this sensor array based on their physicochemical heterogeneities. With the aid of machine learning, the urine composition is precisely detected for the diagnosis of bladder cancer. This protocol enables quantification and classification of 5 proteinuria in 10 min without any tedious pretreatment, showing proimise for the comprehensive analysis of body fluid for early disease diagnosis.},

In cancer research, they are now widely used as in vitro models for drug testing. However, their analysis still relies on tedious manual procedures, which hinders their routine use in large-scale biological assays. Here, a novel drop millifluidic approach is introduced to screen and sort large populations containing over one thousand MCAs: ImOCAS (Image-based Organoid Cytometry and Acoustic Sorting). This system utilizes real-time image processing to detect pheno-morphological traits in MCAs. They are then encapsulated in millimetric drops, actuated on-demand using the acoustic radiation force. The performance of ImOCAS is demonstrated by sorting spheroids with uniform sizes from a heterogeneous population, and by isolating organoids from spheroids with different phenotypes. This approach lays the groundwork for high-throughput screening and high-content analysis of MCAs with controlled morphological and phenotypical properties, which promises accelerated progress in biomedical research.},

The initial stages of bone-related immunomodulation and cellular colonization play crucial roles, but have received limited attention. Herein, a novel supramolecular co-assembled coating of strontium (Sr)-doped metal polyphenol networks (MPN) modified with c(RGDfc) is developed and well-characterized, for eliciting an early immunomodulation and cellular colonization. The results showed that the (Sr-MPN)@RGD coating significantly regulated the polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype by controllable release of Sr, and promote the initial adhesion of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by RGD presented on MPN. Notably, the (Sr-MPN)@RGD attenuated osteoclast differentiation and oxidative stress as well as enhanced osteoblast differentiation and angiogenesis due to macrophage polarization toward M2 phenotype, which in turn has a profound effect on neighboring cells through paracrine signaling. In vivo results showed that the (Sr-MPN)@RGD coating manifested superior osseointegration and bone maturation to the bare Ti-rod or Ti-rod coated with MPN and Sr-MPN. This work contributed to the design of multifunctional implant coatings that address the complex biological process of osteointegration from the perspective of orchestrating stem cell recruitment with immunomodulatory strategies.},

Here, a Mito-EF tracker (Mito-EFT) with a four-pronged probe design is presented to elucidate the dynamic mechanisms of Mito-EF&#39;s involvement in mitochondrial quality control. Heightened aggregation of Mito-EF in fiber-like healthy mitochondria compared to round-like damaged mitochondria is demonstrated, revealed Mito-EF aggregation correlated with mitochondrial morphological remodeling, particularly in regions undergoing mitochondrial fission and fusion, and show the Mito-EF signal associated with mitochondrial cristae maintained by Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP1). This underscores the importance of considering Mito-EF in assessing mitochondrial quality control parameters. A novel drug screening evaluation parameter, Mito-EF is also introduced to screen and discover mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic modulators.

In this study, the anisotropic characteristics of Ni-based van der Waals materials, specifically NiTe 2 and its alloy NiTeSe, utilizing a combination of comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are explored. Unlike 1T-NiTe 2 , which exhibits trigonal in-plane symmetry, the substitution of Te with Se in NiTe 2 (resulting in the NiTeSe alloy) induces a pronounced in-plane anisotropy. This anisotropy is clear in the STM topographs, which reveal a distinct linear order of charge distribution. Corroborating these observations, ARPES measurements and DFT calculations reveal an anisotropic Fermi surface centered at the point, which is notably elongated along the k y direction, leading to directional variations in in-plane carrier velocities. Consequently, the Fermi velocity is highest along the k x direction where the linear charge distribution aligns in real space and is lowest along the k y direction. These findings offer valuable insights into the tunability of anisotropic properties in ternary transition metal dichalcogenide systems, highlighting their potential applications in the development of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

However, their structural determinants for spectral broadening and operating stability are still needed to be investigated in further. Herein, a novel multi-N-heterocycles Diindolo[3,2,1jk:3′,2′,1′jk]dicarbazole[1,2-b:4,5-b] (DIDCz) is proposed to manipulate the emission color toward pure blue region by extending π-conjugation of the N-π-N bridge. By utilizing computed spectral technique, interrelationships between indolocarbazole (ICz)-cyclization sites and spectral broadening are defined. Molecular backbone modifications involving optimized 2,3,6,7-ICz cyclization and steric hindrance substituents are conducive to restricting swing of peripheral bonds and stretching resonances of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) frameworks, thereby contributing to the reduction of shoulder emission peaks. Consequently, the DIDCz-based chromophore exhibited narrowband blue emission with a FWHM of only 15 nm, achieving highly efficient (external quantum efficiencies of 8.87% in triplet–triplet fusion fluorescence and 22.3% in sensitized fluorescence) and long-term (95% of the initial luminance of 1000 cd m −2 , T95 = 1545 h) electroluminescence performances, showing one of the most narrowband and stable blue OLEDs among the reported PAH chromophores. The current achievements offer a new perspective to manage spectral broadening precisely based on the molecular vibration limiting technique.},

  abstract     = {Skeletal muscle atrophy (sarcopenia) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis, and chronic muscle inflammation plays a pivotal role in its pathologenesis. However, the detailed mechanism through which injured liver tissues mediate skeletal muscle inflammatory injury remains elusive. Here, it is reported that injured hepatocytes might secrete mtDNA-enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs) to trigger skeletal muscle inflammation by activating the cGAS-STING pathway. Briefly, injured liver secreted increased amounts of EVs into circulation, which are then engulfed primarily by macrophages in skeletal muscle and subsequently induce cGAS-STING signaling and its-mediated inflammatory response in muscles. In contrast, suppression of hepatic EV secretion or STING signaling significantly alleviated cirrhosis-induced skeletal muscle inflammation and muscle atrophy in vivo. Circulating EVs from cirrhotic patients showed higher levels of mtDNA, and the levels of EV-mtDNA positively correlated with the severity of liver injury. In injured hepatocytes, mitochondrial damage promoted the release of cytosolic mtDNA and the subsequent secretion of mtDNA-enriched EVs. This study reveals that injured hepatocyte-derived EVs induce skeletal muscle inflammation via the mtDNA‒STING axis, while targeted blockade of liver EV secretion or STING signaling represents a potential therapeutic approach for preventing cirrhosis-associated skeletal muscle atrophy.},

However, a significant obstacle in traditional post-assembled heterojunctions is the high interfacial barrier for charge transfer caused by atomic lattice mismatch at multiphase interfaces. Here, as research prototypes, the study creates a lattice-matched co-atomic interface within CsPbBr 3 -CsPb 2 Br 5 polytypic nanocrystals (113-125 PNs) through the proposed in situ hybrid strategy to elucidate the underlying charge transfer mechanism within this unique interface. Compared to CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals, the 113–125 PNs exhibit a remarkable 3.6-fold increase in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity (173.3 µmol −1 g −1 within 5 h). Furthermore, Kelvin probe force microscopy results reveal an increase in the built-in electric field within this lattice-matched co-atomic interface from 43.5 to 68.7 mV, providing a stronger driving force for charge separation and directional migration. Additionally, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy uncovers the additional charge carrier transfer pathways across this lattice-matched co-atomic interface. Thus, this unique co-atomic interface significantly promotes the interfacial electronic coupling and mitigates the charge transfer barrier, thus facilitating efficient charge separation and transfer.

The abundant type I ROS generated by BSA@TPE-BT-SCT NPs induce multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. These multifaceted cell deaths synergistically facilitate the release of damage-associated molecular patterns and antitumor cytokines, thereby provoking robust antitumor immunity. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that BSA@TPE-BT-SCT NPs elicited the immunogenic cell death, enhance dendritic cell maturation, activate T cell, and reduce myeloid-derived suppressor cells, leading to the inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Additionally, BSA@TPE-BT-SCP NPs also exhibited excellent antitumor performance in a humanized mice model, evidenced by a reduction in senescent T cells among these activated T cells.

A well-developed lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform has been widely explored for high-performance electro-optic (EO) modulators to bridge electrical and optical signals. However, the photonic waveguides on the x-cut LNOI platform suffer serious polarization-mode conversion/coupling issues because of strong birefringence, making it hard to realize large-scale integration. Here, low-birefringence photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on lithium-tantalate-on-insulator (LTOI) are proposed and demonstrated, which enables high-performance passive photonic devices as well as EO modulators, showing great potential for large-scale photonic chips. Analysis of mode conversion and evolution behaviors with both low- and high-birefringence shows undesired mode hybridizations can be effectively suppressed. A simple and universal fabrication process is developed and various representative passive photonic devices are demonstrated with impressive performances. Finally, a wavelength-division-multiplexed optical transmitter is developed with a data rate of 1.6 Tbps by monolithically integrating 8 EO modulators and an 8-channel arrayed waveguide grating. Therefore, the demonstrated low-birefringence LTOI platform shows strong ability in both passively and actively controlling photon behaviors on a chip, indicating great potential for ultrafast processing and communicating large-capacity data.},

  abstract     = {The diverse and dynamic population of microorganisms present in the gut microbiota may affect host health. There are evidences to support the role of gut microbiota as a key player in reproductive development. Unfortunately, the relationship between reproductive disorders caused by aging and gut microbiota remains largely unknown. Here, it is shown for the first time that gut microorganism Bacteroides fragilis (BF) transplantation ameliorates ovarian aging by transporting extracellular vesicles (EVs) through the gut-ovary axis. Mechanistically, miR-1246 is enriched in EVs derived from BF-treated intestinal cells, and these miR-1246-enriched EVs are transferred to ovaries, thereby effectively improving reproductive senescence by reducing oxidative stress in the ovaries. Specifically, miR-1246 reduces the ubiquitination of p62 and stabilizes the protein level of p62 by targeting E3 ligase SKP2. Then Keap1-Nrf2 complex is dissociated and Keap1 is recruited to form the p62-Keap1 complex. With the dissociation of Keap1-Nrf2 complex, Nrf2 is released and activated, thus promoting the transcription of antioxidant enzymes and relieving reproductive senescence. Collectively, the data indicates that intestinal cell-derived EVs serve as natural information carriers in the crosstalk between the gut and the ovary, and intestinal microorganism transplantation is a promising approach for the treatment of ovarian dysfunction diseases.},

  abstract     = {Most gene therapies exert their actions via manipulation of hepatocytes (parenchymal cells) and the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of synthetic mRNA in non-parenchymal cells (NPC) such as Kupffer cells (KC), and liver macrophages, remain unclear. Here, the spatio-temporal distribution of mRNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( Egfp ), siRNA, or both co-encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNP) in the liver in vivo using real-time intravital imaging is investigated. Although both KC and hepatocytes demonstrate comparable high and rapid uptake of mRNA-LNP and siRNA-LNP in vivo, the translation of Egfp mRNA occurs exclusively in hepatocytes during intravital imaging. Despite attempts such as inhibiting intracellular ribonuclease, substituting uridine bases in mRNA with pseudouridine, and using a different ionizable lipid in the LNP mixture, no substantial increase in Egfp translation by NPC is possible. The investigation reveals that hepatocytes, which are distinct from other liver cells due to their polyploidy, exhibit significantly elevated levels of total RNA and protein, along with a higher proportion of ribosomal protein per individual cell. Consequently, fundamental cellular differences account for the low mRNA translation observed in NPC. The findings therefore suggest that cellular biology imposes a natural limitation on synthetic mRNA translation that is strongly influenced by cellular ploidy.},

  abstract     = {RuO 2 -based materials are considered an important kind of electrocatalysts on oxygen evolution reaction and water electrolysis, but the reported discrepancies of activities exist among RuO 2 electrocatalysts prepared via different processes. Herein, a highly efficient RuO 2 catalysts via a facile hydrolysis-annealing approach is reported for water electrolysis. The RuO 2 catalyst dealt with at 200 °C (RuO 2 -200) performs the highest activities on both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid with overpotentials of 200 mV for OER and 66 mV for HER to reach a current density of 100 mA cm −2 as well as stable operation for100 h. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations show that the activities of as-prepared RuO 2 rely on the hydroxide group/lattice oxygen (OH − /O 2− ) ratio, size, and crystalline of RuO 2 . The density functional theory (DFT) calculation also reveal that the OH − would enhance the activities of RuO 2 for HER and OER via modifying the electronic structure to facilitate intermediate adsorption, thereby reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. The water electrolysis by using RuO 2 -200 as the catalyst on both anode and cathode demonstrates a stable generation of hydrogen and oxygen with high Faradic efficiency at a current density of ≈30 mA cm −2 and a potential of below 1.47 V.},

Here, it is demonstrated that mannose, a hexose, closely correlates with the pathological characteristics of AD, as confirmed by measuring mannose levels in the brains and serum of AD mice, as well as in the serum of AD patients. AD mice are given mannose by intra-cerebroventricular injection (ICV) or in drinking water to investigate the effects of mannose on cognition and AD pathological progression. Chronic mannose overload increases β-amyloid (Aβ) burdens and exacerbates cognitive impairments, which are reversed by a mannose-free diet or mannose transporter antagonists. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics suggested that mannose-mediated N-glycosylation of BACE1 and Nicastrin enhances their protein stability, promoting Aβ production. Additionally, reduced mannose intake decreased BACE1 and Nicastrin stability, ultimately lowering Aβ production and mitigating AD pathology. this results highlight that high-dose mannose consumption may exacerbate AD pathogenesis. Restricting dietary mannose may have therapeutic benefits.},

Due to their enzyme-like catalytic properties, unique composition, and intelligent design, ROS-based nanomaterials have garnered considerable attention in oral nanomedicine. Such nanomaterials have the capacity to influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of ROS within biological systems, guiding the evolution of intra-ROS to facilitate therapeutic interventions.

To solve this, we developed a near-infrared (NIR) light-controlled polycaprolactone/copper-sulfur (PCL/CuS) coating that slows degradation and enhances osseointegration of Zn alloys. The zinc–lithium (Zn–Li) substrate is encapsulated with PCL, reducing Zn 2+ release and maintaing biocompatibility. Controlled Zn 2+ release and mild photothermal therapy via CuS nanoparticles promoted osteogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrated enhanced cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed improved osseointegration. Mechanistic studies using RNA sequencing and Western blotting revealed that the coating promotes osteogenesis by activating the Wnt/β-catenin and inhibiting NF-κB pathways.

Moreover, it is often overlooked that conventional PDT can exacerbate the development of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is apparently unfavorable to clinical immunotherapy. The endoplasmic reticulum&#39;s (ER) pivotal role in cellular homeostasis and its emerging link to pyroptosis have galvanized interest in ER-centric imaging and therapeutics. Herein, using the targeted group-assisted strategy (TAGS), an intriguing cyclooxygenase-2-targeted photodynamic conjugate, Indo-Cy , strategically created, which exploits the enzyme&#39;s overabundance in the tumoral ER, especially under proinflammatory hypoxic conditions. This conjugate, with its highly precise ER imaging, embodies a trifunctional strategy: i) innovating an electron transfer mechanism, converting the hemicyanine moiety into an oxygen-independent type I photosensitizer, thereby navigating around the hypoxia constraints of traditional PDT; ii) executing precise ER-targeted PDT, amplifying caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis for ICD; 3) attenuating immunosuppressive pathways by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 downstream factors, including HIF-1α, PGE2, and VEGF.

Current first-line therapeutics, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists, often yield incomplete and suboptimal vision improvement, necessitating the exploration of novel and efficacious therapeutic approaches. Herein, a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct moringin (MOR) loaded α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) coated nanoceria (M@CCNP) is constructed, where the hydroxy and newly formed carbonyl groups of α-CD interact with the nanoceria surface via O─Ce conjunction and the isothiocyanate group of MOR inserts deeply into the α-CD cavity via host–guest interaction. By exploiting the recycling reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability of nanoceria and the anti-inflammation properties of MOR, the two-level strike during AMD pathogenesis can be precisely blocked by M@CCNP. Remarkably, excellent therapeutic efficacy to CNV is observed in vivo, achieving over 80% reduction in neovascularization and over 60% reduction in leakage area. In summary, the supramolecular engineered nanoceria provides an efficient approach for amelioration of AMD by blocking the two-level strike, and presents significant potential as an exceptional drug delivery platform, particularly for ROS-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {Micro/nanoscale 3D bioelectrodes gain increasing interest for electrophysiological recording of electroactive cells. Although 3D printing has shown promise to flexibly fabricate 3D bioelectronics compared with conventional microfabrication, relatively-low resolution limits the printed bioelectrode for high-quality signal monitoring. Here, a novel multi-material electrohydrodynamic printing (EHDP) strategy is proposed to fabricate bioelectronics with sub-microscale 3D gold pillars for in vitro electrophysiological recordings. EHDP is employed to fabricate conductive circuits for signal transmission, which are passivated by polyimide via extrusion-based printing. Laser-assisted EHDP is developed to produce 3D gold pillars featuring a diameter of 0.64 ± 0.04 µm. The 3D gold pillars demonstrate stable conductivity under the cell-culture environment. Living cells can conformally grow onto these sub-microscale 3D pillars with a height below 5 µm, which facilitates the highly-sensitive recording of extracellular signals with amplitudes &lt;15 µV. The 3D pillars can apply electroporation currents to reversibly open the cellular membrane for intracellular recording, facilitating the measurement of subtle cellular electrophysiological activities. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, fully-printed chips with multiple culturing chambers and sensing bioelectronics are fabricated for zone-specific electrophysiological recording in drug testing. The proposed multi-material EHDP strategy enables rapid prototyping of organ-on-a-chip systems with 3D bioelectronics for high-quality electrophysiological recordings.},

  abstract     = {End-stage liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma or acute liver failure, critically necessitate liver transplantation. However, the shortage of available organ donors fails to meet the rapidly growing transplantation demand. Due to the high similarity of liver tissue structure and metabolism between miniature pigs and humans, xenotransplantation of pig livers is considered as a potentially viable solution to organ scarcity. In the 2024, teams from China first time have successfully transplanted a genetically modified Bama miniature pig liver into a clinically brain-dead man lasting for 10 days. This milestone in human xenotransplantation research not only confirms the feasibility of clinical application of xenotransplantation, but also underscores the daunting and protracted nature of this pathway. Despite advanced gene-editing technologies theoretically circumventing the occurrence of most transplant rejection reactions, patients still face challenges such as chronic immune rejection, coagulation disorders, and thrombotic microangiopathy after receiving xenografts. Moreover, prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs may induce irreversible immune dysfunction, leading to opportunistic infections and metabolic disorders. This article compares the similarities and differences in livers between humans and pigs, summarizes the immunometabolism of xenotransplantation based on current findings, and provides research perspectives on pre-transplantation and post-transplantation strategies for prolonging the survival time of xenografts.},

Although many studies have reported the adverse effects of microplastics (MPs) on human, the reproductive implications of continuous exposure to physically abraded polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-MPs remain unexplored. Ingestion of physically abraded PET-MPs (size range: 50–100 µm) in mice from 5 to 34 weeks of age at an annual intake relevant dose of MPs (5 mg week −1 ) significantly impaired male reproductive function. Reductions in seminiferous tubule diameter and epithelial height are observed ( p &lt; 0.0001), with 32.2% decrease in Leydig cells and 24.3% reduction in testosterone levels ( p &lt; 0.05). The epididymis shows marked deterioration in all regions, with total sperm concentration significantly reduce from 17.0 × 10⁶ to 5.3 × 10⁶ ( p &lt; 0.01) and decrease motility. Transcriptome analysis demonstrates downregulation of genes related with gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, testosterone biosynthesis, and Meiosin gene, which is for crucial spermatogenesis. Continuous ingestion of physically abraded PET-MPs from plastic bottles adversely affected testicular and epididymal functions, leading to hormonal imbalances and abnormal sperm production. These findings raise concerns about the impact of commonly used plastics on male reproductive development, highlighting potential risks for future generations.},

Image sequences are recorded by the state-of-the-art plasmonic microscopy during single nanoparticle collision onto the sensor surface. Deep-SM can enhance signal detection and suppresses noise by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations of the unique signal and noise characteristics in plasmonic microscopy image sequences. Deep-SM can provide significant scattering signal enhancement and noise reduction in dynamic imaging of biological nanoparticles as small as 10 nm, as well as the collision detection of metallic nanoparticle electrochemistry and quantum coupling with plasmonic microscopy.

  abstract     = {The primary cilia serve as pivotal mediators of environmental signals and play crucial roles in neuronal responses. Disruption of ciliary function has been implicated in neuronal circuit disorders and aberrant neuronal excitability. However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. To study the link between the primary cilia and neuronal excitability, manipulation of somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is investigated, as an example of how alterations in ciliary signaling may affect neuronal activity. It is found that aberrant SSTR3 expression perturbed not only ciliary morphology but also disrupted ciliary signaling cascades. Genetic deletion of SSTR3 resulted in perturbed spatial memory and synaptic plasticity. The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region in the axon where action potentials are initiated. Interestingly, loss of ciliary SSTR3 led to decrease of Akt-dependent cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription at the AIS, specifically downregulating AIS master organizer adaptor protein ankyrin G (AnkG) expression. In addition, alterations of other ciliary proteins serotonin 6 receptor (5-HT6R)and intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) also induced length changes of the AIS. The findings elucidate a specific interaction between the primary cilia and AIS, providing insight into the impact of the primary cilia on neuronal excitability and circuit integrity.},

However, the current nanocarrier-based delivery strategies focus on conventional PSs, neglecting the critical issue of PS phototoxicity. In this study, DHUOCl-25, an activatable PS (aPS) activated by hypochlorous acid, is synthesized by combining a silicon source structure and an activation unit. DHUOCl-25 functions as a silica source for synthesizing activatable mesoporous silica nanostrctures (MSNs) using a standardized protocol, enabling the synthesis of aPS-covalently modified MSNs for a variety of biologic therapeutic applications. On one hand, the resulting nano-aPS maintains aPS functionality for antibacterial application by achieving synergistic antibacterial action via MB PDT and retained cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (antibacterial agent) (DHU–MSNs-2). On the other hand, the nano-aPS exhibits MSN properties for drug loading, facilitating the synergistic integration of photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy (DHU–MSNs-6) of tumors and demonstrating efficacy against the spinal metastases of lung cancer. These results validate this strategy for developing novel aPSs and expanding the application of aPSs and MSNs.},

  abstract     = {Excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is theorized as a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, with ample research focusing on elucidating its cellular manifestations. However, few studies investigate E/I imbalance at the macroscale, whole-brain level, and its microcircuit-level mechanisms and clinical significance remain incompletely understood. Here, the Hurst exponent, an index of the E/I ratio, is computed from resting-state fMRI time series, and microcircuit parameters are simulated using biophysical models. A broad decrease in the Hurst exponent is observed in pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), suggesting more excitable network dynamics. Connectome decoders point to temporolimbic and frontocentral cortices as plausible network epicenters of E/I imbalance. Furthermore, computational simulations reveal that enhancing cortical excitability in TLE reflects atypical increases in recurrent connection strength of local neuronal ensembles. Mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses show stronger E/I ratio elevation in patients with longer disease duration, more frequent electroclinical seizures as well as interictal epileptic spikes, and worse cognitive functioning. Hurst exponent-informed classifiers discriminate patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (72.4% [57.5%–82.5%]). Replicated in an independent dataset, this work provides in vivo evidence of a macroscale shift in E/I balance in TLE patients and points to progressive functional imbalances that relate to cognitive decline.},

  abstract     = {Despite an extensive body of literature on trust in technology, designing trustworthy AI systems for high-stakes decision domains remains a significant challenge. Widely used system design guidelines and tools are rarely attuned to domain-specific trustworthiness principles. In this study, we introduce a design framework to address this gap within intelligence analytic tasks, called the Principles-based Approach for Designing Trustworthy, Human-centered AI using the MAST Methodology (PADTHAI-MM). PADTHAI-MM builds on the Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST), an AI decision support system evaluation tool designed in accordance to the U.S. Intelligence Community&#39;s standards for system trustworthiness. We demonstrate PADTHAI-MM in our development of the Reporting Assistant for Defense and Intelligence Tasks (READIT), a research platform that leverages data visualizations and natural language processing-based text analysis to emulate AI-enabled intelligence reporting aids. To empirically assess the efficacy of PADTHAI-MM, we developed two versions of READIT for comparison: a “High-MAST” version, which incorporates AI contextual information and explanations, and a “Low-MAST” version, designed to be akin to inscrutable “black box” AI systems. Through an iterative design process guided by stakeholder feedback, our multidisciplinary design team developed prototypes that were evaluated by experienced intelligence analysts. Results substantially supported the viability of PADTHAI-MM in designing for system trustworthiness in this task domain. We also explored the relationship between analysts&#39; MAST ratings and three theoretical categories of information known to impact trust: process , purpose , and performance . Overall, our study supports the practical and theoretical viability of PADTHAI-MM as an approach to designing trustable AI systems.},

Addressing the aspirational goal of creating service robots requires improving how they are created. Today&#39;s mainstream AIs are not created by agents learning from experiences doing tasks in real-world contexts and interacting with people. Today&#39;s robots do not learn by sensing, acting, doing experiments, and collaborating. Future robots will need to learn from such experiences in order to be ready for robust deployment in human service applications. This paper investigates what aspirational future autonomous human-compatible service robots will need to know. It recommends developing experiential (robotic) foundation models (FMs) for bootstrapping them.},

However, real-world data frequently exist in non-IID graph structures that capture connections among individual units. To effectively mitigate bias in AI systems, it is essential to bridge the gap between traditional fairness literature, designed for IID data, and the prevalence of non-IID graph data. This survey reviews recent advancements in fairness amidst non-IID graph data, including the newly introduced fair graph generation and the commonly studied fair graph classification. In addition, available datasets and evaluation metrics for future research are identified, the limitations of existing work are highlighted, and promising future directions are proposed.},

  abstract     = {The brute-force scaleup of training datasets, learnable parameters and computation power, has become a prevalent strategy for developing more robust learning models. However, due to bottlenecks in data, computation, and trust, the sustainability of this strategy is a serious concern. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue in a parsimonious manner (i.e., achieving greater potential with simpler models). The key is to drive models using domain-specific knowledge, such as symbols, logic, and formulas, instead of purely relying on scaleup. This approach allows us to build a framework that uses this knowledge as “building blocks” to achieve parsimony in model design, training, and interpretation. Empirical results show that our methods surpass those that typically follow the scaling law. We also demonstrate our framework in AI for science, specifically in the problem of drug-drug interaction prediction. We hope our research can foster more diverse technical roadmaps in the era of foundation models.},

In this article, we provide the first comprehensive survey of security and privacy issues associated with machine unlearning by providing a systematic classification across different levels and criteria. Specifically, we begin by investigating unlearning-based security attacks, where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in the unlearning process to compromise the security of machine learning (ML) models. We then conduct a thorough examination of privacy risks associated with the adoption of machine unlearning. Additionally, we explore existing countermeasures and mitigation strategies designed to protect models from malicious unlearning-based attacks targeting both security and privacy. Further, we provide a detailed comparison between machine unlearning-based security and privacy attacks and traditional malicious attacks.

Our quantitative analysis using True/False questions reveals that these chatbots can be relied on to give the right answers to these close-ended questions. However, the qualitative insights, gathered from domain experts, shows that there are still concerns regarding privacy, ethical implications, and the necessity for chatbots to direct users to professional services. We conclude that while these chatbots hold significant promise, their deployment in sensitive areas necessitates careful consideration, ethical oversight, and rigorous refinement to ensure they serve as a beneficial augmentation to human expertise rather than an autonomous solution.

Incorporating wearable technology with sweat rate sensors allows individuals to conveniently monitor their health, optimize workouts, and enhance occupational safety. However, challenges persist in such integration techniques, including intricate manufacturing, nonlinear responses to changes in sweat rates, and errors from the intermediate measurement of the distance sweat travels in the sensor. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive wearable platform that includes a fully printed, flexible sensor patch, readout electronics, and a mobile app for continuous, real-time monitoring of sweat rate. We fabricate a sensor patch with an area of 700 mm 2 and a weight of 380 mg by utilizing direct 3D printing and scalable microfluidic fabrication. The microfluidic channels are 850 μm wide and 164 μm thick, with serpentine electrodes measuring sweat rate using capacitance. The custom readout electronics capture these changes in capacitance to accurately measure sweat rate, achieving a sensitivity of 0.01 μL min −1 . The sensor&#39;s performance is validated against analytical models, simulations, and on-body trials with commercial sensors. This cost-effective, flexible, and fully integrated sweat-sensing solution has significant potential in precision health.},

In this work, we develop a wristband that integrates an array of 10 skin-conformal strain sensors based on laser-induced graphene, which is optimized for continuous measurement of skin strain. The device is characterized to identify several hand gestures and tasks while simultaneously using an optical camera-based hand-tracking system to estimate the joint locations for ground truth generation. Machine learning models are developed to predict gestures as well as specific hand joint angles with high accuracy of &gt;90% and &gt;95%, respectively. The findings show that the sensors placed closer to actuation-specific anatomical features contribute more toward the high accuracy. The sensor array is also integrated with a wearable readout system that wirelessly transmits the data in real time in order to control a robotic arm as a proof of concept for human–robot interaction applications. The developed skin-conformal device is expected to find wide applications in rehabilitation, sports sciences, and human–computer interaction, paving the way for low-profile prosthetic and orthotic control systems.},

In this manner, it is important to systematically investigate the specific requirements of memristor characteristics associated with the capability to emulate plenty of synaptic weight elements linked between constituent layers in neural networks. Here, the learning capabilities of analog conductance state of memristor device for the perceptron of unstructured complex dataset in multilayer neural network are analyzed in terms of the number of analog state, nonlinearity, and conductance error. It is found that the requirable number of analog state is analyzed in about ≈50 states and conductance deviation of each analog state is until ≈5% of original value with nonlinearity of ≈0.142 according to constant programming pulse scheme. With the memristor characteristics enough to mimic synaptic weight to be learnt and infer the Fashion-mnist dataset, the classification accuracy is satisfied as ≈84.36% with the loss of ≈16.8% to original level. Owing to this investigation, applicability of novel memristor device could be conveniently examined for the utilization as synaptic weight in multilayer neural networks.},

The CNT-PDMS nanocomposite sensors, with different sensitivities, are obtained by varying the amount of CNTs. The input stimuli are transformed into higher-dimensional information, enabling a new path for the CNT-PDMS nanocomposite application, which is implemented on a robotic hand as an in-sensor computing device by applying a reservoir computing paradigm. The nonlinear output data obtained from the sensors are trained using linear regression and used to classify nine different objects used in everyday life with an object recognition accuracy of &gt;80% for each object.

  abstract     = {Controlling soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is complex due to their ubiquitous deformation, prompting the use of reduced model-based controllers to provide sufficient state information for high dynamic response control performance. However, most modeling techniques face computational efficiency and complexity of parameter identification issues. To alleviate this, a paradigm coupling an analytical modeling approach based on pseudo-rigid body modeling and the logarithmic decrement method (PRBM + LDM) for parameter estimation is proposed. Using a soft robot hand test bed, the PRBM + LDM model for a closed-loop position controller is applied and is compared with a simple proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) static shape control of soft continuum robots using deep visual inverse kinematic models. Furthermore, the PRBM + LDM model-based force controller is compared with simple constant pressure grasping control by pinching tasks on low-weight, small objects—a screwdriver, a potato chip, and a brass coin. The PRBM + LDM-based position controller outperforms the simple PID position controller, and the PRBM + LDM-based force controller achieves a higher success rate than the constant pressure grasping control in the pinching tasks. In conclusion, the PRBM + LDM modeling technique proves to be a convenient and efficient way to model the dynamic behavior of soft actuators closely and can be applied to build high-precision position and force controllers.},

Here, a graphical user interface version of SuperResNET was applied to publicly available direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) data of nucleoporin Nup96 and Nup107 labeled nuclear pores that present a highly organized octagon structure of eight corners. SuperResNET effectively segments nuclear pores and Nup96 corners based on differential proximity threshold analysis from 2D and 3D SMLM datasets. SuperResNET quantitatively analyzes features from segmented nuclear pores, including complete structures with eightfold symmetry, and from segmented corners. SuperResNET modularity analysis of segmented corners from 2D SMLM distinguishes two modules at 10.7 ± 0.1 nm distance, corresponding to two individual Nup96 molecules. SuperResNET is therefore a model-free tool that can reconstruct network architecture and molecular distribution of subcellular structures without the bias of a specified prior model, attaining molecular resolution from dSTORM data.

Developing an accurate and anti-interference control method for photoresponsive LCE actuators remains a significant challenge. Herein, a computer vision-assisted light-driven LCE for accurate control of bending actions of the LCE actuator is proposed. The control system effectively mitigates instability in the bending angle caused by environmental factors such as light, wind, and changes in the surrounding medium. Furthermore, a “lift bridge” for ants moving between two platforms and an oscillator with modulable angular interval and frequency are demonstrated.

This study presents a method for a comprehensive IQA of microscopic images, which solves these issues by employing a set of reference-free metrics that estimate the presence of experimental artifacts. The metrics are jointly validated on a semisynthetic dataset and are tested on experimental images.

However, current neuroimaging techniques face several challenges when it comes to imaging the deep brain. These challenges include limited imaging depth, a narrow field of view, low resolution, and a lack of real-time imaging and stereotactic deployment capabilities. To address these challenges, a patient-mounted neuro optical coherence tomography (neuroOCT) system that combines a lightweight 5 degrees-of-freedom skull-mounted robot (Skullbot) with a neuroendoscope measuring ≈0.6 mm in diameter is introduced. This innovative system enables targeted and minimally invasive neuroimaging with an axial resolution of ≈2.4 μm and a transverse resolution of around 4.5 μm. The Skullbot can be securely attached to the head and precisely deploys the neuroendoscope with an accuracy of ±1.5 mm in the transverse direction and ±0.25 mm in the longitudinal direction. This allows for motion-insensitive stereotactic imaging within the brain. By utilizing the neuroOCT system, targeted imaging of a tumor in a brain phantom is successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, the system&#39;s capability for in vivo micro-resolution volumetric neuroimaging of fine structures within a mouse brain is validated.},

Without demanding the expensive cost of fabrication devices, bubbles with various sizes are easy to generate in situ, which is enabled by bubble-endowed interface interactions. It is demonstrated that bubbles acting as micro end-effectors rapidly and adaptively realize dexterous manipulation of microobjects such as biological organisms and droplets. They can function as microgrippers to grasp microobjects based on interface interaction-induced adhesion and act as soft micromanipulators to safely manipulate fragile objects. Moreover, the bubble micro end-effector can sense and perceive the designated objects for contact measurement of microforces or surface textures at a microscopic scale via the shape changes of their ultrasoft structures. The reported method successfully integrates grasping, manipulation, and measurement functions in liquid using a single microbubble of less than 1 mm 3 volume.

However, most of the existing methods are single-modal movement recognition, which has inherent limitations, such as limited feature representation and instability to noise, which will affect its practical performance. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel fusion approach that can integrate two biological signals, including electromyography (EMG) and bioelectrical impedance (BI). The fusion method combines EMG for capturing dynamic movement features and BI for discerning key postures representing discrete points within dynamic movements. In this method, the identification of key postures and their temporal sequences provide a guiding framework for the selection and weighted correction of probability prediction matrices in EMG-based dynamic recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the method, six dynamic upper limb movements and nine key postures are defined, and a Universal Robot that can follow movements is employed for experimental validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of the dynamic movement reaches 96.2%, representing an improvement of nearly 10% compared with single-modal signal. This study illustrates the potential of multimodal fusion of EMG and BI in movement recognition, with broad prospects for application in HMI fields.},

Their functionalities span from cell sorting to microscale fiber assembly through periodic acoustic pressure fields. Conventional methods usually require parallel acoustic emitters and reflective surfaces, producing constrained standing wave patterns. In this paper, an effective approach for creating versatile acoustic standing wave fields using an acoustic metasurface deflector and retroreflector is introduced. The deflector manipulates the direction of incoming acoustic waves coupled with the retroreflector to reflect these waves back to the source. The proposed design allows the creation of standing waves that are not constrained by the relative angles of the two surfaces involved and allows for customizable wave patterns beyond the standard limits with enhanced adaptability. The system&#39;s effectiveness is evaluated through computational simulations using finite element analysis and experimental validation based on a 3D-printed prototype. Results suggest that versatile standing waves between arbitrarily oriented surfaces can be produced through the careful design of the metasurface deflector and retroreflector. This approach can improve the performance of standing wave applications in particle manipulation, thus broadening the range of practical implementations for ultrasound and acoustofluidic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic fields are widely utilized for remote control of magnetic objects, with various actuation systems developed for manipulating miniature robots in research and biomedical applications. When designing a manipulation system providing a uniform magnetic field, it is also important to consider both the accessibility of the workspace and the integration of imaging tools. This article presents an electromagnetic coil system that manipulates magnetic objects within a 3D space, enhancing the magnetic field in an upward orientation. The system includes eight metal-core coils arranged hemispherically to ensure unimpeded access to the workspace and imaging tools, along with two air-core coils. Easier control and repeatability of the magnetic field are achieved using two joysticks and sequential programming. The versatility of the system is demonstrated by using it to manipulate a magnetic guidewire and to guide micromagnets to various targets. Additionally, using this system, oscillating magnetic fields effectively control swarms of magnetic nanoparticles, enabling operations such as dispersion, assembly, and ribbon-like shape formation. Furthermore, the manipulation of cell-based microrobots (cell-bots) showcases the system&#39;s capability to handle single and multiple cell-bots, facilitating their collection while preserving cell viability. These experiments underscore the system&#39;s potential for fundamental biomedical research and various applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic soft robots have emerged as promising tools in biomedicine due to their wireless actuation, rapid response, and compatibility with biological systems. Despite the various innovative strategies proposed for their fabrication, they suffer from complex processes and limited cellular compatibility. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore alternative approaches that are fast, mild, and highly tunable. Herein, a novel fabrication strategy for contactless assembly of soft-robots is introduced for the first time. This technology exploits hydrodynamic instabilities at the free surface of a fluid layer, thus enabling the fabrication of centimeter-scale robots featuring diverse structural properties. These features show a wide range of deformation modes in response to magnetic fields, including folding, bending, and expanding. Furthermore, the design and assembly of novel actuators with customized shapes as fish- and butterfly-like structures is shown. The fabricated patterns exhibit different modes of motion under the influence of uniform magnetic fields. As a proof of concept, an innovative application of this technology combined with the proposed soft robots is represented by the enhanced release of extracellular vesicles.  Altogether, this novel fabrication method along with the newly developed magnetic soft robots enables the manufacturing of high-performance, multifunctional, and cytocompatible intelligent systems.},

  abstract     = {Mecanum-wheeled autonomous electric vehicles are preferred to use in industrial applications to carry loads. To be able to reach a maximum travel distance in one turn of work with a full battery charge, the vehicle should follow the reference route with minimum tracking errors. One of the reasons which prevents a good path tracking is the slippage because slippage causes tracking errors in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Herein, a modeling structure for a mecanum-wheeled autonomous electric vehicle used for the heavy duties in iron–steel industry is proposed by taking the slippage information into account. The objective is to reach more travel distance and reduce the energy loss of the battery which causes to carry load less than planned. The modeling structure proposed is adapted and tested for an autonomous path tracking task in a galvanization line of an iron–steel industry. Five tons of zinc ingots are carried from the storage area to the melting pot using an autonomous electric vehicle in a predefined reference route. More than 5 km autonomous drive is performed and the experiments show that slippage causes an energy loss of 6.1786%, which means battery allows 6.1786% less distance than planned travel.},

Herein, a self-sensing artificial muscle (SSAM), which can sense its own length regardless of the external loadings and driving pressures, is proposed. Empowered by a seamlessly integrated mutual-inductance-based length sensor (MILS), the SSAM can sense its length change as small as 0.01 mm (0.012% of the initial liength 80 mm) in a wide range. The working principle of the MILS is analyzed theoretically to provide a design guideline. An SSAM-based earthworm-like locomotion robot is developed with the capability of knowing its real-time body length change at different gaits. An artificial arm driven by one SSAM is also developed and demonstrated with humanlike capabilities of loading perception, interactive and responsive movements, and accurate positioning.

To achieve this goal, the upcoming generation of head-mounted displays (HMDs) necessitates a seamless transition between different XR modes, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) modes. Herein, an innovative cholesteric liquid crystal- (CLC-) based optical combiner for HMDs is introduced. This approach enables the display device to switch between AR, VR, and transparent modes via temperature modulation. Since CLC materials demonstrate varying optical properties at different temperatures, a real-time temperature monitoring system that is paired with an external controller is integrated. This allows for dynamic temperature adjustments of the optical combiner and enables smooth transitions between display modes. Furthermore, the Berreman 4 × 4 matrix method is used to simulate the optical properties of the optical combiner, finding strong agreement with the experimental results. The performance of the tunable optical combiners using 450, 532, and 635 nm laser sources is explored. The findings demonstrate that CLC-based optical combiners can effectively switch between the three distinct modes at corresponding temperatures, paving the way for versatile applications in future HMDs.},

Furthermore, the contributions of each step are demonstrated through ablation experiments and the proposed method is tested in the occlusion scenarios.

In this study, we introduce the methodological framework of a new procedure for performing power analysis when PLS-based methods are used. Data are simulated by the Monte Carlo method, assuming the null hypothesis of no effect is false and exploiting the latent structure estimated by PLS in the pilot data. In this way, the complex correlation data structure is explicitly considered in power analysis and sample size estimation.

Determining if a measure is suitable to use as a surrogate endpoint is a challenging task and a variety of meta-analysis models have been proposed for this purpose. The Daniels and Hughes bivariate model for trial-level surrogate endpoint evaluation is gaining traction but presents difficulties for frequentist estimation and hitherto only Bayesian solutions have been available. This is because the marginal model is not a conventional linear model and the number of unknown parameters increases at the same rate as the number of studies. This second property raises immediate concerns that the maximum likelihood estimator of the model&#39;s unknown variance component may be downwardly biased. We derive maximum likelihood estimating equations to motivate a bias adjusted estimator of this parameter. The bias correction terms in our proposed estimating equation are easily computed and have an intuitively appealing algebraic form. A simulation study is performed to illustrate how this estimator overcomes the difficulties associated with maximum likelihood estimation.

Several methods to determine sample size based on the RMST-based tests have been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no discussion about the power and sample size regarding the augmented version of RMST-based tests, which utilize baseline covariates for a gain in estimation efficiency and in power for testing no treatment effect. The conventional event-driven study design based on the logrank test allows us to calculate the power for a given hazard ratio without specifying the survival functions. In contrast, the existing sample size determination methods for the RMST-based tests relies on the adequacy of the assumptions of the entire survival curves of two groups. Furthermore, to handle the augmented test, the correlation between the baseline covariates and the martingale residuals must be handled. To address these issues, we propose an approximated sample size formula for the augmented version of the RMST-based test, which does not require specifying the entire survival curve in the treatment group, and also a sample size recalculation approach to update the correlations between the baseline covariates and the martingale residuals with the blinded data. The proposed procedure will enable the studies to have the target power for a given RMST difference even when correct survival functions cannot be specified at the design stage.},

In contrast to the most commonly applied two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), in an N-of-1 design, the individual acts as their own control condition in the sense of a multiple crossover trial. N-of-1 trials can lead to a higher quality of patient by examining the effectiveness of an intervention at an individual level. Moreover, when a series of N-of-1 trials are properly aggregated, it becomes possible to detect an intervention effect at a population level. This work investigates whether a meta-analysis of summary data of a series of N-of-1 trials allows us to detect a statistically significant intervention effect with fewer participants than in a traditional, prospectively powered two-arm RCT and crossover design when evaluating a digital health intervention in cardiovascular care. After introducing these different analysis approaches, we compared the empirical properties in a simulation study both under the null hypothesis and with respect to power with different between-subject heterogeneity settings and in the presence of a carry-over effect. We further investigate the performance of a sequential aggregation procedure. In terms of simulated power, the threshold of 80% was achieved earlier for the aggregating procedure, requiring fewer participants.},

Particularly in the presence of comorbidities or pharmacological treatments, sudden crises can cause potassium to undergo very abrupt yet transient changes. In the context of the monitoring of potassium, there is a need for a dynamic model that can be used in clinical practice to assess the risk of death related to an observed patient&#39;s potassium trajectory. We considered different landmark survival approaches, starting from the simple approach considering the most recent measurement. We then propose a novel method based on wavelet filtering and landmarking to retrieve the prognostic role of past short-term potassium shifts. We argue that while taking into account the smooth changes in the biomarker, short-term changes cannot be overlooked. State-of-the-art dynamic survival models are prone to give more importance to the smooth component of the potassium profiles. However, our findings suggest that it is essential to also take into account recent potassium instability to capture all the relevant prognostic information. The data used comes from over 2000 subjects, with a total of over 80,000 repeated potassium measurements collected through administrative health records. The proposed wavelet landmark method revealed the prognostic role of past short-term changes in potassium.

Such an issue arises when multiple annotators are tasked to manually label the same training samples, potentially giving rise to discrepancies in class assignments among the supplied labels with respect to the ground truth. Commonly, the labeling process is entrusted to a small group of domain experts, and different level of experience and subjectivity may result in noisy training labels. To solve the classification task leveraging on the availability of multiple data annotators, we introduce a novel ensemble methodology constructed combining model-based classifiers separately trained on single sets of noisy labels. Eigenvalue Decomposition Discriminant Analysis is employed for the definition of the base learners, and six distinct averaging strategies are proposed to combine them. Two solutions necessitate a priori information, such as the partial knowledge of the ground truth labels or the annotators&#39; level of expertise. Differently, the remaining four approaches are entirely data-driven. A simulation study and an application on real data showcase the improved predictive performance of our proposal, while also demonstrating the ability of automatically inferring annotators&#39; expertise level as a by-product of the learning process.},

Extending an existing survivor average causal effect (SACE) estimand, we frame the evaluation of treatment effects in the context of semicompeting risks with principal stratification and introduce two new causal estimands: the time-varying survivor average causal effect (TV-SACE) and the restricted mean survivor average causal effect (RM-SACE). These principal causal effects are defined among units that would survive regardless of assigned treatment. We adopt a Bayesian estimation procedure that parameterizes illness-death models for both treatment arms. We outline a frailty specification that can accommodate within-person correlation between nonterminal and terminal event times, and we discuss potential avenues for adding model flexibility.

  abstract     = {Mass spectrometry imaging techniques measure molecular abundance in a tissue sample at a cellular resolution, all while preserving the spatial structure of the tissue. This kind of technology offers a detailed understanding of the role of several molecular factors in biological systems. For this reason, the development of fast and efficient computational methods that can extract relevant signals from massive experiments has become necessary. A key goal in mass spectrometry data analysis is the identification of molecules with similar functions in the analyzed biological system. This result can be achieved by studying the spatial distribution of the molecules&#39; abundance patterns. To do so, one can perform coclustering, that is, dividing the molecules into groups according to their expression patterns over the tissue and segmenting the tissue according to the molecules&#39; abundance levels. We present TRIFASE, a semi-nonnegative matrix trifactorization technique that performs coclustering while accounting for the spatial correlation of the data. We propose an estimation algorithm that solves the proposed matrix trifactorization problem. Moreover, to improve scalability, we also propose two heuristic approximations of the most expensive steps, which help the algorithm converge while significantly streamlining the computational cost. We validated our method on a series of simulation experiments, comparing the different estimating strategies discussed in the article. Last, we analyzed a mouse brain tissue sample processed with MALDI-MSI technology, showing how TRIFASE extracts specific expression patterns of molecule abundance in localized tissue areas and discovers blocks of proteins whose activation is directly linked to specific biological mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Borrowing external controls to augment the concurrent control arm is a popular topic in clinical trials. Bayesian dynamic borrowing methods adaptively discount external controls according to prior-data conflict. For the Gaussian endpoint, parameter-specific information borrowing enables differential discounting between the population mean and variance. The borrowing-by-part power prior employs two power parameters to separately downweight external likelihoods concerning the sample mean and variance. However, within the fully Bayesian framework, the posterior inference of the average treatment effect (ATE) defined as the population mean difference is significantly affected by the variance-specific prior-data conflict that reflects the heterogeneity of population variance. Here, we propose the modified conditional borrowing-by-part power prior (MCBPP) that separately discounts the external sample mean and variance according to parameter-specific prior-data conflicts, resulting in a more stable posterior estimation of ATE than its competitors under the same degree of mean-specific prior-data conflict. By fully discounting the external sample variance, the robust MCBPP (rMCBPP) can yield robust posterior inference of ATE against the variance-specific prior-data conflict. Although the population variance is considered a nuisance parameter, its homogeneity is equally important to justify information borrowing. We recommend the rMCBPP for borrowing external controls with a similar sample variance to concurrent controls because it exhibits better control of bias and Type I error rate than the modified power prior (MPP) assuming unknown variance in the absence of population variance heterogeneity. However, when faced with a significant sample variance discrepancy, the MPP assuming unknown variance is preferred given its better performance under severe population variance heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {The mean residual life (MRL) function plays an important role in the summary and analysis of survival data. The main advantage of this function is that it summarizes the information in units of time instead of a probability scale, which requires careful interpretation. Ranked set sampling (RSS) is a sampling technique designed for situations, where obtaining precise measurements of sample units is expensive or difficult, but ranking them without referring to their accurate values is cost-effective or easy. However, the practical application of RSS is hindered because each sample unit is required to assign a unique rank. To alleviate this difficulty, Frey developed a novel variation of RSS, called RSS-t, that records and utilizes the tie structure in the ranking process. In this paper, we propose several different nonparametric estimators for the MRL function based on RSS-t. Then, we compare the proposed estimators with their counterparts in simple random sampling (SRS) and RSS, where tie information is not utilized. We also implemented our proposed estimators on a real data set related to patient waiting times for liver transplantation, to show their applicability and efficiency in practice. Our results show that using ties information leads to an improved statistical inference for the MRL function, and therefore a smaller sample size is needed to reach a predetermined precision.},

  abstract     = {Extracting typical operational scenarios is essential for making flexible decisions in the dispatch of a new power system. A novel deep time series aggregation scheme (DTSAs) is proposed to generate typical operational scenarios, considering the large amount of historical operational snapshot data. Specifically, DTSAs analyse the intrinsic mechanisms of different scheduling operational scenario switching to mathematically represent typical operational scenarios. A Gramian angular summation field-based operational scenario image encoder was designed to convert operational scenario sequences into high-dimensional spaces. This enables DTSAs to fully capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of new power systems using deep feature iterative aggregation models. The encoder also facilitates the generation of typical operational scenarios that conform to historical data distributions while ensuring the integrity of grid operational snapshots. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method extracted new fine-grained power system dispatch schemes and outperformed the latest high-dimensional feature-screening methods. In addition, experiments with different new energy access ratios were conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed method. DTSAs enable dispatchers to master the operation experience of the power system in advance, and actively respond to the dynamic changes of the operation scenarios under the high access rate of new energy.},

Initially, data augmentation mainly involved some simple transformations of images. Later, in order to increase the diversity and complexity of data, more advanced methods appeared and evolved to sophisticated generative models. However, these methods required a mass of computation of training or searching. In this paper, a novel training-free method that utilises the Pre-Trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) model as a data augmentation tool (PTSAM-DA) is proposed to generate the augmented annotations for images. Without the need for training, it obtains prompt boxes from the original annotations and then feeds the boxes to the pre-trained SAM to generate diverse and improved annotations. In this way, annotations are augmented more ingenious than simple manipulations without incurring huge computation for training a data augmentation model. Multiple comparative experiments on three datasets are conducted, including an in-house dataset, ADE20K and COCO2017. On this in-house dataset, namely Agricultural Plot Segmentation Dataset, maximum improvements of 3.77% and 8.92% are gained in two mainstream metrics, mIoU and mAcc, respectively. Consequently, large vision models like SAM are proven to be promising not only in image segmentation but also in data augmentation.},

It is challenging due to the small size of objects, low contrast, touching boundaries, and complex structure of nuclei. Their segmentation and counting play an important role in cancer identification and its grading. In this study, WaveSeg-UNet, a lightweight model, is introduced to segment cancerous nuclei having touching boundaries. Residual blocks are used for feature extraction. Only one feature extractor block is used in each level of the encoder and decoder. Normally, images degrade quality and lose important information during down-sampling. To overcome this loss, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) alongside max-pooling is used in the down-sampling process. Inverse DWT is used to regenerate original images during up-sampling. In the bottleneck of the proposed model, atrous spatial channel pyramid pooling (ASCPP) is used to extract effective high-level features. The ASCPP is the modified pyramid pooling having atrous layers to increase the area of the receptive field. Spatial and channel-based attention are used to focus on the location and class of the identified objects. Finally, watershed transform is used as a post processing technique to identify and refine touching boundaries of nuclei. Nuclei are identified and counted to facilitate pathologists. The same domain of transfer learning is used to retrain the model for domain adaptability. Results of the proposed model are compared with state-of-the-art models, and it outperformed the existing studies.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz imaging technology has great potential applications in areas, such as remote sensing, navigation, security checks, and so on. However, terahertz images usually have the problems of heavy noises and low resolution. Previous terahertz image denoising methods are mainly based on traditional image processing methods, which have limited denoising effects on the terahertz noise. Existing deep learning-based image denoising methods are mostly used in natural images and easily cause a large amount of detail loss when denoising terahertz images. Here, a residual-learning-based multiscale hybrid-convolution residual network (MHRNet) is proposed for terahertz image denoising, which can remove noises while preserving detail features in terahertz images. Specifically, a multiscale hybrid-convolution residual block (MHRB) is designed to extract rich detail features and local prediction residual noise from terahertz images. Specifically, MHRB is a residual structure composed of a multiscale dilated convolution block, a bottleneck layer, and a multiscale convolution block. MHRNet uses the MHRB and global residual learning to achieve terahertz image denoising. Ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of MHRB. A series of experiments are conducted on the public terahertz image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MHRNet has an excellent denoising effect on synthetic and real noisy terahertz images. Compared with existing methods, MHRNet achieves comprehensive competitive results.},

At present, the model-based offline policy evaluation (MBOPE) is widely welcomed because of its easy to implement and good performance. MBOPE directly approximates the unknown value of a given policy using the Monte Carlo method given the estimated transition and reward functions of the environment. Usually, multiple models are trained, and then one of them is selected to be used. However, a challenge remains in selecting an appropriate model from those trained for further use. The authors first analyse the upper bound of the difference between the approximated value and the unknown true value. Theoretical results show that this difference is related to the trajectories generated by the given policy on the learnt model and the prediction error of the transition and reward functions at these generated data points. Based on the theoretical results, a new criterion is proposed to tell which trained model is better suited for evaluating the given policy. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed criterion is demonstrated on both benchmark and synthetic offline datasets.},

Medical imaging still faces a number of difficulties, including intra-class similarity, a scarcity of training data, and poor contrast skin lesions, notably in the case of skin cancer. An optimisation-aided deep learning-based system is proposed for accurate multi-class skin lesion identification. The sequential procedures of the proposed system start with preprocessing and end with categorisation. The preprocessing step is where a hybrid contrast enhancement technique is initially proposed for lesion identification with healthy regions. Instead of flipping and rotating data, the outputs from the middle phases of the hybrid enhanced technique are employed for data augmentation in the next step. Next, two pre-trained deep learning models, MobileNetV2 and NasNet Mobile, are trained using deep transfer learning on the upgraded enriched dataset. Later, a dual-threshold serial approach is employed to obtain and combine the features of both models. The next step was the variance-controlled Marine Predator methodology, which the authors proposed as a superior optimisation method. The top features from the fused feature vector are classified using machine learning classifiers. The experimental strategy provided enhanced accuracy of 94.4% using the publicly available dataset HAM10000. Additionally, the proposed framework is evaluated compared to current approaches, with remarkable results.},

The fusion of visible and near-infrared (NIR) aims to enhance the quality of images acquired by video monitoring systems for the ease of user observation and data processing. Unfortunately, current fusion algorithms produce artefacts and colour distortion since they cannot make use of spectrum properties and are lacking in information complementarity. Therefore, an information complementarity fusion (ICF) model is designed based on physical signals. In order to separate high-frequency noise from important information in distinct frequency layers, the authors first extracted texture-scale and edge-scale layers using a two-scale filter. Second, the difference map between visible and near-infrared was filtered using the extended-DoG filter to produce the initial visible-NIR complementary weight map. Then, to generate a guide map, the near-infrared image with night adjustment was processed as well. The final complementarity weight map was subsequently derived via an arctanI function mapping using the guide map and the initial weight maps. Finally, fusion images were generated with the complementarity weight maps. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in both avoiding artificial colours as well as effectively utilising information complementarity.},

Optimised datasets were utilised to develop an artificial neural networks (ANN) model for the prediction of optimum values of cut points. The ANN model was then used to replace the hybrid framework of the Taguchi method and the GA. The integration of the ANN and FP model makes it a grey-box (GB) model. For the case of Zamama crude, the GB model helped in the decrease of up to 38.93% in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and an 8.2% increase in diesel production compared to the stand-alone FP model under uncertainty. Similarly, for Kunnar crude, up to 18.87% decrease in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and a 33.96% increase in diesel production was observed in comparison to the stand-alone FP model.},

  abstract     = {Bilingual lexicon induction focuses on learning word translation pairs, also known as bitexts, from monolingual corpora by establishing a mapping between the source and target embedding spaces. Despite recent advancements, bilingual lexicon induction is limited to inducing bitexts consisting of individual words, lacking the ability to handle semantics-rich phrases. To bridge this gap and support downstream cross-lingual tasks, it is practical to develop a method for bilingual phrase induction that extracts bilingual phrase pairs from monolingual corpora without relying on cross-lingual knowledge. In this paper, the authors propose a novel phrase embedding training method based on the skip-gram structure. Specifically, a local hard negative sampling strategy that utilises negative samples of central tokens in sliding windows to enhance phrase embedding learning is introduced. The proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with exceptional results recorded for distant languages. Additionally, we develop a phrase representation learning method that leverages multilingual pre-trained language models. These mPLMs-based representations can be combined with the above-mentioned static phrase embeddings to further improve the accuracy of the bilingual phrase induction task. We manually construct a dataset of bilingual phrase pairs and integrate it with MUSE to facilitate the bilingual phrase induction task.},

The graph of welding spots distribution is encoded using the graph attention network. Independent policy networks with attention mechanism as a decoder can handle the encoded graph and decide to assign robots to different tasks. The policy network is used to convert the large scale welding spots allocation problem to multiple small scale single-robot welding path planning problems, and the path planning problem is quickly solved through existing methods. Then, the model is trained through reinforcement learning. In addition, the task balancing method is used to allocate tasks to multiple stations. The proposed algorithm is compared with classical algorithms, and the results show that the algorithm based on DRL can produce higher quality solutions.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently executing inference tasks of deep neural networks on devices with limited resources poses a significant load in IoT systems. To alleviate the load, one innovative method is branching that adds extra layers with classification exits to a pre-trained model, enabling inputs with high-confidence predictions to exit early, thus reducing inference cost. However, branching networks, not originally tailored for IoT environments, are susceptible to noisy and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and they demand additional training for optimal performance. The authors introduce BrevisNet, a novel branching methodology designed for creating on-device branching models that are both resource-adaptive and noise-robust for IoT applications. The method leverages the refined uncertainty estimation capabilities of Dirichlet distributions for classification predictions, combined with the superior OOD detection of energy-based models. The authors propose a unique training approach and thresholding technique that enhances the precision of branch predictions, offering robustness against noise and OOD inputs. The findings demonstrate that BrevisNet surpasses existing branching techniques in training efficiency, accuracy, overall performance, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent sorting is an important prerequisite for the full quantitative consumption and harmless disposal of kitchen waste. The existing object detection method based on an ImageNet pre-trained model is an effective way of sorting. Owing to significant domain gaps between natural images and kitchen waste images, it is difficult to reflect the characteristics of diverse scales and dense distribution in kitchen waste based on an ImageNet pre-trained model, leading to poor generalisation. In this article, the authors propose the first pre-trained model for kitchen waste sorting called KitWaSor, which combines both contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modelling (MIM) through self-supervised learning (SSL). First, to address the issue of diverse scales, the authors propose a mixed masking strategy by introducing an incomplete masking branch based on the original random masking branch. It prevents the complete loss of small-scale objects while avoiding excessive leakage of large-scale object pixels. Second, to address the issue of dense distribution, the authors introduce semantic consistency constraints on the basis of the mixed masking strategy. That is, object semantic reasoning is performed through semantic consistency constraints to compensate for the lack of contextual information. To train KitWaSor, the authors construct the first million-level kitchen waste dataset across seasonal and regional distributions, named KWD-Million. Extensive experiments show that KitWaSor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the two most relevant downstream tasks for kitchen waste sorting (i.e. image classification and object detection), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed KitWaSor.},

  abstract     = {Images obtained from hyperspectral sensors provide information about the target area that extends beyond the visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to sensor limitations and imperfections during the image acquisition and transmission phases, noise is introduced into the acquired image, which can have a negative impact on downstream analyses such as classification, target tracking, and spectral unmixing. Noise in hyperspectral images (HSI) is modelled as a combination from several sources, including Gaussian/impulse noise, stripes, and deadlines. An HSI restoration method for such a mixed noise model is proposed. First , a joint optimisation framework is proposed for recovering hyperspectral data corrupted by mixed Gaussian-impulse noise by estimating both the clean data as well as the sparse/impulse noise levels. Second , a hyper-Laplacian prior is used along both the spatial and spectral dimensions to express sparsity in clean image gradients. Third , to model the sparse nature of impulse noise, an ℓ 1 − norm over the impulse noise gradient is used. Because the proposed methodology employs two distinct priors, the authors refer to it as the hyperspectral dual prior (HySpDualP) denoiser. To the best of authors&#39; knowledge, this joint optimisation framework is the first attempt in this direction. To handle the non-smooth and non-convex nature of the general ℓp − norm-based regularisation term, a generalised shrinkage/thresholding (GST) solver is employed. Finally , an efficient split-Bregman approach is used to solve the resulting optimisation problem. Experimental results on synthetic data and real HSI datacube obtained from hyperspectral sensors demonstrate that the authors’ proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both visually and in terms of various image quality assessment metrics.},

  abstract     = {Real-world data always exhibit an imbalanced and long-tailed distribution, which leads to poor performance for neural network-based classification. Existing methods mainly tackle this problem by reweighting the loss function or rebalancing the classifier. However, one crucial aspect overlooked by previous research studies is the imbalanced feature space problem caused by the imbalanced angle distribution. In this paper, the authors shed light on the significance of the angle distribution in achieving a balanced feature space, which is essential for improving model performance under long-tailed distributions. Nevertheless, it is challenging to effectively balance both the classifier norms and angle distribution due to problems such as the low feature norm. To tackle these challenges, the authors first thoroughly analyse the classifier and feature space by decoupling the classification logits into three key components: classifier norm (i.e. the magnitude of the classifier vector), feature norm (i.e. the magnitude of the feature vector), and cosine similarity between the classifier vector and feature vector. In this way, the authors analyse the change of each component in the training process and reveal three critical problems that should be solved, that is, the imbalanced angle distribution, the lack of feature discrimination, and the low feature norm. Drawing from this analysis, the authors propose a novel loss function that incorporates hyperspherical uniformity, additive angular margin, and feature norm regularisation. Each component of the loss function addresses a specific problem and synergistically contributes to achieving a balanced classifier and feature space. The authors conduct extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. The experimental results demonstrate that the authors’ loss function outperforms several previous state-of-the-art methods in addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced and long-tailed datasets, that is, by improving upon the best-performing baselines on CIFAR-100-LT by 1.34, 1.41, 1.41 and 1.33, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI), the detrimental influence of noise and distortions on data quality is profound, which has severely affected the following-on analytics and decision-making such as land mapping. This study presents an innovative framework for assessing HSI band quality and reconstructing the low-quality bands, based on the Prophet model. By introducing a comprehensive quality metric to start, the authors approach factors in both spatial and spectral characteristics across local and global scales. This metric effectively captures the intricate noise and distortions inherent in the HSI data. Subsequently, the authors employ the Prophet model to forecast information within the low-quality bands, leveraging insights from neighbouring high-quality bands. To validate the effectiveness of the authors’ proposed model, extensive experiments on three publicly available uncorrected datasets are conducted. In a head-to-head comparison, the framework against six state-of-the-art band reconstruction algorithms including three spectral methods, two spatial-spectral methods and one deep learning method is benchmarked. The authors’ experiments also delve into strategies for band selection based on quality metrics and the quality evaluation of the reconstructed bands. In addition, the authors assess the classification accuracy utilising these reconstructed bands. In various experiments, the results consistently affirm the efficacy of the authors’ method in HSI quality assessment and band reconstruction. Notably, the authors’ approach obviates the need for manually prefiltering of noisy bands. This comprehensive framework holds promise in addressing HSI data quality concerns whilst enhancing the overall utility of HSI.},

To address this limitation, an enhanced car-following algorithm utilising ADRC is proposed, which integrates the improved ESO with a feedback controller. In comparison to the conventional ESO, the enhanced version effectively utilises multi-order estimation and tracking errors. Specifically, it enhances convergence rates by incorporating feedback from higher-order estimation errors and ensures the estimated value converges to the reference value by utilising tracking error feedback.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the CosineGAN-transformer network (CGTNet), which integrates a dual discriminator GAN for generating high-quality synthetic data with a Transformer-based classification network. Equipped with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, this network excels at capturing the intricate spatiotemporal relationships inherent in high-resolution fNIRS signals. The dual discriminator framework ensures that both the temporal and spatial aspects of the synthetic data closely resemble the original signals, thereby enhancing data diversity and fidelity. Experimental results on a publicly available fNIRS dataset, comprising 30 participants performing motor imagery tasks (right-hand tapping, left-hand tapping, and foot tapping), demonstrate that CGTNet achieves an accuracy of 82.67%, outperforming existing methods. Key contributions of this work include the use of multi-head self-attention for refined feature extraction and a dual discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework that maintains data quality and consistency.

  abstract     = {Rapid and accurate prediction of the sectional velocity field of the channel is of great significance to the design and maintenance of open channels and the improvement of irrigation efficiency. During the water delivery process of Renmin Canal of Dujiangyan irrigation system, the water level of the main canal changes rapidly and in a large range, which is the biggest difficulty in real-time prediction of its velocity field. Therefore, based on machine learning, this paper proposes a new method to construct a real-time velocity field prediction model, which can directly predict the velocity field of the channel according to the water level. According to this method, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology is used to simulate the target open channel, and a machine learning model that can adaptively optimize the characteristics of the velocity field data is designed as the velocity field prediction model, which is experimented in the main canal of Renmin Canal of Dujiangyan irrigation system. The results suggest that the predictions are in line with the general features of flow velocity distribution in open channels and have high precision. Therefore, this method is of high value for engineering application and theoretical research.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a robust dual-integral structure zeroing neural network (ZNN) design framework, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing single-integral enhanced ZNN models in completely suppressing linear noise. Based on this design framework, a complex-type dual-integral structure ZNN (DISZNN) model with inherent linear noise suppression capability is constructed for computing dynamic complex matrix inversion (DCMI) online. The stability, convergence, and robustness of the proposed DISZNN model are ensured via rigorous theoretical analyses. In three distinct experiments involving DCMI (including cases with only imaginary parts, both real and imaginary parts, and high-dimensional scenarios), the state trajectories of the DISZNN model are well and quickly fitted to the dynamic trajectories of the theoretical solutions with very low residual errors in various linear noise environments. More specifically, the residual errors of the DISZNN model for online computation of DCMI under linear noise environments are consistently below the order of , representing one-thousandth of the residual errors in existing noise-tolerant ZNN models. Finally, the DISZNN design framework is applied to construct a controlled chaotic system of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with uncertainties and external disturbances based on real-world modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the three state errors of the controlled PMSM chaotic system converge to zero quickly and stably under various conditions (system parameters, external disturbances, and uncertainties), further highlighting the superiority and generalizability of the DISZNN design framework.},

  abstract     = {Transfer functions have a very important role in metaheuristic optimization-based feature selection algorithms as these functions map the continuous search space into binary space. The U-shaped transfer function (UTF) is one of the transfer functions used to solve the problem of feature selection. However, the UTF requires the selection of parametric values, which can vary for different types of data. To address this issue, an approach to select the parameters of the UTF has been proposed based on a time-varying adaption method, resulting in the modified U-shaped transfer function (MUTF). Furthermore, a methodology has been proposed to enhance feature selection and classification for Parkinson&#39;s disease by utilizing z-score normalization in conjunction with a modified U-shaped transfer function and the binary self-adaptive bald eagle search (MUTF-SABES) optimization algorithm. The z-score normalization has been used to mitigate issues caused by outliers. Also, the performance of the k nearest neighbor classifier is improved by selecting an optimal parameter value using the proposed MUTF-SABES algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on seven different Parkinson&#39;s disease datasets and compared with five state-of-the-art optimization algorithms: Salp Swarm algorithm, Harris Hawks optimization, equilibrium optimizer, aquilla optimizer, and Honey Badger algorithm, to evaluate its performance superiority. The results achieved using the proposed approach have been superior or analogous to the erstwhile algorithms for performance comparability. Friedman&#39;s mean rank test is used to check the statistical significance of the propounded approach. The lowest Friedman&#39;s mean rank value obtained using the proposed approach indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to become an alternative to other well-known strategies.},

In orchards, pedestrians exhibit unpredictable behavior and can pose significant challenges to navigation and operation. This demands reliable detection technologies that ensures safety while addressing the unique challenges of orchard environments, such as dense foliage, uneven terrain, and varying lighting conditions. To address this, we propose ReB-DINO, a robust and accurate orchard pedestrian detection model based on an improved DINO. Initially, we improve the feature extraction module of DINO using structural re-parameterization, enhancing accuracy and speed of the model during training and inference decoupling. In addition, a progressive feature fusion module is employed to fuse the extracted features and improve model accuracy. Finally, the network incorporates a convolutional block attention mechanism and an improved loss function to improve pedestrian detection rates. The experimental results demonstrate a 1.6% improvement in Recall on the NREC dataset compared to the baseline. Moreover, the results show a 4.2% improvement in and the number of parameters decreases by 40.2% compared to the original DINO. In the PiFO dataset, the with a threshold of 0.5 reaches 99.4%, demonstrating high detection accuracy in realistic scenarios. Therefore, our model enhances both detection accuracy and real-time object detection capabilities in apple orchards, maintaining a lightweight attributes, surpassing mainstream object detection models.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of video data has resulted in an increasing need for surveillance and violence detection systems. Although such events occur less frequently than normal activities, developing automated video surveillance systems for violence detection has become essential to minimize labor and time waste. Detecting violent activity in videos is a challenging task due to the variability and diversity of violent behavior, which can involve a wide range of actions, motions, and interactions between people and objects. Currently, researchers employ deep learning models to detect violent behaviors. In fact, a large number of deep learning approaches are based on extracting spatio-temporal information from a video by exploiting a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Despite their success, these techniques require a lot more parameters than 2D CNNs and have high computational complexity. Therefore, we focus on exploiting a 2D CNN to encode spatio-temporal information. Actually, statistical features of the optical flow changes are used to give this ability to a 2D CNN. These features are designed to make attention to regions of a video clip with much more motion. Accordingly, the optical flow of an input video is calculated. To determine meaningful changes in the optical flow, the optical flow magnitude of a current frame is compared with its predecessor. After that, statistical features of these changes are extracted to summarize a video clip to a 2D template, which feeds a 2D CNN. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets observe that the suggested strategy outperforms baseline ones. In particular, we make a better estimation of the spatio-temporal features in a video by shortening a video clip into a 2D template.},

  abstract     = {The early detection and classification of COVID-19 is crucial for disease diagnosis and control. To reduce the need for medical professionals, fast and accurate detection approaches for COVID-19 are required. Due to environmental concerns, the quality of the image gets degraded. Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19. Thus, the performance of the deep learning (DL) techniques is diminished. Therefore, a CT image-based hybrid DL technology is presented in this article for the classification of COVID-19 disease as COVID or non-COVID or pneumonia. Initially, in the pre-processing stage, the hybrid nonlocal moment bilateral filtering (Hybrid NMBF) technique is introduced for image de-noising and re-sizing. After pre-processing, the image is fed into the feature extraction phase. Gray-level covariance matrices (GLCM) technique is used to extract the relevant features and reduce feature dimensionality issues. For the feature selection process, the enhanced Archimedes optimization algorithm (EAOA) is introduced to select optimal features. The residual channel attention-generative adversarial network (RCA-GAN) technique is introduced for image classification. Here, the hyperparameter of the network is tuned using the Sandpiper optimization (SPO) algorithm to optimize the loss function. The data set used in this research is COVID-CT-machine learning deep learning (MD), and the performance is analyzed using the MATLAB tool. In the experimental scenario, the proposed system achieves 98.3% accuracy, 98.7% specificity, 99.4% sensitivity, 97.4% F -score, and 96.1% kappa. The attained results prove that the proposed system works better than the traditional techniques.},

  abstract     = {Several companies leverage trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to offer predictive services to users. These companies capitalize on CNNs&#39; superior performance in image processing tasks, such as autonomous driving or face recognition. To safeguard data privacy and model parameters, various algorithms have been proposed. Most of them are predominantly designed using secure multi-party computation (MPC) or hardware-assisted solutions. However, certain limitations persist. First, MPC-based approaches (e.g., garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption) fail to meet rapid responsiveness requirements. Additionally, hardware-assisted solutions impose extra burdens to realize secure inference tasks. The primary reasons for these shortcomings can be summarized as follows: (1) high computation and communication delays are introduced by heavy cryptographic operations during the online phase. (2) Additional overhead for sharing triples. In this article, we propose PCIR, a secure protocol for privacy-preserving convolutional neural network inference (PCIR). PCIR aims to address the aforementioned issues based on a pre-shared secret sharing mechanism. It can achieve rapid responses to user requirements and preserve privacy of data and model for the following reasons: (1) it circumvents computationally expensive operations, such as an operation for permuting plaintext slots, which runs 56 times slower than a homomorphic addition operation, and 34 times slower than a homomorphic multiplication operation. (2) Computational operations, such as homomorphic additions or multiplications, are conducted during the pre-computation phase. It can significantly reduce the online computing costs. (3) PCIR conducts secure multiplication based on pre-shared secret shares. It results in much lower communication and computation costs compared with the use of multiplicative triples. Finally, we evaluate PCIR with benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results have shown that PCIR requires less time and less communication cost than previous methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Land coverage mapping and classification is one of the critical information-based tools for sustainable agricultural development, enabling relevant departments to carry out agricultural resource adjustments, yield predictions, and other tasks in advance. As a vital means of acquiring land cover and usage information, SAR sensors have become an important research direction due to their all-weather and all-day working capabilities. Nevertheless, traditional classification methods in PolSAR image classification often input a combination of various scattering features, i.e., high-dimensional feature combination, into classifiers, leading to mutual interference among different features and consequently degrading classification performance, especially for linear classifiers such as NRS and SVM. To mitigate this interference, this paper proposed an unsupervised feature selection based on spectral clustering (FSSC) that constructs a targeted approach by leveraging the linear expression capabilities of high-dimensional features. In this method, the linear relationships between different features are first analyzed, and the linear similarity between features can be quantitatively expressed using Pearson correlation coefficients, forming a feature similarity matrix. Subsequently, the similarity matrix undergoes unsupervised similarity partitioning through spectral clustering, dividing the features into distinct combinations. Features within clustering subsets can be considered as combinations with high linear similarity. Therefore, KL divergence is applied to select the most representative features within each cluster, and the resulting representative feature combinations from different clustering subsets are combined to form an optimal feature set, achieving the purpose of feature selection. This method maps high-dimensional feature combinations into low-dimensional ones while preserving the essential attributes of the original data, thereby retaining the valuable feature information and enhancing classification performance. Experimental outcomes conclusively show that the proposed method enhances the overall accuracy (OA) of SVM by 4.51% and the OA of NRS by 2.34% in the Flevoland Dataset, underscoring its efficacy in PolSAR image classification, especially for linear classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering is a widely used method in recommender systems research. However, contrary to the assumption that it relies solely on rating data, many contemporary models incorporate review information to address issues such as data sparsity. Although previous recommender systems utilised review texts to capture user preferences and item features, they often rely on a single-embedding model to represent these features, which may limit the richness of the extracted information. Recent advancements suggest that combining multiple pre-trained embedding models can enhance text representation by leveraging the strengths of different encoding methods. In this study, we propose a novel recommender system model, the Multi-embedding Fusion Network for Recommendation (MFNR), which employs a multi-embedding approach to effectively capture and represent user and item features in review texts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and its optimised variant, RoBERTa, both of which are pre-trained transformer-based models designed for natural language understanding. By leveraging their contextual embeddings, our model extracts enriched feature representations from review texts. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world review datasets from Amazon.com and Goodreads.com demonstrate that MFNR significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 9.18% in RMSE and 14.81% in MAE. These results highlight the efficacy of the multi-embedding approach, indicating its potential for broader application in complex recommendation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm used to measure the similarity between sequences, with widespread applications in domains such as speech recognition, image processing and video synchronisation. However, when matching a shorter multivariate time subsequence to a longer time series containing a similar subsequence, existing DTW variants struggle to accurately determine the matching path. To address this issue, we propose an improved algorithm, generalised weighted variance DTW (G-WVDTW). We extend the DTW algorithm to multivariate time series and introduce a weighted variance-based approach to calculate local distances. This allows the algorithm to better assess the distance between different time points in multivariate time series. Additionally, we modify the algorithm&#39;s boundary conditions, enabling it to handle subsequence matching tasks in multivariate time series. We conducted similarity retrieval experiments using public datasets and evaluated the algorithm&#39;s performance with the AUC metric, achieving up to a 19% improvement on certain datasets. Furthermore, we performed alignment experiments on industrial data, where we artificially generated aligned sequences and quantitatively assessed the alignment errors, which were lower than those produced by other DTW variants. Finally, we validated the algorithm&#39;s superior performance in multivariate time series subsequence matching tasks using a synthetic dataset and showcased its use in motif detection using a wind power generation dataset. The algorithm can be applied in fields such as industrial, meteorological and electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis for tasks like time series retrieval, matching and data labelling.},

This is particularly important for improving learning outcomes in massive open online courses (MOOCs) for diverse learners. Because both the historical learning courses and recommended learning paths can be represented as sequential patterns (SPs); it is reasonable to approach this problem through SP mining (SPM). In addition to support, we incorporate three factors, that is, course learning days, grades and engagement, to model frequent high-utility SPs (FHUSPs). When recommending a learning path, FHUSPs that align with the target user&#39;s learning history and are common among successful learners, while rare among less successful ones, are prioritised. If there are insufficient matching FHUSPs, we address this by recommending additional courses based on the joint competency and complementarity of learners similar to the target learner.

However, finding a good set of patterns according to MDL involves a very large search space, and current MDL-based techniques often suffer from long runtimes and find suboptimal solutions. To discover better sets of patterns in less time, this paper introduces GRIMP (a Genetic algoRIthm for coMpression-based descriptive Pattern mining), a novel framework that combines a genetic algorithm with MDL-based pattern selection. Multiple genetic algorithm variants are explored within the GRIMP framework, and their effectiveness is compared using a large number of datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GRIMP consistently outperforms previous methods by achieving higher compression ratios, generating more representative itemsets, and requiring less time. Additionally, the extracted patterns improve downstream classification tasks, highlighting the ability of GRIMP to find more representative patterns within the data.},

The present research evaluates the performance of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms in speech recognition and proposes a novel hybrid approach that combines both methods. The study assesses various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, response time, and computational cost. The experimental tests show that the integration between HMM and CNN increased the accuracy by 6% and 8% when compared to HMM and CNN isolated, respectively, in accordance with results presented in previous papers.

The total collected corpus size is 2293 tweets; after annotation, these tweets were labelled in a three-way classification approach as either positive, negative or neutral. We run different experiments to provide benchmark results of Arabic sentiment classification. Comparative results on our dataset show that the highest performing baseline model when utilising manual labels was MARBERT, with an accuracy of up to 87%, which was pre-trained for Arabic on a massive amount of data. It should be noted that this model enhanced its performance additionally after pre-training on a dialectical Arabic and modern standard Arabic corpus. On the other hand, zero-shot automatically generated labels achieved an 84% accuracy rate in predicting sarcasm classes from sentiment labels.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in 3GPP specifications and the extensive deployment of 5G networks have driven significant growth in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). This development has led to an increase in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which provide capabilities such as automated navigation, ADAS, cruise control, and environmentally sustainable transportation in real-time. Additionally, the widespread adoption of CAVs has also escalated vulnerabilities within the IoV ecosystem, exposing it to potential cyberattacks. The integration of various functional interfaces has enlarged its attack surface, thereby increasing the risk of vehicle infiltration. Researchers have proposed various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to address the ongoing risk of vehicle attacks, without applying encryption and related authentication methods for intra-and inter-vehicular communications. However, a significant limitation of many IDSs is their dependency on characteristics specific to a particular category of vehicles, which limits their adaptability. Additionally, current IDSs frequently rely on one-dimensional features such as traffic, time, etc., which limits their capability of detecting attacks in adverse scenarios. Moreover, incorporating machine learning algorithms into IDSs deployed in automated automobiles causes an increase in computational demands. We propose to develop a collaborative IDS specifically designed for cloud-based vehicle environments. We aim to improve our capabilities of identifying intrusion detection and differentiate which are malicious by using multidimensional features. A customised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), optimised through hyperparameter tuning, is also developed for detecting the malicious vehicles and enhancing the overall IDS. To address the challenge of data diversity, we integrate various vehicular datasets into a unified feature space. This integration allows a single model to efficiently perform multi-classification tasks without frequent adjustments. Our feature space integrates dimensions such as traffic, time and so forth, levels, thereby expanding the spectrum of detectable attack scenarios. By identifying abnormal data points within this comprehensive feature framework, our system effectively identifies intrusions across a diverse range of vehicle types. As a result, our methodology supports robust intrusion detection through comprehensive multiclass vehicle classification.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly vital across numerous sectors, from logistics and rescue operations to military endeavours and beyond. However, ensuring safety in the decision-making processes surrounding UAV operations in real-world settings has become an urgent and complex challenge. At present, the main methods to minimise the risk of drone decision-making include utilising pre-established control rules, expert prior knowledge and regularisation constraints. However, these methodologies require UAVs to meet demanding prerequisites, including the acquisition of extensive decision-making experience and the establishment of comprehensive rules. Regrettably, these strict requirements often lead to frequent UAV crashes in uncertain environments and subsequent mission failures. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a self-decision-making method for quadcopter UAVs based on safe reinforcement learning. Our method utilises a multilevel cascading feature semantic space for reinforcement learning, integrating depth images, greyscale images, semantic segmentation images and object detection results as inputs. This approach aims to facilitate safe autonomous learning. Moreover, we integrate real offline labelled data to enhance the safety policy. Depending on the varying levels of risk encountered during the UAV&#39;s decision-making process, we dynamically select different safety policies. Through this iterative process, the UAV progressively eliminates extreme actions and reverts to the UAV learning policy module. Experimental results indicate that our method not only ensures safe decision-making for UAVs in uncertain environments but also exhibits superior safety decision-making efficacy compared to certain baseline methods.},

Our approach integrates effective practical preprocessing steps, including data augmentation and a data-driven optimisation strategy for the temporal window, even in the presence of numerous crop classes. Our findings demonstrate that DTW, despite its lower data demands, can match the performance of CNN-LSTM through our effective preprocessing steps while significantly improving runtime. These results demonstrate that both CNN-LSTM and DTW can achieve deployment-level accuracy and underscore the potential of DTW as a viable alternative to more resource-intensive models.

In particular, the works are grouped by their representative techniques, including regularisation, knowledge distillation, memory, generative replay, parameter isolation and a combination of the above techniques. For each category of these techniques, both its characteristics and applications in computer vision are presented. At the end of this overview, several subareas, where continuous knowledge accumulation is potentially helpful while continual learning has not been well studied, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the 3D point cloud field in recent years, point cloud completion of 3D objects has increasingly attracted researchers&#39; attention. Point cloud data can accurately express the shape information of 3D objects at different resolutions, but the original point clouds collected directly by various 3D scanning equipment are often incomplete and have uneven density. Tactile is one distinctive way to perceive the 3D shape of an object. Tactile point clouds can provide local shape information for unknown areas during completion, which is a valuable complement to the point cloud data acquired with visual devices. In order to effectively improve the effect of point cloud completion using tactile information, the authors propose an innovative tactile-assisted point cloud completion network, TAPCNet. This network is the first neural network customised for the input of tactile point clouds and incomplete point clouds, which can fuse two types of point cloud information in the feature domain. Besides, a new dataset named 3DVT was rebuilt, to fit the proposed network model. Based on the tactile fusion strategy and related modules, multiple comparative experiments were conducted by controlling the quantity of tactile point clouds on the 3DVT dataset. The experimental data illustrates that TAPCNet can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in the benchmark.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection is one of the current popular hotspots by perceiving the surrounding environment through LiDAR and camera sensors to recognise the category and location of objects in the scene. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Although some approaches have begun to investigate the robustness of 3D object detection models, they are currently generating adversarial examples in a white-box setting and there is a lack of research into generating transferable adversarial examples in a black-box setting. In this paper, a non-end-to-end attack algorithm was proposed for LiDAR pipelines that crafts transferable adversarial examples against 3D object detection. Specifically, the method generates adversarial examples by restraining features with high contribution to downstream tasks and amplifying features with low contribution to downstream tasks in the feature space. Extensive experiments validate that the method produces more transferable adversarial point clouds, for example, the method generates adversarial point clouds in the nuScenes dataset that are about 10 and 7 better than the state-of-the-art method on mAP and NDS, respectively.},

In the field of 3D point cloud classification, transfer-based black-box attack strategies have been explored to address the challenge of limited knowledge about the model in practical scenarios. However, existing approaches typically rely excessively on network structure, resulting in poor transferability of the generated adversarial examples. To address the above problem, the authors propose AEattack , an adversarial attack method capable of generating highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, AEattack employs an autoencoder (AE) to extract features from the point cloud data and reconstruct the adversarial point cloud based on these features. Notably, the AE does not require pre-training, and its parameters are jointly optimised using a loss function during the process of generating adversarial point clouds. The method makes the generated adversarial point cloud not overly dependent on the network structure, but more concerned with the data distribution. Moreover, this design endows AEattack with a broader potential for application. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset show that AEattack is capable of generating highly transferable adversarial point clouds, with up to 61.8% improvement in transferability compared to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an upward trend that marine vessels, an important object category in marine monitoring, have gradually become a research focal point in the field of computer vision, such as detection, tracking, and classification. Among them, marine vessel re-identification (Re-ID) emerges as a significant frontier research topics, which not only faces the dual challenge of huge intra-class and small inter-class differences, but also has complex environmental interference in the port monitoring scenarios. To propel advancements in marine vessel Re-ID technology, SwinTransReID, a framework grounded in the Swin Transformer for marine vessel Re-ID, is introduced. Specifically, the project initially encodes the triplet images separately as a sequence of blocks and construct a baseline model leveraging the Swin Transformer, achieving better performance on the Re-ID benchmark dataset in comparison to convolution neural network (CNN)-based approaches. And it introduces side information embedding (SIE) to further enhance the robust feature-learning capabilities of Swin Transformer, thus, integrating non-visual cues (orientation and type of vessel) and other auxiliary information (hull colour) through the insertion of learnable embedding modules. Additionally, the project presents VesselReID-1656, the first annotated large-scale benchmark dataset for vessel Re-ID in real-world ocean surveillance, comprising 135,866 images of 1656 vessels along with 5 orientations, 12 types, and 17 colours. The proposed method achieves 87.1 mAP and 96.1 Rank-1 accuracy on the newly-labelled challenging dataset, which surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.9 mAP regarding to performance. Moreover, extensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SwinTransReID on the person Market-1501 dataset, vehicle VeRi-776 dataset, and Boat Re-ID vessel dataset.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian images captured by nonoverlapping visible and infrared cameras. Most existing compensation-based methods try to generate images of missing modality from the other ones. However, the generated images often fail to possess enough quality due to severe discrepancies between different modalities. Moreover, it is generally assumed that person images are roughly aligned during the extraction of part-based local features. However, this does not always hold true, typically when they are cropped via inaccurate pedestrian detectors. To alleviate such problems, the authors propose a novel feature-level compensation and alignment network (FCA-Net) for VI-ReID in this paper, which tries to compensate for the missing modality information on the channel-level and align part-based local features. Specifically, the visible and infrared features of low-level subnetworks are first processed by a channel feature compensation (CFC) module, which enforces the network to learn consistent distribution patterns of channel features, and thereby the cross-modality discrepancy is narrowed. To address spatial misalignment, a pairwise relation module (PRM) is introduced to incorporate human structural information into part-based local features, which can significantly enhance the feature discrimination power. Besides, a cross-modality part alignment loss (CPAL) is designed on the basis of a dynamic part matching algorithm, which can promote more accurate local matching. Extensive experiments on three standard VI-ReID datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that state-of-the-art performance is achieved.},

This systematic literature review examines the cutting-edge technologies in smart agriculture specifically computer vision, robotics, deep learning (DL), and Internet of Things (IoT) that are reshaping plant disease detection and management. By analysing 198 studies published between 2021 and 2023, from an initial pool of 19,838 papers, the authors reveal the dominance of DL, particularly with datasets such as PlantVillage, and highlight critical challenges, including dataset limitations, lack of geographical diversity, and the scarcity of real-world field data.

This work addresses these challenges through synthetic-to-real style transfer leveraging diffusion models. The authors’ proposal incorporates semantic controllers to guide the diffusion process and low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to ensure that style-transferred images align with real-world aesthetics while preserving semantic layout. Moreover, the authors introduce quality metrics to rank the utility of generated images, enabling the selective use of high-quality images for training. To further enhance reliability, the authors propose a novel loss function that mitigates artefacts from the style transfer process by incorporating only pixels aligned with the original semantic labels.

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration is a crucial aspect of computer vision and 3D reconstruction. Traditional registration methods often depend on global features or iterative optimisation, leading to inefficiencies and imprecise outcomes when processing complex scene point cloud data. To address these challenges, the authors introduce a principal direction-guided local voxelisation structural feature (PDLVSF) approach for point cloud registration. This method reliably identifies feature points regardless of initial positioning. Approach begins with the 3D Harris algorithm to extract feature points, followed by determining the principal direction within the feature points&#39; radius neighbourhood to ensure rotational invariance. For scale invariance, voxel grid normalisation is utilised to maximise the point cloud&#39;s geometric resolution and make it scale-independent. Cosine similarity is then employed for effective feature matching, identifying corresponding feature point pairs and determining transformation parameters between point clouds. Experimental validations on various datasets, including the real terrain dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Results indicate superior performance in root mean square error (RMSE) and registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high noise, limited overlap, and significant initial pose rotation.

  abstract     = {Egocentric action anticipation involves predicting future actions performed by the camera wearer from egocentric video. Although the task has recently gained attention in the research community, current approaches often assume that input videos are ‘trimmed’, meaning that a short video sequence is sampled a fixed time before the beginning of the action. However, trimmed action anticipation has limited applicability in real-world scenarios, where it is crucial to deal with ‘untrimmed’ video inputs and the exact moment of action initiation cannot be assumed at test time. To address these limitations, an untrimmed action anticipation task is proposed, which, akin to temporal action detection, assumes that the input video is untrimmed at test time, while still requiring predictions to be made before actions take place. The authors introduce a benchmark evaluation procedure for methods designed to address this novel task and compare several baselines on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset. Through our experimental evaluation, testing a variety of models, the authors aim to better understand their performance in untrimmed action anticipation.

Existing blood cell detection methods suffer from low accuracy, which is caused by the uneven distribution, high density, and mutual occlusion of different blood cell types in blood microscope images, this article introduces NBCDC-YOLOv8: a new framework to improve blood cell detection and classification based on YOLOv8. Our framework innovates on several fronts: it uses Mosaic data augmentation to enrich the dataset and add small targets, incorporates a space to depth convolution (SPD-Conv) tailored for cells that are small and have low resolution, and introduces the Multi-Separated and Enhancement Attention Module (MultiSEAM) to enhance feature map resolution. Additionally, it integrates a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) for effective multi-scale feature fusion and includes four detection heads to improve recognition accuracy of various cell sizes, especially small target platelets. Evaluated on the Blood Cell Classification Dataset (BCCD), NBCDC-YOLOv8 obtains a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.7%, and thus surpasses the original YOLOv8n by 2.3%.},

However, only a few of them have explored robust classification, which is an important aspect of human visual intelligence. Humans can effortlessly recognise visual patterns, including lines, circles, and even characters, from image data that has been corrupted or degraded. In this paper, the authors investigate a robust classification method that extends the classical paradigm of robust geometric model fitting. The method views an image as a set of points in a low-dimensional space and analyses each image through low-dimensional geometric model fitting. In contrast, the majority of other methods, such as deep learning methods, treat an image as a single point in a high-dimensional space. The authors evaluate the performance of the method using a noisy Omniglot dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more robust than other methods.

To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel approach to 3D HPE, termed the Spatial Mamba Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) Former (SMGNFormer). The proposed method utilises the Mamba architecture to extract spatial information from 2D keypoints and integrates GCNs with multi-head attention mechanisms to build a relational graph of 2D keypoints across a global receptive field. The outputs are subsequently processed by a Time-Frequency Feature Fusion Transformer to estimate 3D human poses. SMGNFormer demonstrates superior estimation performance on the Human3.6M dataset and real-world video data compared to most Transformer-based algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method achieves a training speed comparable to PoseFormerv2, providing a clear advantage over other methods in its category.},

This, together with large image volumes collected using camera traps and crowdsourcing, opens novel possibilities to study animal populations. For many species, the re-identification can be done by analysing the permanent fur, feather, or skin patterns that are unique to each individual. In this paper, the authors study pattern feature aggregation based re-identification and consider two ways of improving accuracy: (1) aggregating pattern image features over multiple images and (2) combining the pattern appearance similarity obtained by feature aggregation and geometric pattern similarity. Aggregation over multiple database images of the same individual allows to obtain more comprehensive and robust descriptors while reducing the computation time. On the other hand, combining the two similarity measures allows to efficiently utilise both the local and global pattern features, providing a general re-identification approach that can be applied to a wide variety of different pattern types. In the experimental part of the work, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising re-identification accuracies for Saimaa ringed seals and whale sharks without species-specific training or fine-tuning.},

In MMF-Net, firstly, the bone length estimation module and the trajectory multi-level fusion module are used to extract the geometric size information of the human body and multi-level trajectory information of human motion, respectively. Then, the fusion attention-based combination (FABC) module is used to extract multi-level topological structure information of the human body, and effectively fuse topological structure information, geometric size information and trajectory information.

Our key contribution is a dual-branch architecture that separately extracts geometric features from LiDAR and texture features from images. These features are then fused in a BEV perspective to achieve a comprehensive representation of the tracked object. A significant innovation in our approach is the Image-to-LiDAR Adapter module, which transfers the rich feature representation capabilities of the image modality to the 3D tracking task, and the BEV-Fusion module, which facilitates the interactive fusion of geometry and texture features. By validating MILT on public datasets, we demonstrate substantial performance improvements over traditional methods, effectively showcasing the advantages of our multi-modal fusion strategy. This work advances the state-of-the-art in SOT by integrating complementary information from RGB and LiDAR modalities, resulting in enhanced tracking accuracy and robustness.},

However, this task becomes more complex in urban areas characterised by the coexistence of modern developments and natural vegetation. The unstructured nature of point cloud data, along with data sparsity, irregular point distribution, and varying sizes of urban objects, presents challenges in point cloud classification. To address these challenges, development of robust algorithmic approach encompassing efficient feature sets and classification model are essential. This study incorporates point-wise features to capture the local spatial context of points in datasets. Furthermore, an ensemble machine learning model based on extreme boosting is utilised, which integrates sequential training for weak learners, to enhance the model’s resilience. To thoroughly investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach, this study utilises three distinct datasets from diverse geographical locations, each presenting unique challenges related to class distribution, 3D terrain intricacies, and geographical variations. The Land-cover Diversity Index is introduced to quantify the complexity of landcover in 3D by measuring the degree of class heterogeneity and the frequency of class variation in the dataset. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 90% on the regionally complex, higher landcover diversity dataset, Trivandrum Aerial LiDAR Dataset. Furthermore, the results of the study demonstrate improved overall predictive accuracy of 91% and 87% on data segments from two benchmark datasets, DALES and Vaihingen 3D.},

In this paper, the authors present an unsupervised auto-encoder-based network trained by one-class learning that inputs RGB image sequences recorded by egocentric cameras to detect abnormal activities of the camera wearers themselves. To improve the performance of network, the authors introduce a ‘re-encoding’ architecture and a regularisation loss function term, minimising the KL divergence between the distributions of features extracted by the first and second encoders. Unlike the common use of KL divergence loss to obtain a feature distribution close to an already-known distribution, the aim is to encourage the features extracted by the second encoder to have a close distribution to those extracted from the first encoder. The authors evaluate the proposed method on the Epic-Kitchens-55 dataset and conduct an ablation study to analyse the functions of different components. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the comparison methods in all cases and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed re-encoding architecture and the regularisation term.},

  abstract     = {In ecology, deep learning is improving the performance of camera-trap image based wild animal analysis. However, high labelling cost becomes a big challenge, as it requires involvement of huge human annotation. For example, the Snapshot Serengeti (SS) dataset contains over 900,000 images, while only 322,653 contains valid animals, 68,000 volunteers were recruited to provide image level labels such as species, the no. of animals and five behaviour attributes such as standing, resting and moving etc. In contrast, the Gold Standard SS Bounding-Box Coordinates (GSBBC for short) contains only 4011 images for training of object detection algorithms, as the annotation of bounding-box for animals in the image, is much more costive. Such a no. of training images, is obviously insufficient. To address this, the authors propose a method to generate bounding-boxes for a larger dataset using limited manually labelled images. To achieve this, the authors first train a wild animal detector using a small dataset (e.g. GSBBC) that is manually labelled to locate animals in images; then apply this detector to a bigger dataset (e.g. SS) for bounding-box generation; finally, we remove false detections according to the existing label information of the images. Experiments show that detector trained with images whose bounding-boxes are generated using the proposal, outperformed the existing camera-trap image based animal detection, in terms of mean average precision (mAP). Compared with the traditional data augmentation method, our method improved the mAP by 21.3% and 44.9% for rare species, also alleviating the long-tail issue in data distribution. In addition, detectors trained with the proposed method also achieve promising results when applied to classification and counting tasks, which are commonly required in wildlife research.},

This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatial-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilised to model spatial-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularisation losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatial-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks&#39; performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.},

However, previous studies have neglected the presence of outliers in measurements, so that even a small percentage of outliers will significantly degrade precision. In order to deal with outliers, this paper proposes using a graduated non-convexity (GNC) method to suppress outliers in robust camera pose estimation, which serves as the core of GNCPnP. The authors first reformulate the camera pose estimation problem using a non-convex cost, which is less affected by outliers. Then, to apply a non-minimum solver to solve the reformulated problem, the authors use the Black-Rangarajan duality theory to transform it. Finally, to address the dependence of non-convex optimisation on initial values, the GNC method was customised according to the truncated least squares cost. The results of simulation and real experiments show that GNCPnP can effectively handle the interference of outliers and achieve higher accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the camera pose estimation accuracy of GNCPnP in the case of a low percentage of outliers is almost comparable to that of the state-of-the-art algorithm in the case of no outliers.},

To address the issue, the authors propose an innovative approach to detect moving cast shadows by combining the hybrid feature with a broad learning system (BLS). The approach involves extracting low-level features from the input and background images based on colour constancy and texture consistency principles that are shown to be highly effective in moving cast shadow detection. The authors then utilise the BLS to create a hybrid feature and BLS uses the extracted low-level features as input instead of the original data. BLS is an innovative form of deep learning that can map input to feature nodes and further enhance them by enhancement nodes, resulting in more compact features for classification. Finally, the authors develop an efficient and straightforward post-processing technique to improve the accuracy of moving object detection. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalisation ability, the authors conduct extensive experiments on public ATON-CVRR and CDnet datasets to verify the superior performance of our method by comparing with representative approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recently, visual-language models (VLMs) have displayed potent capabilities in the field of computer vision. Their emerging trend as the backbone of visual tasks necessitates studying class incremental learning (CIL) issues within the VLM architecture. However, the pre-training data for many VLMs is proprietary, and during the incremental phase, old task data may also raise privacy issues. Moreover, replay-based methods can introduce new problems like class imbalance, the selection of data for replay and a trade-off between replay cost and performance. Therefore, the authors choose the more challenging rehearsal-free settings. In this paper, the authors study class-incremental tasks based on the large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP model. Initially, at the category level, the authors combine traditional optimisation and distillation techniques, utilising both pre-trained models and models trained in previous incremental stages to jointly guide the training of the new model. This paradigm effectively balances the stability and plasticity of the new model, mitigating the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, utilising the VLM infrastructure, the authors redefine the relationship between instances. This allows us to glean fine-grained instance relational information from the a priori knowledge provided during pre-training. The authors supplement this approach with an entropy-balancing method that allows the model to adaptively distribute optimisation weights across training samples. The authors’ experimental results validate that their method, within the framework of VLMs, outperforms traditional CIL methods.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting middle-aged and elderly populations. Its insidious onset, high disability rate, long diagnostic cycle, and high diagnostic costs impose a heavy burden on patients and their families. Leveraging artificial intelligence, with its rapid diagnostic speed, high accuracy, and fatigue resistance, to achieve intelligent assisted diagnosis of PD holds significant promise for alleviating patients&#39; financial stress, reducing diagnostic cycles, and helping patients seize the golden period for early treatment. This paper proposes an Attention and Multi-level Enhancement Fusion Network (AMEF-Net) based on the characteristics of three-dimensional medical imaging and the specific manifestations of PD in medical images. The focus is on small lesion areas and structural lesion areas that are often overlooked in traditional deep learning models, achieving multi-level attention and processing of imaging information. The model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 98.867%, a precision of 99.830%, a sensitivity of 99.182%, and a specificity of 99.384% on Magnetic Resonance Images from the Parkinson&#39;s Progression Markers Initiative dataset.

  abstract     = {The utilisation of domain adaptation methods facilitates the resolution of classification challenges in an unlabelled target domain by capitalising on the labelled information from source domains. Unfortunately, previous domain adaptation methods have focused mostly on global domain adaptation and have not taken into account class-specific data, which leads to poor knowledge transfer performance. The study of class-level domain adaptation, which aims to precisely match the distributions of different domains, has garnered attention in recent times. However, existing investigations into class-level alignment frequently align domain features either directly on or in close proximity to classification boundaries, resulting in the creation of uncertain samples that could potentially impair classification accuracy. To address the aforementioned problem, we propose a new approach called metric-guided class-level alignment (MCA) as a solution to this problem. Specifically, we employ different metrics to enable the network to acquire supplementary information, thereby enhancing class-level alignment. Moreover, MCA can be effectively combined with existing domain-level alignment methods to successfully mitigate the challenges posed by domain shift. Extensive testing on commonly-used public datasets shows that our method outperforms many other cutting-edge domain adaptation methods, showing significant gains over baseline performance.},

  abstract     = {Video prediction is the process of learning necessary information from historical frames to predict future video frames. Learning features from historical frames is a crucial step in this process. However, most current methods have a relatively single-scale learning approach, even if they learn features at different scales, they cannot fully integrate and utilise them, resulting in unsatisfactory prediction results. To address this issue, a hierarchical multi-scale fusion unit (HMSFU) is proposed. By using a hierarchical multi-scale architecture, each layer predicts future frames at different granularities using different convolutional scales. The abstract features from different layers can be fused, enabling the model not only to capture rich contextual information but also to expand the model&#39;s receptive field, enhance its expressive power, and improve its applicability to complex prediction scenarios. To fully utilise the expanded receptive field, HMSFU incorporates three fusion modules. The first module is the single-layer historical attention fusion module, which uses an attention mechanism to fuse the features from historical frames into the current frame at each layer. The second module is the single-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses complementary temporal and spatial features at each layer. The third module is the multi-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses spatiotemporal features from different layers. Additionally, the authors not only focus on the frame-level error using mean squared error loss, but also introduce the novel use of Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence to consider inter-frame variations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed HMSFU model achieves the best performance on popular video prediction datasets, showcasing its remarkable competitiveness in the field.},

However, retinal vessel segmentation continues to face significant challenges. Firstly, capturing the boundary information of small vessels is particularly difficult. Secondly, uneven vessel thickness and irregular distribution further complicate the multi-scale feature modelling. Lastly, low-contrast images lead to increased background noise, further affecting the segmentation accuracy. To tackle these challenges, this article presents a multi-scale segmentation network that combines edge features and attention mechanisms, referred to as EANet. It demonstrates significant advantages over existing methods. Specifically, EANet consists of three key modules: the edge feature enhancement module, the multi-scale information interaction encoding module, and the multi-class attention mechanism decoding module. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method. Specifically, EANet outperforms existing advanced methods in the precise segmentation of small and multi-scale vessels and in effectively filtering background noise to maintain segmentation continuity.},

However, there are three essential challenges in the task of tennis ball recognition using sport vision sensors: the small size of the ball, its high speed, and the complex match scenarios. As a result, this paper considers a lightweight object detection model named improved RTMDet-light to deal with these challenges. Specifically, it has compatible capacities in the backbone and neck, constructed by a basic building block that consists of large-kernel depth-wise convolutions. Furthermore, GhosNet and ShuffleNet are used to replace the CSPLayers which reduce the parameters of our model. The lightweight model proposed addresses the inherent challenges of detecting small objects and muti scenarios in the match. After training, the proposed model performed better on four scenarios with different shades of tennis ball match, with results visualized through heatmaps and performance metrics tabulated for detailed analysis. The recall, FLOPs and number of parameters of the improved RTMDet-light are 71.4%, 12.543G, and 4.874M, respectively. The results demonstrate robustness and effectiveness of our model in accurate tennis ball detecting across various scales. In conclusion, our model for real-time detection in tennis ball detection offers a lightweight and faster solution for sport sensors.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal, motion and channel information are pivotal in video-based behaviour recognition. Traditional 2D CNNs demonstrate low computational complexity but fail to capture temporal dynamics effectively. Conversely, 3D CNNs excel in recognising temporal patterns but at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose a generic and effective SME module composed of three parallel sub-modules, namely Spatio-Temporal Excitation (STE), Motion Excitation (ME) and Efficient Channel Excitation (ECE). Specifically, the STE module enhances the spatiotemporal representation using a single-channel 3D convolution, enabling the model to focus on both temporal and spatial features. The ME module emphasises motion-sensitive channels by calculating feature map differences at adjacent time steps, guiding the model toward motion-centric regions. The ECE module efficiently captures cross-channel interactions without dimensionality reduction, ensuring robust performance while significantly reducing model complexity. Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, the proposed method achieved Top-1 accuracy of 49.0% on the Something-Something V1 (Sth-Sth V1) dataset and 40.8% on the Diving48 dataset. Extensive ablation studies and comparative experiments further demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an optimal balance between recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Current feature matching methods typically employ a two-stage process, consisting of coarse and fine matching. However, the transition from the coarse to the fine stage often lacks an effective intermediate state, leading to abrupt changes in the matching process. This can hinder smooth transitions and precise localization. To address these limitations, this study introduces Coarse-Mid-Fine Match Net (CMFNet), a novel three-stage image feature matching method. CMFNet incorporates an intermediate-grained matching phase between the coarse and fine stages to facilitate a more gradual and seamless transition. In the proposed method, the intermediate-grained matching refines the correspondences obtained from the coarse-grained stage using Adaptive-random sample consensus (RANSAC). Subsequently, the midtransformer, which integrates sparse self-attention (SSA) mechanisms with local-feature-based cross-attention, is employed for feature extraction. This approach enhances the feature extraction capabilities and improves the adaptability to various types of image data, thereby boosting overall matching performance. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism based on local region features is introduced. The network undergoes fully self-supervised training, aiming to minimize a match loss that is autonomously generated from the training data using a multi-scale cross-entropy method. A series of thorough experiments was carried out on diverse real-world datasets, including both unaltered and extensively processed images.The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 0.776 mAUC on the HPatches dataset and 0.442 mAUC on the ISC-HE dataset.},

SUAS builds upon the rotated multi-scale interaction network (RMSIN) architecture and introduces the prompt refinement and uncertainty adjustment module (PRUAM). This novel component transforms original textual prompts into semantic uncertainty-aware descriptions, particularly focusing on the ambiguous boundaries prevalent in remote sensing imagery. By incorporating semantic uncertainty, SUAS directly tackles the inherent complexities in boundary delineation, enabling more refined segmentations. Experimental results demonstrate SUAS&#39;s effectiveness, showing improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics. SUAS achieves consistent enhancements in mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and precision at various thresholds, with notable performance in handling objects with irregular and complex boundaries—a persistent challenge in aerial imagery analysis.

This allows for sufficient learning of audio features from image features in a low dimensional state to generate more accurate lip movements.

In high-traffic environments, traditional face recognition methods can cause crowd congestion, emphasizing the need for unconscious face recognition, which requires no active cooperation from individuals. Due to the nature of unconscious face recognition, it is necessary to capture high-quality face images. In this paper, the FSA-Net head pose estimation network is enhanced to FSA-Shared_Nadam by replacing the Adam optimizer with Nadam and improving stage fusion. In the first stage, FSA-Shared_Nadam estimates head pose angles, MediaPipe detects facial landmarks to calculate eye distance and aspect ratios, and sharpness is calculated using the Laplacian operator. Images are considered valid if they meet the criteria. A model trains a face quality scoring formula, learning how different head pose angles affect face recognition accuracy. In the second stage, face images are clustered, and the formula is applied to select the highest-scoring face within each cluster. The approach was tested across multiple datasets, and a simulated security checkpoint scenario was created for practical testing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FSA-Shared_Nadam head pose estimation algorithm and the proposed face quality assessment approach.},

  abstract     = {High-quality retinal fundus images are widely used by ophthalmologists for the detection and diagnosis of eye diseases, diabetes, and hypertension. However, in retinal fundus imaging, the reduction in image quality, characterized by poor local contrast and non-uniform brightness, is inevitable. Image enhancement becomes an essential and practical strategy to address these issues. In this paper, we propose a retinal fundus image enhancement method that emphasizes details and equalizes brightness, based on image decomposition. First, the original image is decomposed into three layers using an edge-preserving filter: a base layer, a detail layer, and a noise layer. Second, an adaptive local power-law approach is applied to the base layer for brightness equalization, while detail enhancement is achieved for the detail layer through saliency analysis and blue channel removal. Finally, the base and detail layers are combined, excluding the noise layer, to synthesize the final image. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with both classical and recent approaches using two widely adopted datasets. According to the experimental results, both subjective and objective assessments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances retinal fundus images by highlighting details, equalizing brightness, and suppressing noise and artifacts, all without causing color distortion.},

MFENet introduces a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depth-wise separable convolutions to capture rich multi-scale spatial and channel information. Furthermore, the proposed method employs a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that utilizes wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics.

However, to further enhance the model&#39;s supervisory signals, we introduce a new feature-based perceptual loss. This module utilizes a pre-trained encoder to extract features from both the synthesized and target frames and calculates their cosine dissimilarity as an additional source of supervision. In this way, we aim to improve the model&#39;s robustness in handling complex lighting and surface reflection conditions in endoscopic scenes. We compare the performance of using two pre-trained CNN-based models and four foundational models as encoder. Experimental results show that our improve method further enhances the accuracy of depth estimation in medical imaging. Additionally, it demonstrates that features extracted by CNN-based models, which are sensitive to local details, outperform foundation models. This suggests that encoders for extracting medical image features may not require extensive pre-training, and relatively simple traditional convolutional neural networks can suffice.},

However, existing shadow detection methods tend to misidentify complex shadows and their similar patterns, such as soft shadow regions and shadow-like regions, since they treat all cases equally, leading to an incomplete structure of the detected shadow regions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a structure-aware transformer network (STNet) for robust shadow detection. Specifically, we first develop a transformer-based shadow detection network to learn significant contextual information interactions. To this end, a context-aware enhancement (CaE) block is also introduced into the backbone to expand the receptive field, thus enhancing semantic interaction. Then, we design an edge-guided multi-task learning framework to produce intermediate and main predictions with a rich structure. By fusing these two complementary predictions, we can obtain an edge-preserving refined shadow map. Finally, we introduce an auxiliary semantic-aware learning to overcome the interference from complex scenes, which facilitates the model to perceive shadow and non-shadow regions using a semantic affinity loss. By doing these, we can predict high-quality shadow maps in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the balance error rate (BER) by 4.53%, 2.54%, and 3.49% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the benchmark datasets SBU, ISTD, and UCF, respectively.},

To select the best components among many, we explore the genetic algorithm by convolving different kernels with components, which results in a feature matrix that is further fed to EfficientNet for choosing actual text components. Therefore, the proposed model is called genetic algorithm based network for text localization in degraded social media images (TLDSMI).

Among the various attack types, spoofing attack poses a significant threat due to high success rates and minimal technical requirements. In this study, we explore the differences between real and fake palmprint images. Based on these differences, we propose the concept of ‘high-frequency spoofing regions’ to capture key discriminative spoofing clues. Specifically, the high-frequency spoofing regions adaptation ( HFSRA ) model is proposed to address palmprint anti-spoofing. The HFSRA consists of two key modules: the texture analysis module (TAM) and the spoofing attention module (SAM). In particular, the TAM divides the input feature map into several patches and evaluates the texture distribution within each patch. Next, the SAM dynamically constructs an attention map by mapping the texture distribution to an attention weight matrix. This adaptive structure forces the model to focus on high-frequency spoofing regions, which improves the model&#39;s ability to extract meaningful spoofing clues effectively. Furthermore, we establish three experimental protocols for evaluating the performance of palmprint anti-spoofing models. These protocols provide a standardized evaluation framework for future studies. Extensive experiments conducted under these protocols demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of HFSRA.},

Firstly, we present a spatial information perception (SIP) module to extract contextual features for different objects through the integration of space to depth operation and large selective kernel module, which dynamically adjusts receptive field of the backbone and obtains the enhanced features for richer understanding of differentiation between objects and background. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-scale feature weighted fusion strategy, which performs weighted fusion on feature maps by combining fast normalized fusion method and CARAFE operation, accurately assessing the importance of each feature and enhancing the representation of small objects. The extensive experiments conducted on VisDrone2019, Tiny-Person and PESMOD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method enables comparable detection performance to state-of-the-art detectors.},

  abstract     = {Space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) aims to construct high space-time resolution video sequences from low frame rate and low-resolution video sequences. While recent STVSR works combine temporal interpolation and spatial super-resolution in a unified framework, they face challenges in computational complexity across both temporal and spatial dimensions, particularly in achieving accurate intermediate frame interpolation and efficient temporal information utilisation. To address these, we propose a deformable attention network for efficient STVSR. Specifically, we introduce a deformable interpolation block that employs hierarchical feature fusion to effectively handle complex inter-frame motions at multiple scales, enabling more accurate intermediate frame generation. To fully utilise temporal information, we design a temporal feature shuffle block (TFSB) to efficiently exchange complementary information across multiple frames. Additionally, we develop a motion feature enhancement block incorporating channel attention mechanism to selectively emphasise motion-related features, further boosting TFSB&#39;s effectiveness. Experimental results on benchmark datasets definitively demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance in STVSR tasks.},

This paper proposes a robust text watermarking method based on the stroke components of Chinese characters. By designing an innovative approach, Chinese character strokes are divided into several distinct components, with only specific ones being selectively modified to generate new glyphs, thus forming a unique codebook. The watermark signals are embedded by substituting the carrier glyph with the newly generated one, and the signals are extracted using a template matching method. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional manually designed codebooks, the proposed method significantly reduces human labor and computational overhead while maintaining high visual quality. Moreover, it exhibits superior robustness and adaptability across various challenging scenarios, including digital noise attacks, print-scanning attacks, and print-camera capture, making it a highly effective solution for protecting textual information.},

  abstract     = {In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) systems, deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have made significant strides in recovering 3D hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single 2D measurement. However, the inherent nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of HSI reconstruction continue to challenge existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight collaborative attention-enhanced accelerated unfolding network ( ), which integrates a DUN framework with a streamlined prior extractor. Our integrated approach introduces a generically accelerated half-quadratic splitting algorithm (A-HQS) for degradation estimation, overcoming the limitations of first-order optimization and enabling effective long-range dependency modeling. Within the prior extractor, we introduce cross-convergence attention, facilitating iterative information exchange between local and non-local Transformers to capture holistic features and enhance inductive capacity. Notably, the concept of collaborative cross-convergence is embedded throughout all submodules, ensuring effective information flow. The proposed not only accelerates the convergence of spectral reconstruction, but also fully exploits compressed spatial-spectral information. Numerical and visual comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this approach. Comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the superiority of this approach. The source code is available at https://github.com/Mengjie-s/CA2UN .},

The escalating occurrences of floods, particularly in urban areas, can be attributed to climate change, extreme weather patterns, uncontrolled urbanization, and complex geographical conditions. To mitigate the destructive impacts, such as loss of life and economic ramifications, automatic flood analysis and remote-sensing imagery segmentation offer valuable decision-making insights. However, the segmentation process for flood detection faces challenges due to the scarcity of labelled data and diverse resolutions, including medium resolution data. In response, the authors propose Flood-MATE, a novel semi-supervised learning approach based on the mean-teacher model.

In this paper, a novel calibration method for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras is proposed based on improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction. Initially, a method to extend the maximum fitting FOV of the camera model to over 180 degrees is proposed. Subsequently, a calibration board detection approach is proposed using SE(3) image pre-correction. Specifically, image pre-correction is incorporated into the camera calibration process, utilizing SE(3) to define the pre-correction plane. Calibration boards are detected within the pre-corrected images, enhancing the reliability, accuracy and speed of board detection in distorted images, consequently increasing the control point&#39;s maximum FOV. Lastly, the improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction are integrated into a feedback-based camera calibration system for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras. Operating with real-time or offline video streams as input, this system autonomously selects calibration key frames, optimizes camera parameters and calibration board poses in real-time. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to a 62% increase in the achievable maximum FOV.},

Accurately positioning the centre of OVL targets is fundamental for effective metrology. However, the identification and localization of target centres become challenging due to complex shapes and unexpected features, such as rounded corners, that can arise during manufacturing. An algorithm is proposed to tackle this challenge by employing customizable shape fitting. This method begins with the extraction of sub-pixel edge points, followed by applying a Hough transform to group and smooth these points, thereby enhancing contour quality. By parameterizing the target shape based on specific points, the algorithm integrates sub-pixel traversal techniques with an optimization objective, achieving sub-pixel accuracy in centre positioning. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm can achieve a positioning accuracy of ±0.03 pixels and demonstrates robustness against noise and blur. Finally, the proposed algorithm was used to test the OVL target pair arrays fabricated by electron beam etching, confirming an accuracy of ±0.04 pixels (±6.9 nm). These results validate the algorithm&#39;s capability to meet high precision requirements for OVL target centre positioning in wafer applications.},

The precision of segmentation has become the main factor limiting its development. Researchers typically refine image segmentation algorithms to enhance accuracy, but it is challenging for any improvement strategy to be effectively applied to images of different objects and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a two-step refinement method for image segmentation, comprising region expansion and minor contour adjustments. First, we design an adaptive gradient thresholding module to provide gradient-based constraints for the refinement process. Next, the region expansion module iteratively refines each segmented region based on colour differences and gradient thresholds. Finally, the minor contour adjustments module leverages local strong gradient features to refine the contour positions further. This method integrates region-level and pixel-level information to refine various image segmentation results. This method was applied to the BSDS500, Cells, and WHU Building datasets. The results demonstrate that the refined closed contours align more closely with the ground truth, with the most notable improvement observed at contour inflection points (corner points). Among the results, the Cells dataset showed the most significant improvement in segmentation accuracy, with the F-score increasing from 87.51% to 89.73% and IoU from 86.83% to 88.40%.},

However, the diagnosis of each modality is not entirely accurate. Compounding the challenge is the difficulty in acquiring multi-modal data, with existing datasets frequently lacking paired multi-modal data. To solve these problems, we propose multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm and cross-modal generation algorithm. The multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm first calculates the mean and variance separately for each modality, and then generates multi-modal diagnostic results in a distribution fusion manner. In order to generate the absent modality (mainly OCT data), three sub-networks are designed in the cross-modal generation algorithm: cross-modal alignment network, conditional deformable autoencoder and latent consistency diffusion model (LCDM).

A crucial reason for its limitation of discriminability is the lack of neighbourhood information description from a global perspective. Previous research has attempted to improve its performance by introducing global thresholds, but such threshold selection is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel tomography-aided local binary patterns (TLBP), inspired by the tomographic process of sample separation. TLBP considers constructing visual feature representations under multi-level non-local information to compensate for the lack of LBP possessing only a single shallow feature. In addition to the basic LBP features from local visual context, TLBP captures refined neighbourhood greyscale information through multi-quantile thresholds from a global visual perspective, thereby greatly enhancing discriminability. Experimental results in texture classification, face recognition, and hyperspectral pixel-wise classification demonstrate that the proposed TLBP descriptor outperforms the competitors, achieving 94.39% (KTH-TIPS), 81.22% (KTH-TIPS-ROT), 93.81% (Indian Pines), 99.85% (Salinas), and 99.50% (ORL) accuracy.

  abstract     = {High-resolution images are crucial for many applications, but factors such as environmental conditions can reduce image quality. Super-resolution (SR) techniques address this by generating high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. While deep learning SR models have made significant progress, they can be computationally expensive and struggle with differentiating between various image scales. Lightweight SR methods, suitable for resource-constrained devices, often compromise image quality. This study introduces a multi-stage holistic attention-based network, using Gaussian Laplacian pyramids to decompose images and apply holistic attention modules at each level. This approach reduces parameters and computational costs while maintaining image quality, achieving a PSNR score of 28 and SSIM of 0.91 with only 29,000 parameters. The model demonstrates the potential for efficient and high-quality image reconstruction. Future work will focus on improving quality while minimizing costs and exploring other advanced techniques. The code will be made available upon request},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image target detection provides an effective and accurate data analysis tool for many application areas. Due to complex backgrounds, large differences in target scales, and missed detection of small targets, remote sensing image target detection is challenging. In order to enhance the model&#39;s understanding of the global information of remote sensing images, this paper proposes the GFA module. This module can establish the global contextual connection of remote sensing images to provide rich context to help understand the complex scene and background in which the target is located, without being limited to local information. Additionally, it focuses on channel information for enhanced target feature extraction. For the purpose of alleviating the serious imbalance in foreground–background samples that is present in single-level target detection models. The loss function is reconstructed based on focal loss by redefining the balance factor α and focus factor γ , so that it can be dynamically adjusted during network training. Meanwhile, EIoU is used to further enhance the bounding box regression capability. Affine transformations were also used to augment the dataset in order to assist the model in adjusting to real-world situations. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the publicly available HRRSD dataset. In comparison with YOLO v5, the mAP of the detection results improved by 2.7%. Compared with YOLO v8 and YOLO v10, the mAP improved by 3.2% and 3.3%. The model achieves an FPS of 40.1, an optimal balance between speed and accuracy. Further, experiments are conducted using the NWPU VHR-10 dataset and the RSOD dataset, both of which demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms other target detection methods and improves remote sensing target detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Automatic liver segmentation is of great significance for computer-aided treatment and surgery of liver diseases. However, respiratory motion often affects the liver, leading to image artifacts in liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and increasing segmentation difficulty. To overcome this issue, we propose a global spatial structure-aware attention model (GSA-Net), a robust segmentation network developed to overcome the difficulties caused by respiratory motion. The GSA-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture, which extracts spatial structure information from images and identifies different objects using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. The network&#39;s encoder extracts multi-scale image features with the help of an effective and lightweight channel attention module. The decoder then transforms these features bottom-up using tree filter modules. Combined with the boundary detection module, the segmentation performance can be further improved. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two liver MRI benchmarks: one with respiratory artifacts and the other without. Numerical evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that GSA-Net consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of segmentation precision on our respiratory artifact dataset, and also achieves notable results on high-quality datasets.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely studied and applied in many fields. Although image super-resolution technology has been successfully applied to SAR imaging in recent years, there is less research on large-scale factor SAR image super-resolution methods. A more effective method is to obtain comprehensive information to guide the reconstruction of SAR images. In fact, the co-registered characteristics of high-resolution optical images have been successfully applied to improve the quality of SAR images. Inspired by this, an optical-guided multi-kernel attention based SAR image super-resolution reconstruction network (OMA-SSR) is proposed. The proposed multi-modal mutual attention (MMA) module in this network can effectively establish the dependency between SAR image features and optical image features. This network also designs a deep feature extraction module for SAR images, which includes a channel-splitted multi-kernel attention (CSMA) module and residual connections. CSMA module splits SAR image channels, extracts features in different ranges through multi-kernel convolution, and finally fuses the extracted features between different channels. Experimental results on the Sen1-2 and QXS datasets show that the proposed OMA-SSR performs well in evaluation indicators and visual effects of SAR image super-resolution reconstruction.},

However, in previous works, the negatives are sampled from the input image itself, which inspires us to design a data augmentation method to improve the quality of the selected negatives. Moreover, the previous methods only preserve the content consistency via patch-wise contrastive learning, which ignores the domain consistency between the generated images and the real images of the target domain. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised i2i translation framework based on multi-cropping contrastive learning and domain consistency, called MCDUT. Specifically, the multi-cropping views are obtained with the aim of further generating high-quality negative examples. To constrain the embeddings in the deep feature space, a new domain consistency loss is formulated, which encourages the generated images to be close to the real images. In many i2i translation tasks, this method achieves state-of-the-art results, and the advantages of this method have been proven through extensive comparison experiments and ablation research.

To extract richer features while reducing useless parameters in the network, this paper introduced the Im SRM filtering kernel into the image preprocessing module. To extract effective steganography noise from images, this paper combined depthwise separable convolution and residual networks for the first time and introduces them into the steganography noise extraction module. In addition, to focus network attention on the image regions where steganography information exists, this paper integrated the coordinate attention mechanism. This module will make the network pay attention to the overall structure and local details of the image during network training, improving the network&#39;s recognition ability for steganography information. Finally, the extracted steganography features are classified through a classification module. This paper conducted a series of experiments on the BOSSBase 1.01 and BOWS2 datasets.

To further exploit the intrinsic properties of images, this study proposes a novel low-rank representation-guided grouped sparse representation image restoration algorithm. This algorithm integrates self-representation models and trace optimization techniques to effectively preserve the original image structure, thereby enhancing image restoration performance while retaining the original texture and structural information.

Most existing face frontalization methods rely on heavy architectures that struggle with small datasets and produce low-quality images. Additionally, although video frames provide richer information, these methods typically use single images due to the lack of suitable multi-image datasets. To address these issues, a parameter-efficient framework for high-quality face frontalization in both single and multi-frame scenarios is proposed. First, a high-quality, diverse dataset is created for single and multi-image face frontalization tasks. Second, a novel single-image face frontalization method is introduced by combining GAN inversion with transfer learning. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 91% compared to existing GAN inversion methods while achieving far more photorealistic results than GAN-based methods. Finally, this method is extended to sequences of images, using attention mechanisms to merge information from multiple frames. This multi-frame approach reduces artefacts like eye blinks and improves reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that this single-image method outperforms pSp, a state-of-the-art GAN inversion method, with a 0.15 LPIPS improvement and a 0.10 increase in ID similarity. This multi-frame approach further improves identity preservation to 0.87, showcasing its effectiveness for high-quality frontal-view reconstructions.},

  abstract     = {This study investigated the possibility of using a laser methane detector (LMD) and optical gas imaging (OGI) to detect and quantify enteric methane ( CH 4 ${\rm CH}_4$ ) produced by ruminants in vitro. Four single-flow continuous fermenters were used for rumen culture incubation with four different treatment diets: Control (50:50 forage to concentrate [F:C] ratio), Control + Bromoform (CBR), Low Forage (LF; 20:80), and High Forage (HF; 80:20). After 10 days of incubation, all fermenter contents were transferred and used in a 24 h ANKOM batch culture to measure gas production with LMD and OGI. The authors introduce the Controlled Diet (CD) dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,885 plume images captured using an FLIR GF77 OGI camera under varying dietary conditions. The performance of six semantic segmentation models (FCN, U-Net, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, DeepLabv3+, and Gasformer) on the CD dataset is compared. Results showed that LMD data for followed a similar pattern to the gas chromatography (GC) instrument results. The in vitro results showed that different diets and F:C ratios had an impact on gas production and rumen fermentation characteristics. Adding bromoform to the control diet fully inhibited emission. The HF diet produced more compared to all treatments ( ) when measured with GC and LMD. CBR produced the lowest values when measured with GC and LMD. The Gasformer architecture achieved the highest performance with mean IoU of 85.1% and mean F-score of 91.72%. These findings demonstrate that OGI technology combined with advanced semantic segmentation models offers a promising solution for predicting and quantifying emissions in the livestock sector, potentially aiding in the development of mitigation strategies to combat climate change.},

To address the issue of dominant features being suppressed during feature fusion in FER, this study proposes a self-learning weight network based on label distribution training (SLW-LDT). First, based on the ShuffleNet-V2 backbone model, SLW-LDT introduced a local feature extraction branch that highlights specific expression-related features by cropping the facial image into four local regions. Subsequently, the SLW algorithm is devised to allocate learnable weights to global and local features from different branches before their fusion. Moreover, considering the challenge associated with accessing emotional distribution in facial images directly, a label distribution training module (LDT) is introduced during the training phase to generate label distributions for effective training purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracies of 89.77% and 64.21% on two in-the-wild datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet-7), and 98.90% on the lab-controlled CK+ dataset. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods reveals slight improvements in recognition accuracy along with robust performance exhibited by the model.},

Firstly, OLODN employs FasterNet blocks and reparameterised generalised-FPN to reduce computational complexity and preserve feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Secondly, a reinforced coordination attention mechanism is designed to strengthen the network&#39;s ability to capture occlusion boundary information. Additionally, a spatial pyramid pooling feature concatenation module is introduced to integrate multi-scale features and enhance the algorithm&#39;s robustness to occlusions.

Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. On the WiderPerson dataset, OLODN achieved a recall rate of 68.0%, which is 2.8% higher than YOLOv11&#39;s 65.2%, while running at 35.3 frames per second (f/s) on CPU and 76.6 f/s on GPU, faster than YOLOv11&#39;s 34.1 f/s and 74.5 f/s by 1.2 f/s and 2.1 f/s, respectively.},

Despite extensive research on morphing detection, limited attention has been given to restoring accomplice face images, which is critical for forensic applications. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel face de-morphing (FD) method based on identity feature transfer for restoring accomplice face images. The method encodes facial attribute and identity features separately and employs cross-attention mechanisms to extract identity features from morphed faces relative to reference images. This process isolates and enhances the accomplice&#39;s identity features. Additionally, inverse linear interpolation is applied to transfer identity features to attribute features, further refining the restoration process. The enhanced identity features are then integrated with the StyleGAN generator to reconstruct high-quality accomplice facial images. Experimental evaluations on two morphed face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, improving the average restoration accuracy by at least 5% compared with other methods. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for advancing forensic and security applications.},

Recently, due to the rise and widespread use of spike cameras, learning optical flow from spiking cameras has become a hot topic in the field of two-dimensional motion estimation. Although existing methods have been designed to learn optical flow by designing feature processing methods for spike streams, there is still insufficient consideration for flow field post-processing, resulting in limited accuracy of optical flow estimation. To address this problem, an optical flow estimation method based on directional disassembly is proposed. Specifically, the estimated flow fields along the horizontal and vertical directions are disassembled and the motion vectors along the two directions are denoised separately to reduce the burden of post-processing for complex two-dimensional motion information. In addition, contextual information is introduced in the post-processing so that the scene information can effectively contribute to the results of the flow post-processing.

Building upon the foundational YOLOv7 model, this study replaces the traditional convolution module with the FasterNet convolution module and SCConv module, and introduces the Wise-IoU (WIoU) loss function algorithm and Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism. The results show that the mAP value of the YOLOv7-SFWC model is improved by 4.15% and FPS by 7.6 compared with the original YOLOv7 model, and the computational complexity is reduced to adapt to the deployment. Moreover, the model&#39;s effectiveness is validated through extensive comparison experiments. Finally, the visual results show the accurate performance of the model and verify the progress of YOLOv7-SFWC.

However, due to the complex morphology, small size, and susceptibility to factors like lighting and obstruction, traditional identification methods suffer from low accuracy and efficiency. In this study, image enhancement techniques such as HSV transformation, horizontal flipping, and vertical flipping were applied to the training dataset to improve model robustness and enhance generalization across varying lighting and angles. To address these challenges in the context of tea buds detection, deep-learning-based object detection methods have emerged as promising solutions. Nevertheless, current object detection technologies still face limitations when detecting tea buds under these conditions. To enhance identification performance, this article proposed an improved YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once version 5 small model) algorithm. In the improved YOLOv5s algorithm, CBAM, SE, and CA attention mechanisms were incorporated into the backbone network to augment feature extraction, and a weighted Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed in the neck network to boost performance, resulting in the YOLOv5s_teabuds model. Experimental results indicated that the improved model significantly outperformed the original in terms of precision, recall, mAP and F1-score, with the CA attention mechanism providing the most notable improvement—enhancing precision, recall, mAP and F1-score by 18.119%, 9.633%, 16.496% and 13.524%, respectively. After integrating BiFPN, the YOLOv5s_teabuds model further strengthened performance and robustness, with precision, recall, mAP and F1-score increased by 19.346%, 11.388%, 18.620%, and 15.059%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Images can be corrupted during capture or transmission due to clouds, overlaps, and other interferences, deviating from their original state. Image inpainting techniques restore such images, but different types—Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), RGB, and infrared—require varying field-of-view sizes. SAR and infrared images, with less information, need a larger field of view, leading to uncorrelated interference in distant areas. RGB images, richer in information, are constrained by a limited local field of view, hindering access to full semantic details. To address these challenges, an aggregated convolution progressive network is proposed. This model employs a coarse-grained inpainting module for initial restoration, enhanced by an aggregated convolution module to capture contextual information. Local and global details are then used to refine the output, improving restoration quality. Additionally, existing datasets predominantly focus on RGB images, lacking diversity. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive dataset covering SAR, RGB, and infrared images under cloud, overlap, and corruption conditions is constructed. This method achieves superior performance, with MAE of 0.05, SSIM of 0.95, and PSNR of 36.68 within a 20–30% mask size range, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across diverse image types and size ranges.

This study proposes a novel semi-supervised learning framework, co-teacher-guided pseudo-label supervision (CTGP), to address this challenge. CTGP combines co-training and the Mean-Teacher strategy, where predictions generated by teacher models are filtered and utilized as high-quality pseudo-labels to train the other student models, thus facilitating co-training. Additionally, a medical image-specific augmentation method, MIAugment, is introduced to better adapt to the unique characteristics of medical data. Experiments on a real-life clinical dataset demonstrate that CTGP achieves high segmentation accuracy with minimal labelled data. Using only 10% of labelled data, the framework achieves a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.03% for four tissue types, a decrease of just 2.85% compared to fully supervised learning.

  abstract     = {In the task of 3D visual grounding using monocular RGB images, it is a challenging problem to perceive visual features and accurately predict the localization of 3D objects based on given geometric and appearances descriptions. Traditional text-guided attention-based methods have achieved better results than baselines, but it is argued that there is still potential for improvement in the area of multi-modal fusion. Thus, Mono3DVG-TRv2, an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that employs a visual-text multi-modal encoder for the alignment and fusion of multi-modal features, incorporating an enhanced transformer module proven in 2D detection, is introduced. The depth features predicted by the multi-modal features and the visual-text features are associated with the learnable queries in the decoder, facilitating more efficient and effective acquisition of geometric information in intricate scenes. Following a comprehensive comparison and ablation study on the Mono3DRefer dataset, this method achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing the prior approach.

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial target detection tasks, two main challenges exist: the limited computational resources of UAV terminals, which are not conducive to running complex models, and the prevalence of small targets, which can easily lead to missed detections and false positives. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight and high-accuracy small-object detection algorithm for UAV aerial imagery that is based on YOLOv5s. First, the network structure is optimized by removing the layers in YOLOv5s primarily used for detecting large targets (P4 and P5) and adding layers primarily used for detecting small targets (P2 and P3). This enables the model to focus more on extracting small-object features. A lightweight dynamic convolution is subsequently introduced in the C3 module, and the lightweight LW_C3 and LW_downsampling modules are designed for feature extraction and downsampling operations. This enhances the model&#39;s feature extraction capability while achieving a lightweight design. Finally, the adaptive multi-scale spatial feature fusion (AMSFF) module is designed to adaptively learn the spatial weights of the feature maps at different levels, thereby further strengthening the effective fusion of multi-scale features. Experimental results show that the improved YOLO-Tiny model has higher accuracy and lower complexity, hence validating its excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image super-resolution by addressing issues such as transition smoothing, insufficient high-frequency information, and training instability encountered in regression-based and GAN-based models. However, challenges persist when applying diffusion models to image super-resolution, including randomness, inadequate conditional information, high computational costs, and network architecture complexities. In this article, the authors introduce a diffusion model based on Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE), and propose the use of ENAFBlocks instead of traditional ResBlocks to enhance model performance in noise prediction. The Mean-Reverting SDE effectively mitigates the randomness of the diffusion model by leveraging low-resolution images as means. Additionally, an LR Encoder is introduced to capture hidden information from LR images, providing a more robust condition for stable result generation by the noise predictor. To efficiently handle high-resolution images within limited GPU memory, the method employs adaptive aggregate sampling, which merges overlapping regions smoothly using weighted averaging. Furthermore, color variations are addressed during diffusion model sampling through color correction. Extensive experiments on CelebA, DIV2K, and Urban100 demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models like IDM, with a PSNR improvement of 0.22 dB, FID reduction of 2.35, and LPIPS reduction of 0.05 on the DIV2K dataset, along with a reduced parameter count and faster inference time.},

Most of the previous research on multimodal fusion is single-stage fusion, disregarding how various modality subsets interact, as well as rarely considering relative position relationship of modality sequences, causing the fragmentation of context info. Considering the aforementioned issues, this study introduces an MSA method based on the multi-stage graph fusion network (MSGFN) under random missing modality conditions to improve the robustness of the model to MSA under the random missing modality conditions. Firstly, for each modality, its inter-modal and intra-modal multi-head attention are used to learn robust representation of the modality sequence. Meanwhile, the relative position encoding (RPE) is introduced into mechanism of attention that enables model to perceive and learn the relative position before and after the modality sequence when calculating attention, thereby better understanding the contextual info of the sequence. After that, the transformer encoder receives the learned modality features and uses the pre-trained model to supervise the reconstruction of the missing modality information. Finally, the feature representations of different modalities have effectively fused using multi-stage graph fusion network, and the output is used for the ultimate sentiment classification. Wide experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP, and the findings indicate that the proposed method can better handle the challenges caused by modality fusion and modality missing compared with several baseline methods.},

This approach not only enhances model adaptability but also minimizes maintenance costs. However, the current popular methods are susceptible to the ‘copying shortcut’ phenomenon, which constrains their performance on benchmark datasets. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a multi-class anomaly detection model: UniRD, based on the reverse distillation method. This model creates an image corruptor that expands the dataset and generates ‘normal-corrupt’ image pairs. During the training process, their correspondence is used to optimize the reverse distillation. This process greatly exploits and releases the potential of the student decoder. Furthermore, a teacher feature adaptation module is devised to enhance the compatibility between the pre-trained model and the anomaly detection task. This has the effect of reducing the discrepancy between teacher and student features while ensuring the consistency of normal sample features. The comprehensive evaluation results in two mainstream datasets, MVTec and VisA, and demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits improvement in all indicators compared to benchmark methods. The proposed method attains the state-of-the-art, substantiating its effectiveness and advancement.},

The presence of occlusion in a scene is primarily attributed to variations in viewpoint and access time, thereby posing a significant challenge in accurately predicting scene flow. In the endeavour to mitigate this issue, the focus is on the propagation of scene flow originating from non-occluded points towards occlusion points while concurrently estimating the occlusion map.

Image classified as normal by CNN-J is not processed, while the classified noisy image is denoised. In the denoising process, a marking image and a rough denoised image are generated by CNN for noise mask (CNN-M) and CNN for denoising (CNN-D), respectively. Subsequently, the refined denoised image is output using the proposed refining mechanism. The middle layers of CNN-M and CNN-D are constructed by depth-separable CNN to reduce the network complexity. Experimental results show that the misjudging rate of CNN-M marking is reduced by 19.94% compared with the best existing marking method. Compared with the traditional methods, the peak signal to noise ratio of the proposed method is increased by 2.95% and the information loss is reduced by 21.46%. In addition, the computational complexity is at least 11.18% lower than that of the traditional CNN. Finally, the display of salt-and-pepper denoised images on the flexible AMOLED is realized.},

The model introduces MoE-SM, an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to replace the Feed-Forward inside all Transformer block. MoE-SM is designed with Smart-Merger, and new layer for merging the output of individual experts, and with a new way to split the work between experts, defining a new per-example strategy instead of the commonly used per-token one. Furthermore, it is analyzed how positional encodings interact with each other, demonstrating that per-channel bias and per-head bias can positively cooperate.

  abstract     = {It is well known that image quality needs to be measured with human perception in many computer vision applications. However, these approaches are expensive and require more time for image quality analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and computationally efficient objective-mathematical model based on statistical perceptual features. The structural and textural features are computed using the modified regularized heaviside local binary pattern (RH-LBP) approach and the concept of entropy. The higher-order probability coefficients of images are considered to extract features that are highly correlated to the human visual system features. Further, the additivity property of Renyi entropy is used to show the randomness of the information combining two terms: One extracts the images spatial intensity changes, and therefore their texture qualities, and the other attain structural details. The features in the proposed approach are jointly optimized to achieve better robustness, monotonicity and match human assessments on image quality, while minimizing the computational complexity and run time. Experiments are conducted with three synthetically distorted datasets, KonIQ-10K, BIQ2021, and LIVE (wild), and two intentionally distorted datasets, TID2013 and CSIQ and are used to evaluate performance index. The proposed method offers competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {To help farmers manage limited resources, rice disease diagnosis must be accurate, timely, and affordable. This study addresses challenges in rice field images, such as environmental variability and differences in rice leaf sizes. The proposed technique combines convolutional neural network object detection with image tiling, using estimated rice leaf width as a reference for image division. An 18-layer ResNet model was trained using ground truth leaf width values for regression in leaf width estimation. Experiments used a dataset of 4960 images representing 8 rice diseases. The leaf width prediction model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 11.18% and was used to generate a tiled dataset for training advanced rice disease detection models. The tiling technique was evaluated using YOLOv4, YOLOv8n, YOLOv8l, DINO-5scale Swin-L, and Co-DINO-5scale Swin-L models by comparing detection performance on original and tiled datasets. Mean average precision improved significantly: YOLOv4 increased from 87.56% to91.14%, YOLOv8n from 89.80% to 91.70%, and YOLOv8l from 89.80% to 93.20%. More advanced models, such as DINO5scale Swin-L and Co-DINO-5scale Swin-L, achieved even higher precision, at 93.40% and 94.20%, respectively. In conclusion, the tiling technique improved detection efficiency and addressed object size variability, enhancing rice disease detection accuracy inreal-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The detection of road potholes plays a crucial role in ensuring passenger comfort and the structural safety of vehicles. To address the challenges of pothole detection in complex road environments, this paper proposes a model focusing on shape features (pothole detection you only look once, PD-YOLO). The model aims to overcome the limitations of multi-scale feature learning caused by the use of fixed convolutional kernels in the baseline model, by constructing a feature extraction module that better adapts to variations in the shape of potholes. Subsequently, a cross-stage partial network was designed using a one-time aggregation method, simplifying the model while enabling the network to fuse information between feature maps at different stages. Additionally, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism is introduced to select relevant features, reducing redundancy and suppressing background noise. Experiments conducted on the VOC2007 and GRDDC2020_Pothole datasets reveal that compared to the baseline model YOLOv8, PD-YOLO achieves improvements of 3.9% and 2.8% in mean average precision, with a frame rate of approximately 290 frames per second, effectively meeting the accuracy and real-time requirements for pothole detection.

First, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) with geometric transformations is designed, which uses rotated labels as supervision to obtain lower-level characteristics that more accurately capture various orientations and then makes use of a spectral-spatial characteristic extraction network to maximize the utilization of HSI&#39;s spectrum and spatial information. Next, a class anchor open-set classification module based on a twin clustering network is designed, which uses SCL and FSL to extract more specific personal information by mining the category-invariant characteristics present in the known versus unknown class data. Finally, multiple convolution and open-set recognition (OSC) is performed on the feature blocks. Experimental results on three classical HSI datasets show that FSSCL-OSC provides a significant improvement over existing methods, under a sample size of only 10%, the overall accuracy reached 82.38%, 90.76% and 84.70%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Compared with common urban landscape semantic segmentation, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image semantic segmentation is more challenging because small targets have very low pixel percentages and multi-scale features due to the influence of flight altitude. Yet, the commonly used successive grid downsampling strategy in the current transformer-based methods omits some important features of small targets. Furthermore, due to the complex background interference, it can lead to even worse results. In reaction to this, existing strategies aim to maintain superior resolution. Nevertheless, the application of this method incurs considerable computational costs, which brings challenges for the practical applications of UAVs. So it is significant to design a novel framework to balance retaining more pixels representing small objects during downsampling and reducing computational costs. For this, the Channel Selection and the Local Attention Transformer Model (CSLFormer) are proposed. During the overlap patch embedding process of feature maps, the model allocates half of the important channels to global attention and local attention. These two types of attention focus on different aspects: one learns the relationships and importance among various patches, while the other emphasizes the features of individual patches. The method shows superior performance on two public datasets: AeroScapes and Vaihingen, achieving mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 75.57% and 78.93%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Fisheye cameras are widely used in surveillance, automotive systems, virtual reality, and panoramic photography due to their wide-angle perspective. However, images captured by fisheye cameras suffer from significant geometric distortions, affecting image analysis and understanding. This distortion bends straight lines into curves, resulting in a barrel-shaped appearance of the image. To mitigate these effects and transform fisheye images into a regular perspective, fisheye image correction is necessary, enabling more accurate and reliable performance in applications like object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and visual navigation. While convolutional neural networks based fisheye image correction has progressed, it has not fully utilized the global distribution and local symmetry of distortions due to the limitations of fixed receptive fields. This paper introduces a new model based on the Swin Transformer that effectively utilizes both global and local distortion features to adapt automatically to fisheye lens distortions. It also incorporates image restoration functionality to enhance texture details in the corrected images.

To advance towards an autonomous model for detailed polyp segmentation, the authors propose a new framework for polyp segmentation called U-shaped cross-fusion network with attention mechanism (UCFA-Net), which employs a pyramid vision transformer as encoder to extract image features at multiple scales. Furthermore, the multi-scale cross-fusion module cross-fuses the different scale features and then goes through the multi-scale convolutional parallel feedforward transformer module for modelling the global and local information. Finally, progressive attentional up-sampling module acts as a decoder for up-sampling with progressive attention to get the final polyp segmentation result.

Ultrasound imaging is often the initial diagnostic test for gallbladder cancer, making the enhancement of cancer detection accuracy from these images crucial. Despite the promising results of artificial intelligence techniques in disease diagnosis, their black-box nature hinders the reliability of their results and their practical application. Therefore, it is essential not to rely solely on a single model&#39;s output and to further investigate for more reliable outcomes. This study presents a step-by-step structural investigation of forming an end-to-end model, a conjunction of two convolutional neural network based methods, for detecting gallbladder conditions. The final model, leveraging feature fusions and hierarchical classification, achieved a high accuracy of 92.62% for detecting normal, benign, and malignant gallbladders. It also achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.36% for classifying normal and non-normal instances and 92.22% for classifying benign and malignant cases. Finally, comprehensive post-processing investigations, including cross-validation, temperature scaling, and uncertainty estimation, along with error analysis, are conducted to gain more insights into the model&#39;s output. Among these insights, the model demonstrated resilience of its results to active dropout and augmentation at the inference phase. Furthermore, when applied with test-time data augmentation, uncertainty estimation methods have better distinguishability between the uncertainties of correctly and incorrectly classified instances, which provides additional information about the model&#39;s output.

The authors aim to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to learn mitochondrial morphological features. The approach begins with self-supervised learning from a vast set of unlabeled images through masked image modeling. This technique involves presenting images with randomly masked patches, prompting the model to predict the content of these masked areas. By doing so, the model learns the distinctive features of mitochondria. In the subsequent phase, the trained encoder is transferred to the segmentation task, replacing the original reconstruction decoder with the Segformer segmentation decoder. The model is then fine-tuned using a small labeled dataset. By reconstructing mitochondria in the masked regions, the model learns features more effectively on unlabeled samples, and improves segmentation performance even with limited labeled data. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing an 11.8% improvement in Intersection over Union metrics compared to existing fluorescence mitochondrial segmentation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis of brain tumors significantly enhances treatment success. However, accurate detection and segmentation of tumors, essential for diagnosis, rely heavily on costly manual annotation by experts. To mitigate these costs, weakly supervised methods have gained traction. This paper introduces a novel weakly supervised brain tumor segmentation approach utilizing point and scribble supervision. Experts annotate only the slice with the largest tumor area by marking a single point near the tumor center or drawing a scribble within the tumor region. The method operates in two phases. First, labels are propagated to unlabelled pixels, generating a pseudo-ground-truth with three labels: tumor, non-tumor, and marginal pixels (unlabelled pixels surrounding the initial segmentation). Second, a segmentation model is trained using the pseudo-ground-truth and a loss function combining level-set and binary cross-entropy losses. Marginal pixels contribute to level-set loss computation, refining the segmentation process. The approach is validated on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes from BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show Dice scores comparable to fully supervised methods for whole tumor segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed weakly supervised strategy. This method reduces annotation effort while maintaining competitive segmentation performance, making it valuable for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {In deep neural networks, performance can degrade when test data distributions differ from training data. Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) aims to improve generalization across unseen domains by leveraging multiple source domains without supervision. Traditional methods focus on extracting domain-invariant features, potentially at the expense of feature space integrity and generalization potential. We presents a Multi-Domain Representation Network (MDRN) for unsupervised multi-domain learning. MDRN innovates by disentangling and preserving both domain-invariant and domain-specific features through an unsupervised cross-domain reconstruction task. It employs content encoders for domain-invariant features and multi-domain style encoders for domain-specific characteristics. By merging these features based on domain similarity, MDRN constructs a comprehensive feature space that enhances image reconstruction across domains. Additionally, MDRN integrates domain-specific classifiers, which learn domain classification and provide weighted fusion of domain-specific features. This design facilitates effective inter-domain distance measurement and feature integration. Experiments on PACS and DomainNet show MDRN&#39;s superior performance over existing state-of-the-art UDG approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in handling distribution shifts between source and target domains.},

Major tasks while building such models require an understanding of the characteristic features associated with the disease, patient-to-patient variations and changes associated with disease severity. In this work, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model with customized bottleneck residual module (Attn-CNN) is proposed for classifying CT images into three classes: COVID-19, normal, and other pneumonia. The efficacy of the model is evaluated by carrying out various experiments, such as effect of class imbalance, impact of attention module, generalizability of the model and providing visualization of model&#39;s prediction for the interpretability of results. Comparative performance evaluation with five state-of-the-art deep architectures such as MobileNet, EfficientNet-B7, Inceptionv3, ResNet-50 and VGG-16, and with published models such as COVIDNet-CT, COVNet, COVID-Net CT2, etc. is discussed.},

There are a large number of face recognition and face attribute recognition scenarios in reality, and the industry commonly decomposes these tasks, with three models responsible for handling face detection, face recognition, and face attribute recognition. The multi-model approach requires a lot of computational resources for context switching, while training one model with one dataset is not only complex, but also leads to overfitting of the multi-model approach. The authors propose a single-model multi-task approach, which can complete all tasks using only one model, and thus obtains a great improvement in inference speed, especially in scenes with high face density. After an experimental comparison, our approach saves a maximum of 96% of inference time, 49.5% of memory usage, and 59.7% of CPU time, avoids frequent context switching, and simplifies the training steps while improving the generalization performance of the model.},

Therefore, based on the third-order zigzag displacement field and a layer-spring model, a four-node quadrilateral quasi-conforming plate element (QCQ4) is proposed to calculate the free vibration of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection. In addition, combined with the numerical results from other literature, it is verified that the proposed plate element (QCQ4) can effectively obtain the stress and deflection of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection, and accurately calculate the free vibration of laminates with different geometries, thicknesses and fiber directions. Furthermore, numerical results show that when the dimensionless interface parameter R characterizing the interfacial imperfection increases from 0.0 to 1.0 and 5.0, respectively, the maximum reduction in the natural frequency of the laminated thick and thin plates in the first six modes exceeds 33% and 37%. This means that and seem to be two critical values for evaluating whether thick and thin laminates will experience a significant decrease in stiffness due to interfacial imperfection. Besides, it is also found that as the increase of the dimensionless interface parameter R , the 4th and 5th mode shapes of the square and circular laminate, and the 5th and 6th mode shapes of the triangular laminate will change compared with the mode shapes of laminates without interfacial imperfection.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the optimal control of constrained mechanical systems, with potential additional kinematic constraints at the final time. Correspondingly, the equations of motion of the underlying mechanical system assume the form of differential-algebraic equations with end constraints. The proposed discretisation of the optimality conditions yields a scheme which is capable of preserving control angular momentum maps resulting from the rotational symmetry of the underlying optimal control problem. The numerical solution of the discretised system is first tested with two solution strategies: Monolithic and staggered approaches, and then also solved with hybrid approaches, which combine salient features of each individual strategy. The monolithic strategy solves all the optimality conditions for all time steps as a single system of non-linear equations and relies on a Newton-Raphson scheme, which guarantees quadratic rates of convergence in the vicinity of the optimal solution trajectory. The staggered strategy is based on the Forward-Backward Sweep Method (FBSM), where state and adjoint equations are solved separately, and the control equations provide an update of the control variables, which we here achieve with also a Newton-Raphson scheme. The proposed hybrid strategies combine the advantages of a conventional gradient-based FBSM with the individual Newton-based solution procedures once the solution is close to the optimal trajectory. The strategies are developed and compared through three representative numerical examples, which show that all schemes yield very similar solutions. However, the hybrid approaches become more advantageous in the computation time when the time-step decreases or the size of the problem increases.},

However, the significant computational demands still pose challenges, particularly in dynamic simulations. To mitigate these challenges, we present a newly devised asynchronous variational integrator (AVI) for phase field modeling of dynamic fracture, implemented within the framework of the finite element library FEniCS. The AVI allows each spatial mesh element to progress independently with its own characteristic time step. In the new approach, displacement updates occur as usual at each time step, while the phase field is globally solved after the displacement update of the largest spatial mesh element rather than after each time step. Benchmark problems are investigated to assess the performance and reliability of the new method, revealing notable computational savings while effectively capturing intricate dynamic fracture behavior.},

  abstract     = {The process of elastic deformation is performed using the radial basis functions (RBF) method for the background mesh and the volume-weighted interpolation method for the computational mesh. The RBF method performs interpolation independently in different directions and does not ensure boundary orthogonality during elastic deformation. This study proposes a strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of the dynamic mesh method. Based on the automatically generated adaptive background mesh, a reference displacement method for spatial points is first developed to obtain reasonable reference displacements with rotational correction for spatial control points. The RBF is then used to interpolate the rotation angle of the boundary represented by the quaternion. Therefore, the large angle deformation can be more smoothly propagated to the spatial region. In the background mesh, the translational deformation is obtained by the damping function based on the minimum distance, the rotational deformation is calculated by rotating around a small number of nodes with the minimum distance from the wall surface, and the final rotational displacement is obtained by inverse distance weighting. This method ensures boundary orthogonality. Afterwards, the one-step reference displacement method is developed. A subset of mesh nodes on the boundary surface and one layer outside the boundary are automatically selected using a greedy algorithm and considered as control points. The spatial point is assigned a value using a reference displacement. The deformation displacement of the background mesh is calculated using the RBF method, and then interpolated into the computational grid. The obtained results show that this method can significantly improve the orthogonality of the boundary layer and retain the high accuracy of the RBF method for elastic deformation. In addition, a two-step spatial multi-point selection method is developed. Using a spatial peak selection method of high flexibility based on the quality change before and after mesh deformation, multiple spatial points are selected and considered as control points at a time, which allows for increased stability and robustness of the dynamic mesh method for the one-step reference displacement method. The deformation ability of the two-step spatial multi-point selection method is increased by 20% compared with that of the one-step reference displacement method in a single deformation step. The criterion for point selection is general, and the algorithm has high efficiency, which allows spatial control points to be selected in multiple regions. The two-step spatial multi-point selection method provides a smooth mesh, stretching the overlapped and squeezed mesh. The CPU cost is comparable to the RBF, and iteration is not required. The time complexity of the proposed multiple point selection method is reduced to 2/(M + 1) times that of the single-point selection method, which adds one spatial point at a time until M points are added. Several typical examples show that the proposed methods improve the mesh quality by about 30% for two-dimensional flow and 17% for three-dimensional flow while ensuring the computational efficiency.},

We obtained the difference value in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form as the output of learning using the factorization machine. The QUBO form difference was subjected to the original Hamiltonian as the correction term. The performance of this correction term was evaluated by calculating the energy for a equilibrium state of diblock copolymer. In phase-field analysis, the time evolution equation is formulated so that the total free energy decreases; hence, a lower the free energy means a more accurate result close to that of a conventional method.

  abstract     = {Finite periodic layout for multicomponent systems signifies a compelling design strategy for constructing complex larger structures through assembling repeating representative unit-cells with various orientations. In addition to better transportability, handleability and replaceability, design with structural segmentation has been considered particularly valuable for additive manufacturing of large workpiece due to limited printing dimension of machine. However, existing design optimization of periodic structures has been largely restricted to simple translational placements of unit-cells, sophisticated tessellation with differently oriented topological unit-cells remains underexplored. This paper presents an efficient and adaptable topology optimization framework for concurrently optimizing periodic structures comprised of repeating topological unit-cells and their tailored orientations. By introducing a weighting factor associated with different orientation states of unit-cells, a dominant orientation for each unit-cell can gradually emerge in the course of optimization process. The proposed procedure combines the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model for topology optimization of unit-cell and the discrete material optimization (DMO) technique for the optimization of its orientation. The optimization objective is to minimize structural compliance subject to volume fraction constraint. Through sensitivity analysis, optimality criteria can be applied to simultaneously optimize a representative unit-cell (RUC) topology and the orientation weighting factors in the periodic macrostructure. Several 2D and 3D examples are investigated to demonstrate significant enhancement in compliance reduction of up to 34% compared to conventional periodic design without orientation optimization. This represents a notable improvement in finite periodic structural optimization, particularly leveraging the topology optimization to tailor unit-cell orientation rather than relying on brute-force search approaches. Our methodology paves a new avenue for designing more efficient and readily manufacturable lightweight structures with enhanced performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {During topology optimization with design-dependent boundary load, updating the load conditions is necessary. However, it is challenging to identify the load-carrying boundary in density-based topology optimization frame. To address this issue, a direct load-carrying boundary identification method is proposed to describe and update the design-dependent boundary load, and a topology optimization method for structures with design-dependent boundary load is presented. First, a Flood Fill algorithm (FFA) based domain extension method is introduced to generate a new structure with a boundary equivalent to the load-carrying boundary of the original structure. Then, the erosion boundary identification method is applied to the new structure to identify the load-carrying boundary instead of the original structure. Finally, the load information (direction and magnitude) of the design-dependent boundary load is determined using a normalized gradient algorithm, which completes the update of the design-dependent boundary load. This method overcomes the difficulty of identifying the load-carrying boundary in density-based methods. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by several examples of minimum compliance (including 3D) and flexible mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {We establish a surrogate model for computational homogenization of composite materials consisting of multiple viscoelastic constituents. A surrogate macroscopic material is identified by performing interpolation using radial basis functions (RBFs) and cubic spline functions on a constitutive database generated by a series of microscopic analyses or, equivalently, numerical material tests (NMTs) on a unit cell to represent anisotropic stress relaxation behavior as well as its dependence on strain rate and temperature. After briefly reviewing the two-scale boundary value problem derived based on homogenization theory, an RBF interpolation with a normalized kernel is formulated for a discrete dataset, and an optimization algorithm is applied to determine the three hyperparameters so as to achieve proper interpolation. Then, we formulate the surrogate homogenization model (SHM) using the interpolants to substitute for the macroscopic viscoelastic response. To show the specific procedure of the proposed surrogate modeling and demonstrate the performance of the created SHM, a representative numerical example is presented in the offline and online stages. In the offline stage, NMTs are carried out in the space of training data, including the temperature, to generate a dataset as long as the macroscopic stresses can be learned exhaustively, and then optimization is performed to determine the set of hyperparameters. Then, to validate the created SHM, its responses to unseen loading and temperature histories are compared with the corresponding NMT results. In the online stage, the created SHM is used to carry out a macroscopic analysis of a simple structure under specific loading and temperature conditions, and subsequently, the obtained macroscopic stresses are compared with those obtained from the localization analysis results. The results are also compared with those obtained from the single-scale direct numerical analyses.},

In the field of topology optimization, this requires the coupling of modern optimization methods with solvers capable of handling arbitrary problems. In this work, a topology optimization method for general multiphysics problems is presented. We leverage a convolutional neural parameterization of a level set for a description of the geometry and use this in an unfitted finite element method that is differentiable with respect to the level set everywhere in the domain. We construct the parameter to objective map in such a way that the gradient can be computed entirely by automatic differentiation at roughly the cost of an objective function evaluation. Without handcrafted initializations, the method produces regular topologies close to the optimal solution for standard benchmark problems whilst maintaining the ability to solve a more general class of problems than standard methods, for example, interface-coupled multiphysics.},

  abstract     = {Slender structures, such as rods, often exhibit large deformations even under moderate external forces (e.g., gravity). This characteristic results in a rich variety of morphological changes, making them appealing for engineering design and applications, such as soft robots, submarine cables, decorative knots, and more. Prior studies have demonstrated that the natural shape of a rod significantly influences its deformed geometry. Consequently, the natural shape of the rod should be considered when manufacturing and designing rod-like structures. Here, we focus on an inverse problem: Can we determine the natural shape of a suspended 2D planar rod so that it deforms into a desired target shape under the specified loading? We begin by formulating a theoretical framework based on the statics of planar rod equilibrium that can compute the natural shape of a planar rod given its target shape. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of uncertainties (e.g., noise in the data) on the accuracy of the theoretical framework. The results reveal the shortcomings of the theoretical framework in handling uncertainties in the inverse problem, a fact often overlooked in previous works. To mitigate the influence of the uncertainties, we combine the statics of the planar rod with the adjoint method for parameter sensitivity analysis, constructing a learning framework that can efficiently explore the natural shape of the designed rod with enhanced robustness. This framework is validated numerically for its accuracy and robustness, offering valuable insights into the inverse design of soft structures for various applications, including soft robotics and animation of morphing structures.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel framework for solving large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization problems. While most previous studies on fluid topology optimization assume steady-state flows, an increasing number of recent studies deal with unsteady flows, which are more general in engineering. However, unsteady flow topology optimization involves solving the governing and adjoint equations of a time-evolving system, which requires a significant computational cost for topology optimization with a fine mesh. Therefore, we propose a large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization based on the building-cube method (BCM), which is one of the hierarchical Cartesian mesh methods. Although the BCM has been confirmed to have excellent scalability and is suitable for massively parallel computing, there are no studies that have applied it to unsteady flow topology optimization. In the proposed method, the governing and adjoint equations are discretized by a cell-centered finite volume method based on the BCM, which can achieve high parallel efficiency even with a fine mesh. The effectiveness of the proposed method for large-scale computing is discussed through several examples of optimization and verification of computational efficiency by weak scaling.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) is widely used to analyse coupled (solid-water) problems under large deformations/displacements. However, if not addressed carefully, MPM u-p formulations for poromechanics can be affected by two major sources of instability. Firstly, inf-sup condition violation can arise when the spaces for the displacement and pressure fields are not chosen correctly, resulting in an unstable pressure field when the equations are monolithically solved. Secondly, the intrinsic nature of particle-based discretisation makes the MPM an unfitted mesh-based method, which can affect the system&#39;s condition number and solvability, particularly when background mesh elements are poorly populated. This work proposes a solution to both problems. The inf-sup condition is avoided using two overlapping meshes, a coarser one for the pressure and a finer one for the displacement. This approach does not require stabilisation of the primary equations since it is stable by design and is particularly valuable for low-order shape functions. As for the system&#39;s poor condition number, a face ghost penalisation method is added to both the primary equations, which constitutes a novelty in the context of MPM mixed formulations. This study frequently makes use of the theories of functional analysis or the unfitted Finite Element Method (FEM). Although these theories may not directly apply to the MPM, they provide a robust and logical basis for the research. These rationales are further supported by four numerical examples, which encompass both elastic and elasto-plastic cases and drained and undrained conditions.},

We found that DFT calculations with different functionals underestimate TAMRA maximum UV absorption peak by ~100 nm, resulting in the maximum at ca. 450 nm instead of the experimental value of ca. 550 nm. However, incorporating MD simulation snapshots of TAMRA in water, the UV maximum peak shifts and is in close agreement with the experimental results due to the rotation of TAMRA N(CH 3 ) 2 groups, effectively captured in MD simulations.

For cyclazine, VEEs and vertical gaps from ADC(2) or TD-DFT are spread over a narrow range (&lt; 0.064 eV) whether the S 0 structure is optimized with various DFT, CCSD, and RI-MP2 methods. However, for asymmetric cyclazines, depending on the protocol for optimizing S 0 structures, not only are VEEs spread over a substantially wider range (up to 0.75 eV) but so are vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps (up to 0.30 eV), leading to cases where, with different S 0 structures, one obtains positive vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps or significantly negative gaps. We relate this behavior to the introduction of significant asymmetry and bond-length variations in the cyclazine derivatives, formed by ligand functionalization or modification of the cyclazine core. On a more positive note, adiabatic EEs (AEEs) and adiabatic ΔE S1T1 gaps display significantly lower sensitivity (7–30× less) to the geometry optimization protocols than their vertical analogs. Crucially, for cyclazine, the M06-HF functional with 100% non-local exchange provides the closest S 0 geometry to available CCSD(T) data. We show that this effect exists also for other frameworks (e.g., azulene, pentaazaphenalene, and non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons) that have been considered for the INVEST property, with VEEs spread over a broader range of up to 1.19 eV and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps over a range of 0.62 eV. For INVEST emitters, it is therefore extremely important to judiciously choose the computational protocol for optimizing ground state geometries, in computing VEEs and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps.},

  abstract     = {Cytochrome c nitrite reductase (CcNiR) activates nitrite and produces ammonia. It is one of several enzymes that use a redox-active cofactor to perform its reaction. In this case, the cofactor has a heme with a lysine as the proximal ligand and a charged nearby arginine. The role of a tyrosine, which is also close, has been less clear. There are also four bis-histidine-ligated hemes involved in the electron transfers. CcNiR has been studied before, using essentially the same methods as here. However, the mechanism is very complicated, involving six reductions, and quite different results for the mechanism have been obtained here. For example, the tyrosine has here been found to be redox active in the final step when ammonia is produced. Also, the arginine has here been found to stay protonated throughout the mechanism, which is different from what was found in the previous study. The present results are in very good agreement with experimental findings and are, therefore, another case where the methodology has been shown to work very well. Previous examples include Photosystem II and Nitrogenase, normally considered to be the most important enzymes in nature for the development of life.},

  abstract     = {The band center of d orbitals ( d -band center) has been widely used as an effective descriptor for analyzing material properties. However, in high-entropy nanoalloys, the diverse atomic environments present challenges in systematically exploring all possible combinations. Due to computational resource limitations, generating a sufficient number of samples is infeasible. Consequently, the d -band center should be treated as a response variable in machine-learning models. We calculated the d -band center for individual atoms and applied supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing its behavior. While several factors were identified, their physical significance in predicting d -band centers remained unclear. To address this issue, we incorporated various interatomic distance terms as descriptors, along with element-based coordination numbers (ECN). The resulting model closely resembled the overlap integral of the Slater-type orbital, and the regression coefficients of the ECN exhibited sensitivity to the effective principal quantum number and nuclear charge. Understanding the physical significance of these descriptors is crucial for improving property predictions and facilitating data collection on novel materials.},

A strict conceptual distinction between cause and effect is recommended.

The dataset, containing 300 randomly selected elementary gas-phase reactions, was assembled using accurate DFT (ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP) values for activation energies E a from a database alongside semi-empirical computations. For accurate predictions, this approach required the inclusion of both physical organic and geometric/empirical descriptors in the training procedure. The best two ML models demonstrated efficient E a prediction capability, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.314 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.992 (Model 3) and (MAE) of 1.949 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.979 (Model 2) in validation tests. Notably, this performance approaches the threshold of “chemical accuracy” of 1 kcal mol −1 .

The focus is on proton affinity predictions to assess the influences of computational parameters. NEO-DFT incorporates nuclear quantum effects for protons involved in protonation processes. Using a test set of 72 molecules with experimental proton affinities as reference, we evaluated various exchange-correlation functionals, finding that B3LYP-based functionals deliver the most accurate results. Among the tested functionals, CAM-B3LYP performs the best with an MAD value of 6.2 kJ/mol with respect to experimental data. In NEO-DFT, electron-proton correlation (epc) functionals were assessed, with LDA-type epc17-2 yielding comparable results to the GGA-type epc19 functional. Compared to traditional DFT (MAD value of 31.6 kJ/mol), which treats nuclei classically, NEO-DFT provides enhanced accuracy for proton affinities when electron-proton correlation is included. Regarding basis sets, the def2-QZVP electronic basis set achieved the highest accuracy with an MAD value of 5.0 kJ/mol, though at a higher computational cost compared to def2-TZVP and def2-SVP, while nuclear basis sets showed minimal impact on proton affinity accuracy and no consistent trend. Overall, this study demonstrates NEO-DFT&#39;s efficacy in addressing nuclear quantum effects for proton affinity predictions, providing guidance on optimal parameter selection for future NEO-DFT applications.},

This work introduces the X2-PEC method, that is, the second generalization of the X1 series of ANN methods developed in our group, utilizing pair energy correction (PEC). The essence of the X2 model lies in its feature vector construction, using overlap integrals and core Hamiltonian integrals to incorporate physical and chemical information into the feature vectors to describe atomic interactions. It aims to enhance the accuracy of low-rung density functional theory (DFT) calculations, such as those from the widely used BLYP/6-31G(d) or B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) methods, to the level of top-rung DFT calculations, such as those from the highly accurate doubly hybrid XYGJ-OS/GTLarge method. Trained on the QM9 dataset, X2-PEC excels in predicting the atomization energies of isomers such as C 6 H 8 and C 4 H 4 N 2 O with varying bonding structures. The performance of the X2-PEC model on standard enthalpies of formation for datasets such as G2-HCNOF, PSH36, ALKANE28, BIGMOL20, and HEDM45, as well as a HCNOF subset of BH9 for reaction barriers, is equally commendable, demonstrating its good generalization ability and predictive accuracy, as well as its potential for further development to achieve greater accuracy. These outcomes highlight the practical significance of the X2-PEC model in elevating the results from lower-rung DFT calculations to the level of higher-rung DFT calculations through deep learning.},

The study consisted of evaluating the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) performance of HABT, in spectroscopic terms, when interacting with the PI3K enzyme in a local nonequilibrium regime. This scenario could be considered by investigating the metastable states of HABT in this system. From this, it was possible to observe that the ESIPT performance of HABT considerably differs when comparing the solution and protein environments, where 63% have appropriate geometry in the protein environment, against 97% in the aqueous environment. Thus, from an entirely theoretical methodology, the present work provides insights when modeling biological systems and contributes significantly to a better comprehension of promising probes for cancer diagnosis.},

Starting molecular orbitals were either localized using the Pipek-Mezey procedure or via an incomplete Cholesky decomposition of the density matrix. The Hartree-Fock solution was obtained within a VCCS iterative procedure, with the starting localized molecular orbitals used for the creation of the reference and the singly excited determinants. The same localized basis was kept in each iteration. For a series of medium-sized molecules, we have investigated the convergence behavior of the iterative procedure together with the sparsity of the single-excitation amplitude vector and the corresponding density matrix expressed in the localized basis.},

However, their physical meaning remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. It is the purpose of this work to shed new light on this issue. The main thesis developed here is that de-excitations are not a peculiarity of TDDFT but that they are a more fundamental property of the underlying wave functions reflecting how electrons are excited between partially occupied orbitals. The paraquinodimethane (pQDM) molecule is chosen as a convenient model system whose open-shell character can be modulated via twisting of its methylene groups. Using the one-electron transition density matrix as a rigorous basis for our analysis, we highlight qualitative and quantitative parallels in the way that de-excitations are reflected in multireference wave function and TDDFT computations. As a physically observable consequence, we highlight a lowering of the transition dipole moment that derives from destructive interference between the excitation and de-excitation contributions. In summary, we hope that this work will shed new light on formal and practical aspects regarding the application of TDDFT to excited-state computations, especially of diradicaloid systems.},

In 1990, a paper was published in which the physical causes for the rotational barrier in ethane, that is, the well-known finding that the potential energy in the eclipsed form is slightly higher than in the staggered form, appears as a consequence of a lowering of the nuclear-electron attraction and not as a greater electronic repulsion in the eclipsed form. Surprisingly, this finding has practically not found its way neither into the textbook literature nor into the scientific discourse. Here we will show, by a careful analysis of the components to the total energy and their dependence on the geometry of the molecule, that the kinetic energy of the electrons and the virial theorem play the decisive role.

  abstract     = {The production rate of hydrogen from formic acid on palladium is enhanced in the presence of an Au nanorod by irradiating the system at its plasmon frequency. Taking inspiration from this, we study here the effect of the shape of the Pd cluster (from Pd(111)) on the photoinduced charge injection into the HCOO moiety and adsorbed H, which are the reaction intermediates of the dehydrogenation of formic acid, upon irradiation with a pulse with a carrier frequency equal to the plasmon resonance of a (not included) Au nanorod. We simulate the electron/hole dynamics at frozen nuclei by propagating the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the space of time-dependent density-functional-theory pseudo-eigenstates in the tight-binding approximation. We have taken into account a cluster with two layers of Pd and and atoms per layer (2L3 and 2L4, respectively) or with three layers and atoms per layer (3L3). For all the systems, a net negative charge on HCOO has been found, according to a photoinduced direct charge-transfer mechanism. For 3L3, an indirect charge-transfer mechanism, occurring after 50 fs and inducing a hole injection into HCOO, has also been found. Moreover, we also used a tailored pulse to populate the antibonding molecular orbital localized on the C-H bond for 3L3.},

  abstract     = {Ladderenes, unique polymers composed of fused cyclobutane rings, exhibit promising properties for energy storage applications, including reversible redox behavior and structural tunability. This density functional theory (DFT) study investigates the formation of ladderenes via gold(I)-catalyzed alkyne-alkene coupling reactions. Our calculations reveal a step-wise chain propagation mechanism where the alkene product of each step reacts with a ligand-gold-alkyne complex, leading to the sequential addition of cyclobutene units. We demonstrate that electron-withdrawing substituents on the alkynes, such as chlorine, facilitate the dissociation of the gold catalyst (PMe 3 Au + ) from the cyclobutene adduct, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Solvent effects are also shown to significantly influence the reaction energetics. This finding highlights the significant impact of alkyne substitution on the catalytic cycle. The inherent exothermicity of ladderene formation, coupled with their unique structural features, suggests their potential for storing energy in the form of “covalently condensed acetylene”.},

Photostatins (PSTs) are photoswitchable analogs of combretastatin A-4 (CA4), designed to inhibit tubulin polymerization for cancer treatment. However, the influence of substituents and molecular environments on their photochemistry remains unclear. In this work, the cis -to- trans photodynamics of five PSTs (PST1 to PST5) in the vacuum and aqueous solution were simulated using the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) coupled with correlated multireference electronic structure calculations. Four distinct minima in the same conical intersection seam were discovered, serving as nonradiative decay channels. The aqueous environment slows photoisomerization and lowers its quantum yields and changes the structures near the conical intersection seam. Substituent position and electronegativity significantly impact the isomerization kinetics by altering energy gaps between MECIs and the S 1 state at the Franck-Condon region. These findings provide useful insights into designing next-generation phototherapeutics for cancer.},

The latter is achieved by stable embedding of meta-information into output files and by improving the mutual compatibility of molecular representations (e.g., aromaticity perception). ParaLig wraps around core functionalities provided by a variety of existing software: the two popular cheminformatics packages OpenBabel and RDKit, and the general force field providers CGenFF and AmberTools. Our workflows emphasize scalable bulk processing of large libraries of molecules, and we provide an MPI-based wrapper to simplify deployment to high-performance computing resources.

Theoretical approaches have also been developed to predict B-factor values, which reflect protein flexibility. Previous models have made significant strides in analyzing B-factors by fitting experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for B-factor prediction using differential geometry theory, based on the assumption that the intrinsic properties of proteins reside on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional space of protein structures. By analyzing the mean and Gaussian curvatures of a set of low-dimensional manifolds defined by kernel functions, we develop effective and robust multiscale differential geometry (mDG) models. Our mDG model demonstrates a 27% increase in accuracy compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, by incorporating both global and local protein features, we construct a highly effective machine-learning model for the blind prediction of B-factors. Extensive least-squares approximations and machine learning-based blind predictions validate the effectiveness of the mDG modeling approach for B-factor predictions.},

We have first deduced the missing interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system within the SPICA/SDK CG force-field (CG-FF). By monitoring the electron density profiles, the orientational order parameter, and reproducing the all-atom MD-derived free energy for the insertion of ethanol from the bulk aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core of the POPC-CHOL lipid bilayer, we successfully determined all the missing non-bonding interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system. The proposed force field was applied to investigate the effect of ethanol at various concentrations on unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC and cholesterol. It was found that 40 mol% or more concentration of ethanol is required to disintegrate or rupture the POPC-CHOL vesicle membranes. While cholesterol offers some resilience against the detrimental effects of ethanol, we still observe an increase in vesicle size (swelling) and a contraction in the bilayer thickness (thinning) as ethanol concentration rises from 0 to 30 mol%. At ethanol concentrations exceeding 30 mol%, the vesicles become increasingly susceptible to disintegration due to enhanced penetration of ethanol and water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membranes.},

  abstract     = {A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) has been carried out to investigate its key photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer capable of generating singlet oxygen. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods have been used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin–orbit couplings (SOCs), respectively, in a model (mono-iodinated BODIPY) molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), method to this and similar molecules. Subsequently, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), possibly within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), using several exchange-correlation functionals has been tested on I-BODIPY against ADC(2), both employing a basis set with a two-component pseudopotential on the iodine atoms. Finally, the magnitudes of SOC between excited electronic states of all types found have thoroughly been discussed using the Slater–Condon rules applied to an arbitrary one-electron one-center effective spin–orbit Hamiltonian. The geometry dependence of SOCs between the lowest-lying states has also been addressed. Based on these investigations, the TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP approaches have been selected as the methods of choice for the subsequent nuclear ensemble approach absorption spectra simulations and mixed quantum-classical trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, respectively. Two bright states in the visible spectrum of I-BODIPY have been found, exhibiting a redshift of the main peak with respect to unsubstituted BODIPY caused by the iodine substituents. Excited-state MD simulations including both non-adiabatic effects and SOCs have been performed to investigate the relaxation processes in I-BODIPY after its photoexcitation to the state. The TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a time scale comparable to internal conversions and that after an initial phase of triplet population growth a “saturation” is reached where the ratio of the net triplet to singlet populations is about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 is in qualitative agreement with the previously reported experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99 0.06.},

However, current implementations of MMFF94 are primarily available in commercial software or as closed-source modules. Open-source packages often offer limited functionality and lack extensibility. This paper introduces JMolecular Energy (JME), a novel, open-source Java library designed to implement MMFF94 with a robust and extendable API (Application Programming Interface) that allows for access to individual energy components. Leveraging the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK), JME provides a modular framework for potential energy calculation and facilitates functionalities previously absent in CDK, such as 3D conformation energy minimization. Additionally, JME establishes a framework for tailoring force field energy terms for various applications and facilitates the integration of custom-built force fields.},

  abstract     = {The defect formation energy, electronic structures, and optical properties of paraelectric phase (PE-KDP) and ferroelectric phase (FE-KDP) crystals with Y interstitial (Y i ) defects have been investigated using density function theory. The band-edge correction and FNV correction accurately determine the defect formation energies of the Y i defects in different charge states. The presence of transition energy levels in the band gap may indicate that the Y i defect has a significant impact on the properties of the FE-KDP. The +3 charged Y i defects are more stable. The electronic properties in the 2p orbital mainly contribute to the defect states in the band gap, which provides the possibility of multiphoton transition of electrons. New transparent absorption bands near 3.47 eV (357 nm) and 5.66 eV (219 nm) were calculated in PE-KDP, and the absorption bands caused by Y i defects and strong electron–phonon coupling under the FE-KDP structure showed that the light in the wavelength bands near 5.09 eV (244 nm) and 5.79 eV (214 nm) below the phase transition temperature (123 K) damaged the KDP crystal. The distortion of atoms near the defects indicates that Y i defects may be accompanied by intrinsic defects. The calculated values are highly consistent with the critical absorption observed at 355 nm in the experiment and the new absorption weak at 230 nm produced in the crystal after low-temperature X-ray irradiation, which suggests that the Y defect may be the key factor affecting the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the KDP crystal.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents NJA-CFS, a Python-based comprehensive toolkit for crystal field/ligand field calculations. NJA-CFS is designed to perform simulations of electronic structure properties, including the magnetic ones, for transition metals and lanthanoid complexes, giving access to several CF/LF parametrization schemes, from point-charge model and AOM to AILFT parameters, putting great effort in the implementation of routines for CF parameters manipulation and rotation. NJA-CFS was designed to meet the needs of both first-time users of crystal field theory and those who require a high degree of flexibility in the choice of crystal field parameters formalisms. In this manuscript, we present the theoretical foundations of the program routines and the comparison of NJA-CFS calculation results either to experimental data or ab initio computations, proving the advantages that access to multiple CFPs formalism can bring in. We also present intuitive applications of the NJA-CFS routines to didactically valuable examples, like the projection of CF/LF splitting on real d- and f- orbitals and the calculations of Tanabe–Sugano diagrams for arbitrary symmetries and with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling.},

Traditional SFs yield their inherent shortage for idealized approximations and simplifications predicting the binding affinity. Complementarily, SFs based on deep learning (DL) have emerged as powerful tools for capturing intricate features within protein-ligand (PL) interactions. We here present a docking-score fusion strategy that integrates pose scores derived from GNINA&#39;s convolutional neural network (CNN) with traditional docking scores. Extensive validation on diverse datasets has shown that by means of multiplying Watvina docking score by CNNscore demonstrates state-of-the-art screening power. Furthermore, in a reverse practice, our docking-score fusion technique was incorporated into the virtual screening (VS) workflow aimed at identifying inhibitors of the challenging target TYK2. Two promising hits with IC 50 9.99 μM and 13.76 μM in vitro were identified from nearly 12 billion molecules.},

Additionally, structure selection from the lowest temperature PT-BOMD trajectory for further optimization is performed with a scheme based on the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). This step can be done automatically and therefore removes a human bias. The influence of parameters for the DCT and the length of the PT-BOMD simulations is investigated with regard to their impact on the result of the global optimization.},

  abstract     = {The uranium benzyl derivatives are a class of uranium carbon complex with saturated carbon atom coordination. We investigated the electronic structures of the tetravalent uranium benzyl (Bn) complex U(CH 2 Ph) 4 and its derivatives U(2-CH 2 (NC 5 H 4 )) 4 , U( o -OMeBn) 4 , U( m -OMeBn) 4 , and the bonding nature between the uranium atom and methylene carbon atom (U–C me ) using scalar-relativistic quantum chemical calculations. The structures of the four uranium benzyl derivatives identify that the electronic structures are not sensitive to meta -OMe substitution, while they are significantly sensitive to the ortho -OMe and pyridine due to the coordination of O and N to the uranium atom. The U–C me bonds have highly polarized σ-bonding with partial covalency, which are predominantly composed of U 6d and 5f orbitals. Moreover, U 6d orbitals are favored for the U–C me bonds compared with U 5f orbitals. Furthermore, there are no additional π interactions in the U( o -OMeBn) 4 and the corresponding U–C me bonds appear the strongest covalent character among the four U(IV) system. The energy decomposition analysis suggests that the electrostatic interaction plays a dominant role between uranium and ligands. Finally, the complexes U(2-CH 2 (NC 5 H 4 )) 4 and U( o -OMeBn) 4 are the most thermodynamically accessible among the four complexes based on the binding energies. This study improves our understanding of tetravalent uranium benzyl derivatives bearing uranium-saturated carbon bondings.},

  abstract     = {The infrared (IR) spectrum of meta -fluorothiophenol (mFTP) isolated in a low-temperature N 2 matrix was recorded and interpreted with the aid of B3LYP vibrational frequency calculations for both cis and trans conformers. Then, photochemical transformations in the matrix-isolated compound were triggered through UV–Vis laser irradiations and their outcomes were monitored by IR spectroscopy. Upon excitation at λ = 285 nm, thiol-to-thione phototautomerization was identified as the sole reaction pathway, leading to the formation of three thione isomers. Among them, the ortho -isomer where the hydrogen atom reattaches to the fluorine-substituted side of the aromatic ring was identified as the predominant photoproduct. Identification of the photoproducts was confirmed by comparing the emerging experimental spectra with the IR absorptions predicted for the candidate structures. The photoreaction was found to be reversible, as irradiation at λ = 405 nm partially restored the reactant. The experimental results were complemented with the application of multireference/multiconfigurational (CASSCF, CASPT2, MR-CIS) and TD-DFT (TD-M062X, ωB97XD, and τ-HCTHhyb) methods to investigate the excited state properties of mFTP, including the simulation of its UV photoabsorption spectra. A comparative analysis of the results obtained by the different methods was performed. This combined experimental and theoretical approach provided valuable insights into the photochemical behavior and electronic structure of fluorinated thiophenols.},

Spectroscopic features of CAID suggest that the tautomeric equilibrium is possible both in ground and excited state. To further elucidate this, measurements of UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded in various solvents. The ground and low-lying excited states of CAID are modeled at SOS-MP2/ADC(2) computational level. The two tautomers A and B coexist in ground state with the amount of A amounting to 90% and a dynamic equilibrium is established. However, in all excited states the tautomer B is more stable and its amount is almost 100%. Along with fluorescence from the first excited state of both tautomers, a rare case of breaking Kasha&#39;s rule—fluorescence from the third excited state of the two tautomers—has been observed. A scheme is proposed to explain the photophysical processes and photoreactions of CAID in ethanol solution.},

Despite their widespread appeal, these platforms face two critical challenges (i.e., order batching and demand allocation) in effectively managing the delivery process while maintaining reliability. In response, this study aims to address these two challenges by examining the effects of real-time demands and restaurant density on delivery reliability, as well as how the type of driver (i.e., in-house versus crowdsourced drivers) moderates these effects. We evaluated our model with a unique dataset obtained from one of the top three on-demand meal delivery platforms in China, and our research sheds light on several key findings. Specifically, our study finds inverted U-shaped relationships between real-time demands and delivery reliability and a positive relationship between restaurant density and delivery reliability. In addition, it reveals that crowdsourced drivers perform better than in-house drivers under high real-time demands. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying how delivery reliability can be influenced by real-time demands and restaurant density. The results offer important implications for on-demand meal delivery platforms to improve delivery performance and allocate demands amid complicated market conditions.},

While prior research on order dispatch algorithms has largely focused on minimizing delivery time or delay, the direct impact of delivery performance on repeat purchases remains underexplored. Using transactional data from an online meal delivery platform in China, we empirically investigate the asymmetric effects of early and late deliveries on customer repurchasing behavior. To address potential endogeneity, we introduce driver experience and local knowledge, two previously overlooked factors in platform algorithms, as novel instrumental variables. The survival analysis shows that late deliveries significantly reduce future orders, while early deliveries provide only limited benefits. Guided by these empirical insights, we develop a simulation-based evaluation of different order dispatch algorithms, revealing that maximizing future orders, rather than minimizing delivery time or delays, yields the highest future orders. These insights offer actionable recommendations for platform managers, stressing the importance of strategic adjustments in dispatch algorithms and integrating heterogeneous treatment effects into algorithmic design. By merging operational delivery performance with consumer behavior insights through causal inference and optimization, this study provides a novel end-to-end framework for creating data-driven dispatch algorithms that enhance both service efficiency and customer retention.},

Moreover, we find that the positive effects of PDA on the delivery platform&#39;s sales are stronger in markets where online grocery penetration is lower, indicating that the effects were likely driven by increased purchases for groceries.

This research examines how warehouses use last-minute coordination, an unstructured mechanism, to ensure sufficient inventory at the order penetration points. Previous research has focused on structured mechanisms like contracts and inventory management systems to enhance warehouse performance. However, these mechanisms can be ineffective when faced with unforeseen local contingencies. To adjust inventory and adapt to changes in supply and/or demand, warehouses need to engage in unstructured, last-minute coordination with other warehouses. Using coordination and loose coupling theories, we find that coordinating with many warehouses (i.e., large coordination scope) reduces the operational efficiency of individual warehouses. At the network level, we find that a centralized coordination structure improves the operational efficiency of the entire network. We also show that demand uncertainty reinforces the existing last-minute coordination patterns, using the Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (ST-ERGM). This research highlights the importance of last-minute coordination and reveals its effects on both individual warehouses and the overall network.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a discrete-time fractional stochastic volatility model (FSV) based on fractional Gaussian noise. The new model includes the standard stochastic volatility model as a special case and has the same limit as the fractional integrated stochastic volatility (FISV) model, which is the continuous-time fractional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. A simulated maximum likelihood method, which maximizes the time-domain log-likelihood function calculated by the importance sampling technique, and a frequency-domain quasi maximum likelihood method (or quasi Whittle) are employed to estimate the model parameters. Simulation studies suggest that, while both estimation methods can accurately estimate the model, the simulated maximum likelihood method outperforms the quasi Whittle method. As an illustration, we fit the FSV and FISV models with the proposed estimation techniques to the S&amp;P 500 composite index over a sample period spanning 45 years.},

  abstract     = {Risk parity portfolio optimization, using expected shortfall as the risk measure, is investigated when asset returns are fat-tailed and heteroscedastic with regime switching dynamic correlations. The conditional return distribution is modeled by an elliptical multi-variate generalized hyperbolic distribution, allowing for fast parameter estimation via an expectation-maximization algorithm, and a semi-closed form of the risk contributions. A new method for efficient computation of non-Gaussian risk parity weights sidesteps the need for numerical simulations or Cornish–Fisher-type approximations. Accounting for fat-tailed returns, the risk parity allocation is less sensitive to volatility shocks, thereby generating lower portfolio turnover, in particular during market turmoils such as the global financial crisis or the COVID shock. While risk parity portfolios are rather robust to the misuse of the Gaussian distribution, a sophisticated time series model can improve risk-adjusted returns, strongly reduces drawdowns during periods of market stress and enables to use a holistic risk model for portfolio and risk management.},

This article introduces new techniques for estimating, identifying and simulating MARMA models. Although the estimation of the parameters is done using second-order moments, the identification relies on the existence of high-order dynamics, captured in the high-order spectral densities and the correlation of the squared residuals. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study demonstrated the robust performance of our estimation and identification methods. We propose an empirical application to 24 portfolios from emerging markets based on the factors: size, book-to-market, profitability, investment and momentum. All portfolios exhibited forward-looking behavior, showing significant non-causal and non-invertible dynamics. Moreover, we found the residuals to be uncorrelated and independent, with no trace of conditional volatility.},

Our focus is on the role of additional and time-varying decay parameters, conditional heteroscedasticity, and macroeconomic variables. We also consider the role of several popular restrictions on the dynamics of the factors. Using a novel dataset of end-of-month continuously compounded Treasury yields on US zero-coupon bonds and frequentist estimation based on the extended Kalman filter, we show that a second decay parameter does not contribute to better forecasts. In concordance with the preferred habitat theory, we also show that the best forecasting model depends on the maturity. For short maturities, the best performance is obtained in a heteroscedastic model with a time-varying decay parameter. However, for long maturities, neither the time-varying decay nor the heteroscedasticity plays any role, and the best forecasts are obtained in the basic DNS model with the shape of the yield curve depending on macroeconomic activity. Finally, we find that assuming non-stationary factors is helpful in forecasting at long horizons.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel class of stochastic volatility models, which can utilize and relate many high-frequency realized volatility (RV) measures to latent volatility. Instrumental variable methods provide a unified framework for estimation and testing. We study parameter inference problems in the proposed framework with nonstationary stochastic volatility and exogenous predictors in the latent volatility process. Identification-robust methods are developed for a joint hypothesis involving the volatility persistence parameter and the autocorrelation parameter of the composite error (or the noise ratio). For inference about the volatility persistence parameter, projection techniques are applied. The proposed tests include Anderson-Rubin-type tests and their point-optimal versions. For distributional theory, we provide finite-sample tests and confidence sets for Gaussian errors, establish exact Monte Carlo test procedures for non-Gaussian errors (possibly heavy-tailed), and show asymptotic validity under weaker assumptions. Simulation results show that the proposed tests outperform the asymptotic test regarding size and exhibit excellent power in empirically realistic settings. The proposed inference methods are applied to IBM&#39;s price and option data (2009–2013). We consider 175 different instruments (IVs) spanning 22 classes and analyze their ability to describe the low-frequency volatility. IVs are compared based on the average length of the proposed identification-robust confidence intervals. The superior instrument set mostly comprises 5-min HF realized measures, and these IVs produce confidence sets which show that the volatility process is nearly unit-root. In addition, we find RVs with higher frequency yield wider confidence intervals than RVs with slightly lower frequency, indicating that these confidence intervals adjust to absorb market microstructure noise. Furthermore, when we consider irrelevant or weak IVs (jumps and signed jumps), the proposed tests produce unbounded confidence intervals. We also find that both RV and BV measures produce almost identical confidence intervals across all 14 subclasses, confirming that our methodology is robust in the presence of jumps. Finally, although jumps contain little information regarding the low-frequency volatility, we find evidence that there may be a nonlinear relationship between jumps and low-frequency volatility.},

The previous equivalence results with the continuity assumptions alone in the literature have been widely used to study the existence of solutions and numerical solutions of the Caputo FDEs up to now, so according to the new results obtained in this paper, there are no guarantees that the solutions of the integral equations obtained in the literature are the solutions of the Caputo FDEs. New conditions which are stronger than continuity are provided to ensure the equivalences.

This reinforces the understanding of symmetry analysis and explores the application of differential geometry and physics to the analysis of selected problems. A demonstration of the utility of symmetries in offering concise solutions for previously extensively studied problems is given with the specific linearization of the Ermakov–Pinney equation and that of another nonmaximal symmetric equation, showcasing how differential geometry can chart novel pathways in the realm of symmetry analysis is given.},

Due to the problems, we calculate the operational matrix of derivatives, the operational matrix of the piecewise fractional derivative, and the pantograph operational matrix. By employing the proposed numerical algorithm, we transform the problems into a system of algebraic equations.

Unlike conventional methods that incorporate a single inertial step, our approach employs dual inertia to accelerate convergence while preserving stability. The proposed method combines the viscosity approximation technique with the extragradient method to guarantee strong convergence. Initially, the extragradient method is applied under a Lipschitz continuity assumption on the equilibrium bifunction. Subsequently, this condition is relaxed by adopting a self-adaptive step size strategy, allowing variable step sizes to be updated iteratively based on the current iterates information. Notably, the algorithm operates without requiring prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constants or any line search procedures. Strong convergence is established under mild condition, and its applicability to variational inequality problems is demonstrated. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing its capability to handle large-scale and complex problems efficiently while outperforming traditional single-inertia methods.},

Therefore, analyzing and establishing the corresponding mathematical model can help explore and study the propagation law of computer viruses.

The study presents a new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIQRS) computer virus propagation model with two delays. In addition, we introduce impulse control, an optimal control method, to explore the effect of the impulse period on the model. We first derive the basic reproduction number of the model. Then, the characteristic equations and eigenvalues are discussed analytically by controlling the delay parameters variation in order to analyze local stability and Hopf bifurcation for the computer virus model. Next, we add impulse control and find that it could better control the propagation of computer viruses. Firstly, we analyze the dynamical behavior of this model using the relevant theories of time delay differential equations to provide a theoretical basis for the effective elimination and control of virus propagation in computer networks. Secondly, we use Matlab to conduct numerical simulations, which verify the correctness of theoretical results. Finally, we synthesize the theoretical and experimental analysis of the present model to provide some scientific suggestions for better control of the spreading of computer viruses.},

Traditional models often fail to capture such dynamics, making TFBSE particularly important for accurately reflecting market behaviors over time. In this paper, we propose a novel compact difference scheme to solve the mixed-type TFBSE. Discretization in the time direction is accomplished using the L1 scheme. To achieve fourth-order discretization in the spatial direction, a compact difference method based on the reduced-order method is employed. The stability and convergence of the proposed scheme under the norm are established using the discrete energy method. Finally, a series of numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results, demonstrating both the accuracy and efficiency of the method in practical applications.},

Given any signal f $$ f $$ and data point x k ∈ ℝ $$ {x}_k\in \mathbb{R} $$ , the sample f ⁡ ( x k ) $$ f\left({x}_k\right) $$ is stored along a sequence of directions { ν k ⁢ m } m ∈ ℤ $$ {\left\{{\nu}_{km}\right\}}_{m\in \mathbb{Z}} $$ . Specifically, the inner products ⟨ f ⁡ ( x k ) , ν k ⁢ m ⟩ $$ \left\langle f\left({x}_k\right),{\nu}_{km}\right\rangle $$ are stored. First, we define what we mean by a stable set of sampling and provide equivalent conditions for proving that a given set is a stable set of sampling. We then present a reconstruction formula for from its integer samples . Finally, we address the cases of perturbed and irregular sampling, examining their impact on the reconstruction process.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of this paper is to classify the first transitions of a general class of one spatial dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations on a bounded interval. The linear part of the equation is assumed to have a real discrete spectrum with a complete set of eigenfunctions, which are of the form sin ⁡ k ⁢ x $$ \sin kx $$ or cos ⁡ k ⁢ x , k ∈ ℕ $$ \cos kx,\kern0.3em k\in \mathbb{N} $$ . The nonlinear operator consists of arbitrary finite products and sums of the unknown function and its derivatives of arbitrary order. The equations allow for a trivial steady-state solution that becomes unstable when a control parameter exceeds a certain threshold. Unlike most of the previous research in this direction that considers specific equations, this general framework is suitable for extension in several directions such as the higher spatial dimensions and different basis vectors. Under a set of assumptions that are often valid in many interesting applications, we derive two numbers called the transition number and the critical index which completely describe the first dynamic transition. We make detailed numerical computations that reveal the properties of the transition numbers. To show the applicability of our theoretical results, we determine the first transitions of several well-known equations including the Cahn–Hilliard, thin film, Harry Dym, Kawamoto, and Rosenau–Hyman equations.},

To address existence, uniqueness, stability, and numerical results, fractional derivatives are substituted by diffusion equations relative to a new independent variable, resulting in an augmented model with a dissipative semigroup operator. Polynomial decay of energy is achieved, with a decay rate depending on the fractional derivative parameters. Both the polynomial decay and its dependency on the parameters of the generalized Caputo derivative are numerically validated.

The deterministic model is solved by using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method, and Milstein&#39;s method is used for solving the stochastic model. Numerical simulations correlated quite strongly with observed data, while projections for the 2024–2030 period indicate that controlled population growth bodes well for the outlook of the economy for India, supporting economic prosperity alongside reduced inflation and better employment conditions. The findings presented in this work are correlational; therefore, to find the possible cause for this phenomenon, further research is required with detailed datasets. Comparing our model&#39;s GDP predictions with that obtained using a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model returned very high values of predictive accuracy, thus reinforcing the strength and reliability of our framework.},

  abstract     = {A Filippov system of crop-pest-natural enemy with a Holling-II type functional response function is developed based on the fear effect and threshold control strategy. The threshold control strategy is mainly a means of controlling pests and natural enemies. When the number of natural enemies is below a threshold, the natural enemies cannot achieve a controlling effect on the pest population and control is needed to suppress the outbreak. In this case, the fear of pests to natural enemies will affect the pest&#39;s survival mode, thus affecting the pest&#39;s dynamic behavior. However, the number of natural enemy population exceeds the threshold density, and there is no need to control the system. At this point, the pest&#39;s fear of natural enemies is almost zero. The dynamic behavior of the two subsystems of the model is discussed, the existence and stability of various equilibria are analyzed, and the existence of sliding and crossing regions is also investigated. In addition, it is possible that the established model has more than one pseudo-equilibrium. Therefore, the dynamic behavior of the pseudo-equilibria is analyzed, and we observe that Hopf bifurcation occurs near the pseudo-equilibria. By numerically simulating the global sliding bifurcation of the system, we discover that as the bifurcation parameters are varied, the system exhibits a series of bifurcations such as grazing bifurcation, buckling bifurcation, crossing bifurcation, and period-halving bifurcation.},

The stability and convergence analysis of the time-discrete outline are investigated by the energy approach. The spatial dimension of the model is discretized by the fourth-order local radial basis function-Hermite finite difference (RBF-HFD) method.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to address an interesting open problem, posed in the paper “Singular Optimal Control for a Transport-Diffusion Equation” of Sergio Guerrero and Gilles Lebeau in 2007. The problem involves studying the null controllability cost of a transport–diffusion equation with Neumann conditions, where the diffusivity coefficient is denoted by ε &gt; 0 $$ \varepsilon &amp;gt;0 $$ and the velocity by B ⁡ ( x , t ) $$ \mathfrak{B}\left(x,t\right) $$ . Our objective is twofold. First, we investigate the scenario where each velocity trajectory B $$ \mathfrak{B} $$ originating from Ω ‾ $$ \overline{\Omega} $$ enters the control region in a shorter time at a fixed entry time. By employing Agmon and dissipation inequalities, and Carleman estimate in the case is the gradient of a time-dependent scalar field, we establish that the control cost remains bounded for sufficiently small and large control time. Secondly, we explore the case where at least one trajectory fails to enter the control region and remains in . In this scenario, we prove that the control cost explodes exponentially when the diffusivity approaches zero and the control time is sufficiently small for general velocity.},

In this paper, we applied the PDE approach to price European continuous-installment option and consider Heston stochastic volatility model for the dynamics of the underlying asset. We proved the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for our pricing problem based on the two-dimensional finite element method. Due to the flexibility to continue or stop paying installments, installment options pricing can be modeled as an optimal stopping time problem. This problem is formulated as an equivalent free boundary problem and then as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). We wrote the resulted LCP in the form of a variational inequality and used the finite element method for the discretization. Then the resulting time-dependent LCPs are solved by using a projected successive over relaxation iteration method. Finally, we implemented our numerical method. The numerical results verified the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method.},

Next, we establish the Carleman estimate for backward stochastic degenerate parabolic equation with convection term. In order to deal with the convection term, the Carleman estimate is established by introducing an auxiliary function to transfer the diffusion and the convection term into a whole complex divergence-like form. By this Carleman estimate, we then obtain an observability inequality for the adjoint system of the approximate system.

Soliton solutions are essential for analyzing nonlinear wave behaviors in different physical systems, and the Kaup–Newell model is also significant in this context. The model&#39;s ability to represent subpicosecond pulses makes it a significant tool for the research of nonlinear optics and plasma physics. Overall, the Kaup–Newell model is an important research domain in these areas, with ongoing efforts focused on understanding its various solutions and potential applications. A new version of the generalized exponential rational function method and -expansion function method are utilized to discover diverse soliton solutions. The generalized exponential rational function method facilitates the generation of multiple solution types, including singular, shock, singular periodic, exponential, combo trigonometric, and hyperbolic solutions in mixed forms. Thanks to -expansion function method, we obtain trigonometric, hyperbolic, and rational solutions. The modulation instability of the proposed model is examined, with numerical simulations complementing the analytical results to provide a better understanding of the solutions&#39; dynamic behavior. These results offer a foundation for future research, making the solutions effective, manageable, and reliable for tackling complex nonlinear problems. The methodologies used in this study are robust, influential, and practicable for diverse nonlinear partial differential equations; to our knowledge, for this equation, these methods of investigation have not been explored before. The accuracy of each solution has been verified using the Maple software program.},

  abstract     = {We present a simplified mathematical and computational model of blood flow through a chamber of a healthy human heart, with a particular description of the left ventricle. We use fixed representations of the domain and mesh, assume blood to be an incompressible Newtonian fluid, and simulate the chamber volume variation by introducing a capacitance function, which is space and time-dependent. The inclusion of this capacitance function gives rise to a model whose differential form resembles the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical methodology is based on stable Galerkin mixed finite element formulations posed on velocity and pressure. Convergence studies for the two-dimensional steady-state Stokes equation with spatially-varying capacitance indicate optimal convergence orders when combining continuous biquadratic velocities with continuous bilinear pressures (Taylor–Hood elements) or discontinuous unmapped linear pressures. On the other hand, we observed loss of optimality with discontinuous linear mapped approximations for this field, as expected for the classical Stokes problem. Additional convergence studies indicate that the optimal convergence properties are preserved in the resolution of the nonlinear model, for the case of smooth solutions. Finally, we present simulations of cardiac cycles in an idealized human left ventricle in two and three dimensions. The results are meaningful given the model simplicity and open the possibility for future extensions of the proposed methodology.},

To demonstrate the results, the concept of bounded integral contractors is combined with the stochastic result and sequencing technique. In contrast to previous publications, we do not need to specify the induced inverse of the controllability operator to prove the stability results, and the relevant nonlinear function does not have to meet the Lipschitz condition. Furthermore, exponential stability results for neutral stochastic differential systems with Poisson jump have been established.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel complex-valued differential-algebraic neural network model with time delay (DDANN). Firstly, based on the differential-algebraic inequality technique, the global stability criteria of the considered system are obtained to ensure the complex-valued DDANN achieves global exponential stability. Next, by designing an appropriate feedback controller, to get the desired results, we present some constraint conditions, which make the drive system and the response system achieve the global exponential synchronization. Furthermore, as an application, a complex-valued neutral-type neural network (NDNN) can be transformed into a simple complex-valued DDANN and the global exponential stability results of NDNN are also proposed. In the end of paper, two examples are given to verify the superiority/feasibility of the presented theoretical results.},

It is shown that the stability of steady-state solutions and their evolution are mainly determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of a linearized system and the fractional derivative order. It is also demonstrated that the basic properties of auto-wave solutions in fractional-order systems can essentially differ from those in standard systems. The results of the linear stability analysis are confirmed by computer simulations of the generalized fractional van der Pol–FitzHugh–Nagumo mathematical model.

  abstract = {Detecting statistical differences among functional dataset or streaming signal dataset is of interest to many diverse fields, including neurophysiology, imaging, biomedical engineering, and public health. For example in our study, our interest is to provide the guideline for detecting the lowest drug dosage level for glioblastoma as quickly as possible in which the intensity functional curves are different among dosage groups. However, such functional data often have unknown and nonlinear massive correlated curves that lead to difficulties in detecting their significant differences without explicit likelihood functions. Existing detecting procedures mainly test a linear, quadratic, or specific parametric form of departure and require explicit likelihood functions due to estimating specific models. In this paper, we propose a flexible detecting method to test any unknown functional departure in a generalized functional regression without estimating models. We develop our detecting method under a generalized semiparametric functional model framework in which the explicit likelihood function does not exist. We develop our detecting method using the approximated Bayes factor, a score-type test, and the estimating equations. The decision of rejecting (or not) the null hypothesis is made using the Frequentist p -values. We also studied the asymptotic properties of our method. We compare our detecting method to the alternative method regarding the type-I error and power under various simulation settings. We demonstrate the advantages of our method by applying two real datasets: functional data of drug-exposed glioblastoma cell line and diffusion tensor imaging tractography.},

The semi-parametric nature of the model eliminates the need for specific distributional assumptions about the angular error, enhancing its versatility. Extensive simulation studies, incorporating von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions, highlight the robustness of the framework.

  abstract = {Tensor data are multi-dimensional arrays. Low-rank decomposition-based regression methods with tensor predictors exploit the structural information in tensor predictors while significantly reducing the number of parameters in tensor regression. We propose a method named NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ (Noise Augmentation for ℓ 0 $$ {\mathrm{\ell}}_0 $$ regularization on Core Tensor in Tucker decomposition) to regularize the parameters in tensor regression (TR), coupled with Tucker decomposition. We establish theoretically that NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ achieves exact ℓ 0 $$ {\mathrm{\ell}}_0 $$ regularization on the core tensor from the Tucker decomposition in linear TR and generalized linear TR. To our knowledge, NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ is the first Tucker decomposition-based regularization method in TR to achieve ℓ 0 $$ {\mathrm{\ell}}_0 $$ regularization in core tensors. NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ is implemented through an iterative procedure and involves two straightforward steps in each iteration—generating noisy data based on the core tensor from the Tucker decomposition of the updated parameter estimate and running a regular GLM on noise-augmented data on vectorized predictors. We demonstrate the implementation of NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ and its ℓ 0 $$ {\mathrm{\ell}}_0 $$ regularization effect in both simulation studies and real data applications. The results suggest that NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ can improve predictions compared with other decomposition-based TR approaches, with or without regularization and it identifies important predictors though not designed for that purpose.},

  abstract = {Neural networks have been employed to identify materials of interest from hyperspectral data (generally imagery) based on their unique spectral signatures. This approach assumes that there is a single material that is standing out from the rest of the spectrum to be identified. However, pixels often contain more than one material, or a material of interest may itself be a mixture of multiple materials. Neural networks are only as good as the data used to train them, and it takes a great deal of work in the laboratory to identify, make, and measure all potential mixtures of interest. Thus, researchers often calculate synthetic spectra using algorithms with varying degrees of fidelity to the physics that govern the interactions between light and multiple materials. In this work, we have (1) adapted a neural network designed to identify mixture components from Raman spectroscopy to work with visible to near-infrared reflectance data and (2) tested three common mixture algorithms to determine the most accurate and least computationally expensive method to build synthetic training datasets. With our initial test dataset, we have achieved accuracies of &gt; 90% and found that the synthetic training dataset produced using the Hapke mixture model provides the best results.},

The unobservable variable is subject to a multiplicative distortion influenced by an unknown smoothing function dependent on a confounding variable. We introduce the conditional mean calibrated Greenwood statistic and its variants, including the coefficient of variation, to adapt to this complex situation. The asymptotic results we present showcase their effectiveness even when such distortions are present. Moreover, for general distributions of the unobserved variable, we extend the methodology by proposing calibrated-modified Greenwood statistics and the coefficient of variation. These methods are demonstrated to be asymptotically efficient under various assumptions about the distortion function. Furthermore, we conduct Monte Carlo simulation experiments to assess the performance of the proposed estimators and test statistics, during which we compare our proposed test statistics with existing ones. For illustrative purposes, these methods are then applied to analyze a real-world dataset. MSC2020 Classification: 62G05, 62G08, 62G20},

Identifying the differences in microbial taxa across two different health conditions is clinically important, as it can enhance our understanding of disease pathology from a microbiome perspective and potentially lead to preventive or therapeutic strategies. However, there are three main challenges for analyzing microbiome data, due to compositionality, sparsity, and high dimensionality of the relative abundances. Although a few two-sample tests have been proposed for analyzing microbiome data, the statistical power cannot be guaranteed as the true alternative hypothesis is unknown. To potentially address this issue, we propose an adaptive microbiome-based truncated test (AMTT) that produces high power for various alternative hypotheses. Simulation studies with a wide range of scenarios are conducted, the results indicate that AMTT is not only powerful in almost all the scenarios but also effectively controls type I error rates. Real data about Parkinson&#39;s intestinal microbiome is analyzed to demonstrate its practical performance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number and complexity of advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks have significantly increased, posing major challenges for organizations in effectively detecting and mitigating these threats. Although various APT detection methods have been developed, current approaches still face limitations, such as poor generalization leading to high false alarm rates. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel ensemble learning model called MCG, based on the combination of three main components: multilayer perceptron (MLP), correlated recursion (CR) layer, and graph attention network (GAT). The MLP component extracts flow features from network traffic, the CR layer constructs the IP information network by grouping and linking network behaviors, and finally, the GAT layer analyzes relationships between IPs through an attention mechanism. The MCG model proposed in this article has demonstrated superior performance in APT detection by effectively leveraging the strengths of each component, enabling more accurate identification of abnormal behaviors and reducing false alarms. The experimental results, presented in Section 4.4, show that the MCG model significantly improves accuracy and outperforms traditional methods. This demonstrates that the proposed model not only makes significant theoretical contributions but also offers practical value, providing a more reliable and effective solution for early detection and warning of APT attacks.},

The objective of this study is to explore treatment-covariate interaction tests involving covariate-adaptive randomization. Without assuming a parametric data-generating model, we investigate usual interaction tests and observe that they tend to be conservative: specifically, their limiting rejection probabilities under the null hypothesis are typically strictly lower than the nominal level. To address this problem, we propose modifications to the usual tests to obtain corresponding valid tests with limiting rejection probabilities equal to the nominal level. Moreover, we introduce a novel class of stratified-adjusted interaction tests that are simple, more powerful than the usual and modified tests, and broadly applicable to most covariate-adaptive randomization methods. The results encompass two types of interaction tests: one involving stratification covariates and the other involving additional covariates that are not used for randomization. Our study clarifies the application of interaction tests in clinical trials and offers valuable tools for revealing treatment heterogeneity, crucial for advancing personalized medicine.},

This article proposes a novel sequence outlier detection method based on the gated recurrent unit autoencoder with Gaussian mixture model (GRU-AE-GMM), which combines gated recurrent unit (GRU), autoencoder (AE), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and optimization algorithms. The GRU captures long-term dependencies within the sequence, while the AE measures sequence abnormality. Meanwhile, the GMM models the relationship between the original and reconstructed sequences, employing the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation to calculate the likelihood of each hidden variable belonging to each Gaussian mixture component. In this article, we first train the model with mean-squared error loss (MSEL), and then further enhanced by substituting it with quantile loss (QL), composite quantile loss (CQL), and Huber loss (HL), respectively. Next, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model through Monte Carlo experiments conducted under different error terms. Finally, the method is applied to Amazon stock data for 2022, demonstrating its significant potential for application in dynamic and unpredictable market environments.},

These include the high-dimensionality of the data, the high codimension in the ambient space of the data manifolds of interest, and that the structure of machine learning models may encourage classifiers to develop decision boundaries close to data points. This article proposes a new framework for studying adversarial examples that does not depend directly on the distance to the decision boundary. Similarly to the smoothed classifier literature, we define a (natural or adversarial) data point to be ( γ , σ)-stable if the probability of the same classification is at least γ $$ \gamma $$ for points sampled in a Gaussian neighborhood of the point with a given standard deviation σ $$ \sigma $$ . We focus on studying the differences between persistence metrics along interpolants of natural and adversarial points. We show that adversarial examples have significantly lower persistence than natural examples for large neural networks in the context of the MNIST and ImageNet datasets. We connect this lack of persistence with decision boundary geometry by measuring angles of interpolants with respect to decision boundaries. Finally, we connect this approach with robustness by developing a manifold alignment gradient metric and demonstrating the increase in robustness that can be achieved when training with the addition of this metric.},

A common goal in group testing applications is to estimate the relationship between an individual&#39;s true disease status and their individual-level covariate information. However, estimating such a relationship is a non-trivial problem because true individual disease statuses are unknown due to the group testing protocol and the possibility of imperfect testing. While several regression methods have been developed in recent years to accommodate the complexity of group testing data, the functional form of covariate effects is typically assumed to be known. To avoid model misspecification and to provide a more flexible approach, we propose a Bayesian additive regression trees framework to model the individual-level probability of disease with potentially misclassified group testing data. Our methods can be used to analyze data arising from any group testing protocol with the goal of estimating unknown functions of covariates and assay classification accuracy probabilities.},

  abstract     = {When planning a clinical trial for a time-to-event endpoint, we require an estimated effect size and need to consider the type of effect. Usually, an effect of proportional hazards is assumed with the hazard ratio as the corresponding effect measure. Thus, the standard procedure for survival data is generally based on a single-stage log-rank test. Knowing that the assumption of proportional hazards is often violated and sufficient knowledge to derive reasonable effect sizes is usually unavailable, such an approach is relatively rigid. We introduce a more flexible procedure by combining two methods designed to be more robust in case we have little to no prior knowledge. First, we employ a more flexible adaptive multi-stage design instead of a single-stage design. Second, we apply combination-type tests in the first stage of our suggested procedure to benefit from their robustness under uncertainty about the deviation pattern. We can then use the data collected during this period to choose a more specific single-weighted log-rank test for the subsequent stages. In this step, we employ Royston-Parmar spline models to extrapolate the survival curves to make a reasonable decision. Based on a real-world data example, we show that our approach can save a trial that would otherwise end with an inconclusive result. Additionally, our simulation studies demonstrate a sufficient power performance while maintaining more flexibility.},

Advancements in medical and health sciences and the emergence of novel treatments are expected to lead to a favorable response in a subset of patients. This, in turn, is anticipated to enhance overall survival and disease-free survival rates. Cure fraction models have become essential for estimating the proportion of individuals considered cured and free from adverse events. This article presents a novel piecewise power-law cure fraction model with a piecewise decreasing hazard function, deviating from the traditional piecewise constant hazard assumption. By analyzing real medical data, we evaluate various factors to explain the survival of individuals. Consistently, positive outcomes are observed, affirming the significant potential of our approach. Furthermore, we use a local influence analysis to detect potentially influential individuals and perform a postdeletion analysis to analyze their impact on our inferences.},

Inference, with or without covariates, after implementing covariate adaptive randomization (CAR), is garnering increased interest. This paper investigates the sequential monitoring of covariate-adaptive randomized clinical trials through non-parametric methods, a critical advancement for enhancing the precision and efficiency of medical research. CAR, which incorporates baseline patient characteristics into the randomization process, aims to mitigate the risk of confounding and improve the balance of covariates across treatment groups, thereby addressing patients&#39; heterogeneity. Although CAR is known for its benefits in reducing biases and enhancing statistical power, its integration into sequentially monitored clinical trials—a standard practice—poses methodological challenges, particularly in controlling the type I error rate. By employing a non-parametric approach, we demonstrate through theoretical proofs and numerical analyses that our methods effectively control the type I error rate and surpass traditional randomization and analysis methods. This paper not only fills a gap in the literature on sequential monitoring of CAR without model misspecification but also proposes practical solutions for enhancing trial design and analysis, thereby contributing significantly to the field of clinical research.},

  abstract     = {Multilevel data are frequently encountered in biomedical research, and several statistical methods have been developed to analyze such data. Informativeness of the number of units on certain levels often manifests itself in multilevel data analysis and failure to account for this phenomenon will lead to biased inference. Moreover, utilizing an incorrect marginalization approach will also lead to invalid conclusions. To identify the appropriate marginal distribution to be tested in multilevel designs, we propose a sequential testing procedure to test for informativeness of unit sizes in multilevel structures with three levels. At a given level of the design, a bootstrap method is developed to estimate the null distribution of no informativeness of unit size. Simulation studies confirm the efficacy of our sequential procedure in maintaining an overall Type I error rate. Additionally, we extend our testing procedure to a multilevel regression setting, enhancing its practical applicability. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods through the analysis of data from a study on periodontal disease and a study on stress levels of preschoolers.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the Swedish Betula study, we consider the joint modeling of longitudinal memory assessments and the hazard of dementia. In the Betula data, the time-to-dementia onset or its absence is available for all participants, while some memory measurements are missing. In longitudinal studies of aging, one cannot rule out the possibility of dropout due to health issues resulting in missing not at random longitudinal measurements. We, therefore, propose a pattern-mixture sensitivity analysis for missing not-at-random data in the joint modeling framework. The sensitivity analysis is implemented via multiple imputation as follows: (i) multiply impute missing not at random longitudinal measurements under a set of plausible pattern-mixture imputation models that allow for acceleration of memory decline after dropout, (ii) fit the joint model to each imputed longitudinal memory and time-to-dementia dataset, and (iii) combine the results of step (ii). Our work illustrates that sensitivity analyses via multiple imputations are an accessible, pragmatic method to evaluate the consequences of missing not at-random data on inference and prediction. This flexible approach can accommodate a range of models for the longitudinal and event-time processes. In particular, the pattern-mixture modeling approach provides an accessible way to frame plausible missing not at random assumptions for different missing data patterns. Applying our approach to the Betula study shows that worse memory levels and steeper memory decline were associated with a higher risk of dementia for all considered scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Disease models are used to examine the likely impact of therapies, interventions, and public policy changes. Ensuring that these are well calibrated on the basis of available data and that the uncertainty in their projections is properly quantified is an important part of the process. The question of non-identifiability poses a challenge to disease model calibration where multiple parameter sets generate identical model outputs. For statisticians evaluating the impact of policy interventions such as screening or vaccination, this is a critical issue. This study explores the use of the Bayesian framework to provide a natural way to calibrate models and address non-identifiability in a probabilistic fashion in the context of disease modeling. We present Bayesian approaches for incorporating expert knowledge and external data to ensure that appropriately informative priors are specified on the joint parameter space. These approaches are applied to two common disease models: a basic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and a much more complex agent-based model which has previously been used to address public policy questions in HPV and cervical cancer. The conditions that allow the problem of non-identifiability to be resolved are demonstrated for the SIS model. For the larger HPV model, an overview of the findings is presented, but of key importance is a discussion on how the non-identifiability impacts the calibration process. Through case studies, we demonstrate how informative priors can help resolve non-identifiability and improve model inference. We also discuss how sensitivity analysis can be used to assess the impact of prior specifications on model results. Overall, this work provides an important tutorial for researchers interested in applying Bayesian methods to calibrate models and handle non-identifiability in disease models.},

  abstract     = {Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is an increasingly popular framework for the estimation of causal effects. It requires modeling both the exposure and outcome but is doubly robust in the sense that it is valid if at least one of these models is correctly specified. In addition, TMLE allows for flexible modeling of both the exposure and outcome with machine learning methods. This provides better control for measured confounders since the model specification automatically adapts to the data, instead of needing to be specified by the analyst a priori . Despite these methodological advantages, TMLE remains less popular than alternatives in part because of its less accessible theory and implementation. While some tutorials have been proposed, none address the case of a time-to-event outcome. This tutorial provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the implementation of TMLE for estimating the effect of a point binary or multilevel exposure on a time-to-event outcome, modeled as counterfactual survival curves and causal hazard ratios. The tutorial also provides guidelines on how best to use TMLE in practice, including aspects related to study design, choice of covariates, controlling biases and use of machine learning. R-code is provided to illustrate each step using simulated data ( https://github.com/detal9/SurvTMLE ). To facilitate implementation, a general R function implementing TMLE with options to use machine learning is also provided. The method is illustrated in a real-data analysis concerning the effectiveness of statins for the prevention of a first cardiovascular disease among older adults in Québec, Canada, between 2013 and 2018.},

  abstract     = {In various missing data problems, values are not entirely missing, but are coarsened. For coarsened observations, instead of observing the true value, a subset of values - strictly smaller than the full sample space of the variable - is observed to which the true value belongs. In our motivating example for patients with endometrial carcinoma, the degree of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) can be either absent, focally present, or substantially present. For a subset of individuals, however, LVSI is reported as being present, which includes both non-absent options. In the analysis of such a dataset, difficulties arise when coarsened observations are to be used in an imputation procedure. To our knowledge, no clear-cut method has been described in the literature on how to handle an observed subset of values, and treating them as entirely missing could lead to biased estimates. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluated the best strategy to deal with coarsened and missing data in multiple imputation. We tested a number of plausible ad hoc approaches, possibly already in use by statisticians. Additionally, we propose a principled approach to this problem, consisting of an adaptation of the SMC-FCS algorithm (SMC-FCS : Coarsening compatible), that ensures that imputed values adhere to the coarsening information. These methods were compared in a simulation study. This comparison shows that methods that prevent imputations of incompatible values, like the SMC-FCS method, perform consistently better in terms of a lower bias and RMSE, and achieve better coverage than methods that ignore coarsening or handle it in a more naïve way. The analysis of the motivating example shows that the way the coarsening information is handled can matter substantially, leading to different conclusions across methods. Overall, our proposed SMC-FCS method outperforms other methods in handling coarsened data, requires limited additional computation cost and is easily extendable to other scenarios.},

Existing strategies rely on either blinded or unblinded methods to inform such adjustments and, ideally, perform these adjustments in a way that preserves Type I error at the nominal level. Here, we propose an approach that uses partially-unblinded methods for SSR for both binary and continuous endpoints. Although this approach has operational unblinding, its partial use of the unblinded information for SSR does not include the interim effect size, hence the term ‘partially-unblinded.’ Through proof-of-concept and simulation studies, we demonstrate that these adjustments can be made without compromising the Type I error rate. We also investigate different mathematical expressions for SSR under different variance scenarios: homogeneity, heterogeneity, and a combination of both. Of particular interest is the third form of dual variance, for which we provide additional clarifications for binary outcomes and derive an analogous form for continuous outcomes. We show that the corresponding mathematical expressions for the dual variance method are a compromise between those for variance homogeneity and heterogeneity, resulting in sample size estimates that are bounded between those produced by the other expressions, and extend their applicability to adaptive trial design.},

When considering realistic numbers of agents and properly accounting for stochasticity, this high-dimensional calibration can be computationally prohibitive. This paper presents a random forest-based surrogate modeling technique to accelerate the evaluation of ABMs and demonstrates its use to calibrate an epidemiological ABM named CityCOVID via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The technique is first outlined in the context of CityCOVID&#39;s quantities of interest, namely hospitalizations and deaths, by exploring dimensionality reduction via temporal decomposition with principal component analysis (PCA) and via sensitivity analysis. The calibration problem is then presented, and samples are generated to best match COVID-19 hospitalization and death numbers in Chicago from March to June in 2020. These results are compared with previous approximate Bayesian calibration (IMABC) results, and their predictive performance is analyzed, showing improved performance with a reduction in computation.},

  abstract     = {The prognostic significance of biomarker variability in predicting associated disease risk is well-established. However, prevailing methods that assess the relationship between biomarker variability and time to event often overlook within-subject correlation in longitudinal measurement errors, resulting in biased parameter estimates and erroneous statistical inference. Additionally, these methods typically assume that biomarker trajectory can be represented as a linear combination of spline basis functions with normally distributed random effects. This not only leads to significant computational demands due to the necessity of high-dimensional integration over the random effects but also limits the applicability because of the normality restriction imposed on the random effects. This paper addresses these limitations by incorporating correlated longitudinal measurement errors and proposing a novel semiparametric multiplicative random effects model. This model does not assume normality for the random effects and eliminates the need for integration with respect to them. The biomarker variability is incorporated as a covariate within a Cox model for time-to-event data, thus facilitating a joint modeling strategy. We demonstrate the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and validate their performance through simulation studies. The methodology is applied to assess the impact of systolic blood pressure variability on cardiovascular mortality using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.},

  abstract     = {In the quest for enhanced HIV prevention methods, the advent of antiretroviral drugs as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has marked a significant stride forward. However, the ethical challenges in conducting placebo-controlled trials for new PrEP agents against a backdrop of highly effective existing PrEP options necessitate innovative approaches. This manuscript delves into the design and implementation of active-controlled trials that incorporate a counterfactual placebo estimate—a theoretical estimate of what HIV incidence would have been without effective prevention. We introduce a novel statistical framework for regulatory approval of new PrEP agents, predicated on the assumption of an available and consistent counterfactual placebo estimate. Our approach aims to assess the absolute efficacy (i.e., against placebo) of the new PrEP agent relative to the absolute efficacy of the active control. We propose a two-step procedure for hypothesis testing and further develop an approach that addresses potential biases inherent in non-randomized comparisons to counterfactual placebos. By exploring different scenarios with moderately and highly effective active controls and counterfactual placebo estimates from various sources, we demonstrate how our design can significantly reduce sample sizes compared to traditional non-inferiority trials and offer a robust framework for evaluating new PrEP agents. This work contributes to the methodological repertoire for HIV prevention trials and underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of ethical and practical challenges.},

  abstract     = {Platform trials are multi-arm designs that simultaneously evaluate multiple treatments for a single disease within the same overall trial structure. Unlike traditional randomized controlled trials, they allow treatment arms to enter and exit the trial at distinct times while maintaining a control arm throughout. This control arm comprises both concurrent controls, where participants are randomized concurrently to either the treatment or control arm, and non-concurrent controls, who enter the trial when the treatment arm under study is unavailable. While flexible, platform trials introduce the challenge of using non-concurrent controls, raising questions about estimating treatment effects. Specifically, which estimands should be targeted? Under what assumptions can these estimands be identified and estimated? Are there any efficiency gains? In this article, we discuss issues related to the identification and estimation assumptions of common choices of estimand. We conclude that the most robust strategy to increase efficiency without imposing unwarranted assumptions is to target the concurrent average treatment effect (cATE), the ATE among only concurrent units, using a covariate-adjusted doubly robust estimator. Our studies suggest that, for the purpose of obtaining efficiency gains, collecting important prognostic variables is more important than relying on non-concurrent controls. We also discuss the perils of targeting ATE due to an untestable extrapolation assumption that will often be invalid. We provide simulations illustrating our points and an application to the ACTT platform trial, resulting in a 20% improvement in precision compared to the naive estimator that ignores non-concurrent controls and prognostic variables.},

  abstract     = {In determining the accuracy of a new diagnostic test, often two steps are performed. In the first step, a case–control study is performed as an efficient but potentially biased design. In a second step, a population-based cohort study is performed as an unbiased but less efficient design. In order to accelerate diagnostic research, it has recently been suggested to combine the two designs in one seamless design. In this article, we present a more in-depth description of this idea. The seamless diagnostic accuracy study design is formally introduced by comparison with the traditional pathway, and the basic design decisions are discussed: A stopping rule and a stopping time. An appealing feature of the design is the possibility to ignore the seamless design in the final analysis, although part of the data is used already in an interim analysis. The justification for this strategy is provided by a large-scale simulation study. The simulation study suggests also that the risk of a loss of power due to using a seamless design can be limited by a reasonable choice of the futility boundaries, defining the stopping rule. We conclude that the seamless diagnostic accuracy study design seems to be ready to use. It promises to accelerate diagnostic research, in particular if population-based cohort studies can be started without great efforts and if the reference standard can be evaluated with little delay.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive seamless design, which integrates phases II and III into a single trial comprising two stages, is garnering increasing interest in the efficient drug development. The first stage involves selecting promising treatment group(s), followed by comparing the efficacy between the selected and control groups in the second stage. This study focused on a two-stage adaptive seamless design where treatment selection is based on a short-term binary endpoint, while the comparison is based on a long-term binary endpoint. Recently, exact and mid- p $$ p $$ tests were proposed in this setting. However, treatment effects at the second stage were estimated using the conventional maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), leading to upward bias owing to treatment selection. We propose the conditional mean-adjusted estimator (CMAE) and uniformly minimum variance conditional unbiased estimator (UMVCUE) to address the bias in this setting. Additionally, confidence intervals for exact and mid- tests were constructed using the Clopper-Pearson method. Simulation studies were performed to compare the six inference methods defined by combinations of the three estimators and two statistical tests. The simulation results showed that MLE of the treatment effect at the second stage exhibited a notable bias, while CMAE and UMVCUE substantially reduced the bias. The exact test was conservative in terms of the type-I error rate of the comparison at the second stage, while the mid- test yielded results close to the nominal level. In conclusion, we recommend statistical inferences based on the CMAE + mid- test or UMVCUE + mid- test in our setting.},

  abstract     = {Based on data from a randomized, controlled vaccine efficacy trial, this article develops statistical methods for assessing vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent COVID-19 infections by a discrete set of genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2. Strain-specific VE adjusting for possibly time-varying covariates is estimated using augmented inverse probability weighting to address missing viral genotypes under a competing risks model that allows separate baseline hazards for different risk groups. Hypothesis tests are developed to assess whether the vaccine provides at least a specified level of VE against some viral genotypes and whether VE varies across genotypes. Asymptotic properties providing analytic inferences are derived and finite-sample properties of the estimators and hypothesis tests are studied through simulations. This research is motivated by the fact that previous analyses of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy did not account for missing genotypes, which can cause severe bias and efficiency loss. The theoretical properties and simulations demonstrate superior performance of the new methods. Application to the Moderna COVE trial identifies several SARS-CoV-2 genotype features with differential vaccine efficacy across genotypes, including lineage (Reference, Epsilon, Gamma, Zeta), indicators of residue match vs. mismatch to the vaccine-strain residue at Spike amino acid positions (identifying signatures of differential VE), and a weighted Hamming distance to the vaccine strain. The results show VE decreases against genotypes more distant from the vaccine strain, highlighting the need to update COVID-19 vaccine strains.},

We propose a flexible, additive mixed model for studying volume-outcome associations in health care that takes into account individual patient characteristics as well as provider-specific effects through a hierarchical approach. More specifically, we treat volume as a continuous variable, and its effect on the considered outcome is modeled as a smooth function. We take account of different case-mixes by including patient-specific risk factors and clustering on the provider level through random intercepts. This strategy enables us to extract a smooth volume effect as well as volume-independent provider effects. These two quantities can be compared directly in terms of their magnitude, which gives insight into the sources of variability of quality of care. Based on a causal DAG, we derive conditions under which the volume-effect can be interpreted as a causal effect. The paper provides confidence sets for each of the estimated quantities relying on joint estimation of all effects and parameters. Our approach is illustrated through simulation studies and an application to German health care data about mortality of very low birth weight infants.},

In research areas such as multi-center clinical trials, recurrent events, and genetic studies, proportional hazard mixed effects models (PHMMs) are used to account for correlations observed in clusters within the data. In high dimensions, proper specification of the fixed and random effects within PHMMs is difficult and computationally complex. In this paper, we approximate the proportional hazards mixed effects model with a piecewise constant hazard mixed effects survival model. We estimate the model parameters using a modified Monte Carlo expectation conditional minimization (MCECM) algorithm, allowing us to perform variable selection on both the fixed and random effects simultaneously. We also incorporate a factor model decomposition of the random effects in order to more easily scale the variable selection method to larger dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulations, and we apply our method to a multi-study pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma gene expression dataset to select features important for survival.},

  abstract     = {A common problem in numerous research areas, particularly in clinical trials, is to test whether the effect of an explanatory variable on an outcome variable is equivalent across different groups. In practice, these tests are frequently used to compare the effect between patient groups, for example, based on gender, age, or treatments. Equivalence is usually assessed by testing whether the difference between the groups does not exceed a pre-specified equivalence threshold. Classical approaches are based on testing the equivalence of single quantities, for example, the mean, the area under the curve or other values of interest. However, when differences depending on a particular covariate are observed, these approaches can turn out to be not very accurate. Instead, whole regression curves over the entire covariate range, describing for instance the time window or a dose range, are considered and tests are based on a suitable distance measure of two such curves, as, for example, the maximum absolute distance between them. In this regard, a key assumption is that the true underlying regression models are known, which is rarely the case in practice. However, misspecification can lead to severe problems as inflated type I errors or, on the other hand, conservative test procedures. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing a flexible extension of such an equivalence test using model averaging in order to overcome this assumption and making the test applicable under model uncertainty. Precisely, we introduce model averaging based on smooth Bayesian information criterion weights and we propose a testing procedure which makes use of the duality between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by means of a simulation study and illustrate its practical relevance considering a time-response case study with toxicological gene expression data.},

We then establish the asymptotic validity of the tests under relatively mild conditions and investigate finite-sample properties through simulations. The results show that our testing approach can be a valid alternative to classic methods based on the difference in the integrals of the cumulative distribution functions, which require bounded support and struggle to detect departures from the null in some cases.

The theoretical results are illustrated in a simulation study. The crude SR can be interpreted as an estimator of the hazard ratio (HR) of treatment when the allowed time between initiation of the treatment and the outcome drug is small. The HR can easily be estimated flexibly as a function of covariates, such as age and sex, using logistic regression. The crude SR implicitly adjusts for unmeasured time-invariant confounding, whereas the null-effects SR, and thereby the adjusted SR, make little sense unless treatment and outcome are strictly independent. The use of the adjusted SR should be abandoned. Another design should be used if it is infeasible to require treatment and outcome sufficiently close. The crude SR can be modeled flexibly with logistic regression to estimate covariate-dependent HRs or at least to test whether the HR depends on covariates.},

One major challenge is to determine the number of threshold effects. We first show the selection consistency of a modified Bayesian information criterion under mild conditions. It is useful sometimes but heavily depends on the penalization magnitude, which usually varies from the model configuration and data distribution. To address this issue, we leverage a cross-validation criterion alongside an order-preserved sample-splitting scheme to yield a consistent estimation. The new criterion is completely data driven without additional parameters and thus robust to model setting and data distributions. The asymptotic properties for the parameter estimates are also carefully established. Additionally, we propose an efficient score-type test to examine the existence of threshold effects. The new statistic is free of estimating any potential threshold effects and is thus suitable for multithreshold scenarios. Numerical experiments validate the reliable finite-sample performance of our methodologies, which corroborates the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Several models for count time series have been developed during the last decades, often inspired by traditional autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models for real-valued time series, including integer-valued ARMA (INARMA) and integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (INGARCH) models. Both INARMA and INGARCH models exhibit an ARMA-like autocorrelation function (ACF). To achieve negative ACF values within the class of INGARCH models, log and softplus link functions are suggested in the literature, where the softplus approach leads to conditional linearity in good approximation. However, the softplus approach is limited to the INGARCH family for unbounded counts, that is, it can neither be used for bounded counts, nor for count processes from the INARMA family. In this paper, we present an alternative solution, named the Tobit approach, for achieving approximate linearity together with negative ACF values, which is more generally applicable than the softplus approach. A Skellam–Tobit INGARCH model for unbounded counts is studied in detail, including stationarity, approximate computation of moments, maximum likelihood and censored least absolute deviations estimation for unknown parameters and corresponding simulations. Extensions of the Tobit approach to other situations are also discussed, including underlying discrete distributions, INAR models, and bounded counts. Three real-data examples are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.},

  abstract     = {The Erdös–Rényi graph is a popular choice to model network data as it is parsimoniously parameterized, straightforward to interpret and easy to estimate. However, it has limited suitability in practice, since it often fails to capture crucial characteristics of real-world networks. To check its adequacy, we propose a novel class of goodness-of-fit tests for homogeneous Erdös–Rényi models against heterogeneous alternatives that permit nonconstant edge probabilities. We allow for both asymptotically dense and sparse networks. The tests are based on graph functionals that cover a broad class of network statistics for which we derive limiting distributions in a unified manner. The resulting class of asymptotic tests includes several existing tests as special cases. Further, we propose a parametric bootstrap and prove its consistency, which avoids the often tedious variance estimation for asymptotic tests and enables performance improvements for small network sizes. Moreover, under certain fixed and local alternatives, we provide a power analysis for some popular choices of subgraph counts as goodness-of-fit test statistics. We evaluate the proposed class of tests and illustrate our theoretical findings by simulations.},

We develop a classical hypothesis test for completed epidemics which assesses whether or not there is significant within-group transmission during an outbreak. The test is based on time-ordered group labels of individuals. The null hypothesis is that of homogeneity of disease transmission among individuals, a hypothesis under which the discrete random vector of groups labels has a known sampling distribution that is independent of any model parameters. The test exhibits excellent performance when applied to various scenarios of simulated data and is also illustrated using two real-life epidemic data sets. We develop some asymptotic theory including a central limit theorem. The test is practically very appealing, being computationally cheap and straightforward to implement, as well as being applicable to a wide range of real-life outbreak settings and to related problems in other fields.},

Recently, the first inference methods for the MCV were proposed for general factorial designs. However, the inference methods are primarily derived for one special MCV variant while there are several reasonable proposals. Moreover, when rejecting a global null hypothesis, a more in-depth analysis is of interest to find the significant contrasts of MCV. This paper concerns extending the nonparametric permutation procedure to the other MCV variants and a max-type test for post hoc analysis. To improve the small sample performance of the latter, we suggest a novel bootstrap strategy and prove its asymptotic validity. The actual performance of all proposed tests is compared in an extensive simulation study and illustrated by real data analysis. All methods are implemented in the R package GFDmcv, available on CRAN.},

We find that they tend to have unsatisfactory size performances for general elliptical population. This is mainly because such population often possesses high-order correlations among their coordinates. Taking such kind of dependency into consideration, we propose necessary corrections for these tests to cope with elliptically high-dimensional data. For computational efficiency, alternative forms of the new test statistics are also provided. We derive the universal asymptotic null distributions of the proposed test statistics under elliptical distributions and beyond. The powers of the proposed tests are further investigated.

The methods that have been suggested have either an insufficient adjustment of the censoring or by assuming the the win and loss probabilities are proportional over time. The assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities will often in practice not be satisfied. In this paper, we present estimates for the win ratio, and win and loss probabilities, under independent right-censoring and derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimates. The proposed win ratio estimate does not require the assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities. The small sample properties of the proposed method are studied in a simulation study showing that the variance formula is accurate even for small samples. The method is applied on two data sets.},

Confidence intervals resulting from these asymptotic approximations and the covariance bootstrap show good finite-sample coverage. In a simulation, the power of asymptotic as well as permutation tests for independence based on our correlation measures compares favorably with competing methods based on distance correlation or rank coefficients for functional dependence, among others. Moreover, for the bivariate normal distribution, our correlation coefficients equal the absolute value of the Pearson correlation, an attractive feature for practitioners which is not shared by various competitors.

The second challenge is the convexity of the log-likelihood function. Besides these two challenges in maximizing the likelihood function, we also study the theoretical property of the two-step estimation.
