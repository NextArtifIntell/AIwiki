  abstract     = {This study presents a novel approach to crop mapping using remotely sensed satellite images. It addresses the significant classification modelling challenges, including (1) the requirements for extensive labelled data and (2) the complex optimisation problem for selection of appropriate temporal windows in the absence of prior knowledge of cultivation calendars. We compare the lightweight Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) classification method with the heavily supervised Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) using high-resolution multispectral optical satellite imagery (3Â m/pixel). Our approach integrates effective practical preprocessing steps, including data augmentation and a data-driven optimisation strategy for the temporal window, even in the presence of numerous crop classes. Our findings demonstrate that DTW, despite its lower data demands, can match the performance of CNN-LSTM through our effective preprocessing steps while significantly improving runtime. These results demonstrate that both CNN-LSTM and DTW can achieve deployment-level accuracy and underscore the potential of DTW as a viable alternative to more resource-intensive models. The results also prove the effectiveness of temporal windowing for improving runtime and accuracy of a crop classification study, even with no prior knowledge of planting timeframes.},

Similar to the human learning process with the ability of learning, fusing and accumulating new knowledge acquired at different time steps, continual learning is considered to have high practical significance. Hence, continual learning has been studied in various artificial intelligence tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the recent progress of continual learning in computer vision. In particular, the works are grouped by their representative techniques, including regularisation, knowledge distillation, memory, generative replay, parameter isolation and a combination of the above techniques. For each category of these techniques, both its characteristics and applications in computer vision are presented. At the end of this overview, several subareas, where continuous knowledge accumulation is potentially helpful while continual learning has not been well studied, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the 3D point cloud field in recent years, point cloud completion of 3D objects has increasingly attracted researchers&#39; attention. Point cloud data can accurately express the shape information of 3D objects at different resolutions, but the original point clouds collected directly by various 3D scanning equipment are often incomplete and have uneven density. Tactile is one distinctive way to perceive the 3D shape of an object. Tactile point clouds can provide local shape information for unknown areas during completion, which is a valuable complement to the point cloud data acquired with visual devices. In order to effectively improve the effect of point cloud completion using tactile information, the authors propose an innovative tactile-assisted point cloud completion network, TAPCNet. This network is the first neural network customised for the input of tactile point clouds and incomplete point clouds, which can fuse two types of point cloud information in the feature domain. Besides, a new dataset named 3DVT was rebuilt, to fit the proposed network model. Based on the tactile fusion strategy and related modules, multiple comparative experiments were conducted by controlling the quantity of tactile point clouds on the 3DVT dataset. The experimental data illustrates that TAPCNet can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in the benchmark.},

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Although some approaches have begun to investigate the robustness of 3D object detection models, they are currently generating adversarial examples in a white-box setting and there is a lack of research into generating transferable adversarial examples in a black-box setting. In this paper, a non-end-to-end attack algorithm was proposed for LiDAR pipelines that crafts transferable adversarial examples against 3D object detection. Specifically, the method generates adversarial examples by restraining features with high contribution to downstream tasks and amplifying features with low contribution to downstream tasks in the feature space. Extensive experiments validate that the method produces more transferable adversarial point clouds, for example, the method generates adversarial point clouds in the nuScenes dataset that are about 10 and 7 better than the state-of-the-art method on mAP and NDS, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In the field of 3D point cloud classification, transfer-based black-box attack strategies have been explored to address the challenge of limited knowledge about the model in practical scenarios. However, existing approaches typically rely excessively on network structure, resulting in poor transferability of the generated adversarial examples. To address the above problem, the authors propose AEattack , an adversarial attack method capable of generating highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, AEattack employs an autoencoder (AE) to extract features from the point cloud data and reconstruct the adversarial point cloud based on these features. Notably, the AE does not require pre-training, and its parameters are jointly optimised using a loss function during the process of generating adversarial point clouds. The method makes the generated adversarial point cloud not overly dependent on the network structure, but more concerned with the data distribution. Moreover, this design endows AEattack with a broader potential for application. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset show that AEattack is capable of generating highly transferable adversarial point clouds, with up to 61.8% improvement in transferability compared to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an upward trend that marine vessels, an important object category in marine monitoring, have gradually become a research focal point in the field of computer vision, such as detection, tracking, and classification. Among them, marine vessel re-identification (Re-ID) emerges as a significant frontier research topics, which not only faces the dual challenge of huge intra-class and small inter-class differences, but also has complex environmental interference in the port monitoring scenarios. To propel advancements in marine vessel Re-ID technology, SwinTransReID, a framework grounded in the Swin Transformer for marine vessel Re-ID, is introduced. Specifically, the project initially encodes the triplet images separately as a sequence of blocks and construct a baseline model leveraging the Swin Transformer, achieving better performance on the Re-ID benchmark dataset in comparison to convolution neural network (CNN)-based approaches. And it introduces side information embedding (SIE) to further enhance the robust feature-learning capabilities of Swin Transformer, thus, integrating non-visual cues (orientation and type of vessel) and other auxiliary information (hull colour) through the insertion of learnable embedding modules. Additionally, the project presents VesselReID-1656, the first annotated large-scale benchmark dataset for vessel Re-ID in real-world ocean surveillance, comprising 135,866 images of 1656 vessels along with 5 orientations, 12 types, and 17 colours. The proposed method achieves 87.1 mAP and 96.1 Rank-1 accuracy on the newly-labelled challenging dataset, which surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.9 mAP regarding to performance. Moreover, extensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SwinTransReID on the person Market-1501 dataset, vehicle VeRi-776 dataset, and Boat Re-ID vessel dataset.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian images captured by nonoverlapping visible and infrared cameras. Most existing compensation-based methods try to generate images of missing modality from the other ones. However, the generated images often fail to possess enough quality due to severe discrepancies between different modalities. Moreover, it is generally assumed that person images are roughly aligned during the extraction of part-based local features. However, this does not always hold true, typically when they are cropped via inaccurate pedestrian detectors. To alleviate such problems, the authors propose a novel feature-level compensation and alignment network (FCA-Net) for VI-ReID in this paper, which tries to compensate for the missing modality information on the channel-level and align part-based local features. Specifically, the visible and infrared features of low-level subnetworks are first processed by a channel feature compensation (CFC) module, which enforces the network to learn consistent distribution patterns of channel features, and thereby the cross-modality discrepancy is narrowed. To address spatial misalignment, a pairwise relation module (PRM) is introduced to incorporate human structural information into part-based local features, which can significantly enhance the feature discrimination power. Besides, a cross-modality part alignment loss (CPAL) is designed on the basis of a dynamic part matching algorithm, which can promote more accurate local matching. Extensive experiments on three standard VI-ReID datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that state-of-the-art performance is achieved.},

This systematic literature review examines the cutting-edge technologies in smart agriculture specifically computer vision, robotics, deep learning (DL), and Internet of Things (IoT) that are reshaping plant disease detection and management. By analysing 198 studies published between 2021 and 2023, from an initial pool of 19,838 papers, the authors reveal the dominance of DL, particularly with datasets such as PlantVillage, and highlight critical challenges, including dataset limitations, lack of geographical diversity, and the scarcity of real-world field data.

This work addresses these challenges through synthetic-to-real style transfer leveraging diffusion models.

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration is a crucial aspect of computer vision and 3D reconstruction. Traditional registration methods often depend on global features or iterative optimisation, leading to inefficiencies and imprecise outcomes when processing complex scene point cloud data. To address these challenges, the authors introduce a principal direction-guided local voxelisation structural feature (PDLVSF) approach for point cloud registration. This method reliably identifies feature points regardless of initial positioning. Approach begins with the 3D Harris algorithm to extract feature points, followed by determining the principal direction within the feature points&#39; radius neighbourhood to ensure rotational invariance. For scale invariance, voxel grid normalisation is utilised to maximise the point cloud&#39;s geometric resolution and make it scale-independent. Cosine similarity is then employed for effective feature matching, identifying corresponding feature point pairs and determining transformation parameters between point clouds. Experimental validations on various datasets, including the real terrain dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Results indicate superior performance in root mean square error (RMSE) and registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high noise, limited overlap, and significant initial pose rotation. The real terrain dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/black-2000/Real-terrain-data .},

  abstract     = {Egocentric action anticipation involves predicting future actions performed by the camera wearer from egocentric video. Although the task has recently gained attention in the research community, current approaches often assume that input videos are âtrimmedâ, meaning that a short video sequence is sampled a fixed time before the beginning of the action. However, trimmed action anticipation has limited applicability in real-world scenarios, where it is crucial to deal with âuntrimmedâ video inputs and the exact moment of action initiation cannot be assumed at test time. To address these limitations, an untrimmed action anticipation task is proposed, which, akin to temporal action detection, assumes that the input video is untrimmed at test time, while still requiring predictions to be made before actions take place. The authors introduce a benchmark evaluation procedure for methods designed to address this novel task and compare several baselines on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset. Through our experimental evaluation, testing a variety of models, the authors aim to better understand their performance in untrimmed action anticipation. Our results reveal that the performance of current models designed for trimmed action anticipation is limited, emphasising the need for further research in this area.},

Existing blood cell detection methods suffer from low accuracy, which is caused by the uneven distribution, high density, and mutual occlusion of different blood cell types in blood microscope images, this article introduces NBCDC-YOLOv8: a new framework to improve blood cell detection and classification based on YOLOv8. Our framework innovates on several fronts: it uses Mosaic data augmentation to enrich the dataset and add small targets, incorporates a space to depth convolution (SPD-Conv) tailored for cells that are small and have low resolution, and introduces the Multi-Separated and Enhancement Attention Module (MultiSEAM) to enhance feature map resolution. Additionally, it integrates a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) for effective multi-scale feature fusion and includes four detection heads to improve recognition accuracy of various cell sizes, especially small target platelets. Evaluated on the Blood Cell Classification Dataset (BCCD), NBCDC-YOLOv8 obtains a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.7%, and thus surpasses the original YOLOv8n by 2.3%.},

Humans can effortlessly recognise visual patterns, including lines, circles, and even characters, from image data that has been corrupted or degraded. In this paper, the authors investigate a robust classification method that extends the classical paradigm of robust geometric model fitting. The method views an image as a set of points in a low-dimensional space and analyses each image through low-dimensional geometric model fitting. In contrast, the majority of other methods, such as deep learning methods, treat an image as a single point in a high-dimensional space. The authors evaluate the performance of the method using a noisy Omniglot dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more robust than other methods.

To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel approach to 3D HPE, termed the Spatial Mamba Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) Former (SMGNFormer). The proposed method utilises the Mamba architecture to extract spatial information from 2D keypoints and integrates GCNs with multi-head attention mechanisms to build a relational graph of 2D keypoints across a global receptive field. The outputs are subsequently processed by a Time-Frequency Feature Fusion Transformer to estimate 3D human poses. SMGNFormer demonstrates superior estimation performance on the Human3.6M dataset and real-world video data compared to most Transformer-based algorithms.

This, together with large image volumes collected using camera traps and crowdsourcing, opens novel possibilities to study animal populations. For many species, the re-identification can be done by analysing the permanent fur, feather, or skin patterns that are unique to each individual. In this paper, the authors study pattern feature aggregation based re-identification and consider two ways of improving accuracy: (1) aggregating pattern image features over multiple images and (2) combining the pattern appearance similarity obtained by feature aggregation and geometric pattern similarity. Aggregation over multiple database images of the same individual allows to obtain more comprehensive and robust descriptors while reducing the computation time. On the other hand, combining the two similarity measures allows to efficiently utilise both the local and global pattern features, providing a general re-identification approach that can be applied to a wide variety of different pattern types. In the experimental part of the work, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising re-identification accuracies for Saimaa ringed seals and whale sharks without species-specific training or fine-tuning.},

In MMF-Net, firstly, the bone length estimation module and the trajectory multi-level fusion module are used to extract the geometric size information of the human body and multi-level trajectory information of human motion, respectively. Then, the fusion attention-based combination (FABC) module is used to extract multi-level topological structure information of the human body, and effectively fuse topological structure information, geometric size information and trajectory information.

Our key contribution is a dual-branch architecture that separately extracts geometric features from LiDAR and texture features from images. These features are then fused in a BEV perspective to achieve a comprehensive representation of the tracked object. A significant innovation in our approach is the Image-to-LiDAR Adapter module, which transfers the rich feature representation capabilities of the image modality to the 3D tracking task, and the BEV-Fusion module, which facilitates the interactive fusion of geometry and texture features. By validating MILT on public datasets, we demonstrate substantial performance improvements over traditional methods, effectively showcasing the advantages of our multi-modal fusion strategy.

The unstructured nature of point cloud data, along with data sparsity, irregular point distribution, and varying sizes of urban objects, presents challenges in point cloud classification. To address these challenges, development of robust algorithmic approach encompassing efficient feature sets and classification model are essential. This study incorporates point-wise features to capture the local spatial context of points in datasets. Furthermore, an ensemble machine learning model based on extreme boosting is utilised, which integrates sequential training for weak learners, to enhance the modelâs resilience. To thoroughly investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach, this study utilises three distinct datasets from diverse geographical locations, each presenting unique challenges related to class distribution, 3D terrain intricacies, and geographical variations. The Land-cover Diversity Index is introduced to quantify the complexity of landcover in 3D by measuring the degree of class heterogeneity and the frequency of class variation in the dataset. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 90% on the regionally complex, higher landcover diversity dataset, Trivandrum Aerial LiDAR Dataset. Furthermore, the results of the study demonstrate improved overall predictive accuracy of 91% and 87% on data segments from two benchmark datasets, DALES and Vaihingen 3D.},

In this paper, the authors present an unsupervised auto-encoder-based network trained by one-class learning that inputs RGB image sequences recorded by egocentric cameras to detect abnormal activities of the camera wearers themselves. To improve the performance of network, the authors introduce a âre-encodingâ architecture and a regularisation loss function term, minimising the KL divergence between the distributions of features extracted by the first and second encoders. Unlike the common use of KL divergence loss to obtain a feature distribution close to an already-known distribution, the aim is to encourage the features extracted by the second encoder to have a close distribution to those extracted from the first encoder. The authors evaluate the proposed method on the Epic-Kitchens-55 dataset and conduct an ablation study to analyse the functions of different components. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the comparison methods in all cases and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed re-encoding architecture and the regularisation term.},

  abstract     = {In ecology, deep learning is improving the performance of camera-trap image based wild animal analysis. However, high labelling cost becomes a big challenge, as it requires involvement of huge human annotation. For example, the Snapshot Serengeti (SS) dataset contains over 900,000 images, while only 322,653 contains valid animals, 68,000 volunteers were recruited to provide image level labels such as species, the no. of animals and five behaviour attributes such as standing, resting and moving etc. In contrast, the Gold Standard SS Bounding-Box Coordinates (GSBBC for short) contains only 4011 images for training of object detection algorithms, as the annotation of bounding-box for animals in the image, is much more costive. Such a no. of training images, is obviously insufficient. To address this, the authors propose a method to generate bounding-boxes for a larger dataset using limited manually labelled images. To achieve this, the authors first train a wild animal detector using a small dataset (e.g. GSBBC) that is manually labelled to locate animals in images; then apply this detector to a bigger dataset (e.g. SS) for bounding-box generation; finally, we remove false detections according to the existing label information of the images. Experiments show that detector trained with images whose bounding-boxes are generated using the proposal, outperformed the existing camera-trap image based animal detection, in terms of mean average precision (mAP). Compared with the traditional data augmentation method, our method improved the mAP by 21.3% and 44.9% for rare species, also alleviating the long-tail issue in data distribution. In addition, detectors trained with the proposed method also achieve promising results when applied to classification and counting tasks, which are commonly required in wildlife research.},

Mainstream approaches encompass rule-based and deep learning-based methods for spatial-temporal relationship modelling. While the former relies on physical motion laws, offering wider applicability but yielding suboptimal results for complex object movements, the latter, though achieving high-performance, lacks interpretability and involves complex module designs. This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatial-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilised to model spatial-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularisation losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatial-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks&#39; performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.},

  abstract     = {Camera pose estimation plays a crucial role in computer vision, which is widely used in augmented reality, robotics and autonomous driving. However, previous studies have neglected the presence of outliers in measurements, so that even a small percentage of outliers will significantly degrade precision. In order to deal with outliers, this paper proposes using a graduated non-convexity (GNC) method to suppress outliers in robust camera pose estimation, which serves as the core of GNCPnP. The authors first reformulate the camera pose estimation problem using a non-convex cost, which is less affected by outliers. Then, to apply a non-minimum solver to solve the reformulated problem, the authors use the Black-Rangarajan duality theory to transform it. Finally, to address the dependence of non-convex optimisation on initial values, the GNC method was customised according to the truncated least squares cost. The results of simulation and real experiments show that GNCPnP can effectively handle the interference of outliers and achieve higher accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the camera pose estimation accuracy of GNCPnP in the case of a low percentage of outliers is almost comparable to that of the state-of-the-art algorithm in the case of no outliers.},

  abstract     = {The accurate detection of moving objects is essential in various applications of artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of intelligent surveillance systems. However, the moving cast shadow detection significantly decreases the precision of moving object detection because they share similar motion characteristics. To address the issue, the authors propose an innovative approach to detect moving cast shadows by combining the hybrid feature with a broad learning system (BLS). The approach involves extracting low-level features from the input and background images based on colour constancy and texture consistency principles that are shown to be highly effective in moving cast shadow detection. The authors then utilise the BLS to create a hybrid feature and BLS uses the extracted low-level features as input instead of the original data. BLS is an innovative form of deep learning that can map input to feature nodes and further enhance them by enhancement nodes, resulting in more compact features for classification. Finally, the authors develop an efficient and straightforward post-processing technique to improve the accuracy of moving object detection. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalisation ability, the authors conduct extensive experiments on public ATON-CVRR and CDnet datasets to verify the superior performance of our method by comparing with representative approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recently, visual-language models (VLMs) have displayed potent capabilities in the field of computer vision. Their emerging trend as the backbone of visual tasks necessitates studying class incremental learning (CIL) issues within the VLM architecture. However, the pre-training data for many VLMs is proprietary, and during the incremental phase, old task data may also raise privacy issues. Moreover, replay-based methods can introduce new problems like class imbalance, the selection of data for replay and a trade-off between replay cost and performance. Therefore, the authors choose the more challenging rehearsal-free settings. In this paper, the authors study class-incremental tasks based on the large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP model. Initially, at the category level, the authors combine traditional optimisation and distillation techniques, utilising both pre-trained models and models trained in previous incremental stages to jointly guide the training of the new model. This paradigm effectively balances the stability and plasticity of the new model, mitigating the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, utilising the VLM infrastructure, the authors redefine the relationship between instances. This allows us to glean fine-grained instance relational information from the a priori knowledge provided during pre-training. The authors supplement this approach with an entropy-balancing method that allows the model to adaptively distribute optimisation weights across training samples. The authorsâ experimental results validate that their method, within the framework of VLMs, outperforms traditional CIL methods.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting middle-aged and elderly populations. Its insidious onset, high disability rate, long diagnostic cycle, and high diagnostic costs impose a heavy burden on patients and their families. Leveraging artificial intelligence, with its rapid diagnostic speed, high accuracy, and fatigue resistance, to achieve intelligent assisted diagnosis of PD holds significant promise for alleviating patients&#39; financial stress, reducing diagnostic cycles, and helping patients seize the golden period for early treatment. This paper proposes an Attention and Multi-level Enhancement Fusion Network (AMEF-Net) based on the characteristics of three-dimensional medical imaging and the specific manifestations of PD in medical images. The focus is on small lesion areas and structural lesion areas that are often overlooked in traditional deep learning models, achieving multi-level attention and processing of imaging information. The model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 98.867%, a precision of 99.830%, a sensitivity of 99.182%, and a specificity of 99.384% on Magnetic Resonance Images from the Parkinson&#39;s Progression Markers Initiative dataset. On Diffusion Tensor Images, it achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 99.602%, a precision of 99.930%, a sensitivity of 99.463%, and a specificity of 99.877%.

  abstract     = {The utilisation of domain adaptation methods facilitates the resolution of classification challenges in an unlabelled target domain by capitalising on the labelled information from source domains. Unfortunately, previous domain adaptation methods have focused mostly on global domain adaptation and have not taken into account class-specific data, which leads to poor knowledge transfer performance. The study of class-level domain adaptation, which aims to precisely match the distributions of different domains, has garnered attention in recent times. However, existing investigations into class-level alignment frequently align domain features either directly on or in close proximity to classification boundaries, resulting in the creation of uncertain samples that could potentially impair classification accuracy. To address the aforementioned problem, we propose a new approach called metric-guided class-level alignment (MCA) as a solution to this problem. Specifically, we employ different metrics to enable the network to acquire supplementary information, thereby enhancing class-level alignment. Moreover, MCA can be effectively combined with existing domain-level alignment methods to successfully mitigate the challenges posed by domain shift. Extensive testing on commonly-used public datasets shows that our method outperforms many other cutting-edge domain adaptation methods, showing significant gains over baseline performance.},

  abstract     = {Video prediction is the process of learning necessary information from historical frames to predict future video frames. Learning features from historical frames is a crucial step in this process. However, most current methods have a relatively single-scale learning approach, even if they learn features at different scales, they cannot fully integrate and utilise them, resulting in unsatisfactory prediction results. To address this issue, a hierarchical multi-scale fusion unit (HMSFU) is proposed. By using a hierarchical multi-scale architecture, each layer predicts future frames at different granularities using different convolutional scales. The abstract features from different layers can be fused, enabling the model not only to capture rich contextual information but also to expand the model&#39;s receptive field, enhance its expressive power, and improve its applicability to complex prediction scenarios. To fully utilise the expanded receptive field, HMSFU incorporates three fusion modules. The first module is the single-layer historical attention fusion module, which uses an attention mechanism to fuse the features from historical frames into the current frame at each layer. The second module is the single-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses complementary temporal and spatial features at each layer. The third module is the multi-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses spatiotemporal features from different layers. Additionally, the authors not only focus on the frame-level error using mean squared error loss, but also introduce the novel use of KullbackâLeibler (KL) divergence to consider inter-frame variations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed HMSFU model achieves the best performance on popular video prediction datasets, showcasing its remarkable competitiveness in the field.},
