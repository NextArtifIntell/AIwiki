  abstract     = {Halide perovskites have gained significant attention due to their tunable bandgaps and environmentally friendly properties, making them strong candidates for advanced optoelectronic applications. In this study, we employed the FP-LAPW method to explore the structural, electronic, and optical properties of Na 2 LiZF 6 (Z = Ir and Rh). Our findings confirm the stability of the cubic phase through a Goldschmidt tolerance factor of 0.99 and negative formation energies of −3.34 Ry for Na 2 LiIrF 6 and −3.22 Ry for Na 2 LiRhF 6 . Additionally, phonon dispersion analysis verifies their dynamic stability. Mechanical analysis indicates that these materials are structurally robust, with bulk moduli of 84.21 and 80.48 GPa, while their ductile nature is supported by Pugh&#39;s ratios of 2.21 and 2.41, respectively. From an electronic perspective, both compounds exhibit indirect bandgaps of 4.05 and 3.98 eV, making them suitable for UV applications. Optical studies further reveal strong UV absorption, with static dielectric constants of 1.42 and 1.50, along with refractive indices ( n (0)) of 1.19 and 1.22. These characteristics make Na 2 LiZF 6 (Z = Ir and Rh) promising candidates for next-generation UV photodetectors and light-emitting devices.},

Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we examine TAMRA UV absorption spectra together with TAMRA-labeled peptides (Arg 9 , Arg 4 , Lys 9 ). We found that DFT calculations with different functionals underestimate TAMRA maximum UV absorption peak by ~100 nm, resulting in the maximum at ca. 450 nm instead of the experimental value of ca. 550 nm. However, incorporating MD simulation snapshots of TAMRA in water, the UV maximum peak shifts and is in close agreement with the experimental results due to the rotation of TAMRA N(CH 3 ) 2 groups, effectively captured in MD simulations. The method is used to estimate the UV absorption spectra of TAMRA-labeled peptides, matching experimental values.},

Further simulations reveal that the molecule shows ultrafast internal conversion in the triplet manifold, similar to its singlet dynamics. Apart from these decay processes in the Franck-Condon region, this molecule can display thiol proton transfer via multiple singlet states due to low barrier energies along the reaction coordinate. The S 1 -T 4 and S 3 -T 5 /T 6 crossings upon the S-H coordinate&#39;s elongation illustrate that the molecule can also show the triplet formation outside the Franck-Condon region.},

  abstract     = {Computational investigations of Inverted Singlet-Triplet (INVEST) emitters often rely on ADC(2) and TD-DFT excitation energies (EEs) obtained with the vertical approximation. Here, we first considered several cyclazine derivatives and examine the sensitivity of vertical EEs (VEEs) as well as singlet-triplet gaps, ΔE S1T1 gaps, to the level at which the ground state (S 0 ) structure was optimized. For cyclazine, VEEs and vertical gaps from ADC(2) or TD-DFT are spread over a narrow range (&lt; 0.064 eV) whether the S 0 structure is optimized with various DFT, CCSD, and RI-MP2 methods. However, for asymmetric cyclazines, depending on the protocol for optimizing S 0 structures, not only are VEEs spread over a substantially wider range (up to 0.75 eV) but so are vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps (up to 0.30 eV), leading to cases where, with different S 0 structures, one obtains positive vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps or significantly negative gaps. We relate this behavior to the introduction of significant asymmetry and bond-length variations in the cyclazine derivatives, formed by ligand functionalization or modification of the cyclazine core. On a more positive note, adiabatic EEs (AEEs) and adiabatic ΔE S1T1 gaps display significantly lower sensitivity (7–30× less) to the geometry optimization protocols than their vertical analogs. Crucially, for cyclazine, the M06-HF functional with 100% non-local exchange provides the closest S 0 geometry to available CCSD(T) data. We show that this effect exists also for other frameworks (e.g., azulene, pentaazaphenalene, and non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons) that have been considered for the INVEST property, with VEEs spread over a broader range of up to 1.19 eV and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps over a range of 0.62 eV. For INVEST emitters, it is therefore extremely important to judiciously choose the computational protocol for optimizing ground state geometries, in computing VEEs and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps.},

  abstract     = {Cytochrome c nitrite reductase (CcNiR) activates nitrite and produces ammonia. It is one of several enzymes that use a redox-active cofactor to perform its reaction. In this case, the cofactor has a heme with a lysine as the proximal ligand and a charged nearby arginine. The role of a tyrosine, which is also close, has been less clear. There are also four bis-histidine-ligated hemes involved in the electron transfers. CcNiR has been studied before, using essentially the same methods as here. However, the mechanism is very complicated, involving six reductions, and quite different results for the mechanism have been obtained here. For example, the tyrosine has here been found to be redox active in the final step when ammonia is produced. Also, the arginine has here been found to stay protonated throughout the mechanism, which is different from what was found in the previous study. The present results are in very good agreement with experimental findings and are, therefore, another case where the methodology has been shown to work very well. Previous examples include Photosystem II and Nitrogenase, normally considered to be the most important enzymes in nature for the development of life.},

  abstract     = {The band center of d orbitals ( d -band center) has been widely used as an effective descriptor for analyzing material properties. However, in high-entropy nanoalloys, the diverse atomic environments present challenges in systematically exploring all possible combinations. Due to computational resource limitations, generating a sufficient number of samples is infeasible. Consequently, the d -band center should be treated as a response variable in machine-learning models. We calculated the d -band center for individual atoms and applied supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing its behavior. While several factors were identified, their physical significance in predicting d -band centers remained unclear. To address this issue, we incorporated various interatomic distance terms as descriptors, along with element-based coordination numbers (ECN). The resulting model closely resembled the overlap integral of the Slater-type orbital, and the regression coefficients of the ECN exhibited sensitivity to the effective principal quantum number and nuclear charge. Understanding the physical significance of these descriptors is crucial for improving property predictions and facilitating data collection on novel materials.},

A strict conceptual distinction between cause and effect is recommended.

The dataset, containing 300 randomly selected elementary gas-phase reactions, was assembled using accurate DFT (ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP) values for activation energies E a from a database alongside semi-empirical computations. For accurate predictions, this approach required the inclusion of both physical organic and geometric/empirical descriptors in the training procedure. The best two ML models demonstrated efficient E a prediction capability, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.314 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.992 (Model 3) and (MAE) of 1.949 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.979 (Model 2) in validation tests. Notably, this performance approaches the threshold of “chemical accuracy” of 1 kcal mol −1 .

The focus is on proton affinity predictions to assess the influences of computational parameters. NEO-DFT incorporates nuclear quantum effects for protons involved in protonation processes. Using a test set of 72 molecules with experimental proton affinities as reference, we evaluated various exchange-correlation functionals, finding that B3LYP-based functionals deliver the most accurate results. Among the tested functionals, CAM-B3LYP performs the best with an MAD value of 6.2 kJ/mol with respect to experimental data. In NEO-DFT, electron-proton correlation (epc) functionals were assessed, with LDA-type epc17-2 yielding comparable results to the GGA-type epc19 functional. Compared to traditional DFT (MAD value of 31.6 kJ/mol), which treats nuclei classically, NEO-DFT provides enhanced accuracy for proton affinities when electron-proton correlation is included. Regarding basis sets, the def2-QZVP electronic basis set achieved the highest accuracy with an MAD value of 5.0 kJ/mol, though at a higher computational cost compared to def2-TZVP and def2-SVP, while nuclear basis sets showed minimal impact on proton affinity accuracy and no consistent trend. Overall, this study demonstrates NEO-DFT&#39;s efficacy in addressing nuclear quantum effects for proton affinity predictions, providing guidance on optimal parameter selection for future NEO-DFT applications.},

This work introduces the X2-PEC method, that is, the second generalization of the X1 series of ANN methods developed in our group, utilizing pair energy correction (PEC). The essence of the X2 model lies in its feature vector construction, using overlap integrals and core Hamiltonian integrals to incorporate physical and chemical information into the feature vectors to describe atomic interactions. It aims to enhance the accuracy of low-rung density functional theory (DFT) calculations, such as those from the widely used BLYP/6-31G(d) or B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) methods, to the level of top-rung DFT calculations, such as those from the highly accurate doubly hybrid XYGJ-OS/GTLarge method. Trained on the QM9 dataset, X2-PEC excels in predicting the atomization energies of isomers such as C 6 H 8 and C 4 H 4 N 2 O with varying bonding structures. The performance of the X2-PEC model on standard enthalpies of formation for datasets such as G2-HCNOF, PSH36, ALKANE28, BIGMOL20, and HEDM45, as well as a HCNOF subset of BH9 for reaction barriers, is equally commendable, demonstrating its good generalization ability and predictive accuracy, as well as its potential for further development to achieve greater accuracy. These outcomes highlight the practical significance of the X2-PEC model in elevating the results from lower-rung DFT calculations to the level of higher-rung DFT calculations through deep learning.},

Not only for unraveling important features of cancer development, a disease that affects the lives of many people worldwide, but also to understand drug–target interactions in a more real scenario, which can help to combat this disease. Therefore, aiming to contribute to new strategies against cancer, the present work used this approach to investigate the spectroscopy of 2-(2′-hydroxy-4′-aminophenyl)benzothiazole (HABT) when interacting with the PI3K enzyme, a widely associated target for the mentioned illness. The study consisted of evaluating the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) performance of HABT, in spectroscopic terms, when interacting with the PI3K enzyme in a local nonequilibrium regime. This scenario could be considered by investigating the metastable states of HABT in this system. From this, it was possible to observe that the ESIPT performance of HABT considerably differs when comparing the solution and protein environments, where 63% have appropriate geometry in the protein environment, against 97% in the aqueous environment. Thus, from an entirely theoretical methodology, the present work provides insights when modeling biological systems and contributes significantly to a better comprehension of promising probes for cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Normally, carbocations and carbanions of hydrocarbons react to form a C  C σ bond. However, if the ions are very stable with a large steric repulsion between them, one can also have the formation of an ion pair, generally much less stable than the covalent form. For an extremely large steric repulsion in the covalent form, the ion pair can become the most stable form, even in the gas phase. DFT and CASSCF calculations indicate that the tert-butylfulleride anion and the tris[1-(5-isopropyl-3,8-dimethylazulenyl)]-cyclopropenylium cation form an ion pair. This is the first study of this ion pair, although it is the building block of a salt that has already been synthesized. DFT results indicate that this ion pair is considerably more stable than its covalent counterpart. Nevertheless, several properties of the ionic and covalent forms are similar. An energy decomposition analysis indicates the polarization, electrostatic, and dispersion terms as the most important attractive terms between the ions.},

  abstract     = {Some years ago, we proved that Variational Coupled Cluster Singles (VCCS) theory can be effectively used to solve the independent particle model, which gave rise to a diagonalization-free self-consistent-field approach. The resulting formulation enables a solution with “a priori” localized orbitals. In the current contribution, we have explored this still unexplored possibility. Starting molecular orbitals were either localized using the Pipek-Mezey procedure or via an incomplete Cholesky decomposition of the density matrix. The Hartree-Fock solution was obtained within a VCCS iterative procedure, with the starting localized molecular orbitals used for the creation of the reference and the singly excited determinants. The same localized basis was kept in each iteration. For a series of medium-sized molecules, we have investigated the convergence behavior of the iterative procedure together with the sparsity of the single-excitation amplitude vector and the corresponding density matrix expressed in the localized basis.},

  abstract     = {De-excitations play a prominent role within the mathematical formalism of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and other excited-state response methods. However, their physical meaning remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. It is the purpose of this work to shed new light on this issue. The main thesis developed here is that de-excitations are not a peculiarity of TDDFT but that they are a more fundamental property of the underlying wave functions reflecting how electrons are excited between partially occupied orbitals. The paraquinodimethane (pQDM) molecule is chosen as a convenient model system whose open-shell character can be modulated via twisting of its methylene groups. Using the one-electron transition density matrix as a rigorous basis for our analysis, we highlight qualitative and quantitative parallels in the way that de-excitations are reflected in multireference wave function and TDDFT computations. As a physically observable consequence, we highlight a lowering of the transition dipole moment that derives from destructive interference between the excitation and de-excitation contributions. In summary, we hope that this work will shed new light on formal and practical aspects regarding the application of TDDFT to excited-state computations, especially of diradicaloid systems.},

In 1990, a paper was published in which the physical causes for the rotational barrier in ethane, that is, the well-known finding that the potential energy in the eclipsed form is slightly higher than in the staggered form, appears as a consequence of a lowering of the nuclear-electron attraction and not as a greater electronic repulsion in the eclipsed form. Surprisingly, this finding has practically not found its way neither into the textbook literature nor into the scientific discourse. Here we will show, by a careful analysis of the components to the total energy and their dependence on the geometry of the molecule, that the kinetic energy of the electrons and the virial theorem play the decisive role.

We simulate the electron/hole dynamics at frozen nuclei by propagating the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the space of time-dependent density-functional-theory pseudo-eigenstates in the tight-binding approximation. We have taken into account a cluster with two layers of Pd and and atoms per layer (2L3 and 2L4, respectively) or with three layers and atoms per layer (3L3). For all the systems, a net negative charge on HCOO has been found, according to a photoinduced direct charge-transfer mechanism. For 3L3, an indirect charge-transfer mechanism, occurring after 50 fs and inducing a hole injection into HCOO, has also been found. Moreover, we also used a tailored pulse to populate the antibonding molecular orbital localized on the C-H bond for 3L3.},

This density functional theory (DFT) study investigates the formation of ladderenes via gold(I)-catalyzed alkyne-alkene coupling reactions. Our calculations reveal a step-wise chain propagation mechanism where the alkene product of each step reacts with a ligand-gold-alkyne complex, leading to the sequential addition of cyclobutene units. We demonstrate that electron-withdrawing substituents on the alkynes, such as chlorine, facilitate the dissociation of the gold catalyst (PMe 3 Au + ) from the cyclobutene adduct, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Solvent effects are also shown to significantly influence the reaction energetics. This finding highlights the significant impact of alkyne substitution on the catalytic cycle. The inherent exothermicity of ladderene formation, coupled with their unique structural features, suggests their potential for storing energy in the form of “covalently condensed acetylene”.},

Photostatins (PSTs) are photoswitchable analogs of combretastatin A-4 (CA4), designed to inhibit tubulin polymerization for cancer treatment. However, the influence of substituents and molecular environments on their photochemistry remains unclear. In this work, the cis -to- trans photodynamics of five PSTs (PST1 to PST5) in the vacuum and aqueous solution were simulated using the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) coupled with correlated multireference electronic structure calculations. Four distinct minima in the same conical intersection seam were discovered, serving as nonradiative decay channels. The aqueous environment slows photoisomerization and lowers its quantum yields and changes the structures near the conical intersection seam. Substituent position and electronegativity significantly impact the isomerization kinetics by altering energy gaps between MECIs and the S 1 state at the Franck-Condon region. These findings provide useful insights into designing next-generation phototherapeutics for cancer.},

Previous models have made significant strides in analyzing B-factors by fitting experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for B-factor prediction using differential geometry theory, based on the assumption that the intrinsic properties of proteins reside on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional space of protein structures. By analyzing the mean and Gaussian curvatures of a set of low-dimensional manifolds defined by kernel functions, we develop effective and robust multiscale differential geometry (mDG) models. Our mDG model demonstrates a 27% increase in accuracy compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, by incorporating both global and local protein features, we construct a highly effective machine-learning model for the blind prediction of B-factors. Extensive least-squares approximations and machine learning-based blind predictions validate the effectiveness of the mDG modeling approach for B-factor predictions.},

We have first deduced the missing interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system within the SPICA/SDK CG force-field (CG-FF). By monitoring the electron density profiles, the orientational order parameter, and reproducing the all-atom MD-derived free energy for the insertion of ethanol from the bulk aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core of the POPC-CHOL lipid bilayer, we successfully determined all the missing non-bonding interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system. The proposed force field was applied to investigate the effect of ethanol at various concentrations on unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC and cholesterol. It was found that 40 mol% or more concentration of ethanol is required to disintegrate or rupture the POPC-CHOL vesicle membranes. While cholesterol offers some resilience against the detrimental effects of ethanol, we still observe an increase in vesicle size (swelling) and a contraction in the bilayer thickness (thinning) as ethanol concentration rises from 0 to 30 mol%. At ethanol concentrations exceeding 30 mol%, the vesicles become increasingly susceptible to disintegration due to enhanced penetration of ethanol and water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membranes.},

  abstract     = {A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) has been carried out to investigate its key photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer capable of generating singlet oxygen. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods have been used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin–orbit couplings (SOCs), respectively, in a model (mono-iodinated BODIPY) molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), method to this and similar molecules. Subsequently, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), possibly within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), using several exchange-correlation functionals has been tested on I-BODIPY against ADC(2), both employing a basis set with a two-component pseudopotential on the iodine atoms. Finally, the magnitudes of SOC between excited electronic states of all types found have thoroughly been discussed using the Slater–Condon rules applied to an arbitrary one-electron one-center effective spin–orbit Hamiltonian. The geometry dependence of SOCs between the lowest-lying states has also been addressed. Based on these investigations, the TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP approaches have been selected as the methods of choice for the subsequent nuclear ensemble approach absorption spectra simulations and mixed quantum-classical trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, respectively. Two bright states in the visible spectrum of I-BODIPY have been found, exhibiting a redshift of the main peak with respect to unsubstituted BODIPY caused by the iodine substituents. Excited-state MD simulations including both non-adiabatic effects and SOCs have been performed to investigate the relaxation processes in I-BODIPY after its photoexcitation to the state. The TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a time scale comparable to internal conversions and that after an initial phase of triplet population growth a “saturation” is reached where the ratio of the net triplet to singlet populations is about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 is in qualitative agreement with the previously reported experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99 0.06.},

  abstract     = {Computational chemistry plays a crucial role in drug design and development, where accurate modeling of molecular interactions is vital in rational drug design. Among the available methods, force fields such as MMFF94 are extensively used to calculate molecular potential energies, especially for small organic molecules. However, current implementations of MMFF94 are primarily available in commercial software or as closed-source modules. Open-source packages often offer limited functionality and lack extensibility. This paper introduces JMolecular Energy (JME), a novel, open-source Java library designed to implement MMFF94 with a robust and extendable API (Application Programming Interface) that allows for access to individual energy components. Leveraging the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK), JME provides a modular framework for potential energy calculation and facilitates functionalities previously absent in CDK, such as 3D conformation energy minimization. Additionally, JME establishes a framework for tailoring force field energy terms for various applications and facilitates the integration of custom-built force fields.},

The mechanistic pathway turns from stoichiometric to catalytic upon addition of a base (2,6-lutidine), suggesting a modification of the reactive species. Herein, we report theoretical calculations to characterize the reactive species and obtain a detailed understanding of the reactivity. Since different electronic structures are possible for these high valent systems, we perform DFT calculations coupled to CCSD(T) ones using the DLPNO-CCSD(T) scheme. Our results show that the presence of a base will impact the nature of the reactive species but also the type of mechanism involved in the C  H activation.},

The ScentGraphX model captures atomic, chemical bond, and structural features of molecules through a feature encoder and a subgraph encoder. Experimental results show that the ScentGraphX model exhibits superior performance on a dataset comprising 4967 molecules, accurately predicting multi-label odor descriptors of molecules. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the ScentGraphX model excels in precision, recall, F 1, and AUCROC evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in the field of molecular odor prediction. Moreover, interpretability analysis of the model reveals the impact of various chemical functional groups on odor characteristics, and ablation studies confirm the indispensability of each module in ScentGraphX.},

  abstract     = {The defect formation energy, electronic structures, and optical properties of paraelectric phase (PE-KDP) and ferroelectric phase (FE-KDP) crystals with Y interstitial (Y i ) defects have been investigated using density function theory. The band-edge correction and FNV correction accurately determine the defect formation energies of the Y i defects in different charge states. The presence of transition energy levels in the band gap may indicate that the Y i defect has a significant impact on the properties of the FE-KDP. The +3 charged Y i defects are more stable. The electronic properties in the 2p orbital mainly contribute to the defect states in the band gap, which provides the possibility of multiphoton transition of electrons. New transparent absorption bands near 3.47 eV (357 nm) and 5.66 eV (219 nm) were calculated in PE-KDP, and the absorption bands caused by Y i defects and strong electron–phonon coupling under the FE-KDP structure showed that the light in the wavelength bands near 5.09 eV (244 nm) and 5.79 eV (214 nm) below the phase transition temperature (123 K) damaged the KDP crystal. The distortion of atoms near the defects indicates that Y i defects may be accompanied by intrinsic defects. The calculated values are highly consistent with the critical absorption observed at 355 nm in the experiment and the new absorption weak at 230 nm produced in the crystal after low-temperature X-ray irradiation, which suggests that the Y defect may be the key factor affecting the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the KDP crystal.},

NJA-CFS was designed to meet the needs of both first-time users of crystal field theory and those who require a high degree of flexibility in the choice of crystal field parameters formalisms. In this manuscript, we present the theoretical foundations of the program routines and the comparison of NJA-CFS calculation results either to experimental data or ab initio computations, proving the advantages that access to multiple CFPs formalism can bring in. We also present intuitive applications of the NJA-CFS routines to didactically valuable examples, like the projection of CF/LF splitting on real d- and f- orbitals and the calculations of Tanabe–Sugano diagrams for arbitrary symmetries and with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling.},

Traditional SFs yield their inherent shortage for idealized approximations and simplifications predicting the binding affinity. Complementarily, SFs based on deep learning (DL) have emerged as powerful tools for capturing intricate features within protein-ligand (PL) interactions. We here present a docking-score fusion strategy that integrates pose scores derived from GNINA&#39;s convolutional neural network (CNN) with traditional docking scores. Extensive validation on diverse datasets has shown that by means of multiplying Watvina docking score by CNNscore demonstrates state-of-the-art screening power. Furthermore, in a reverse practice, our docking-score fusion technique was incorporated into the virtual screening (VS) workflow aimed at identifying inhibitors of the challenging target TYK2. Two promising hits with IC 50 9.99 μM and 13.76 μM in vitro were identified from nearly 12 billion molecules.},

Additionally, structure selection from the lowest temperature PT-BOMD trajectory for further optimization is performed with a scheme based on the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). This step can be done automatically and therefore removes a human bias. The influence of parameters for the DCT and the length of the PT-BOMD simulations is investigated with regard to their impact on the result of the global optimization.},

We investigated the electronic structures of the tetravalent uranium benzyl (Bn) complex U(CH 2 Ph) 4 and its derivatives U(2-CH 2 (NC 5 H 4 )) 4 , U( o -OMeBn) 4 , U( m -OMeBn) 4 , and the bonding nature between the uranium atom and methylene carbon atom (U–C me ) using scalar-relativistic quantum chemical calculations. The structures of the four uranium benzyl derivatives identify that the electronic structures are not sensitive to meta -OMe substitution, while they are significantly sensitive to the ortho -OMe and pyridine due to the coordination of O and N to the uranium atom. The U–C me bonds have highly polarized σ-bonding with partial covalency, which are predominantly composed of U 6d and 5f orbitals. Moreover, U 6d orbitals are favored for the U–C me bonds compared with U 5f orbitals. Furthermore, there are no additional π interactions in the U( o -OMeBn) 4 and the corresponding U–C me bonds appear the strongest covalent character among the four U(IV) system. The energy decomposition analysis suggests that the electrostatic interaction plays a dominant role between uranium and ligands. Finally, the complexes U(2-CH 2 (NC 5 H 4 )) 4 and U( o -OMeBn) 4 are the most thermodynamically accessible among the four complexes based on the binding energies. This study improves our understanding of tetravalent uranium benzyl derivatives bearing uranium-saturated carbon bondings.},

  abstract     = {The infrared (IR) spectrum of meta -fluorothiophenol (mFTP) isolated in a low-temperature N 2 matrix was recorded and interpreted with the aid of B3LYP vibrational frequency calculations for both cis and trans conformers. Then, photochemical transformations in the matrix-isolated compound were triggered through UV–Vis laser irradiations and their outcomes were monitored by IR spectroscopy. Upon excitation at λ = 285 nm, thiol-to-thione phototautomerization was identified as the sole reaction pathway, leading to the formation of three thione isomers. Among them, the ortho -isomer where the hydrogen atom reattaches to the fluorine-substituted side of the aromatic ring was identified as the predominant photoproduct. Identification of the photoproducts was confirmed by comparing the emerging experimental spectra with the IR absorptions predicted for the candidate structures. The photoreaction was found to be reversible, as irradiation at λ = 405 nm partially restored the reactant. The experimental results were complemented with the application of multireference/multiconfigurational (CASSCF, CASPT2, MR-CIS) and TD-DFT (TD-M062X, ωB97XD, and τ-HCTHhyb) methods to investigate the excited state properties of mFTP, including the simulation of its UV photoabsorption spectra. A comparative analysis of the results obtained by the different methods was performed. This combined experimental and theoretical approach provided valuable insights into the photochemical behavior and electronic structure of fluorinated thiophenols.},

Spectroscopic features of CAID suggest that the tautomeric equilibrium is possible both in ground and excited state. To further elucidate this, measurements of UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded in various solvents. The ground and low-lying excited states of CAID are modeled at SOS-MP2/ADC(2) computational level. The two tautomers A and B coexist in ground state with the amount of A amounting to 90% and a dynamic equilibrium is established. However, in all excited states the tautomer B is more stable and its amount is almost 100%. Along with fluorescence from the first excited state of both tautomers, a rare case of breaking Kasha&#39;s rule—fluorescence from the third excited state of the two tautomers—has been observed. A scheme is proposed to explain the photophysical processes and photoreactions of CAID in ethanol solution.},
