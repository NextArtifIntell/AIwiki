  abstract     = {As manufacturing faces evolving customer demands, the integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks is crucial for enhancing production flexibility. In this context, the Seru Production System (SPS) has emerged as a highly adaptable production mode and emphasizes the strategic assignment of cross-trained workers, particularly in hybrid configurations combining divisional and rotating serus. This paper proposes a novel bi-objective mathematical model incorporating learning effects to minimize makespan and balance workloads among workers. With the development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) empowered big models, new breakthroughs have emerged in industrial manufacturing decision-making. These models utilize deep learning for foundational content processing and leverage reinforcement learning to optimize strategies. This process provides robust support for achieving efficient decision optimization. Building on the concepts of AIGC big models training, this study employs reinforcement learning to refine the results of multi-objective genetic algorithms, thereby improving the solution capability of the bi-objective model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively provides optimal strategies for tuning crossover and mutation operations. Additionally, numerical experiments offer insights into the formation of hybrid SPS configurations.},

The superpixel fiber flexibly exploits the local similarity at different scales and leads to significant low-rankness. In this paper, we propose the parallel HSI denoising models which simultaneously consider the local and global low-rankness of the HSI based on superpixel segmentation. In the proposed models, the non-convex but smooth log-determination function is adopted to better characterize the low-rankness of the HSI. We also propose an adaptive weighted strategy to optimize the restored HSI. An efficient iterative algorithm is developed to solve the parallel models. Several experiments verify the superior performance of the proposed approach over other competing methods.},

Accurate detection of the location and orientation of the runway can effectively assist in safe aircraft landings and avoid potential risks. However, existing runway detection methods struggle in foggy conditions due to light scattering, causing blurry images and obscuring runway details, resulting in poor detection performance. Towards this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive image-based runway boundary detection method by combining image processing and filter prediction to enhance images automatically. It leverages runway symmetry to enhance feature maps and global-local information fusion. A shape loss function based on the runway&#39;s parallel boundaries is also introduced. These developments finally endow the proposed method with robustness towards foggy conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the method&#39;s effectiveness, achieving an average IoU of 73.58 on internal datasets, surpassing other advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), renowned for its high spatial resolution, shows substantial promise in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. However, challenges such as lengthy data acquisition processes and susceptibility to noise can limit data availability and reduce classification accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the CosineGAN-transformer network (CGTNet), which integrates a dual discriminator GAN for generating high-quality synthetic data with a Transformer-based classification network. Equipped with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, this network excels at capturing the intricate spatiotemporal relationships inherent in high-resolution fNIRS signals. The dual discriminator framework ensures that both the temporal and spatial aspects of the synthetic data closely resemble the original signals, thereby enhancing data diversity and fidelity. Experimental results on a publicly available fNIRS dataset, comprising 30 participants performing motor imagery tasks (right-hand tapping, left-hand tapping, and foot tapping), demonstrate that CGTNet achieves an accuracy of 82.67%, outperforming existing methods. Key contributions of this work include the use of multi-head self-attention for refined feature extraction and a dual discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework that maintains data quality and consistency. These advancements significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of BCI systems, offering promising applications in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies.},

During the water delivery process of Renmin Canal of Dujiangyan irrigation system, the water level of the main canal changes rapidly and in a large range, which is the biggest difficulty in real-time prediction of its velocity field. Therefore, based on machine learning, this paper proposes a new method to construct a real-time velocity field prediction model, which can directly predict the velocity field of the channel according to the water level. According to this method, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology is used to simulate the target open channel, and a machine learning model that can adaptively optimize the characteristics of the velocity field data is designed as the velocity field prediction model, which is experimented in the main canal of Renmin Canal of Dujiangyan irrigation system. The results suggest that the predictions are in line with the general features of flow velocity distribution in open channels and have high precision.

Based on this design framework, a complex-type dual-integral structure ZNN (DISZNN) model with inherent linear noise suppression capability is constructed for computing dynamic complex matrix inversion (DCMI) online. The stability, convergence, and robustness of the proposed DISZNN model are ensured via rigorous theoretical analyses. In three distinct experiments involving DCMI (including cases with only imaginary parts, both real and imaginary parts, and high-dimensional scenarios), the state trajectories of the DISZNN model are well and quickly fitted to the dynamic trajectories of the theoretical solutions with very low residual errors in various linear noise environments. More specifically, the residual errors of the DISZNN model for online computation of DCMI under linear noise environments are consistently below the order of , representing one-thousandth of the residual errors in existing noise-tolerant ZNN models. Finally, the DISZNN design framework is applied to construct a controlled chaotic system of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with uncertainties and external disturbances based on real-world modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the three state errors of the controlled PMSM chaotic system converge to zero quickly and stably under various conditions (system parameters, external disturbances, and uncertainties), further highlighting the superiority and generalizability of the DISZNN design framework.},

  abstract     = {Transfer functions have a very important role in metaheuristic optimization-based feature selection algorithms as these functions map the continuous search space into binary space. The U-shaped transfer function (UTF) is one of the transfer functions used to solve the problem of feature selection. However, the UTF requires the selection of parametric values, which can vary for different types of data. To address this issue, an approach to select the parameters of the UTF has been proposed based on a time-varying adaption method, resulting in the modified U-shaped transfer function (MUTF). Furthermore, a methodology has been proposed to enhance feature selection and classification for Parkinson&#39;s disease by utilizing z-score normalization in conjunction with a modified U-shaped transfer function and the binary self-adaptive bald eagle search (MUTF-SABES) optimization algorithm. The z-score normalization has been used to mitigate issues caused by outliers. Also, the performance of the k nearest neighbor classifier is improved by selecting an optimal parameter value using the proposed MUTF-SABES algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on seven different Parkinson&#39;s disease datasets and compared with five state-of-the-art optimization algorithms: Salp Swarm algorithm, Harris Hawks optimization, equilibrium optimizer, aquilla optimizer, and Honey Badger algorithm, to evaluate its performance superiority. The results achieved using the proposed approach have been superior or analogous to the erstwhile algorithms for performance comparability. Friedman&#39;s mean rank test is used to check the statistical significance of the propounded approach. The lowest Friedman&#39;s mean rank value obtained using the proposed approach indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to become an alternative to other well-known strategies.},

In orchards, pedestrians exhibit unpredictable behavior and can pose significant challenges to navigation and operation. This demands reliable detection technologies that ensures safety while addressing the unique challenges of orchard environments, such as dense foliage, uneven terrain, and varying lighting conditions. To address this, we propose ReB-DINO, a robust and accurate orchard pedestrian detection model based on an improved DINO. Initially, we improve the feature extraction module of DINO using structural re-parameterization, enhancing accuracy and speed of the model during training and inference decoupling. In addition, a progressive feature fusion module is employed to fuse the extracted features and improve model accuracy. Finally, the network incorporates a convolutional block attention mechanism and an improved loss function to improve pedestrian detection rates. The experimental results demonstrate a 1.6% improvement in Recall on the NREC dataset compared to the baseline. Moreover, the results show a 4.2% improvement in and the number of parameters decreases by 40.2% compared to the original DINO. In the PiFO dataset, the with a threshold of 0.5 reaches 99.4%, demonstrating high detection accuracy in realistic scenarios. Therefore, our model enhances both detection accuracy and real-time object detection capabilities in apple orchards, maintaining a lightweight attributes, surpassing mainstream object detection models.},

Although such events occur less frequently than normal activities, developing automated video surveillance systems for violence detection has become essential to minimize labor and time waste. Detecting violent activity in videos is a challenging task due to the variability and diversity of violent behavior, which can involve a wide range of actions, motions, and interactions between people and objects. Currently, researchers employ deep learning models to detect violent behaviors. In fact, a large number of deep learning approaches are based on extracting spatio-temporal information from a video by exploiting a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Despite their success, these techniques require a lot more parameters than 2D CNNs and have high computational complexity. Therefore, we focus on exploiting a 2D CNN to encode spatio-temporal information. Actually, statistical features of the optical flow changes are used to give this ability to a 2D CNN. These features are designed to make attention to regions of a video clip with much more motion. Accordingly, the optical flow of an input video is calculated. To determine meaningful changes in the optical flow, the optical flow magnitude of a current frame is compared with its predecessor. After that, statistical features of these changes are extracted to summarize a video clip to a 2D template, which feeds a 2D CNN. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets observe that the suggested strategy outperforms baseline ones. In particular, we make a better estimation of the spatio-temporal features in a video by shortening a video clip into a 2D template.},

Specifically, we generate synthetic CM data and how it can be used to improve the translation performance of NMT through the data augmentation strategy. We conduct experiments on three data augmentation approaches viz. CM-Augmentation, CM-Concatenation, and Multi-Encoder approaches, and the latter two approaches are inspired by document-level NMT, where we use synthetic CM data as context to improve the performance of the NMT models. We conduct experiments on three language pairs, viz. Hindi–English, Telugu–English and Czech–English. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly improve performance over the baseline model trained without data augmentation and over the existing data augmentation strategies. The CM-Concatenation model attains the best performance.},

  abstract     = {The early detection and classification of COVID-19 is crucial for disease diagnosis and control. To reduce the need for medical professionals, fast and accurate detection approaches for COVID-19 are required. Due to environmental concerns, the quality of the image gets degraded. Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19. Thus, the performance of the deep learning (DL) techniques is diminished. Therefore, a CT image-based hybrid DL technology is presented in this article for the classification of COVID-19 disease as COVID or non-COVID or pneumonia. Initially, in the pre-processing stage, the hybrid nonlocal moment bilateral filtering (Hybrid NMBF) technique is introduced for image de-noising and re-sizing. After pre-processing, the image is fed into the feature extraction phase. Gray-level covariance matrices (GLCM) technique is used to extract the relevant features and reduce feature dimensionality issues. For the feature selection process, the enhanced Archimedes optimization algorithm (EAOA) is introduced to select optimal features. The residual channel attention-generative adversarial network (RCA-GAN) technique is introduced for image classification. Here, the hyperparameter of the network is tuned using the Sandpiper optimization (SPO) algorithm to optimize the loss function. The data set used in this research is COVID-CT-machine learning deep learning (MD), and the performance is analyzed using the MATLAB tool. In the experimental scenario, the proposed system achieves 98.3% accuracy, 98.7% specificity, 99.4% sensitivity, 97.4% F -score, and 96.1% kappa. The attained results prove that the proposed system works better than the traditional techniques.},

  abstract     = {Several companies leverage trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to offer predictive services to users. These companies capitalize on CNNs&#39; superior performance in image processing tasks, such as autonomous driving or face recognition. To safeguard data privacy and model parameters, various algorithms have been proposed. Most of them are predominantly designed using secure multi-party computation (MPC) or hardware-assisted solutions. However, certain limitations persist. First, MPC-based approaches (e.g., garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption) fail to meet rapid responsiveness requirements. Additionally, hardware-assisted solutions impose extra burdens to realize secure inference tasks. The primary reasons for these shortcomings can be summarized as follows: (1) high computation and communication delays are introduced by heavy cryptographic operations during the online phase. (2) Additional overhead for sharing triples. In this article, we propose PCIR, a secure protocol for privacy-preserving convolutional neural network inference (PCIR). PCIR aims to address the aforementioned issues based on a pre-shared secret sharing mechanism. It can achieve rapid responses to user requirements and preserve privacy of data and model for the following reasons: (1) it circumvents computationally expensive operations, such as an operation for permuting plaintext slots, which runs 56 times slower than a homomorphic addition operation, and 34 times slower than a homomorphic multiplication operation. (2) Computational operations, such as homomorphic additions or multiplications, are conducted during the pre-computation phase. It can significantly reduce the online computing costs. (3) PCIR conducts secure multiplication based on pre-shared secret shares. It results in much lower communication and computation costs compared with the use of multiplicative triples. Finally, we evaluate PCIR with benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results have shown that PCIR requires less time and less communication cost than previous methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Land coverage mapping and classification is one of the critical information-based tools for sustainable agricultural development, enabling relevant departments to carry out agricultural resource adjustments, yield predictions, and other tasks in advance. As a vital means of acquiring land cover and usage information, SAR sensors have become an important research direction due to their all-weather and all-day working capabilities. Nevertheless, traditional classification methods in PolSAR image classification often input a combination of various scattering features, i.e., high-dimensional feature combination, into classifiers, leading to mutual interference among different features and consequently degrading classification performance, especially for linear classifiers such as NRS and SVM. To mitigate this interference, this paper proposed an unsupervised feature selection based on spectral clustering (FSSC) that constructs a targeted approach by leveraging the linear expression capabilities of high-dimensional features. In this method, the linear relationships between different features are first analyzed, and the linear similarity between features can be quantitatively expressed using Pearson correlation coefficients, forming a feature similarity matrix. Subsequently, the similarity matrix undergoes unsupervised similarity partitioning through spectral clustering, dividing the features into distinct combinations. Features within clustering subsets can be considered as combinations with high linear similarity. Therefore, KL divergence is applied to select the most representative features within each cluster, and the resulting representative feature combinations from different clustering subsets are combined to form an optimal feature set, achieving the purpose of feature selection. This method maps high-dimensional feature combinations into low-dimensional ones while preserving the essential attributes of the original data, thereby retaining the valuable feature information and enhancing classification performance. Experimental outcomes conclusively show that the proposed method enhances the overall accuracy (OA) of SVM by 4.51% and the OA of NRS by 2.34% in the Flevoland Dataset, underscoring its efficacy in PolSAR image classification, especially for linear classifiers.},
