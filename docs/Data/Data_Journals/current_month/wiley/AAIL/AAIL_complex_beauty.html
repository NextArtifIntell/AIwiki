  abstract     = {The deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) panel systems, as renewable energy sources, has seen a rise recently. Consequently, it is imperative to implement efficient methods for the accurate detection and diagnosis of PV system faults to prevent unexpected power disruptions. This paper introduces a potential strategy for fault identification and classification through the utilization of machine learning (ML) techniques. The study aimed to use ML algorithms to identify and classify normal operations, seven different types of faults, in two operational modes (maximum power point tracking and intermediate power point tracking). Four machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods (decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting) were employed, followed by hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to determine the best configuration. The results indicated that ensemble methods, particularly XGBoost, excelled in detecting and classifying faults in PV systems, achieving a 99% accuracy rate after hyperparameter adjustments. The TPR values show a high sensitivity of 0.999, with some achieving a perfect score of 1.000. The FPR shows very low values, with the majority of metrics indicating FPRs at or close to 0%. This performance is crucial in the solar energy context, as failing to detect faults can result in significant energy loss and increased maintenance costs.},

  abstract     = {In spite of the high potential shown by spiking neural networks (e.g., temporal patterns), training them remains an open and complex problem. In practice, while in theory these networks are computationally as powerful as mainstream artificial neural networks, they have not reached the same accuracy levels yet. The major reason for such a situation seems to be represented by the lack of adequate training algorithms for deep spiking neural networks, since spike signals are not differentiable, that is, no direct way to compute a gradient is provided. Recently, a novel training method, based on the (digital) simulation of certain quantum systems, has been suggested. It has already shown interesting advantages, among which is the fact that no gradient is required to be computed. In this work, we apply this approach to the problem of training spiking neural networks, and we show that this recent training method is capable of training deep and complex spiking neural networks on the MNIST data set.},

  abstract     = {The study suggests using a hybrid convolutional neural networks-support vector machines architecture to extract reliable characteristics from medical images and classify them as an ensemble using four different models. Manual processing of fundus images for the automated identification of ocular disorders is laborious, error-prone, and time-consuming. This necessitates computer-assisted technologies that can automatically identify different ocular illnesses from fundus images. The interpretation of the photos also plays a massive role in the diagnosis. Automating the diagnosing procedure reduces human mistakes and helps with early cataract detection. The oneDNN library available in the oneAPI Environment provided by Intel has been used to optimize all transfer learning models for better performance. The suggested approach is verified through a range of metrics in experiments using the openly accessible Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition dataset. The MobileNet Model outperformed other transfer learning techniques with an accuracy of 0.9836.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are continuously being evaluated in more diverse contexts. However, they still have challenges when extracting information from highly specific internal technical documentation. One specific area of real-world technical documentation is telecommunications engineering, which could benefit from domain-specific LLMs. In this article, we expand the notion of Technical Language Processing (TLP) to the telecommunications domain by introducing and analyzing the format of technical specifications from a leading telecommunications equipment vendor. Additionally, we highlight the importance of use case definitions by introducing requirement property mapping for maximizing information extraction. Also, we recommend actions to mitigate the effect of the internal specifications format on information extraction, which can lead to LLM-friendly internal specifications. Finally, a PoC is built to showcase the improvements of our proposed framework.},
