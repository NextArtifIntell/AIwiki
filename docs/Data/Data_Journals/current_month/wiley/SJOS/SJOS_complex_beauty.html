  abstract     = {Conducting a meta-analysis on a body of studies subject to publication bias is a type of post-selection inference that may invalidate findings. Therefore, analysts often run a hypothesis test to check for publication bias prior to conducting a meta-analysis. However, conducting meta-analyses conditional on the outcome of such preliminary tests is itself a form of post-selection inference. We investigate the effect on the outcome of a meta-analysis of a null finding at the preliminary stage. We find that in many situations there is no or little bias in the findings at the main stage.},

Test statistics are obtained as functionals of the difference between the identity and the Lorenz P–P plot, defined as the composition between the inverse unscaled Lorenz curve of one distribution and the unscaled Lorenz curve of the other. We determine upper bounds for such test statistics under the null hypothesis and derive their limit distribution, to be approximated via bootstrap procedures. We then establish the asymptotic validity of the tests under relatively mild conditions and investigate finite-sample properties through simulations. The results show that our testing approach can be a valid alternative to classic methods based on the difference in the integrals of the cumulative distribution functions, which require bounded support and struggle to detect departures from the null in some cases. The same approach can be extended to a family of fractional-degree stochastic orders, including the first order as a limiting case.},

The mathematical properties of the crude, null-effects, and adjusted sequence ratios (SR) are analyzed in the presence of prescription time-trends and unmeasured time-invariant confounding. The theoretical results are illustrated in a simulation study. The crude SR can be interpreted as an estimator of the hazard ratio (HR) of treatment when the allowed time between initiation of the treatment and the outcome drug is small. The HR can easily be estimated flexibly as a function of covariates, such as age and sex, using logistic regression. The crude SR implicitly adjusts for unmeasured time-invariant confounding, whereas the null-effects SR, and thereby the adjusted SR, make little sense unless treatment and outcome are strictly independent. The use of the adjusted SR should be abandoned. Another design should be used if it is infeasible to require treatment and outcome sufficiently close. The crude SR can be modeled flexibly with logistic regression to estimate covariate-dependent HRs or at least to test whether the HR depends on covariates.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a novel estimation framework for the multithreshold accelerated failure time model, which has distinct linear forms within different subdomains. One major challenge is to determine the number of threshold effects. We first show the selection consistency of a modified Bayesian information criterion under mild conditions. It is useful sometimes but heavily depends on the penalization magnitude, which usually varies from the model configuration and data distribution. To address this issue, we leverage a cross-validation criterion alongside an order-preserved sample-splitting scheme to yield a consistent estimation. The new criterion is completely data driven without additional parameters and thus robust to model setting and data distributions. The asymptotic properties for the parameter estimates are also carefully established. Additionally, we propose an efficient score-type test to examine the existence of threshold effects. The new statistic is free of estimating any potential threshold effects and is thus suitable for multithreshold scenarios. Numerical experiments validate the reliable finite-sample performance of our methodologies, which corroborates the theoretical results.},

Although SW-CREs have become popular, definitions of estimands and robust methods to target estimands under the potential outcomes framework remain insufficient. To address this gap, we describe a class of estimands that explicitly acknowledge the multilevel data structure in SW-CREs and highlight three typical members of the estimand class that are interpretable. We then introduce four analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) working models to achieve estimand-aligned analyses with covariate adjustment. Each ANCOVA estimator is model-assisted, as its point estimator is consistent even when the working model is misspecified. Under the stepped wedge randomization scheme, we establish the finite population Central Limit Theorem for each estimator. We study the finite-sample operating characteristics of the ANCOVA estimators in simulations and illustrate their application by analyzing the Washington State Expedited Partner Therapy study.},

  abstract     = {Several models for count time series have been developed during the last decades, often inspired by traditional autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models for real-valued time series, including integer-valued ARMA (INARMA) and integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (INGARCH) models. Both INARMA and INGARCH models exhibit an ARMA-like autocorrelation function (ACF). To achieve negative ACF values within the class of INGARCH models, log and softplus link functions are suggested in the literature, where the softplus approach leads to conditional linearity in good approximation. However, the softplus approach is limited to the INGARCH family for unbounded counts, that is, it can neither be used for bounded counts, nor for count processes from the INARMA family. In this paper, we present an alternative solution, named the Tobit approach, for achieving approximate linearity together with negative ACF values, which is more generally applicable than the softplus approach. A Skellam–Tobit INGARCH model for unbounded counts is studied in detail, including stationarity, approximate computation of moments, maximum likelihood and censored least absolute deviations estimation for unknown parameters and corresponding simulations. Extensions of the Tobit approach to other situations are also discussed, including underlying discrete distributions, INAR models, and bounded counts. Three real-data examples are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.},

However, it has limited suitability in practice, since it often fails to capture crucial characteristics of real-world networks. To check its adequacy, we propose a novel class of goodness-of-fit tests for homogeneous Erdös–Rényi models against heterogeneous alternatives that permit nonconstant edge probabilities. We allow for both asymptotically dense and sparse networks. The tests are based on graph functionals that cover a broad class of network statistics for which we derive limiting distributions in a unified manner. The resulting class of asymptotic tests includes several existing tests as special cases. Further, we propose a parametric bootstrap and prove its consistency, which avoids the often tedious variance estimation for asymptotic tests and enables performance improvements for small network sizes. Moreover, under certain fixed and local alternatives, we provide a power analysis for some popular choices of subgraph counts as goodness-of-fit test statistics. We evaluate the proposed class of tests and illustrate our theoretical findings by simulations.},

We develop a classical hypothesis test for completed epidemics which assesses whether or not there is significant within-group transmission during an outbreak. The test is based on time-ordered group labels of individuals. The null hypothesis is that of homogeneity of disease transmission among individuals, a hypothesis under which the discrete random vector of groups labels has a known sampling distribution that is independent of any model parameters. The test exhibits excellent performance when applied to various scenarios of simulated data and is also illustrated using two real-life epidemic data sets. We develop some asymptotic theory including a central limit theorem. The test is practically very appealing, being computationally cheap and straightforward to implement, as well as being applicable to a wide range of real-life outbreak settings and to related problems in other fields.},

Recently, the first inference methods for the MCV were proposed for general factorial designs. However, the inference methods are primarily derived for one special MCV variant while there are several reasonable proposals. Moreover, when rejecting a global null hypothesis, a more in-depth analysis is of interest to find the significant contrasts of MCV. This paper concerns extending the nonparametric permutation procedure to the other MCV variants and a max-type test for post hoc analysis. To improve the small sample performance of the latter, we suggest a novel bootstrap strategy and prove its asymptotic validity. The actual performance of all proposed tests is compared in an extensive simulation study and illustrated by real data analysis.

The methods that have been suggested have either an insufficient adjustment of the censoring or by assuming the the win and loss probabilities are proportional over time. The assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities will often in practice not be satisfied. In this paper, we present estimates for the win ratio, and win and loss probabilities, under independent right-censoring and derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimates. The proposed win ratio estimate does not require the assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities. The small sample properties of the proposed method are studied in a simulation study showing that the variance formula is accurate even for small samples. The method is applied on two data sets.},

  abstract     = {We suggest novel correlation coefficients which equal the maximum correlation for a class of bivariate Lancaster distributions while being only slightly smaller than maximum correlation for a variety of further bivariate distributions. In contrast to maximum correlation, however, our correlation coefficients allow for rank and moment-based estimators which are simple to compute and have tractable asymptotic distributions. Confidence intervals resulting from these asymptotic approximations and the covariance bootstrap show good finite-sample coverage. In a simulation, the power of asymptotic as well as permutation tests for independence based on our correlation measures compares favorably with competing methods based on distance correlation or rank coefficients for functional dependence, among others. Moreover, for the bivariate normal distribution, our correlation coefficients equal the absolute value of the Pearson correlation, an attractive feature for practitioners which is not shared by various competitors. We illustrate the practical usefulness of our methods in applications to two real data sets.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models are used when apart from the main treatments, some covariates also affect the response variable. In this article, the problem of testing the homogeneity of treatment effects against ordered alternatives is addressed in a fixed effects one-way ANCOVA model when error variances are heterogeneous. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and two approximate tests based on the asymptotic distributions of some union-intersection type test statistics are proposed. A parametric bootstrap technique has been used to implement the LRT and its asymptotic validity is proved. A method to construct simultaneous confidence intervals is proposed. All the test procedures are further extended to the case of more than one covariate. The robustness of tests is also studied under departure from normality. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed test procedures perform well in terms of achieving the nominal size value and good power values.},

  abstract     = {General geostatistical models are powerful tools for analyzing spatial datasets. A two-step estimation based on the likelihood function is widely used by researchers, but several theoretical and computational challenges remain to be addressed. First, it is unclear whether there is a unique global maximizer of the log-likelihood function, a seemingly simple but theoretically challenging question. The second challenge is the convexity of the log-likelihood function. Besides these two challenges in maximizing the likelihood function, we also study the theoretical property of the two-step estimation. Unlike many previous works, our results can apply to the non-twice differentiable covariance functions. In the simulation studies, three optimization algorithms are evaluated in terms of maximizing the log-likelihood functions.},

  abstract     = {Functional Principal Component Analysis is a reference method for dimension reduction of curve data. Its theoretical properties are now well understood in the simplified case where the sample curves are fully observed without noise. However, functional data are noisy and necessarily observed on a finite discretization grid. Common practice consists in smoothing the data and then to compute the functional estimates, but the impact of this denoising step on the procedure&#39;s statistical performance are rarely considered. Here we prove new convergence rates for functional principal component estimators. We introduce a double asymptotic framework: one corresponding to the sampling size and a second to the size of the grid. We prove that estimates based on projection onto histograms show optimal rates in a minimax sense. Theoretical results are illustrated on simulated data and the method is applied to the visualization of genomic data.},
