  abstract     = {Laminated composite plates widely used in industries are prone to various defects at the interfaces between layers in complex usage environments and manufacturing processes, also known as the interfacial imperfection. Therefore, based on the third-order zigzag displacement field and a layer-spring model, a four-node quadrilateral quasi-conforming plate element (QCQ4) is proposed to calculate the free vibration of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection. In addition, combined with the numerical results from other literature, it is verified that the proposed plate element (QCQ4) can effectively obtain the stress and deflection of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection, and accurately calculate the free vibration of laminates with different geometries, thicknesses and fiber directions. Furthermore, numerical results show that when the dimensionless interface parameter R characterizing the interfacial imperfection increases from 0.0 to 1.0 and 5.0, respectively, the maximum reduction in the natural frequency of the laminated thick and thin plates in the first six modes exceeds 33% and 37%. This means that and seem to be two critical values for evaluating whether thick and thin laminates will experience a significant decrease in stiffness due to interfacial imperfection. Besides, it is also found that as the increase of the dimensionless interface parameter R , the 4th and 5th mode shapes of the square and circular laminate, and the 5th and 6th mode shapes of the triangular laminate will change compared with the mode shapes of laminates without interfacial imperfection.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the optimal control of constrained mechanical systems, with potential additional kinematic constraints at the final time. Correspondingly, the equations of motion of the underlying mechanical system assume the form of differential-algebraic equations with end constraints. The proposed discretisation of the optimality conditions yields a scheme which is capable of preserving control angular momentum maps resulting from the rotational symmetry of the underlying optimal control problem. The numerical solution of the discretised system is first tested with two solution strategies: Monolithic and staggered approaches, and then also solved with hybrid approaches, which combine salient features of each individual strategy. The monolithic strategy solves all the optimality conditions for all time steps as a single system of non-linear equations and relies on a Newton-Raphson scheme, which guarantees quadratic rates of convergence in the vicinity of the optimal solution trajectory. The staggered strategy is based on the Forward-Backward Sweep Method (FBSM), where state and adjoint equations are solved separately, and the control equations provide an update of the control variables, which we here achieve with also a Newton-Raphson scheme. The proposed hybrid strategies combine the advantages of a conventional gradient-based FBSM with the individual Newton-based solution procedures once the solution is close to the optimal trajectory. The strategies are developed and compared through three representative numerical examples, which show that all schemes yield very similar solutions. However, the hybrid approaches become more advantageous in the computation time when the time-step decreases or the size of the problem increases.},

However, the significant computational demands still pose challenges, particularly in dynamic simulations. To mitigate these challenges, we present a newly devised asynchronous variational integrator (AVI) for phase field modeling of dynamic fracture, implemented within the framework of the finite element library FEniCS. The AVI allows each spatial mesh element to progress independently with its own characteristic time step. In the new approach, displacement updates occur as usual at each time step, while the phase field is globally solved after the displacement update of the largest spatial mesh element rather than after each time step. Benchmark problems are investigated to assess the performance and reliability of the new method, revealing notable computational savings while effectively capturing intricate dynamic fracture behavior.},

  abstract     = {The process of elastic deformation is performed using the radial basis functions (RBF) method for the background mesh and the volume-weighted interpolation method for the computational mesh. The RBF method performs interpolation independently in different directions and does not ensure boundary orthogonality during elastic deformation. This study proposes a strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of the dynamic mesh method. Based on the automatically generated adaptive background mesh, a reference displacement method for spatial points is first developed to obtain reasonable reference displacements with rotational correction for spatial control points. The RBF is then used to interpolate the rotation angle of the boundary represented by the quaternion. Therefore, the large angle deformation can be more smoothly propagated to the spatial region. In the background mesh, the translational deformation is obtained by the damping function based on the minimum distance, the rotational deformation is calculated by rotating around a small number of nodes with the minimum distance from the wall surface, and the final rotational displacement is obtained by inverse distance weighting. This method ensures boundary orthogonality. Afterwards, the one-step reference displacement method is developed. A subset of mesh nodes on the boundary surface and one layer outside the boundary are automatically selected using a greedy algorithm and considered as control points. The spatial point is assigned a value using a reference displacement. The deformation displacement of the background mesh is calculated using the RBF method, and then interpolated into the computational grid. The obtained results show that this method can significantly improve the orthogonality of the boundary layer and retain the high accuracy of the RBF method for elastic deformation. In addition, a two-step spatial multi-point selection method is developed. Using a spatial peak selection method of high flexibility based on the quality change before and after mesh deformation, multiple spatial points are selected and considered as control points at a time, which allows for increased stability and robustness of the dynamic mesh method for the one-step reference displacement method. The deformation ability of the two-step spatial multi-point selection method is increased by 20% compared with that of the one-step reference displacement method in a single deformation step. The criterion for point selection is general, and the algorithm has high efficiency, which allows spatial control points to be selected in multiple regions. The two-step spatial multi-point selection method provides a smooth mesh, stretching the overlapped and squeezed mesh. The CPU cost is comparable to the RBF, and iteration is not required. The time complexity of the proposed multiple point selection method is reduced to 2/(M + 1) times that of the single-point selection method, which adds one spatial point at a time until M points are added. Several typical examples show that the proposed methods improve the mesh quality by about 30% for two-dimensional flow and 17% for three-dimensional flow while ensuring the computational efficiency.},

We obtained the difference value in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form as the output of learning using the factorization machine. The QUBO form difference was subjected to the original Hamiltonian as the correction term. The performance of this correction term was evaluated by calculating the energy for a equilibrium state of diblock copolymer. In phase-field analysis, the time evolution equation is formulated so that the total free energy decreases; hence, a lower the free energy means a more accurate result close to that of a conventional method. When we performed annealing with correction terms, the microstructure showed a Gibbs free energy that was lower than that obtained without the correction terms.},

  abstract     = {Finite periodic layout for multicomponent systems signifies a compelling design strategy for constructing complex larger structures through assembling repeating representative unit-cells with various orientations. In addition to better transportability, handleability and replaceability, design with structural segmentation has been considered particularly valuable for additive manufacturing of large workpiece due to limited printing dimension of machine. However, existing design optimization of periodic structures has been largely restricted to simple translational placements of unit-cells, sophisticated tessellation with differently oriented topological unit-cells remains underexplored. This paper presents an efficient and adaptable topology optimization framework for concurrently optimizing periodic structures comprised of repeating topological unit-cells and their tailored orientations. By introducing a weighting factor associated with different orientation states of unit-cells, a dominant orientation for each unit-cell can gradually emerge in the course of optimization process. The proposed procedure combines the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model for topology optimization of unit-cell and the discrete material optimization (DMO) technique for the optimization of its orientation. The optimization objective is to minimize structural compliance subject to volume fraction constraint. Through sensitivity analysis, optimality criteria can be applied to simultaneously optimize a representative unit-cell (RUC) topology and the orientation weighting factors in the periodic macrostructure. Several 2D and 3D examples are investigated to demonstrate significant enhancement in compliance reduction of up to 34% compared to conventional periodic design without orientation optimization. This represents a notable improvement in finite periodic structural optimization, particularly leveraging the topology optimization to tailor unit-cell orientation rather than relying on brute-force search approaches. Our methodology paves a new avenue for designing more efficient and readily manufacturable lightweight structures with enhanced performance metrics.},

However, it is challenging to identify the load-carrying boundary in density-based topology optimization frame. To address this issue, a direct load-carrying boundary identification method is proposed to describe and update the design-dependent boundary load, and a topology optimization method for structures with design-dependent boundary load is presented. First, a Flood Fill algorithm (FFA) based domain extension method is introduced to generate a new structure with a boundary equivalent to the load-carrying boundary of the original structure. Then, the erosion boundary identification method is applied to the new structure to identify the load-carrying boundary instead of the original structure. Finally, the load information (direction and magnitude) of the design-dependent boundary load is determined using a normalized gradient algorithm, which completes the update of the design-dependent boundary load. This method overcomes the difficulty of identifying the load-carrying boundary in density-based methods. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by several examples of minimum compliance (including 3D) and flexible mechanisms.},

A surrogate macroscopic material is identified by performing interpolation using radial basis functions (RBFs) and cubic spline functions on a constitutive database generated by a series of microscopic analyses or, equivalently, numerical material tests (NMTs) on a unit cell to represent anisotropic stress relaxation behavior as well as its dependence on strain rate and temperature. After briefly reviewing the two-scale boundary value problem derived based on homogenization theory, an RBF interpolation with a normalized kernel is formulated for a discrete dataset, and an optimization algorithm is applied to determine the three hyperparameters so as to achieve proper interpolation. Then, we formulate the surrogate homogenization model (SHM) using the interpolants to substitute for the macroscopic viscoelastic response. To show the specific procedure of the proposed surrogate modeling and demonstrate the performance of the created SHM, a representative numerical example is presented in the offline and online stages. In the offline stage, NMTs are carried out in the space of training data, including the temperature, to generate a dataset as long as the macroscopic stresses can be learned exhaustively, and then optimization is performed to determine the set of hyperparameters. Then, to validate the created SHM, its responses to unseen loading and temperature histories are compared with the corresponding NMT results. In the online stage, the created SHM is used to carry out a macroscopic analysis of a simple structure under specific loading and temperature conditions, and subsequently, the obtained macroscopic stresses are compared with those obtained from the localization analysis results. The results are also compared with those obtained from the single-scale direct numerical analyses.},

We leverage a convolutional neural parameterization of a level set for a description of the geometry and use this in an unfitted finite element method that is differentiable with respect to the level set everywhere in the domain. We construct the parameter to objective map in such a way that the gradient can be computed entirely by automatic differentiation at roughly the cost of an objective function evaluation.

  abstract     = {The polynomial bases usually applied in the implementation of hybrid-Trefftz stress elements for plate bending are extended to include the formal solutions necessary to model high-gradient stress fields associated with boundary layer and singular wedge effects. To this end, the approximation of the stress-resultant field includes the (Trefftz) solutions of the harmonic, biharmonic, and Helmholtz governing systems of differential equations. Numerical testing problems are selected to show that the element can be used to solve the Kirchhoff model and to adequately simulate both boundary layer and singular wedge effects in thin and moderately thick Mindlin–Reissner plates.},

  abstract     = {Slender structures, such as rods, often exhibit large deformations even under moderate external forces (e.g., gravity). This characteristic results in a rich variety of morphological changes, making them appealing for engineering design and applications, such as soft robots, submarine cables, decorative knots, and more. Prior studies have demonstrated that the natural shape of a rod significantly influences its deformed geometry. Consequently, the natural shape of the rod should be considered when manufacturing and designing rod-like structures. Here, we focus on an inverse problem: Can we determine the natural shape of a suspended 2D planar rod so that it deforms into a desired target shape under the specified loading? We begin by formulating a theoretical framework based on the statics of planar rod equilibrium that can compute the natural shape of a planar rod given its target shape. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of uncertainties (e.g., noise in the data) on the accuracy of the theoretical framework. The results reveal the shortcomings of the theoretical framework in handling uncertainties in the inverse problem, a fact often overlooked in previous works. To mitigate the influence of the uncertainties, we combine the statics of the planar rod with the adjoint method for parameter sensitivity analysis, constructing a learning framework that can efficiently explore the natural shape of the designed rod with enhanced robustness. This framework is validated numerically for its accuracy and robustness, offering valuable insights into the inverse design of soft structures for various applications, including soft robotics and animation of morphing structures.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel framework for solving large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization problems. While most previous studies on fluid topology optimization assume steady-state flows, an increasing number of recent studies deal with unsteady flows, which are more general in engineering. However, unsteady flow topology optimization involves solving the governing and adjoint equations of a time-evolving system, which requires a significant computational cost for topology optimization with a fine mesh. Therefore, we propose a large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization based on the building-cube method (BCM), which is one of the hierarchical Cartesian mesh methods. Although the BCM has been confirmed to have excellent scalability and is suitable for massively parallel computing, there are no studies that have applied it to unsteady flow topology optimization. In the proposed method, the governing and adjoint equations are discretized by a cell-centered finite volume method based on the BCM, which can achieve high parallel efficiency even with a fine mesh. The effectiveness of the proposed method for large-scale computing is discussed through several examples of optimization and verification of computational efficiency by weak scaling.},

Using an extended nonintrusive model combination algorithm, the proposed model achieves high accuracy with an error of approximately 1%, outperforming baselines: a state-space model and a purely data-driven model. Moreover, it delivers a computational speed-up of three orders of magnitude compared with the traditional time-stepping volume integral method on the same mesh in the online prediction stage, at the cost of a one-time training effort and previously mentioned error, making it highly effective for real-time and repeated predictions.},

The presented projection-based method performs updates of the reduced basis during the iterative process and at the end of each load step. Convergence is achieved in all stages of the simulation and the best choice of basis vectors is assured. A novel technique for the choice of basis, the recursive Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, is introduced and compared to an existing technique, the comparative Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, in an academic two-dimensional unit cell example. Numerical examples of real two- and three-dimensional microstructures unveil the performance of the adaptive technique for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) is widely used to analyse coupled (solid-water) problems under large deformations/displacements. However, if not addressed carefully, MPM u-p formulations for poromechanics can be affected by two major sources of instability. Firstly, inf-sup condition violation can arise when the spaces for the displacement and pressure fields are not chosen correctly, resulting in an unstable pressure field when the equations are monolithically solved. Secondly, the intrinsic nature of particle-based discretisation makes the MPM an unfitted mesh-based method, which can affect the system&#39;s condition number and solvability, particularly when background mesh elements are poorly populated. This work proposes a solution to both problems. The inf-sup condition is avoided using two overlapping meshes, a coarser one for the pressure and a finer one for the displacement. This approach does not require stabilisation of the primary equations since it is stable by design and is particularly valuable for low-order shape functions. As for the system&#39;s poor condition number, a face ghost penalisation method is added to both the primary equations, which constitutes a novelty in the context of MPM mixed formulations. This study frequently makes use of the theories of functional analysis or the unfitted Finite Element Method (FEM). Although these theories may not directly apply to the MPM, they provide a robust and logical basis for the research. These rationales are further supported by four numerical examples, which encompass both elastic and elasto-plastic cases and drained and undrained conditions.},
