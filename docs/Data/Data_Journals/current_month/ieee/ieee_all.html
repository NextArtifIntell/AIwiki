The global cost function is subjected to a constraint with an aggregative item, which reveals the degree of aggregation for the multiagent system. A distributed strategy is proposed to optimize the formation configuration at multiple scales, including the position, angle, and size of the formation configuration. The strategy first employs observation and parameter projection technologies to search for the optimal size. Then, it utilizes the gradient and moment to optimize the position and angle of the formation configuration synchronously. Finally, some simulation results are provided to verify the proposed strategy.},

However, existing work has primarily provided proof of concept in regular, open arenas without obstacles. For practical applications on real robots, multiple collective motion skills are required. This article proposes a novel, multitask deep reinforcement learning algorithm and domain transfer architecture permitting multiple collective motion skills to be bootstrapped automatically and applied to real robots. The proposed approach is tested for tuning two collective motion skills for grouped movement and obstacle avoidance, without requiring a map of the environment. We show that our approach can tune obstacle avoidance parameters while maintaining high-quality swarming collective behavior when an obstacle is detected. Furthermore, learned collective motion skills can be transferred from a point mass simulation onto real mobile robots using our domain transfer architecture, without loss of quality. Transferability is comparable to that of an evolutionary algorithm run in a high-fidelity simulator.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles trained through multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) have shown impressive results in many driving scenarios. However, the performance of these trained policies can be impacted when faced with diverse driving styles and personalities, particularly in highly interactive situations. This is because conventional MARL algorithms usually operate under the assumption of fully cooperative behavior among all agents and focus on maximizing team rewards during training. To address this issue, we introduce the personality modeling network (PeMN), which includes a cooperation value function and personality parameters to model the varied interactions in high-interactive scenarios. The PeMN also enables the training of a background traffic flow with diverse behaviors, thereby improving the performance and generalization of the ego vehicle. Our extensive experimental studies, which incorporate different personality parameters in high-interactive driving scenarios, demonstrate that the personality parameters effectively model diverse driving styles and that policies trained with PeMN demonstrate better generalization than traditional MARL methods.},

  abstract     = {The age of information (AoI) has recently gained recognition as a critical quality-of-service (QoS) metric for quantifying the freshness of status updates, playing a crucial role in supporting massive ultrareliable and low-latency communications (mURLLCs). In mURLLC scenarios, status updates generally involve the transmission through applying finite blocklength coding (FBC) to efficiently encode small update packets while meeting stringent error-rate and latency-bounded QoS constraints. However, due to inherent system dynamics and varying environmental conditions, optimizing AoI under such multi-QoS constraints often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable problems. Motivated by the demonstrated efficacy of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in addressing large-scale networking challenges, this work aims to apply DRL techniques to derive optimal resource allocation solutions in real time. Despite its potential, the effective integration of FBC in DRL-based AoI optimization remains underexplored, especially in addressing the challenge of simultaneously upper bounding both delay and error rate. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based framework for AoI-aware optimal resource allocation in mURLLC-driven multi-QoS schemes, leveraging AoI as a core metric within the finite blocklength regime. First, we design a wireless communication architecture and AoI-based modeling framework that incorporates FBC. Second, we proceed by deriving upper bounded peak AoI and delay violation probabilities using stochastic network calculus. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the peak AoI violation probability through FBC. Third, we develop DRL algorithms to determine optimal resource allocation policies that meet statistical delay and error-rate requirements for mURLLC. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the developed schemes, we have executed a series of simulations.},

The method is based on intracluster and intercluster distance evaluations to achieve a good partition. A quasi-convex curve is formed to select the optimal NoC, ensuring an excellent computational time to converge. Tests are carried out using K-means, and simulations are conducted using IEEE unbalanced test feeders. Different input random variables are tested, including correlated and noncorrelated variables, with and without renewable distributed generators. The results prove that the input conditions significantly affect the optimal NoC. Comparisons are made with Monte Carlo simulation to justify the proposed application, showing that the computational time reduction provided by the clustering algorithm reaches up to ∼99% . Since the optimal NoC increases dramatically with the size of the input database, guidelines are proposed to reduce the MPPF dimensionality for more effective probabilistic procedures.},

  abstract     = {The growth of distributed renewable energy in microgrids (MGs) raises challenges in energy management and consumption. As an innovative approach, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers a promising solution to address these problems. In this article, we propose a bi-layer decentralized (BLD) optimization algorithm for P2P energy trading in multimicrogrids (MMG). Compared with traditional optimization algorithms that are single-layer decentralized (i.e., decentralizing solely at inter-MG trading and typically centralizing prosumers within the MG), the proposed algorithm achieves bi-layer decentralization (i.e., decentralization extends to both inter-MG and intra-MG trading). In this way, the BLD algorithm can significantly preserve the information privacy and decision independence of prosumers. In addition, the proposed algorithm can efficiently manage power flow in a decentralized manner at both layers, whereas existing decentralized algorithms frequently neglect this critical feature. Furthermore, an accelerated BLD (ABLD) algorithm is proposed to address time-consuming issues in this nested P2P trading for MMG. Numerical simulations on various test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the error of the proposed algorithm is below 0.1%. In addition, BLD requires 15602.03 s to converge with 560 prosumers, while ABLD only requires 228.05 s.},

However, the challenge lies in distinguishing between short-circuit faults and system disturbances, e.g., load encroachment, power swing, out-of-step condition, and voltage instability, which can mimic fault conditions and lead to improper relay operation. To address this issue, this article presents a new local protection method by employing three innovative indices: the out-of-step detection index, the positive-sequence impedance angle (PSIA) index, and the superimposed PSIA index. These indices are derived from theoretical principles and are tailored to effectively discriminate between faults and system disturbances. As a major novelty, the determination of indices threshold values is extracted based on the theoretical relationships and further validated through comprehensive static and dynamic analyses. The algorithm&#39;s effectiveness is evaluated under various stressed conditions through multiple simulations, showing its ability to distinguish between stressed conditions and short-circuit faults, even in the presence of inverter-based resources. This leads to enhanced power system reliability and security. The proposed method is also cost-effective as it is implemented in the local distance relay, eliminating the need for synchrophasor devices and communication infrastructure.},

In this article, we propose a time-efficient greedy search method to identify critical branches in a power network. We address the challenge of computational constraints by using a failure propagation graph, which accurately captures the critical failure propagation patterns based on cascading failure simulation. Our approach minimizes cascading failure risk while strategically reinforcing a limited number of branches. The failure-propagation-graph greedy-search (FPG-GS) algorithm selects candidate branches based on cascading failure simulation and iteratively identifies the most crucial branches. Our experimental results on different power systems demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the FPG-GS algorithm compared to existing methods. In addition, our study highlights the importance of strategic branch selection, showing that reinforcing one-fifth of the branches can achieve a mitigation rate exceeding 80%.},

Enabling caching capabilities has been regarded as a promising way to reduce the high-delay pressure of file delivery on the backhaul links. However, file delivery has different requirements on quality-of-service, and the increased densification of small base stations will consume more energy, thus it is essential to solve the problem of delay and energy in cache-enabled HetCNets. In this article, we employ a utility function with the weighted sum of energy consumption and delay cost to formulate the delay-energy tradeoff optimization problem that is a kind of multiobjective optimization problem. Considering a jointly performed mechanism comprising power control, user association, and content caching, the optimization problem is further decomposed into the primal problem and the main problem by generalized Benders decomposition method. Here, the primal problem is related to power-aware user association that dynamically associates with the base station, and the main problem is related to content caching. Furthermore, an iterative power-aware user association and content caching algorithm (PAUA-CC) is proposed.

To achieve this, a utility function is developed to evaluate the coalition structure, transmit power consumption, and tracking accuracy. Then, by formulating the cooperative interactions among radars as a coalition game, we establish an optimization model to optimize the coalition structure and power allocation for the distributed radar network. The existence of the Nash equilibrium solution for the game is proven mathematically. To address the optimization model, an iterative three-step algorithm is developed based on the sequential quadratic programming.

To overcome these challenges, a lightweight AKA protocol with self-adaptive synchronization and authority management is proposed. Formal verification through the real-or-random model, BAN logic, and ProVerif tool confirms its security and availability, while informal analysis demonstrates its robust security features. Comparative analysis with recent schemes also highlights its superiority and fitness for WMSNs.},

  abstract     = {Network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which virtually achieve FD transmission by employing half-duplex access points (APs) to simultaneously serve uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users on the same frequency bands, can decrease latency and enhance reliability since self-interference cancellation is unnecessary and macrodiversity is provided, thus helping industrial ultrareliable low-latency communication applications. In this article, we consider a monitoring scenario of industrial automation in NAFD cell-free systems using finite blocklength codewords and analyze UL and DL signals, end-to-end (E2E) delay, and E2E decoding error probability (DEP). Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum E2E DEP among all actuators by jointly designing AP working mode, UL and DL blocklengths under the E2E delay constraint. We propose the estimation of distribution algorithm-differential evolution (EDA-DE) method with low complexity to obtain a near-optimal solution, where the block coordinate descent is used to divide this problem into two parts. The first AP working mode selection is solved by EDA, and the second UL and DL blocklengths are designed by DE. Simulation results indicate that the performance of our proposed EDA-DE method is close to that of exhaustive search with lower computational complexity.},

Specifically, to address the practical limitation that communication links between subsystems of IMMPSs may be unavailable, we first formulate a sparse LQT problem in which the sparse patterns of controllers match the actual communication links. Meanwhile, in order to be applicable to real-time applications while overcoming model uncertainty caused by parameter variability common in IMMPSs models, we subsequently develop a data compression-based model-free PI algorithm for the abovementioned sparse LQT problem. The main advantages of this algorithm over existing algorithms for IMMPSs control are threefold: first, it has the ability to operate without a prior knowledge of system model, second, its embedded data compression significantly reduces the time consumption for controller design, making it suitable for real-time applications, and third, it designs controllers based on actual communication links, making it practical for applications where communication infrastructure may be constrained. Finally the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is verified through the IEEE 39-bus New England Power System.},

  abstract     = {Numerous mission-critical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, such as rescue and surveillance missions, are conducted in areas lacking access to external infrastructure providing precise positioning information. To enhance situational awareness in such scenarios, millimeter wave (mmWave, $\text{30}-\text{300}$ GHz) and subterahertz (sub-THz, $\text{100}-\text{300}$ GHz) range or Doppler radars promising large resolution can be employed. However, the small antenna apertures in these bands naturally call for the use of massive antenna arrays to achieve reasonable detection distances. By employing directional antenna arrays, these radars need to exhaustively scan the surroundings to ensure situational awareness of a UAV in a swarm. The aim of this article is to characterize the system-level performance of mmWave/sub-THz range and Doppler radars as a function of system parameters by accounting for the propagation specifics of the considered bands. To this aim, we combine the tools of stochastic geometry and antenna simulations to determine the optimal half-power beamwidth that minimizes the full scanning time while maximizing the detection probability of all UAVs in a swarm. Our results demonstrate that both types of radars are characterized by qualitatively similar performance. Detection performance is highly sensitive to both UAV density and coverage radius, as the increase in these parameters leads to an abrupt drop in the detection performance. At small distances, $\leq\!\text{50}$ m, antenna arrays with a smaller number of elements result in the best tradeoff between scanning time and detection probability. Specifically, both types of radars provide perfect knowledge of the surroundings (with detection probability higher than 0.99) within a 50-m radius with a scanning time of less than 1 ms. At greater distances, $\geq\! \text{100}$ m, the only option to improve performance is a drastic increase in the emitted power or receiver sensitivity.},

Therefore, this article proposes $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ resilient bipartite control method to address the security problem of network information interaction among agents within competitive and cooperative multiagent systems. When the communication networks among agents are subject to a replay attack, the system model integrating multisensor weight fusion with an unknown input leader is established first. Then, a detection fusion algorithm is proposed to simultaneously uncover attacker behavior and identify tampered sensors. Considering the intermittent or interrupted communication resulting from the time variability of topology switching among agents, the switching topology is modeled by a semi-Markov process within a signed graph having positive and negative interaction weights. Subsequently, a distributed observer is designed to estimate the unknown input leader, utilizing the semi-Markov interactions among agents and incorporating an adaptive update mechanism to eliminate the dependency on global topology information. Ulteriorly, by solving convex optimization problems, a distributed resilient bipartite controller relying on the observer state is formulated, and achieves the expected $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance while remaining resilient against replay attacks. Finally, the superiority of the proposed method is validated through comparative examples.},

Hence, robustness against disturbances in affine formation control has been a subject remaining to be determined. To address this problem, a continuous robust controller is introduced in this study, leveraging the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) approach, aiming to suppress external disturbances while ensuring efficient convergence speed of the system under various collective formation maneuvers determined by the leader. The controller is designed to handle two types of disturbance models: one involving general disturbances and the other considering time-delay disturbances. It consists of formation tracking terms based on stress matrices and graph theory, as well as disturbance suppression terms utilizing RISE. Sufficient conditions for the stability of affine formations under both types of disturbances are derived. By designing a Lyapunov function that integrates a class-P function, the exponential stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously demonstrated. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Furthermore, through a novel gain-scheduled state observer, the fuzzy logic systems are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. The dynamic surface design method is used to remove the need for derivative calculations of the constructed virtual controls, significantly the complexity of calculations. In addition, under the framework of backstepping design, the switching threshold event-triggered control strategy is developed to effectively decrease the communication load and balance the performance of MASs. The proposed control protocol ensures that all signals within the closed-loop systems are ultimately bounded under the MDADT switching property.

Balancing these factors is a key challenge for modern green data centers. In this research, we propose a monitoring, visualization, and management system for green data centers (MVMS-GDC). Our comprehensive automated platform includes “monitoring system” and “rules and policy management” modules. The “monitoring system” gathers and visualizes time series data from all resources of a green data center, tracking essential metrics and measurements. It audits green energy, microgrid, climate conditions, workloads, hardware, CPU and memory usage, cluster component health, computing node activities, and network health and quality metrics. The “rules and policy management” module defines and enforces policies to balance resources, ensuring a reliable, sustainable, scalable, and efficient computing environment. We implemented, tested, and evaluated the MVMS-GDC system using green energy at the Zephyr data center located at the GLEAMM site. Our results demonstrate at least a 4.9% improvement in performance, at least a 4% increase in energy efficiency, and a reduction of at least 4% in job losses. The MVMS-GDC system also enhances scalability by employing a policy machine for each compute node, which automates power state control (on, off, or hibernation) based on monitoring observations. This automated approach ensures efficient and dynamic scaling, making MVMS-GDC suitable for large and highly distributed data centers. Overall, MVMS-GDC provides a robust solution for balancing energy availability and computational needs, optimizing performance, and maintaining energy efficiency in green data centers.},

This study proposes a virtual-real synchronization method for digital twins of an aeroengine gas path system (AGPS) based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). First, the parameters are divided into directly measurable parameters (DMP) and nondirectly measurable parameters (NDMP). Then, different algorithms are applied to different types of parameters. An unscented Kalman filtering algorithm is utilized to aid in the synchronization of the DMP. An RL approach is employed to train parameter inference models for the NDMP. By combining the two algorithms, synchronization between these two parameter classes is achieved. This method excels by integrating the NDMP into the virtual-real synchronization of the AGPS digital twin, concurrently reducing the inference time for this specific segment. Comparative experiments are conducted, and the results indicate an effective improvement in the accuracy of parameter inference with the proposed method. Simultaneously, it ensures real-time and robust parameter inference.},

This article explores optimal UAV positioning to maximize coverage in hybrid aerial–ground communication links. Exploiting a probabilistic line-of-sight (LOS) model, we examine coverage radius behavior in mixed urban and suburban environments to meet specific quality-of-service (QoS) targets. The analysis reveals that the coverage radius expands as the probability of LOS increases, which in turn increases with the UAV height. However, beyond a certain height, path loss becomes dominant, and further increases in altitude negatively impact the coverage radius. By studying the maximum coverage radius for minimum signal strength and spectral efficiency requirements, we numerically determine a configuration space of UAV altitudes and the corresponding maximum radius that satisfies the target QoS. The results illustrate a dual-regime behavior, where coverage increases with altitude up to a certain value, beyond which it declines, indicating the existence of an optimal altitude for reliability. In addition, the analysis of ground surface effects shows that flying over concrete surfaces significantly enhances coverage, offering a radius up to five times larger compared to rough, vegetated surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) plays a pivotal role in the Internet of Vehicles and the Internet of Things. Edge server deployment is the initial step in establishing edge computing systems, which impact the overall system performance significantly. Besides, the performance of an edge computing system is also contingent upon the type of service deployed on servers, in the case of the same server deployment, different deployment of services will bring different profits. Most current studies concentrate solely on the former aspect, neglecting the optimization of service deployment in MEC system. In this article, we proposed a two-step method KPSOP for edge server and edge service deployment, aiming to reduce time delay, balance load, and improve the profit of MEC system, and KPSOP includes clustering algorithm and heuristic algorithm. We considered the location distribution of base stations, the task requests of vehicle users, the resource limitations of edge servers, etc. First, the edge server deployment was completed with the goal of minimizing time delay and load balancing. Second, the service deployment was completed with the goal of maximizing edge server profit. The experiments were based on real world base station information. The simulation results validate that our algorithm is more stable and converges faster. In addition, compared to other algorithms, it performs better in load balance and increasing profit.},

The research utilizes orthogonal arrays in combination with regression analysis to systematically test the parameter space of an engineered system function. We explored the parameter space of interest and detected where the system model does not comply with a defined measure of effectiveness. The findings from this case study suggest that these methods enable a systematic exploration of the system&#39;s parameter space, allowing for the effective detection of detrimental weak emergent behavior. This approach potentially enhances test coverage, expands system operating knowledge and facilitates mitigation efforts more efficiently.},

  abstract     = {The design of low-complexity data detection techniques for massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems continues to attract considerable industry and research attention due to the critical need to achieve the right tradeoff between complexity and performance, especially with the signed quadrature spatial modulation (SQSM) scheme. However, the SQSM scheme attains a high spectral efficiency and good performance but suffers from a high computational complexity with mMIMO systems. In this article, we propose an efficient low-complexity detection framework for the SQSM scheme. Sparsity detection is amalgamated in this article with minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector by decoupling the detection of the real and imaginary vector streams. Unfortunately, the MMSE-based detector has a matrix inversion which incurs a high computational complexity. Therefore, we employed several iterative methods; i.e., conjugate gradient and Gauss–Seidel, to avoid the exact matrix inversion, and hence, the computational complexity is significantly reduced. Moreover, the proposed framework can host other iterative methods such as the JA, successive over relaxation, accelerated over relaxation, Neumann series, Newton iteration, two-parameter over relaxation, and Richardson methods. The proposed detection framework attains a significant complexity reduction with a small or insignificant deterioration in the performance.},

In this article, the deception attacks on both ends of the controller are considered using a more generic probability model. Attack detection models and mechanisms are established to detect the integrity of transmitted information in order to mitigate the impact of deception attacks. To ensure the input-to-state practical stability of the closed-loop system, a model predictive controller is designed based on the detected state. Finally, a simulation case is presented to demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Despite great progress in modeling the resilience response of power systems under extreme events, it remains difficult to assess the evolutionary trend of system performance at a specific observation moment during such events. Conventional simulation-based assessment methods are typically time-consuming because a series of scenario-specific optimization problems must be solved as a prerequisite. Thus, a spatial-temporal graph-based approach is proposed for fast resilience assessment to provide timely warning information. The key factors, including observable meteorological information, component vulnerabilities, emergency dispatch, and repair strategies, are modeled in the form of matrices that depict the spatial and temporal relationships. Based on these matrices, a spatiotemporal graph neural network is developed to fit the mapping relationship between observable states and resilience indicators, which is trained offline and enables fast assessment via forward inference. Regarding the uncertainties of various extreme scenarios, the evaluation procedure combines the whole-process simulation and single-state replay technologies, which can respectively consider the uncertainties and provide deterministic data labeling for assessment. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the benchmarks, including the IEEE 118-bus system and a realistic 2868-bus system.},

However, the demand for machine learning model updates on embedded systems has become relevant in multiple scenarios. This article proposes a methodology for tiny machine learning operations within the context of the Internet of Intelligent Vehicles, utilizing affordable microcontrollers based on the ESP32 platform. The solution presented in the article consists of two ESP32 devices: one functioning as a radio station (RS) and the other as the microcontroller of an onboard diagnostic (OBD-II) scanner. The RS hosts the updated model and transmits it to the OBD-II scanner using the Espressif Systems Peer-to-Peer Over Wi-Fi communication protocol over 802.11 Wi-Fi. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in model performance postupdate, but the article also identifies critical challenges to model robustness because of the use of the interpreter method on microcontrollers.},

These realities create new test and debug challenges through all stages of chiplet productization from sort to in field. There is a scaling challenge to test and debug efficiently without growing package pin count; there is a challenge of test time reduction and interoperability when testing and debugging with chiplets from multiple vendors. Additionally, silicon lifecycle management (SLM) of chiplets in a system in package (SIP) for manufacturing quality monitoring and in-field predictive analysis is a significant challenge.

Central to a successful chiplet-based product is the die-to-die interconnect technology between the chiplets. Based on product requirements, some chiplet designs can utilize a single interconnect technology such as 2-D signals over an organic substrate or higher-density 2.5-D integration technologies. With increasing demands on compute and memory capabilities, high-performance products are now moving to heterogeneous integration, which combines multiple advanced packaging technologies all within a single system on chip. To address the market demands for high-performance artificial intelligence solutions, AMD has introduced the AMD Instinct MI300X accelerator.

  abstract     = {Today, packaging plays a crucial role in determining chip performance in systems. As transistor sizes shrink and chip sizes grow to meet increasing processing demands, wafer yield drops. Connecting smaller chips within a package or using multidie designs has gained attention as it improves yield, enables intellectual property reuse, enhances performance, and lowers costs. The Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express standard, developed by industry leaders, supports these efforts by enabling different dies, or chiplets, to work together smoothly. Various structures based on this standard, such as standard 2-D organic substrate, 2.5-D through-silicon via interposer, Fanout redistribution layer organic interposer, and 3-D hybrid bonding, have been suggested. Despite the benefits, die integration faces challenges due to dense and intricate connections. This article focuses on achieving effective die-to-die connectivity using organic and advanced packaging. These patterns have been validated through simulations and the fabrication of the test chip.},

The rise in cost per transistor (CPT) is outweighing scaling benefits from advances in generational process technology. These diminishing silicon economies of scale have pushed foundries, EDA companies, and the manufacturing ecosystem to enable chiplet designs. Developments in packaging technology and standardization of die-to-die interfaces provide technology gains offsetting challenges of die sizes and CPT. Standards bodies and IP implementers have risen to the challenge, providing solutions to interface bottlenecks. We examine standards for chiplet and die-to-die interfaces, such as UCIe and the work done in the industry to enable these. Architectural partitions for chiplet implementations and development of reusable components that enable a future chiplet marketplace are considered. The juggernaut for differentiation and disaggregation in the more-than-Moore era continues to build momentum. We examine these trends and recent technology advances, looking at future directions for implementations.},

However, the scarcity of labeled data poses a significant challenge to training high-quality models. To address this issue, we explore the potential of data augmentation using ChatGPT, a well-performing large language model, to enhance the sentiment classification performance toward aspect terms. Specifically, we explore three data augmentation strategies based on ChatGPT: context-focused, aspect-focused, and context–aspect data augmentation techniques. Context-focused data augmentation focuses on changing the word expression of context words in the sentence while keeping aspect terms unchanged. In contrast, aspect-focused data augmentation aims to change aspect terms but keep context words unchanged. Context–aspect data augmentation integrates these two data augmentations to generate augmented samples. Furthermore, we incorporate contrastive learning into the ABSA tasks to improve performance. Extensive experiments show that all three data augmentation techniques lead to performance improvements, with the context–aspect data augmentation strategy performing best and surpassing the performance of the baseline models.},

To deliver packages quickly and cost-effectively, the routes taken by UAVs from depots to customers must be optimized. We present an innovative, practical package-delivery model wherein multiple UAVs deliver multiple packages to customers, who are compensated for late deliveries. Further, we propose a novel methodology that combines a new plan-generation algorithm with a collective-learning heuristic to quickly determine cost-effective paths of UAVs, even for large-scale deliveries up to 10,000 customers. To demonstrate our methodology, we applied our highly flexible approach to a depot in Heathrow Airport, London. We show that our coordinated approach, in which the UAVs collectively determine their flight paths, leads to similar operational costs as those of the ant colony optimization technique and outperforms it for large-scale package deliveries.},

LLM outputs may not be entirely reliable for the direct handling of driving decisions due to potential inaccuracies and inconsistencies. To address these issues, we propose integrating LLM knowledge with statistical learning. This enables LLMs to export task-specific knowledge as symbolic rules, forming the initial learning structure. Rule weights are calculated based on statistical salience derived from training data, resulting in a set of weighted rules for robust decision making. Furthermore, this set of weighted rules preserves strong semantics, allowing LLMs to comprehend and make modifications based on varying needs.

The lack of stability guarantee for MPC brings difficulties in reducing tracking errors caused by perturbations in the perturbed max-plus linear system. To reduce tracking errors, the perturbed max-plus linear system is partitioned into a switching max-plus linear system by a permutation matrix. Based on a local maximum terminal set, each mode of the switching max-plus linear system is assigned with an optimal control problem to track the reference signal. Minimum dwell-time is designed to ensure the feasibility of the switching MPC and the stability of the switching max-plus linear system via Hausdorff metric analyses and $\infty$-norm hypercube invariance. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness and superiority of the switching MPC for a perturbed max-plus linear system.},

Contrary to the necessary customization of multistage structures in the prescribed-time distributed optimization, this study bridges the gap on the single-stage structured prescribed-time ZGS algorithm. Different from the existing multistage algorithms, the proposed optimization algorithms are proven to converge to the optimal solution within a prescribed-time under more mild conditions. Besides, for the first time, a singularity-free prescribed-time distributed optimization algorithm based on time-varying scaling function is proposed. Furthermore, the robustness of the singularity-free algorithm in rejecting external disturbances is also analyzed.

  abstract     = {This study addresses the intricate challenge of decentralized output-feedback control for stochastic non-triangular nonlinear interconnected systems with unknown time-varying sensor sensitivity in a dynamic event-triggered context. The presence of stochastic disturbances, non-triangular structural uncertainties, and evolving sensor sensitivity distinguishes this problem of global asymptotic stability from conventional event-triggered control scenarios. Existing event-triggered control approaches with static event conditions encounter difficulties in simultaneously ensuring zero tracking/stabilization error and preventing the occurrence of Zeno behavior. In this work, we develop a novel solution to address this complex issue. First, we establish a linear relationship between the state vector of each interconnected subsystem and two error vectors through a unique coordinate transformation. This transformation effectively handles the complexities introduced by non-triangular structural uncertainties. Second, we introduce a decentralized dynamic event-triggered output-feedback control strategy, which involves a state observer and a decentralized output-feedback controller. Unlike conventional event-triggered control methods with static event conditions, this strategy formulates a modified clock-based dynamic triggering mechanism by introducing an auxiliary variable that evolves based on predicted plant state values, while utilizing a clock variable to guarantee the existence of a positive lower bound on inter-execution times. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis confirms the global asymptotic stability in probability of the closed-loop system, with the states and the output of each local subsystem converging to the equilibrium at the origin in probability. In addition, the existence of a minimal dwell-time between triggering instants is guaranteed. Finally, we substantiate the advantages and efficiency of the proposed algorithm through comprehensive numerical simulations.},

The LPV paradigm preserves well-understood linear design methods, although the stability analysis of these systems has remained difficult. In a recent paper, it is shown that under some stringent conditions, a linear continuous-time gain-scheduled output feedback controller can be designed to provide closed-loop exponential stability; however, the conditions are hard to check, few examples are provided and all of the examples are stable. The goal of this article is to construct two large families of single-input single-output second-order systems, which satisfy these constraints while admitting wide ranges of parameter variation. The classes constructed include unstable and nonminimum phase systems, and consequently, this work facilitates the design of exponentially stabilizing LPV controllers for systems that are difficult to control.},

From this viewpoint, a necessary and sufficient existence condition of bounded DOs is first established, which can be easily verified. Furthermore, a set-membership filter-based DO is developed, and its completeness is proven; thus, our proposed DO is bounded if and only if bounded DOs exist. We also prove that the proposed DO has the capability to achieve the worst-case optimality, which can provide a benchmark for the design of DOs.

This feature allows for reducing the data transmitted among nodes at each intermediate step, namely, instead of exchanging a vector of the dimension of the state, nodes exchange a vector of the dimension of the rank of the total output matrix. The main finding is that the convergence to the performance of the centralized Kalman filter and mean-square boundedness of the estimation error are not lost despite an increase in the number of consensus steps. Simulations show that the total communication overhead is reduced without performance degradation with respect to the original distributed filter, where nodes exchange local state estimates.},

A main novelty of the proposed algorithm is the introduction of a scale factor into the gradient tracking scheme to suppress the consensus error. By the estimate sequence approach, the dynamics of the error due to the unbalance of directed networks is analyzed and it is shown that a sublinear convergence rate can be achieved with a vanishing step size. Numerical results suggest that the performance of IDNGT is comparable to that of the centralized Nesterov gradient descent algorithm.},

In this article, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder, and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system&#39;s state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. In addition, the proposed privacy-preserving scheme is also proven to satisfy differential privacy. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs.

Control-barrier-function (CBF)-based control has shown its promising potential and power in delivering formal safe property of dynamic nonlinear systems. The presence of disturbances, whether from matched or unmatched channels, negatively impacts CBF-based control, leading to violations of formal safety guarantees and degraded control performance. In this article, a new safety-critical disturbance rejection control approach is proposed for nonlinear systems subject to unmatched disturbances. Owing to the naturally intractable mismatching condition, the disturbances and their high order derivatives could generate considerable negative impacts on not only the high order CBF but also the control Lyapunov function. To this end, an observer-based disturbance rejection CBF is proposed, delivering a new robust adaptive mechanism to deal with the disturbances. It is shown that by fully exploiting the disturbance estimates and adequately quantifying the impacts of estimation errors, the proposed approach provides attractive properties like formal robust safety guarantee and nominal control performance recovery under unmatched disturbances. Simulation results of path following of a drone suffering wind disturbances verify the benefits of the proposed solution in collision avoidance and retaining nominal safety performance.},

However, its superior learning capability from cycle to cycle is mostly predicated on the assumption that the initial state for all cycles is identical and at the desired point. In engineering practice, this assumption can be overly strict. A more common scenario involves the initial state varying randomly from cycle to cycle. In this article, we propose an optimally selected cycle-based ILC scheme to address the issue of randomly varying initial states. Our approach involves selecting an optimal cycle for iterative learning by evaluating both the potential impact of initial state variations and the tracking performance of historical cycles. By extending the learning mechanism of ILC from learning from the previous cycle to learning from the past optimally selected cycle, our scheme ensures improvement after each iteration of learning. In addition, our scheme has been adapted to accommodate uncertain systems with greater generality. The feasibility and convergence properties of our scheme are investigated through theoretical analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and other properties of the proposed method through a benchmark numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Using the proportional-type update rule (PTUR) is the most common update approach for iterative learning control. By combining PTUR and a newly proposed fractional-power-type update rule (FTUR), a fractional-proportional-type update rule is proposed to achieve fast convergence for scenarios where the tracking errors can be large or small. The nonlinearity of fractional power term and tracking error accumulation along the time axis introduce considerable challenges in convergence analysis and convergence rate estimation. Thus, a novel analysis method is proposed for nonlinear recursion with perturbation where the convergence is established as per nonlinear tracking-error dynamics. The limits of the tracking errors are demonstrated independent of the system matrices. The relationship between the convergence limit and initial tracking error is examined. Moreover, the local and global convergence rates are provided. The proposed approach exhibits an advantage in terms of the convergence rate compared with PTUR and FTUR. Optimal parameter selection is achieved based on the convergence rate. The theoretical results are confirmed via numerical simulations.},

In particular, the linear system is perturbed by both additive and multiplicative stochastic disturbances. We provide conditions under which mean-square boundedness, mean-square stability, and recurrence properties hold for the closed-loop system. We distinguish two cases, when these properties are verified for any value of the discount factor sufficiently close to 1, or when they hold for a fixed value of the discount factor in which case tighter conditions are derived, as illustrated in an example. The analysis exploits properties of the optimal value function, as well as a detectability property of the system with respect to the stage cost, to construct a Lyapunov function for the stochastic linear quadratic regulator problem.},

It incorporates dual asynchronous triggering mechanisms for both the system&#39;s output and control input, utilizing a specifically designed adaptive filtering method. The first mechanism aims to reduce the burden on sensor to controller communication, while the second determines when the controller needs to be updated. Particularly, an adaptive neural state observer, reliant on the filtered version of sampled output, is designed to estimate the system&#39;s states. Then, differentiable virtual controls are formulated using the estimated states within the framework of the dynamic surface control. Hence, the proposed approach reduces the number of triggering mechanisms and required communication channels compared to existing results. By using the online approximation technique with adaptation schemes, the unknown nonlinearities are approximated without the need for global Lipschitz and linear growth conditions, as well as without encountering overparameterization issue. Finally, the closed-loop stability is analyzed, and proofs for the avoidance of Zeno behavior are provided.},

This article proposes two $\epsilon$-differentially private distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms for aggregative games under directed communication graphs with row- and column-stochastic adjacency matrices, respectively. By utilizing the diameters of players&#39; strategy sets, Laplacian noise free from the uniformly upper bound information of gradients is proposed to achieve $\epsilon$-differential privacy and guarantee the algorithms being fully distributed. To avoid the noise accumulating in the estimate of the aggregate strategy, a noise deduction mechanism is employed to ensure the accuracy of the algorithms.

In this article, we study distributed solvers for network linear equations over a network with node-to-node communication messages compressed as scalar values. Our key idea lies in a dimension compression scheme that includes a dimension-compressing vector and a data unfolding step. The compression vector applies to individual node states as an inner product to generate a real-valued message for node communication. In the unfolding step, such scalar message is then plotted along the subspace generated by the compression vector for the local computations. We first present a compressed consensus flow that relies only on such scalarized communication, and show that linear convergence can be achieved with well excited signals for the compression vector. We then employ such a compressed consensus flow as a fundamental consensus subroutine to develop distributed continuous-time and discrete-time solvers for network linear equations, and prove their linear convergence properties under scalar node communications. With scalar communications, a direct benefit would be the reduced node-to-node communication channel burden for distributed computing. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the established theoretical results.},

We derive simultaneous sublinear dynamic regret and constraint violation bounds for OIPM-TEC under standard assumptions. For applications where a given tolerance around optima is accepted, we employ an alternative OCO performance metric—the epsilon-regret—and a more computationally efficient algorithm, the epsilon-OIPM-TEC that possesses sublinear bounds under this metric. Finally, we showcase the performance of these two algorithms on an online OPF problem and compare them to another OCO algorithm from the literature.},

This article concentrates on the examination of error dynamics in affine group systems when exposed to external disturbances or random noises. To this end, we first characterize linear group systems equivalently by homomorphism of its transition flow and linearity of its Lie algebra. Next, we investigate linear group systems that are spread by a Brownian motion in tangent spaces. We show that the Itô stochastic differential equation in the Lie algebra space has a linear drift component and an additional “pinning” term. We apply these findings in analyzing error dynamics, a specific linear group system, with smooth disturbances and random noises. The error dynamics is expressed in the group and the Lie algebra. An explicit and accurate derivation of error dynamics is provided for a concrete example of $SE_{2}(3)$, which plays a vital role in inertial-based navigation and other robotics applications.},

We describe the scheme and develop an approach that integrates the two abilities into a single constrained optimization problem with only continuous variables. For linear systems with convex constraints, the problem reduces to a convex quadratic program and is easy to solve. We illustrate the proposed safety supervisor with an automotive example.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a two-lifeline differential game with two pursuers and one evader in a planar environment that is divided into a game area and two target areas by the two lifelines. The evader aims to enter the target area by passing through either of the two lifelines, eluding capture in the process. Conversely, the pursuers endeavor to capture the evader before it reaches one of the target areas. To construct the barrier, we first divide the two-lifeline differential game into two subgames: one pursuer and one evader with two lifelines; the other pursuer and evader with two lifelines. We construct the reachable region of the evader using the Cartesian oval. Then, we employ a geometric method to obtain the barrier of each subgame and analyze the optimal strategies of the pursuers and the evader in each area. Furthermore, this article proposes a resultant force method to develop strategies for both the evader and the pursuers in the two-lifeline game. Finally, simulation examples are provided to validate the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The optimal filtering problem for general nonlinear and continuous state-observation systems attracts lots of attention in the control theory. The essence of optimal filtering requires solving the Duncan–Mortensen–Zakai (DMZ) equation in a computationally feasible way. Under the pioneering work of Yau-Yau filtering, the DMZ equation is reduced to a pathwise computation of a forward Kolmogorov equation with time-varying initial conditions, which is very challenging. To overcome the computational difficulty, in this article, we proposed a new efficient filtering algorithm consisting of a forward Kolmogorov equation solver based on a physics-informed neural network and a probability density approximator based on generalized Legendre polynomials. By utilizing the advanced deep learning method and classical Galerkin approximation, our developed algorithm not only maintains the high accuracy of the spectral method but also removes massive computational loads in the offline part. Furthermore, the convergence of our method is proved. Numerical experiments have been carried out to verify the feasibility of the new method. Regarding accuracy and efficacy, the newly proposed deep generalized Legendre–Galerkin algorithm outperforms other popular suboptimal methods including the extended Kalman filter and particle filter.},

  abstract     = {The optimal transmission scheduling over packet length-dependent lossy networks is investigated. A set of sensors observe some linear time-invariant systems, and obtain their local state estimates using Kalman filters independently. The local state estimates are encoded in a data packet, which is sent to a remote estimator over packet length-dependent lossy networks, i.e., the packet arrival probability is exponentially decreasing with the packet length. The tradeoff arises between the packet arrival probability and the data size. To improve the remote estimation performance, one needs to design a transmission scheduling policy to determine how many as well as which sensors transmit data at each time instant, which is formulated here as a Markov decision process (MDP) model. There exists an optimal stationary policy for the MDP model, which is verified to possess a threshold structure. Based on this, a structure-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to approximate the MDP&#39;s optimal policy. Some simulation examples are given to verify the optimal policy&#39;s structure, and illustrate the performance of the proposed structure-aware reinforcement learning algorithm.},

A parabolic PDE system on space–time scales is constructed for the first time. This article focuses on global exponential stabilization (GES) of a linear parabolic PDE systems on space–time scales by using point-based collocated and noncollocated observations. First, we give the definitions of space–time scales, which contain four cases: continuous time and continuous space, continuous time and discrete space, discrete time and continuous space, and discrete time and discrete space. Wirtinger inequality on space scales is demonstrated, which provides mathematically analytical technique for PDE systems on space–time scales. Second, point-based collocated stabilization control strategy is developed for parabolic PDE systems on space–time scales. Third, considering the fact that sensors and actuators are always placed at different locations, a noncollocated point-based feedback controller is designed by using the observer estimation states. Different from the existing literature, the spatial domain does not need to be divided again according to the actuator and sensor locations. By using the Lyapunov function method, calculus on space–time scales, integration by parts, and Wirtinger inequality on space scales, sufficient criteria are developed such that the closed-loop systems can achieve GES. Finally, numerical simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the developed point-based controllers.},

One of the central challenges tackled in this study pertains to the efficient resolution of these infinite-dimensional TBLMIs. Exploiting the structured nature of such problems, we introduce a consistent truncation method that effectively reduces the problem to a finite-dimensional convex optimization problem. By consistent, we mean that the solution to this finite-dimensional problem allows to closely approximate the infinite-dimensional solution with arbitrary precision. Furthermore, we establish a link between the harmonic framework and the time domain setting, emphasizing the advantages over periodic differential LMIs. We illustrate that our proposed framework is not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable to solving $H_{2}$ and $H_\infty$ harmonic control design problems. To enable this, we extend the definitions of $H_{2}$ and $H_\infty$ norms into the harmonic space, leveraging the concepts of the harmonic transfer function and the average trace operator for Toeplitz block operators. Throughout this article, we support our theoretical contributions with a range of illustrative examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Distributed online learning is gaining increased traction due to its unique ability to process large-scale datasets and streaming data. To address the growing public awareness and concern about privacy protection, plenty of algorithms have been proposed to enable differential privacy in distributed online optimization and learning. However, these algorithms often face the dilemma of trading learning accuracy for privacy. By exploiting the unique characteristics of online learning, this article proposes an approach that tackles the dilemma and ensures both differential privacy and learning accuracy in distributed online learning. More specifically, while ensuring a diminishing expected instantaneous regret, the approach can simultaneously ensure a finite cumulative privacy budget, even in the infinite time horizon. To cater for the fully distributed setting, we adopt the local differential-privacy framework, which avoids the reliance on a trusted data curator that is required in the classic “centralized” (global) differential-privacy framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that successfully ensures both rigorous local differential privacy and learning accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using machine learning tasks, including logistic regression on the the “mushrooms” datasets and convolutional neural network-based image classification on the “MNIST” and “CIFAR-10” datasets.},

Stochastic gradient methods enable low computational complexity, while they are hard and slow to converge due to the variance caused by random sampling. To construct a convergent distributed stochastic projection-free algorithm, this article incorporates variance reduction and gradient tracking techniques in the Frank–Wolfe (FW) update. We develop a novel sampling rule for the variance reduction technique to reduce the variance introduced by stochastic gradients. Complete and rigorous proofs show that the proposed distributed projection-free algorithm converges with a sublinear convergence rate and enjoys superior complexity guarantees for both convex and nonconvex objective functions.

  abstract     = {The problem of reconciling a prior probability law on paths with data was introduced by Schrödinger in 1931 and 1932. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schrödinger&#39;s bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schrödinger&#39;s paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schrödinger&#39;s dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.},

  abstract     = {Calculating fixed points of a nonlinear function is a central problem in many areas of science and engineering with applications ranging from the study of dynamical systems to optimization and game theory. Fixed-point iteration methods provide a simple way to calculate the fixed point of nonexpansive mappings and they have been studied extensively. Emerging applications, however, necessitate the study of fixed-point calculation under various perturbations. For instance, in the data-driven identification of dynamical systems, the learning is typically erroneous, which in turn impacts the subsequent fixed calculations, which itself is an essential step for control. Motivated by such settings, in this work, we establish a general mathematical modeling framework for the study of inexact fixed-point iteration (FPI) algorithms. In doing so, we leverage and extend the recent advances in the stochastic optimization literature to derive new methods and convergence analysis results. In particular, adopting this view enables us to present a unified mathematical model to study the impact of inexact computations in both expansive and nonexpansive scenarios, a new technical approach for the analysis of inexact FPI methods, and a new inexact FPI method, which under certain assumptions, enjoys a faster convergence rate than traditional FPI algorithms in the expansive case.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces two sample-based formulations of incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), a suitable detectability notion for general nonlinear systems. In this work, we consider the case of limited output information, i.e., measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. The output-dependent term of the sample-based i-IOSS bound is properly modified to yield a characterization for detectability in the presence of incomplete output sequences. We provide both a nontime-discounted and a time-discounted formulation of sample-based i-IOSS. Furthermore, conditions for an i-IOSS system to be also sample-based i-IOSS are given and the relation between the two formulations of sample-based i-IOSS is shown.},

In this article, a relaxed Lyapunov-like condition for forward completeness is presented for finite-dimensional systems defined on open sets that does not require boundedness of the Lyapunov-like function along the solutions of the system but an exponential growth condition. The corresponding condition is then exploited for the design of autonomous 2-D movement, with focus on lane-free cruise controllers for automated vehicles described by the bicycle kinematic model. The derived feedback laws (cruise controllers) are decentralized and can account for collision avoidance, roads of variable width, on-ramps and off-ramps as well as different desired speed for each vehicle.},

The proposed detection methods can distinguish system fault and replay attack, handle both input and output data replay, maintain certain control performance, and be implemented conveniently and efficiently. First, the replay attack effect on the residual is derived and analyzed. The residual change induced by replay attack is characterized explicitly, and the detection performance analysis based on two different test statistics is given. Second, based on the replay attack effect characterization, targeted passive and active designs for detection performance enhancement are proposed. Regarding the passive design, four optimization schemes regarding different cost functions are proposed with optimal parity matrix solutions, and the unified solution to the passive optimization schemes is obtained; the active design is enabled by a marginally stable filter so as to enlarge the replay attack effect on the residual for detection. Simulations and comparison studies are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action–reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of optimal mode scheduling subject to dwell time constraints, which is the minimum amount of time a system has to spend in one mode before it can transition to another. The constraint is important since most physical systems cannot switch rapidly between different modes and its presence also eliminates the problem of chattering solutions by construction. We investigate the topology of the optimization space and show that it lacks structure to define local minima. A framework is developed for defining optimal solutions as stationary points of optimality functions and an optimality function is proposed for characterizing the necessary conditions for optimality. The challenges posed by dwell time constraints to algorithmic implementation are addressed by exploring the geometric properties of the so-called mode insertion gradient, and a technique is developed for rapidly updating of the mode sequence. The algorithm&#39;s convergence to an optimal solution is proved and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the algorithm&#39;s efficacy.},

Further, a class of matrix operations induced by fairly common $n$-port network connections is examined. The intrinsic phase properties of networks under such connections are preserved. Concretely, a scalable phase-preserving criterion is proposed, which involves only the phase properties of individual subnetworks, under the matrix operations featured by connections. This criterion ensures that the phase range of the integrated network can be verified effectively and that the scalability of the analyses can be maintained. In addition, the inverse operations of the considered connections, that is, network subtractions with correspondences are examined. With the known phase ranges of the integrated network and one of its subnetworks, the maximal allowable phase range of the remaining subnetwork can also be determined explicitly in a unified form for all types of subtractions. Finally, we extend the phase-preserving properties from the aforementioned connections to more general matrix operations defined using a certain indefinite inner product.},

The system is modeled by an automaton in which several states are secret and assigned with different confidentiality requirement. Events in the system can be protected to verify the identity of the user, and a user who successfully executes/passes a protected event gains some authorization. Our purpose is to design an event-protecting policy such that any user, either legal or unauthorized, who visits a secret state must have an authorization that satisfies the requirement of confidentiality of the state. We consider the criteria of optimality on protecting policies as to protecting policies with a minimum degree of disturbance to legal users&#39; normal operations. To this aim, we use Moore machines to model the dynamics of the clearance level of users when using the system. Then, we develop an auxiliary data structure called the generalized secret automaton, based on which we propose a method to design a protecting policy using the classical supervisory control theory. The minimally disruptive protecting policy is then represented by an automaton called the secret enforcer whose state size is polynomial both in the number of the plant states and the number of secret states in the plant.},

Two algorithms involving inclusive neighbor information and neighbor information are introduced to accomplish attack isolation. By exploring the mechanism of attack collusion, it is found that both the number of subsystems&#39; one-hop neighbors and the size of cycles in the graph play significant roles in attack isolation. Besides, it is interesting to note that their impacts on attack isolation can be mutually compensated. Then, the worst attack collusion cases for the proposed algorithms under different cycle sizes are developed, based on which, several equivalent sufficient yet sharp graph conditions for the isolation of false data injection attacks and covert attacks are, respectively, provided with the notion of $(r,s)$-isolability. It is revealed that the inclusive neighbor information-based algorithm is more effective for isolating false data injection attacks. In contrast, the neighbor information-based algorithm is more suitable for isolating covert attacks. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The local gradient information of each player, essential in implementing algorithms for finding game solutions, is all too often unavailable. In this article, we focus on designing solution algorithms for multiplayer games using bandit feedback, i.e., the only available feedback at each player&#39;s disposal is the realized objective values. To tackle the issue of large variances in the existing bandit learning algorithms with a single oracle call, we propose two algorithms by integrating the residual feedback scheme into single-call extragradient methods. Subsequently, we show that the actual sequences of play can converge almost surely to a critical point if the game is pseudomonotone plus and characterize the convergence rate to the critical point when the game is strongly pseudomonotone. The ergodic convergence rates of the generated sequences in monotone games are also investigated as a supplement. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithms is further verified via numerical examples.},

In particular, to our knowledge, CEDAS enjoys so far the shortest transient time (with respect to the graph specifics) for achieving the convergence rate of centralized SGD, which behaves as $\mathcal {O}(n{C^{3}}/(1-\lambda _{2})^{2})$ under smooth strongly convex objective functions and $\mathcal {O}(n^{3}{C^{6}}/(1-\lambda _{2})^{4})$ under smooth nonconvex objective functions, where $(1-\lambda _{2})$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix, and $C&amp;gt;0$ is the compression-related parameter.

The players then simultaneously allocate their remaining real-time resources, which can be randomized, in a decisive final stage. Our main contributions provide complete characterizations of the optimal reinforcement strategies and resulting equilibrium payoffs in these multistage General Lotto games.

Each subsystem in the network performs its local updates by using the information received from its neighbors, be it possibly outdated. The communication delays with respect to different neighbors are assumed to be arbitrary but bounded. The objective function consists of a twice differentiable coupling term and an aggregated private term. The private function of each subsystem is the sum of two possibly nonsmooth terms, one of which is composed of a linear mapping. We propose a primal-dual fixed point algorithm framework based on the adapted metric for two scenarios where the coupling among subsystems is only enacted by the global objective function and enforced both by the global objective function and the linear mapping. The adapted metric method utilizes an adequate quadratic approximation of the global objective function as the updating step-size to exploit the second-order information. Under some mild assumptions, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is rigorously analyzed based on the quasi-Fejér monotonicity. The numerical simulation verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Distributed stochastic nonconvex optimization problems have recently received attention due to the growing interest of signal processing, computer vision, and natural language processing communities in applications deployed over distributed learning systems (e.g., federated learning). We study the setting where the data is distributed across the nodes of a time-varying directed network, a topology suitable for modeling dynamic networks experiencing communication delays and straggler effects. The network nodes, which can access only their local objectives and query a stochastic first-order oracle to obtain gradient estimates, collaborate to minimize a global objective function by exchanging messages with their neighbors. We propose an algorithm, novel to this setting, that leverages stochastic gradient descent with momentum and gradient tracking to solve distributed nonconvex optimization problems over time-varying networks. To analyze the algorithm, we tackle the challenges that arise when analyzing dynamic network systems that communicate gradient acceleration components. We prove that the algorithm&#39;s oracle complexity is $\mathcal {O}(1/\epsilon ^{1.5})$, and that under Polyak-$\text{L}$ojasiewicz condition the algorithm converges linearly to a steady error state. The proposed scheme is tested on several learning tasks: a nonconvex logistic regression experiment on the MNIST dataset, an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and an NLP classification test on the IMDB dataset. We further present numerical simulations with an objective that satisfies the PL condition. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework compared to the existing related methods.},

  abstract     = {Networked multiagent systems often communicate information over low-power shared wireless networks in unlicensed spectrum, which are prone to denial-of-service attacks. An instance of this scenario is considered: multiple pairs of agents, each pair consisting of a transmitting sensor and a receiver acting as an estimator, communicate strategically over shared communication networks in the presence of a jammer who may launch a denial-of-service attack in the form of packet collisions. Using the so-called coordinator approach, we cast this problem as a zero-sum game between the coordinator, who jointly optimizes the transmission and estimation policies, and a jammer, who optimizes its probability of performing an attack. We consider two cases: point-to-point channels and large-scale networks with a countably infinite number of sensor–receiver pairs. When the jammer proactively attacks the channel, we find that this game is nonconvex from the coordinator&#39;s perspective. However, we construct a saddle point equilibrium solution for any multivariate Gaussian input distribution for the observations despite the lack of convexity. In the case where the jammer is reactive, we obtain a customized algorithm based on sequential convex optimization, which converges swiftly to first-order Nash equilibria. Interestingly, we discovered that when the jammer is reactive, it is often optimal to block the channel even when it knows that the channel is idle to create ambiguity at the receiver.},

The typical attacks involve initially proposing a parameterized pattern, such as a linear one, then optimizing parameters according to system performance. The parameterized model limits the destructivity because it cannot cover all patterns. To overcome this, we investigate a generalized deception attack model with an unparameterized form. The resulting optimal attack patterns are nonlinear and discontinuous but can be analytically formalized. As a consideration of optimality, we consider two scenarios for attacks: the myopic scenario, focusing on current system time-step performance, and the nonmyopic one, considering both pregiven system time-step and steady-state performance. A suboptimal attack with explicit pattern and estimation error is also proposed to reduce computational load. The conditions for the equivalence of different optimal attack models are provided. Moreover, we summarize typical stealthiness constraints and improve the proposed attacks on them. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A nonparametric learning solution framework is proposed for the global nonlinear robust output regulation problem. We first extend the assumption that the steady-state generator is linear in the exogenous signal to the more relaxed assumption that it is polynomial in the exogenous signal. In addition, a nonparametric learning framework is proposed to eliminate the construction of an explicit regressor, as required in the adaptive method, which can potentially simplify the implementation and reduce the computational complexity of existing methods. With the help of the proposed framework, the robust nonlinear output regulation problem can be converted into a robust nonadaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral input-to-state stable inverse dynamics. Moreover, a dynamic gain approach can adaptively raise the gain to a sufficiently large constant to achieve stabilization without requiring any a priori knowledge of the uncertainties appearing in the dynamics of the exosystem and the system. Furthermore, we apply the nonparametric learning framework to globally reconstruct and estimate multiple sinusoidal signals with unknown frequencies without the need for adaptive parametric techniques. An explicit nonlinear mapping can directly provide the estimated parameters, which will exponentially converge to the unknown frequencies. Finally, a feedforward control design is proposed to solve the linear output regulation problem using the nonparametric learning framework. Two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

This article aims to extend the geometric relationship between the controllable subspace of a linear system and the unobservable subspace of its dual to the realm of nonlinear systems on smooth manifolds.

  abstract     = {The discrete-time, infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is studied with the objective of establishing a unified perspective on the problem by relying simultaneously on Dynamic Programming and the discrete Minimum Principle. While it is well known that the two strategies independently yield the optimal solution, it is shown here that their combination provides much deeper insights on the nature of the optimal solution and on the strategies by means of which it can be computed. More precisely, the optimal cost, captured by the matrix P, and the feedback gain matrix K are jointly related via the observability matrix of the underlying state/costate (Hamiltonian) dynamics when the state alone is measured. Such an abstract property is then instrumental for deriving alternative characterizations of the optimal solution. First, an algebraic equation, referred to as the policy algebraic equation, is established in the variable K alone and with dimension typically much smaller than the size of the classic ARE arising in discrete-time LQR, although comprising polynomial equations of higher degree. This equation permits the direct construction of the optimal feedback gain (i.e., the actor) without the need for the simultaneous computation of the optimal cost (i.e., the critic). The structure of the policy algebraic equation naturally lends itself to an iterative approach towards its solution, which is restricted to the space of policies alone and which does not require the explicit solution of any intermediate (linear) equation at each step. Furthermore, as a consequence of the above properties, it is possible to derive a Riccati equation in P, although with coefficients defined by polynomial functions of K, with the property that the constant and quadratic terms are symmetric and sign-definite. This aspect is remarkably different from the classic ARE associated to the discrete-time LQR and more akin to the continuous-time counterpart.},

  abstract = {Human emotions vary over time, which can be vividly described as a stream of emotions. Observing the emotion stream in daily life provides valuable insights into an individual&#39;s mental state. However, existing research in emotion understanding has mainly focused on classification tasks, assigning an emotion category to a well-trimmed segment or each frame within a continuous signal. In contrast, the task of temporal emotion detection, which involves locating the boundaries of emotion segments and recognizing their categories in untrimmed signals, has not been fully explored. To advance research in this area, this paper introduces an in-the-wild Audio-Visual Emotion Stream (AVES) dataset, which is reliably annotated with the time boundaries and emotion category for each emotion segment in the videos. Thus, AVES can serve as a solid benchmark for temporal emotion detection tasks. Moreover, considering the flexible boundaries and varying durations of emotion segments, we propose a Boundary Combination Network (BoCoNet) for temporal emotion detection, which leverages short-term temporal context information to first predict the boundaries of emotion segments and then locate the entire emotion segments. Extensive experiments conducted on various representative unimodal and multimodal representations demonstrate that BoCoNet achieves state-of-the-art results. The AVES dataset will be released to the research community. We expect that this paper can advance the research on emotion stream and temporal emotion detection.},

  abstract = {Due to the lack of physical touch, social distancing caused by COVID-19 makes it difficult to convey social intentions through handshakes. To mitigate this situation, one promising solution is to simulate distinguishable handshake patterns through haptic feedback devices during distant social communication. This paper reports a distant handshake scheme with multi-modal soft haptic gloves. To address the challenge of duplicating rich haptic stimuli of real handshakes in a compact glove, we extracted four haptic features including grip location, grip strength, skin temperature, and shaking frequency from abundant components of the haptic perception system to mimic handshake behaviors. To guide the interference-free spatial layout of multiple actuators in a limited hand-sized space, we measured the handshake contact area and grip strength of different handshake patterns, which together with the thermosensitivity of the human hand determine the grip location, grip strength, and salient thermal stimulating location. We developed a multi-modal soft haptic glove by rendering four features through pneumatic pressure, thermal, and vibrotactile stimuli, respectively. A user study was conducted to validate the performance of our glove, which set two states for each of the four features, showing over 90% accuracy in distinguishing 16 handshake patterns. Furthermore, a user study on the identification of social intentions yields the finding that distant handshakes with our haptic gloves can convey positive, neutral, and negative social intentions. These results inform the potential of distant handshakes with haptic gloves to convey social intentions in remote interactions including business, politics, and daily life in severe and post-pandemic situations, as well as in future metaverse-based society.},

  abstract = {Video-based facial affect analysis has recently attracted increasing attention owing to its critical role in human-computer interaction. Previous studies mainly focus on developing various deep learning architectures and training them in a fully supervised manner. Although significant progress has been achieved by these supervised methods, the longstanding lack of large-scale high-quality labeled data severely hinders their further improvements. Motivated by the recent success of self-supervised learning in computer vision, this paper introduces a self-supervised approach, termed Self-supervised Video Facial Affect Perceiver (SVFAP), to address the dilemma faced by supervised methods. Specifically, SVFAP leverages masked facial video autoencoding to perform self-supervised pre-training on massive unlabeled facial videos. Considering that large spatiotemporal redundancy exists in facial videos, we propose a novel temporal pyramid and spatial bottleneck Transformer as the encoder of SVFAP, which not only largely reduces computational costs but also achieves excellent performance. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning three downstream tasks, including dynamic facial expression recognition, dimensional emotion recognition, and personality recognition. Comprehensive results demonstrate that SVFAP can learn powerful affect-related representations via large-scale self-supervised pre-training and it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all datasets.},

A total of 780 sounds are selected from the BBC Sounds Library. Participants are recruited online and asked to rate a subset of sounds based on how they make them feel. Each sound is rated for arousal and valence. It was found that while evenly distributed, there was bias towards the low-valence, high-arousal quadrant, and displayed a greater range of ratings in comparison to others. The AAD is compared with existing datasets to check its consistency and validity, with differences in data collection methods and intended use-cases highlighted. Using a subset of the data, the online ratings were validated against an in-person data collection experiment with findings strongly correlating.

  abstract = {Enabling continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of stress is essential for delivering personalized stress interventions at opportune moments. To achieve automatic stress detection on a time-continuous basis, reliable moment-to-moment ratings of stress are required. However, the current research lacks a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides time-continuous ratings of perceived stress. Existing datasets mainly consist of single-valued self-reported ratings obtained after the stress-inducing task or rely on audio-visual recordings to capture moment-to-moment ratings from multiple annotators. The collection of time-continuous ratings of stress based solely on audio recordings has not been extensively explored. In this paper, we introduce an updated version of the publicly available VerBIO dataset that contains moment-to-moment ratings of perceived stress from multiple annotators. These annotators rated their perception of stress by listening to participants who had conducted a public speaking task. Time-continuous ratings of stress are obtained from four annotators using 22 hours of audio recordings from 339 public speaking sessions performed by 53 individuals. These time-continuous ratings of stress perception were obtained from the annotators solely based on speech, without incorporating the visual modality as an expressive marker. We examine the reliability of the annotation scheme employed in this study and investigate the factors contributing to the observed variation in perceived stress among annotators. Next, we introduce an annotation fusion technique based on expectation-maximization to obtain a reliable gold standard rating by aggregating the ratings from multiple annotators. Results indicate that the proposed annotation fusion technique yields aggregated ratings that can be estimated more reliably using acoustic features compared to the ratings yielded from conventional annotation fusion techniques. The newly generated annotations are publicly available within the proposed updated version of the existing VerBIO dataset, facilitating research in the field of continuous stress detection.},

  abstract = {Depression has long been studied in the NLP field, with most works focusing on individuals’ negative emotions. People with depression experience happiness, but this has not been extensively studied. Previous works have shown that sentiment or emotion classification approaches are unsuitable for extracting happy moments because they may not be expressed only in positive words. In this work, we conduct a large-scale study of happy moments from social media texts of individuals mentioning a depression diagnosis. We develop an extensive deep learning-based framework to extract happy moments from text, and annotate them with semantic topics, gender labels, and agency and sociality measures. We analyze over 400,000 happy moments and show significant differences in topics, agency, and sociality of users in the depression and control groups, varying by gender. We found that male and female users in the depression group expressed more sociality in their happy moments than control users. Furthermore, male users’ agency was not impaired in depression, while female users in the depression group expressed fewer happy moments with agency than the control group. Our research can inform psychology interventions, which can foster feelings of longer-lasting happiness and represent a promising path of collaboration between computational linguistics and psychology.},

  abstract = {Interpersonal touch is an important channel of social emotional interaction. How these physical skin-to-skin touch expressions are processed in the peripheral nervous system is not well understood. From microneurography recordings in humans, we evaluated the capacity of six subtypes of cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents to differentiate human-delivered social touch expressions. Leveraging statistical and classification analyses, we found that single units of multiple mechanoreceptive Aβ subtypes, especially slowly adapting type II (SA-II) and fast adapting hair follicle afferents (HFA), can reliably differentiate social touch expressions at accuracies similar to human recognition. We then identified the most informative firing patterns of SA-II and HFA afferents, which indicate that average durations of 3-4 s of firing provide sufficient discriminative information. Those two subtypes also exhibit robust tolerance to spike-timing shifts of up to 10-20 ms, varying with touch expressions due to their specific firing properties. Greater shifts in spike-timing, however, can change a firing pattern&#39;s envelope to resemble that of another expression and drastically compromise an afferent&#39;s discrimination capacity. Altogether, the findings indicate that SA-II and HFA afferents differentiate the skin contact of social touch at time scales relevant for such interactions, which are 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than those for non-social touch.},

  abstract = {Emotions arise from a complex interplay of various factors, including conscious experience, physiological processes, and contextual elements. Although emotions are inherently dynamic processes, this aspect is oftentimes neglected in experimental protocols. In this study, we employed dynamical systems theory to investigate the time-varying self-assessed emotion ratings. We used the continuous ratings of the publicly available CASE dataset, in which thirty individuals rated their level of arousal and valence while watching videos designed to evoke four different emotions. First, we analyzed the univariate dynamics by reconstructing the phase space from the arousal and valence series separately, and quantified their regularity and spatial complexity by using three metrics: Fuzzy, Sample, and Distribution Entropy. Then, we combined the arousal and valence series and proposed a novel index, the Multichannel Distribution Entropy (MDistEn), to estimate the complexity of the bivariate phase space. By coupling the two dimensions, we found that MDistEn resulted as an effective marker of fear, showing patterns statistically different from all of the other stimuli (p-value $\leq$ 0.001). These findings support the investigation of the time-varying dynamics of annotated emotion ratings as a promising pathway to discriminate the onset of fear-related pathological states.},

Massive studies focus on the mining of emotion-aware information, overlooking emotion-agnostic information, which is insufficient for the extraction of emotion-relevant features against redundancy and variation. In this paper, Graph Orthogonal Purification Network (Grop) is proposed to enhance individual adaptability through improvements in the orthogonality and transferability between emotion-relevant and emotion-irrelevant features. Specifically, the proposed Grop utilized a graph representation extraction module to capture both emotion-relevant and emotion-irrelevant features by the dual graph. The representation orthogonal purification module is developed to eliminate redundant information through feature projection and feature purification. Moreover, the dual emotional space alignment module is imposed to align distribution discrepancies in different emotion feature spaces. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed Grop, various experiments are conducted on two public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., SEED and SEED-IV. The results achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the capability of the Grop to capture robust emotion features and alleviate the intra- and inter-subject discrepancies.},

  abstract = {Most current audio-visual emotion recognition models lack the flexibility needed for deployment in practical applications. We envision a multimodal system that works even when only one modality is available and can be implemented interchangeably for either predicting emotional attributes or recognizing categorical emotions. Achieving such flexibility in a multimodal emotion recognition system is difficult due to the inherent challenges in accurately interpreting and integrating varied data sources. It is also a challenge to robustly handle missing or partial information while allowing direct switch between regression or classification tasks. This study proposes a versatile audio-visual learning (VAVL) framework for handling unimodal and multimodal systems for emotion regression or emotion classification tasks. We implement an audio-visual framework that can be trained even when audio and visual paired data is not available for part of the training set (i.e., audio only or only video is present). We achieve this effective representation learning with audio-visual shared layers, residual connections over shared layers, and a unimodal reconstruction task. Our experimental results reveal that our architecture significantly outperforms strong baselines on the CREMA-D, MSP-IMPROV, and CMU-MOSEI corpora. Notably, VAVL attains a new state-of-the-art performance in the emotional attribute prediction task on the MSP-IMPROV corpus.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is an objective tool for emotion recognition with promising applications. However, the scarcity of labeled data remains a major challenge in this field, limiting the widespread use of EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, a semi-supervised Dual-stream Self-attentive Adversarial Graph Contrastive learning framework (termed as DS-AGC) is proposed to tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition. The DS-AGC framework includes two parallel streams for extracting non-structural and structural EEG features. The non-structural stream incorporates a semi-supervised multi-domain adaptation method to alleviate distribution discrepancy among labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and unknown target domain. The structural stream develops a graph contrastive learning method to extract effective graph-based feature representation from multiple EEG channels in a semi-supervised manner. Further, a self-attentive fusion module is developed for feature fusion, sample selection, and emotion recognition, which highlights EEG features more relevant to emotions and data samples in the labeled source domain that are closer to the target domain. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark databases (SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, and FACED) using a semi-supervised cross-subject leave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation protocol. The results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods under different incomplete label conditions with an average improvement of 2.17%, which demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing the label scarcity problem in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition.},

Those decisions are computed by taking the context of interaction and the estimated level of rapport between the human and the agent into account. We then present a study based on a vicarious protocol where participants evaluated recorded interactions between an avatar (a human-controlled 3D character) and our agent. Results indicate that the estimations made by our decision model regarding the state of the situation mirror those made by human observers. Our initial hypothesis that the level of rapport would positively influence the acceptability of a touch receives mixed support. Social touch occurrences did not feel as coherent and acceptable as hoped yet. Avenues of improvement for human-agent interactions including social touch are discussed.},

Most existing studies are dominant with adversarial learning methods and focus on learning domain-invariant sentiment representations in both the source and target domains. However, since sentiment-specific features are not explicitly decoupled, the model may confuse domain features with sentiment features, thus affecting its generalization ability on target domains. Unlike previous studies, in this paper, we tackle the CDSA task from the view of disentangled representation learning, which explicitly learns the disentangled representations of review, focusing in particular on sentiment and domain semantics. Specifically, we disentangle sentiment-specific and domain-specific features from the text representation of the review by two different linear transformations. Then, we introduce a straightforward disentangled loss to disallow the sentiment-specific feature to capture domain information. Moreover, we leverage target unlabeled data to improve the quality of the learned sentiment-specific features via prototypical learning. It indirectly encourages the sentiment-specific features of target samples having potentially different classes more discriminative. Extensive experiments on widely used CDSA datasets show that our method surpasses competitive baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract = {Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is the technology of intelligently recognizing and assessing human sentiments using various data forms such as text, image, and audio. Despite current mainstream methods have made significant progress, MSA still faces the following issues: 1) most current methods train models based on pre-extracted features, lacking a sufficient understanding of sentiment diversity in multimodal data and may even lead to the loss of critical information in the raw data; and 2) textual modality, which possesses high-level semantic features, should typically dominate the fusion process, yet current methods fail to fully leverage this characteristic to balance modality information. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Multimodal Sentiment Analysis framework using Multimodal-Prefixed and Cross-Modal Attention (DB-MPCA). For the first issue, DB-MPCA employs multimodal raw data for pre-training, which not only allows for in-depth exploration of multimodal information but also significantly enhances the model’s learning capabilities and generalization, while reducing the substantial costs associated with manual annotation. Regarding the second issue, DB-MPCA introduces two prefix encoders designed to convert acoustic and visual features into prefix tokens. These tokens are then embedded into a pre-trained language model, where they are encoded together with textual tokens. Through this approach, DB-MPCA effectively learns cross-modal attention while maintaining the dominance of the textual modality, thereby optimizing the fusion of modalities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the widely utilized dataset (CMU-MOSI) demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, highlighting its superiority over baseline models.},

Results show that the GBF group practiced their treatments significantly more often, achieved better skill transfer at post-test, and obtained a higher increase in self-reported positivity and relaxation during treatment.

  abstract = {Recently, multimodal fusion efforts have achieved remarkable success in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). However, most of the existing methods are based on model-level fusion, and the challenge of heterogeneity between modalities is not well resolved. Heterogeneity lies in the different feature distributions and distinct representation spaces among different modalities. To mitigate this problem, we propose that fusion is a progressive process, and we introduce a novel multi-level contrastive learning and multi-layer convolution fusion (MCL-MCF) method for MSA. Due to the relationships among multimodal data, the fusion process that involves single-modal to single-modal, single-modal to bimodal or trimodal, and higher-level fused modality semantic consistency is divided into three levels. The first-level contrast learning alleviates heterogeneity between unimodal modalities at the early level of multimodal feature fusion. The second-level contrast learning mitigates heterogeneity between unimodal and fused modalities. At the third level, we introduce a tensor convolution fusion (TCF) module that extracts high-level semantic features from the fused modalities and mitigates heterogeneity at the higher feature level through contrastive learning. To simulate fusion as a progressive process, MCF is proposed to fuse shallow and deep features to model complex relationships among modalities. Experiments on three public datasets show our approach&#39;s state-of-the-art performance.},

As a useful tool for emotion recognition, facial action units (FAUs) extracted from facial images are well-established, however these are insufficiently detailed for the eye. In this paper, we extract discrete eye behaviors from eyelid, iris and pupil boundaries and propose eye action units (EAUs) based on the eye appearance (behavior), providing a detailed and interpretable representation that shares the advantages of FAUs and describes the wide range of eye states and shapes. Eight volunteers annotated 11 EAUs for 120 eye images, represented by a series of discrete eye behaviors. Analysis shows that the EAUs can be viably characterized by fundamental eye behaviors with moderate to substantial agreement. When evaluating discrete eye behaviors and EAUs for recognition of four mental states and two load levels, the former achieved significantly higher accuracy than conventional features of pupil size change and blink rate, especially using behavior duration features, and EAUs outperformed combinations of discrete eye behaviors in general, implying their utility as an action unit.},

  abstract = {While interest in the field of explainable agents increases, it is still an open problem to incorporate a proactive explanation component into a real-time human–agent collaboration. Thus, when collaborating with a human, we want to enable an agent to identify critical moments requiring timely explanations. We differentiate between situations requiring explanations about the agent&#39;s decision-making and assistive explanations supporting the user. In order to detect these situations, we analyze eye tracking signals of participants engaging in a collaborative virtual cooking scenario. First, we show how users’ gaze patterns differ between moments of user confusion, the agent making errors, and the user successfully collaborating with the agent. Second, we evaluate different state-of-the-art models on the task of predicting whether the user is confused or the agent makes errors using gaze- and task-related data. An ensemble of MiniRocket classifiers performs best, especially when updating its predictions with high frequency based on input samples capturing time windows of 3 to 5 seconds. We find that gaze is a significant predictor of when and what to explain. Gaze features are crucial to our classifier&#39;s accuracy, with task-related features benefiting the classifier to a smaller extent.},

  abstract = {Video-based automatic depression analysis provides a fast, objective and repeatable self-assessment solution, which has been widely developed in recent years. While depression cues may be reflected by human facial behaviours of various temporal scales, most existing approaches either focused on modelling depression from short-term or video-level facial behaviours. In this sense, we propose a two-stage framework that models depression severity from multi-scale short-term and video-level facial behaviours. The short-term depressive behaviour modelling stage first deep learns depression-related facial behavioural features from multiple short temporal scales, where a Depression Feature Enhancement (DFE) module is proposed to enhance the depression-related cues for all temporal scales and remove non-depression related noise. Two novel graph encoding strategies are proposed in the video-level depressive behavior modeling stage, i.e., Sequential Graph Representation (SEG) and Spectral Graph Representation (SPG), to re-encode all short-term features of the target video into a video-level graph representation, summarizing depression-related multi-scale video-level temporal information. As a result, the produced graph representations predict depression severity using both short-term and long-term facial behaviour patterns. The experimental results on AVEC 2013, AVEC 2014 and AVEC 2019 datasets show that the proposed DFE module constantly enhanced the depression severity estimation performance for various CNN models while the SPG is superior than other video-level modelling methods. More importantly, the result achieved for the proposed two-stage framework shows its promising and solid performance compared to widely-used one-stage modelling approaches.},

  abstract = {The diagnosis of depression in individuals with Parkinson&#39;s Disease (PD) through the utilization of multimodal fusion techniques represents a significant domain. The primary challenge involves the creation of a robust fusion framework to address the heterogeneity among different modalities effectively. However, previous studies primarily focused on interactions between heterogeneous data, neglecting the structural similarities among isomorphic data, resulting in a substantial loss of feature information when merging heterogeneous data. In this study, we introduced a multi-modal data image encoding and fusion approach for diagnosing depression in PD patients. Additionally, we proposed a multi-modal dataset encompassing motion, facial expression, and audio data. First, we designed an RGB and sparse coding method to encode the multi-modal data, achieving the isomorphic transformation of multi-modal information and extracting feature information from lower-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, we introduced a Spatial-Temporal Network (STN) to fuse the three types of encoded images. We incorporated the Relation Global Attention (RGA) to enhance feature extraction and leverage all encoded image location feature nodes for balanced decision attention. Finally, recognizing the limitations of traditional machine learning algorithms in handling multi-tasks in medical diagnosis, we established a multi-task weighted loss function to achieve depression identification and severity prediction through Multi-Task learning (MTL).},

  abstract = {Facial expression recognition (FER) has always been one of the key task in affective computing. Over the years, researchers have worked to improve the performance of FER by designing models with more powerful feature extraction, embedding attention mechanism, and reconstructing missing information, etc. Different from the paradigms above, we attempt to improve FER performance by using multimodal sentiment data, such as audio and text, as privileged information (PI) for facial images. To this end, a multimodal privileged information embedded facial expression recognition network (MPI-FER) is proposed in this paper. During the training phase, this model achieves the PI embedding of multimodal data for FER by developing cross-modality translation between multimodal sentiment data. During the test phase, input images alone are sufficient for the model inference to accomplish the FER task input. The MPI-FER is a large-scale, heterogeneous deep neural network. To achieve effective training of this model with limited training samples, we design a multi-stage training strategy of module-wise pre-training followed by end-to-end fine-tuning. In addition, a strategy of filling the multimodal sentiment quaternion is proposed for implementing our method on a facial expression database consisting only of face images. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method on two databases of multimodal sentiment analysis (CH-SIMS and CMU-MOSI) and two databases of FER in the wild (RAF-DB and AffectNet). The results show that embedding multimodal sentiment data as privileged information into the FER task based on face images can significantly improve the accuracy of FER. Furthermore, by only using image in the test phase, the proposed method can achieve better results of multimodal sentiment analysis than those methods achieved by using multimodal sentimental data fusion.},

After each task, participants reported their CWL by completing the NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and Instantaneous Self-Assessment (ISA). Personal background (e.g., personality and prior experience) was surveyed using demographic and Big Five Factor personality questionnaires, and two domains of subjective emotion information (i.e., arousal and valence) were obtained from the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), which could serve as potential indicators for improving CWL recognition performance.

  abstract = {In affective computing, breathing has seen lighter use than the heart and EDA channels. Several reasons have contributed to this, including difficulties in disambiguating affective from speech effects and perceived lack of generalizability. Here we report a framework that addresses these issues. The cornerstone of the framework is a comprehensive set of physiologically informed features, comprised of three groups: breathing depth, respiratory time quotient (RTQ), and breathing speed features. The breathing depth features capture either mental arousal or fear effects. The RTQ features capture speech production. The breathing speed features capture arousal effects due to emotional influences. The said framework appears to have broad applicability. In the naturalistic Office Tasks 2019 dataset with speaking sessions, the said features used either in regression or random forest models led to robust classification of arousal ($\overline{\text{AUC}}$ in [0.75, 0.96]) stemming from three different conditions: a) mental-emotional stressor effected through a time-pressured knowledge task; b) pure mental stressor effected through a long knowledge task; c) mental-social stressor effected through a public speech task. In the stylized CASE dataset with silent sessions, the same features and algorithms led to solid classification of arousal ($\overline{\text{AUC}}$ in [0.71, 0.85]) stemming from scary vs. non-scary movie clips.},

  abstract = {Recognizing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has faced great challenges due to insufficient professional clinicians and complex procedures. Automated data-driven ASD recognition models can reduce the subjectivity and physician dependency of traditional evaluation methods. Facial data, which can encode important perceptual and social behaviors, have emerged in ASD research to explore novel biomarkers for screening, diagnosing, and treating ASD. However, existing research mainly focuses on extracting low-level hand-crafted facial features for analysis and classification. Determining how to learn discriminative deep representations from dynamic facial data for computational model construction remains an unresolved challenge. In this study, we propose an ASD recognition model based on facial videos to fill the lack of temporal correlation learning of facial features. First, we utilize a vision transformer to extract frame-based global facial features. Then, we use a Longformer to establish the correlation of facial features over time. In the experiment, we recruited 146 subjects between 2 and 8 years of age to record their facial videos under a computer-based eye-tracking experiment and 76 subjects to conduct a smartphone-based experiment. Quantitative comparisons have shown the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed model. Furthermore, we have confirmed the correlation between facial and eye-tracking modalities in visual attention.},

The task is challenging due to the presence of speech variations, such as noise, content, and timbre, which can obstruct emotion extraction and transfer. This paper proposes a new approach to performing multi-speaker emotional speech synthesis. The proposed method, which is based on a seq2seq synthesizer, integrates emotion embedding as a conditioned variable to convey exact emotional information from reference audio to the synthesized speech. To boost emotion representation capability, we utilize a three-dimensional acoustic feature as input. And an emotion generalization module with adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) is proposed to obtain emotion embedding with high generalization ability, which also results in improved controllability. The derived emotion embedding from the generalization module can be readily conditioned by affine parameters, allowing for control both the emotion category and the emotion intensity of synthesized speech. Various emotional speech synthesis experimental results of the propposed method demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in multi-speaker emotional speech synthesis, coupled with its advantage of high emotion controllability.},

Though some emotion representations are popular in the literature, their relative merits and demerits in terms of expressiveness and broad applicability have been sparsely studied. The application-specific emotion representations used in multiple studies lead to incomparability of algorithms and performance metrics and non-reusability of representation-specific emotion data across studies. In this work, we study an intensity ratings-based, categorical emotion representation called Emotion-Word Intensity-Value (EWIV) representation, with emotion classes adapted from the aesthetic concept of Nava Rasa. We also introduce EmoRaga - a novel clip-set annotated with perceived emotions and emotion motifs for emotion analysis of Hindustani classical music. We explore the applicability of EWIV towards diverse MIR applications, e.g., dominant and secondary emotion identification, and temporal emotion pattern study. Last, we report a data-driven comparison of EWIV, categorical and dimensional representations, using statistical out-of-sample goodness of fit tests to measure and compare their representativeness over both benchmark datasets and collected emotion data. We conclude that EWIV is applicable to a range of MIR tasks, with higher representative and generalization potential compared to popular representations in certain cases.},

These methods discard data points without consensus, making the test set easier than practical tasks where a prediction is needed for each sample. However, the discarded data points often express ambiguous cues that elicit coexisting traits perceived by annotators. This paper addresses the importance of considering all the annotations and samples in the data, highlighting that only showing the model&#39;s performance on an incomplete test set selected by using the majority or plurality rules can lead to bias in the models’ performances. We focus on speech-emotion recognition (SER) tasks. We observe that traditional aggregation rules have a data loss ratio ranging from 5.63% to 89.17%. From this observation, we propose a flexible method named the all-inclusive aggregation rule to evaluate SER systems on the complete test data. We contrast traditional single-label formulations with a multi-label formulation to consider the coexistence of emotions. We show that training an SER model with the data selected by the all-inclusive aggregation rule shows consistently higher macro-F1 scores when tested in the entire test set, including ambiguous samples without agreement.},

Therefore, the ability to track emotion and patterns in emotion over time could provide new opportunities in measuring health longitudinally. This is of particular importance for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), where emotion dysregulation is a hallmark symptom of increasing mood severity. However, measuring emotions typically requires self-assessment, a willful action outside of one&#39;s daily routine. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for collecting real-world natural speech data from daily life and measuring emotions from these data. The approach combines a novel data collection pipeline and validated robust emotion recognition models. We describe a deployment of this pipeline that included parallel clinical and self-report measures of mood and self-reported measures of emotion. Finally, we present approaches to estimate clinical and self-reported mood measures using a combination of passive and self-reported emotion measures. The results demonstrate that both passive and self-reported measures of emotion contribute to our ability to accurately estimate mood symptom severity for individuals with BD.},

  abstract = {Emotion detection is a critical technology extensively employed in diverse fields. While the incorporation of commonsense knowledge has proven beneficial for existing emotion detection methods, dialogue-based emotion detection encounters numerous difficulties and challenges due to human agency and the variability of dialogue content. In dialogues, human emotions tend to accumulate in bursts. However, they are often implicitly expressed. This implies that many genuine emotions remain concealed within a plethora of unrelated words and dialogues. In this article, we propose a Dynamic Causal Disentanglement Model founded on the separation of hidden variables, which effectively decomposes the content of dialogues and investigates the temporal accumulation of emotions, thereby enabling more precise emotion recognition. First, we introduce a novel Causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to establish the correlation between hidden emotional information and other observed elements. Subsequently, our approach utilizes pre-extracted personal states and utterance topics as guiding factors for the distribution of hidden variables, aiming to separate irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Causal Disentanglement Model to infer the propagation of utterances and hidden variables, enabling the accumulation of emotion-related information throughout the conversation. To guide this disentanglement process, we leverage the GPT4.0 and LSTM networks to extract utterance topics and personal states as observed information. Finally, we test our approach on popular datasets in dialogue emotion detection and relevant experimental results verified the model&#39;s superiority.},

  abstract     = {Decision-making stands as a pivotal component in the realm of autonomous vehicles (AVs), playing a crucial role in navigating the intricacies of autonomous driving. Amid the evolving landscape of data-driven methodologies, enhancing decision-making performance in complex scenarios has emerged as a prominent research focus. Despite considerable advancements, current learning-based decision-making approaches exhibit potential for refinement, particularly in aspects of policy articulation and safety assurance. To address these challenges, we introduce DDM-Lag, a diffusion decision model, augmented with Lagrangian-based safety enhancements. This work conceptualizes the sequential decision-making challenge inherent in autonomous driving as a problem of generative modeling, adopting diffusion models as the medium for assimilating patterns of decision-making. We introduce a hybrid policy update strategy for diffusion models, amalgamating the principles of behavior cloning and Q-learning, alongside the formulation of an actor–critic architecture for the facilitation of updates. To augment the model&#39;s exploration process with a layer of safety, we incorporate additional safety constraints, employing a sophisticated policy optimization technique predicated on Lagrangian relaxation to refine the policy learning endeavor comprehensively. Empirical evaluation of our proposed decision-making methodology was conducted across a spectrum of driving tasks, distinguished by their varying degrees of complexity and environmental contexts. The comparative analysis with established baseline methodologies elucidates our model&#39;s superior performance, particularly in dimensions of safety and holistic efficacy.},

The finite-time command-filter is employed to reduce the difficulty of complex calculation caused by backstepping technique. An adaptive observer is developed to estimate unmeasured states, and a controller is designed to be triggered only when the event-triggered condition is met.

  abstract     = {AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have attracted great attention in the study of multiplayer systems over the past decade. Despite the advances, most of the studies are focused on synchronized decision-making to attain Nash equilibrium, where all the players take actions simultaneously. On the other hand, however, in complex applications, certain players may have an advantage in making sequential decisions and this situation introduces a hierarchical structure and influences how other players respond. The control design for such system is challenging since it relies on solving the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The situation becomes more difficult when the learning process is exposed to complex uncertainties with unreliable data being exchanged. Therefore, in this article, we develop a new learning-based control approach for a class of nonlinear hierarchical multiplayer systems subject to mismatched uncertainties. Specifically, we first formulate this new problem as a multiplayer Stackelberg–Nash game in conjunction with the hierarchical robust–optimal transformation. Theoretical analysis confirms the equivalence of this transformation and ensures that the designed control policies can achieve stable equilibrium. Then, a two-level neural-RL-based approach is developed to automatically and adaptively learn the solutions. The stability of this online learning process is also provided. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed learning-based robust control design.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments in Swin Transformer have shown its great potential in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. However, it is challenging to achieve desired performance by directly employing the Swin Transformer in multiview 3-D object recognition since the Swin Transformer independently extracts the characteristics of each view and relies heavily on a subsequent fusion strategy to unify the multiview information. This leads to the problem of the insufficient extraction of interdependencies between the multiview images. To this end, we propose an aggregation strategy integrated into the Swin Transformer to reinforce the connections between internal features across multiple views, thus leading to a complete interpretation of isolated features extracted by the Swin Transformer. Specifically, we utilize Swin Transformer to learn view-level feature representations from multiview images and then calculate their view discrimination scores. The scores are employed to assign the view-level features to different groups. Finally, a grouping and fusion network is proposed to aggregate the features from view and group levels. The experimental results indicate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance compared with prior approaches in multiview 3-D object recognition tasks.

However, they ignored that the mutual effects between the pretrained network and the downstream target network was also conducive to the learning of domain-invariant features. In this article, we propose a deep feature unsupervised domain adaptation (DFUDA) for time series classification. First, we pretrain a network based on consistency learning to ensure the invariant feature extraction from the source and target domains. Then, we propose an end-to-end unsupervised domain adaptation, which includes the layer matching and the unsupervised domain adaptation to promote more confident knowledge transfer. Finally, the pretrained network receives feedback of the domain adaptation&#39;s performance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform the comprehensive experiments on fault diagnosis datasets and human activity recognition datasets. The results show that DFUDA outperforms the state of the arts methods for both scenarios.},

This issue is exacerbated in rural regions, like parts of India, where a notable dermatologist shortage exists, leading to overlooked skin diseases. In response, the use of medicinal plants for dermatological purposes has been a longstanding tradition. However, traditional plant identification often relies on a single attribute, such as leaves or flowers, which can be unreliable due to seasonal variations. This article introduces a novel approach for accurately identifying medicinal plants using a multiattribute deep convolutional neural network. This approach aims to bridge the gap in healthcare access by empowering individuals to recognize and utilize these plants effectively. Our objective is to develop a robust deep CNN model trained on a diverse dataset of images encompassing leaves, trunks, and seeds of medicinal plants associated with skin health. Our findings demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy in plant identification, effectively addressing the limitations of single-attribute methods. This research not only contributes to the field of medicinal plant classification but also empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their skin health while preserving valuable traditional knowledge.},

However, existing FGL frameworks require all clients to train the identical GNN model, which limits their real-world applicability. Although many model-heterogenous frameworks have been proposed for traditional nongraph federated learning settings, directly transferring them to the FGL setting typically results in suboptimal performance. To fill the gap, this article presents federated prototype propagation network (FedPPN), a lightweight FGL framework that supports clients to train fully customized models. FedPPN only transmits prototypes between clients and the server for knowledge sharing. The core idea is propagating global prototypes on each client&#39;s local graph, generating prototype-based node representations and predictions. The prototype-based prediction can then be ensembled with the prediction of local GNN, allowing clients to achieve accurate prediction. We evaluate our FedPPN on six benchmark datasets with different heterogeneous model setups. Experimental results show that our FedPPN outperforms advanced baselines in model accuracy without adding any trainable parameters on clients or the server. Besides, FedPPN&#39;s communication cost is significantly lower than methods that rely on model parameter exchange.},

Addressing the challenges associated with IOD and NINO3.4 prediction, a robust multitask autoregressive deep learning (DL) model is introduced for precise forecasting of these indices and key grid projections sea surface temperature (SST), surface-level pressure gradient (SLG), and horizontal wind velocity (U-Comp) over a short to mid-term window (20 months). Utilizing spatiotemporal (SST, SLG, U-Comp) and temporal (IOD and NINO3.4) modalities, the proposed model predicts future IOD and NINO3.4, as well as SST, SLG, and U-Comp, in an autoregressive scheme. The multitask learning component regularizes the model, effectively capturing the evolving dynamics of global patterns conditioned on IOD and NINO3.4. The comprehensive evaluation explores various task settings, including a duo-setting that predicts IOD or NINO3.4 with spatiotemporal information, showcasing notable proficiency. In a multitask environment, where both temporal IOD, NINO3.4, and spatiotemporal SST, SLG, U-Comp are predicted, the model successfully forecasts IOD and NINO3.4 indices alongside grid projections with modest accuracy in root mean square error (RMSE). To enhance the model&#39;s interpretability regarding spatiotemporal dynamics, a tailored version of Grad-CAM is employed, providing critical insights for climate prediction.

  abstract     = {With the great progress of three-dimensional (3-D) sensing and acquisition technology, the volume of point cloud data has grown dramatically, which urges the development of efficient point cloud compression methods. In this article, we focus on the task of learned lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC). We propose an efficient attention-based method for lossy compression of point cloud attributes leveraging on an autoencoder architecture. Specifically, at the encoding side, we conduct multiple downsampling to best exploit the local attribute patterns, in which effective external cross attention (ECA) is devised to hierarchically aggregate features by intergrating attributes and geometry contexts. At the decoding side, the attributes of the point cloud are progressively reconstructed based on the multiscale representation and the zero-padding upsampling tactic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce attention mechanism to point-based lossy PCAC task. We verify the compression efficiency of our model on various sequences, including human body frames, sparse objects, and large-scale point cloud scenes. Experiments show that our method achieves an average improvement of 1.15 and 2.13 dB in Bjontegaard delta (BD)-peak signal-to-noise ratio (BD-PSNR) of Y channel and YUV channel, respectively, when comparing with the state-of-the-art point-based method deep-PCAC.

  abstract     = {The human brain is exceedingly good at learning rich narratives from highly limited experiences. One of the ways this is achieved in our brain is through neuromodulators or neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and nor-epinephrine, in cortical circuits. In terms of symbolic processing, these neuromodulators add “salience” to various emotions and experiences. A salience-based neural network (SANN) architecture was proposed in [1]. We have taken this architecture and have developed a discriminator to enable efficient change detection for underwater applications. In the context of underwater, surveillance can be elucidated as one of the processes of detecting and tracking the moving objects present in underwater videos. Several researchers working on the same tried to develop different techniques for identifying moving objects from outdoor scenes. However, while applying the same for underwater environments, it is found to be unable to preserve the minute details that are important for defining an object&#39;s boundary. This is mainly due to the complex scene dynamics of the aquatic environment. Moreover, the intricate natural properties of water and some of its characteristics, such as excessive turbidity, scattering, and low visibility, also make the task of detecting the object present in underwater videos extremely challenging. In this regard, we put forth an adversarial learning-based end-to-end deep learning architecture inspired by the way neurotransmitters work in the human brain to detect underwater moving objects. The proposed architecture uses two modules for underwater object detection. The initial module is a generator composed of a probabilistic learner which is based on multiple down- and up-sampling modules. Further, the discriminator network is composed of a multilevel feature-concatenation component, which can perpetuate specifics at distinct levels. The effectiveness of the proposed method (PM) is confirmed using the underwater change detection and Fish4Knowledge benchmark datasets by contrasting its outcomes with those of different state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Manipulated images are flooding our daily lives, which poses a threat to social security. Recently, many studies have focused on image tampering detection. However, they have poor performance on independent validation due to differences in image scenes and tampering methods. The key question is how to design a network that is able to adaptively enhance the tampering information and suppress the generalization features during training. To this end, we propose a dual-branch network with a frequency adaptation paradigm and a feature fusion module for robust tampering image detection. First, this paradigm is designed to adaptively highlight tampering features through frequency conversion and learnable weight. Second, a feature fusion module is developed to filter redundant features and dynamically fuse two-branch features. Experiments on eight typical datasets demonstrate that our model has advantages over state-of-the-art algorithms, and our paradigm can well empower semantic segmentation networks for tampering detection.},

  abstract     = {The bone structure in a chest x-ray creates trouble for a radiologist to examine the organs, manifestation of disease, and hidden tiny abnormalities. Bone suppression in chest x-rays allows better examination of lung fields. This has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. Dual-energy subtraction imaging is a standard bone suppression technique that delivers a higher dose of radiation and requires specific hardware. This article proposes a novel multiscale and dual attention-guided generative adversarial network (MDA-GAN) to transform chest x-rays into bone-suppressed x-rays in an unsupervised manner. We incorporate a spatial attention module to generate attention maps that were further concatenated with the coarsely generated bone segmentation mask. This dual attention is introduced to the generator at multiple scales in between the skip connection of the encoder and decoder layer. The proposed dual attention multiscale mechanism helps the generator to learn that only bones need to be removed on the chest x-ray without tempering the remaining parts. The proposed MDA-GAN is trained with adversarial loss combined with deep supervised cycle consistency and structure similarity for unpaired training images. We employ supervision heads in all the decoder layers to convert the activation maps into an output comparable to the scaled-down images and minimize the cycle consistency loss in a deep supervised manner. Experiments are conducted on an unpaired dataset including the public and our in-house Indian dataset and results show that incorporating dual attention at multiple scales and deep cycle consistency in translation networks significantly improves the quality of bone-suppressed images.

  abstract     = {Pretrained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance on question answering (QA) tasks, but they usually require fine-tuning (FT) that depends on a substantial quantity of QA pairs. Therefore, improving the performance of PLMs in scenarios with only a small number of training examples, also known as a few-shot setting, is of great practical significance. Current mitigation strategies for the few-shot QA task largely rely on pretraining a QA task-specific language model from scratch, overlooking the potential of foundational PLMs to generate QA pairs, particularly in the few-shot setting. To address this issue, we propose a prompt-based QA data augmentation method aimed at automating the creation of high-quality QA pairs. It employs the PFT method, adapting the question generation process of PLMs to the few-shot setting. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic text filling training strategy. This strategy simulates the progressive human learning process, thereby alleviating overfitting of PLMs in the few-shot setting and enhancing their reasoning capability to tackle complex questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across various few-shot configurations.},

  abstract     = {E-learning courses often suffer from high dropout rates and low student satisfaction. One way to address this issue is to use personalized learning paths (PLPs), which are sequences of learning materials that meet the individual needs of students. However, creating PLPs is difficult and often involves combining knowledge graphs (KGs), student profiles, and learning materials. Researchers typically assume that the problem of creating PLPs belong to the nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard class of computational problems. However, previous research in this field has neither defined the different variations of the PLP problem nor formally established their computational complexity. Without clear definitions of the PLP variations, researchers risk making invalid comparisons and conclusions when they use different metaheuristics for different PLP problems. To unify this conversation, this article formally proves the NP-completeness of two common PLP variations and their generalizations and uses them to categorize recent research in the PLP field. It then presents an instance of the PLP problem using real-world data and shows how this instance can be cast into two different NP-complete variations. This article then presents three artificial intelligence (AI) strategies, solving one of the PLP variations with back-tracking and branch and bound heuristics and also converting the PLP variation instance to XCSP${}^{3}$, an intermediate constraint satisfaction language to be resolved with a general constraint optimization solver. This article solves the other PLP variation instance using a greedy search heuristic. The article finishes by comparing the results of the two different PLP variations.},

Notably, various deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art performance in traffic prediction tasks but still lack interpretability. To interpret the critical information abstracted by traffic prediction models, we proposed a flexible framework termed Traffexplainer toward GNN-based interpretable traffic prediction. Traffexplainer is applicable to a wide range of GNNs without making any modifications to the original model structure. The framework consists of the GNN-based traffic prediction model and the perturbation-based hierarchical interpretation generator. Specifically, the hierarchical spatial mask and temporal mask are introduced to perturb the prediction model by modulating the values of input data. Then the prediction losses are backward propagated to the masks, which can identify the most critical features for traffic prediction, and further improve the prediction performance. We deploy the framework with five representative GNN-based traffic prediction models and analyze their prediction and interpretation performance on three real-world traffic flow datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our framework can generate effective and faithful interpretations for GNN-based traffic prediction models, and also improve the prediction performance.

Accurately identifying unknown traffic is critical to network management and security, not only to help managers allocate bandwidth appropriately for all types of applications and ensure quality of service but also to prevent security breaches that may result from unknown applications or protocols. Notably, the unknown network traffic has been increasing with the emergence of new applications or protocols, which further increases the difficulty in identifying them. Existing unknown traffic classification methods based on Softmax output confidence values cause bias in the prediction probability due to overconfidence of the model during the training process, thus decreasing the identification accuracy. Thus, for unknown traffic identification, this study proposes a deep-learning-based uncertainty-estimation (EUE) approach. EUE introduces the theory of evidence to the task of identifying unknown traffic by inferring traffic uncertainty directly from traffic evidence without the need for a Softmax layer, thus avoiding overconfidence in the model. Thus, the EUE can accurately identify unknown traffic while classifying known traffic at the application level. We construct two experimental scenarios simulating the real network environments with different proportions of unknown traffic to evaluate EUE. The experimental results show that the proposed approach EUE exhibits excellent classification accuracy.},

However, these algorithms are criticized for the low efficiency of the optimization process, especially when the number of users is large. To address this issue, this article proposes an evolutionary multitasking-based recommendation method, where each task corresponds to a user and all the tasks are optimized simultaneously, thus highly improving the efficiency of recommendation. To enhance the convergence speed, all the users are divided into multiple populations according to the similarity between their preferences, where each population evolves with internal knowledge transfer between users, and all the populations evolve with external knowledge transfer between populations. Experimental results on various datasets verify that the proposed method can better balance between multiple metrics than classical and deep neural network-based recommendation methods and exhibits significantly higher efficiency than evolutionary multiobjective optimization-based recommendation methods.},

We cast it as a multiarmed bandit problem with a Gaussian process (GP) for the payoff function. Action selections rely on upper confidence bound (UCB) or expected improvement (EI). Prior works with GPs faced challenges for large iteration horizons ($T$) due to cubic scaling in posterior computation. To address this, we propose a simple thresholding: incorporating an action into the GP posterior only when its conditional entropy surpasses $\epsilon$. Doing so permits us to precisely characterize the tradeoff between regret bounds of GP bandit algorithms and complexity of the posterior distributions depending on the compression parameter $\epsilon$ for both discrete and continuous action sets. To best of our knowledge, this is the first result which allows us to obtain sublinear regret bounds while still maintaining sublinear growth rate of the complexity of the posterior which is linear in the existing literature. Moreover, a provably finite bound on the complexity could be achieved but the algorithm would result in $\epsilon$-regret which means $\textbf{Reg}_{T}/T\rightarrow\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ as $T\rightarrow\infty$. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and complexity tradeoffs for GP bandit algorithms in global optimization, highlighting the benefits of compressed GPs in bandit settings.},

  abstract = {Information diffusion and diffusion prediction have attracted a great deal of research attention over the past decades. Existing approaches usually make predictions based on the order of the activated users, while recently, some studies have taken the social network into consideration and begun to analyze the influence of neighbors via some graph neural networks. However, they ignore the fact that the interests of users and their neighbors may dynamically change along with the growth of the cascade, and thus fail to model the potential impact of activated users. To address the above shortcomings, we proposed in this paper a deep learning model that combines the Mode of cascades Growth and potential Impact of users (MGI). It leverages GCNs to represent users from the social network to model their static features. Besides, we designed an attention mechanism on the cascade sequence to compute features of activated users, and added the popularity variable to model features of users in cascades. Finally, we combined the growth of cascades and impact of users in our model for diffusion prediction. We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in diffusion prediction.},

  abstract = {As a classic k-NN graph construction method, NN-Descent has been adopted in various applications for its simplicity, genericness, and efficiency. However, its memory consumption is high due to the employment of two extra supporting graph structures. In this paper, a novel k-NN graph construction method is proposed. Similar to NN-Descent, the k-NN graph is constructed by doing cross-matching continuously on the sampled neighbors on each neighborhood. Whereas different from NN-Descent, the cross-matching is undertaken directly on the k-NN graph under construction. It makes the extra graph structures adopted to support the cross-matching no longer necessary. Moreover, no synchronization between different threads is needed within one iteration. The high-quality graph is constructed at the high-speed efficiency and considerably better memory efficiency over NN-Descent on both the multi-thread CPU and the GPU.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of positioning technology produces an extremely large volume of spatio-temporal data with various geometry types such as point, line string, polygon, or a mixed combination of them. As one of the most fundamental but time-consuming operations, $k$ nearest neighbors join ($k$NN join) has attracted much attention. However, most existing works for $k$NN join either ignore temporal information or consider only point data. Besides, most of them do not automatically adapt to the different features of spatio-temporal data. This paper proposes to address a novel and useful problem, i.e., ST-$k$NN join, which considers both spatial closeness and temporal concurrency. To support ST-$k$NN join over a large amount of spatio-temporal data with any geometry types efficiently, we propose a novel distributed solution based on Apache Spark. Specifically, our method adopts a two-round join framework. In the first round join, we propose a new spatio-temporal partitioning method that achieves spatio-temporal locality and load balance at the same time. We also propose a lightweight index structure, i.e., Time Range Count Index (TRC-index), to enable efficient ST-$k$NN join. In the second round join, to reduce the data transmission among different machines, we remove duplicates based on spatio-temporal reference points before shuffling local results. Furthermore, we design a set of models based on Bayesian optimization to automatically determine the values for the introduced parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted using three real big datasets, showing that our method is much more scalable and achieves 9X faster than baselines, and that the proposed models can always predict appropriate parameters for different datasets.},

  abstract = {The range search in Hamming space is to explore the binary vectors whose Hamming distances with a query vector are within a given searching threshold. It arises as the core component of many applications, such as image retrieval, pattern recognition, and machine learning. Existing searching methods in Hamming space require much pre-processing overhead, which are not suitable for processing multiple batches of incoming data in a short time. Moreover, significant pre-processing overhead can be a burden when the number of queries is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a query-aware method for the approximate range search in Hamming space with no pre-process. Specifically, to eliminate the impact of data skewness, we introduce JS-divergence to measure the divergence between data&#39;s distribution and query&#39;s distribution, and specially design a Query-Aware Dimension Partitioning (QADP) strategy to partition the dimensions into several subspaces according to the scales of given searching thresholds. In the subspaces, the candidates can be efficiently obtained by the basic Pigeonhole Principle and our proposed Anti-Pigeonhole Principle. Furthermore, a sampling strategy is designed to estimate the Hamming distance between the query vector and arbitrary binary vector to obtain the final approximate searching results among the candidates. Experimental results on four real-world datasets illustrate that, in comparison with benchmark methods, our method possesses the superior advantages on searching accuracy and efficiency. The proposed method can increase the searching efficiency up to nearly 16 times with high searching accuracy.},

  abstract = {Transfer-based adversarial attacks involve generating adversarial point clouds in surrogate models and transferring them to other models to assess 3D model robustness. However, current methods rely too much on surrogate model parameters, limiting transferability. In this work, we use Shapley value to identify positive and negative features, guiding optimization of adversarial noise in feature space. To effectively mislead the 3D classifier, we factorize the adversarial noise into positive and negative noise, with the former keeping the features of the adversarial point cloud close to the negative features, and the latter and the adversarial noise moving it away from the positive features. Finally, a novel adversarial point cloud attack method with Adversarial Noise Factorization is proposed, which is abbreviated as ANF. ANF simultaneously optimizes the adversarial noise and its positive and negative noise in the feature space, only relying on partial network parameters, which significantly reduces the reliance on the surrogate model and improves the transferability of the adversarial point cloud. Experiments on well-recognized benchmark datasets show that the transferability of adversarial point clouds generated by ANF could be improved by more than 26.7$\%$ on average over state-of-the-art transfer-based adversarial attack methods.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a competitive method in single-modality-dominated remote sensing (RS) data classification tasks, but its classification performance inevitably encounters a bottleneck due to the lack of representation diversity in complicated spatial structures with various land cover types. Therefore, the RS community has been actively researching multimodal feature learning techniques for the same scene. However, expert annotation of multisource data consumes a significant amount of time and cost. This article proposes an end-to-end method called semisupervised multimodal dual-path network (SMDN). This method simultaneously explores spatial-spectral features contained in hyperspectral images (HSI) and elevation information provided by light detection and ranging (LiDAR). SMDN exploits an unsupervised novel encoder-decoder structure as the backbone network to construct a multimodal DL architecture by jointly training with a data-specific branch. To obtain discriminative multimodal representations, SMDN is able to guide the collaborative training of two different unsupervised features mapped in the latent subspace with limited labeled training samples. Furthermore, after a simple modification of the fusion strategy in SMDN, it can be applied to unsupervised classification problems. Experimental results on benchmark RS datasets validate the effectiveness of the developed SMDN compared over many state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in exploring disease mechanisms via computational methods to overcome the challenge of tremendous manpower and material resources in biological experiments. However, current computational methods suffer from two main limitations: simple data structures that do not consider the close association between multiple types of data, and the lack of a systematic pathogenesis analysis that identified disease-associated lncRNAs are not applied to the downstream disease prognosis and therapeutic analysis from the perspective of data analysis. In this end, we present a systemic pipeline including disease-associated lncRNAs identification and downstream pathogenesis analysis on how the predicted lncRNAs are involved in the disease prognosis and therapy. Due to the importance of identifying disease-associated lncRNAs and the weak interpretability of existing computational identification methods, we propose a novel approach named iLncDA-PT to identify disease-associated lncRNAs considering the interactions between various bio-entities outperforming the other state-of-the-art methods, and then we conduct a systematically subsequent analysis on prognosis and therapy for a specific disease, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as an example. Finally, we reveal a significant association between immune checkpoint expression, tumor microenvironment, and drug treatment.},

However, many researches have confirmed that deliberately designed adversarial attacks can easily confuse GNNs on the classification of target nodes (targeted attacks) or all the nodes (global attacks). According to our observations, different attributes tend to be differently treated when the graph is attacked. Unfortunately, most of the existing defense methods can only defend at the graph or node level, which ignores the diversity of different attributes within each node. To address this limitation, we propose to leverage a new property, named Attribute-level Smoothness (ALS), which is defined based on the local differences of graph. We then propose a novel defense method, named GCN with Attribute-level Defense (ALD-GCN), which utilizes the ALS property to provide attribute-level protection to each attributes.

  abstract = {The pursuit of refined data analysis and the preservation of privacy in Big Data pose significant concerns. Among the paramount paradigms for addressing these challenges, differential privacy stands out as a vital area of research. However, traditional differential privacy tends to be excessively restrictive when it comes to individuals’ control over their own data. It often treats all data as inherently sensitive, whereas in reality, not all information related to individuals is sensitive and requires an identical level of protection. In this paper, we define secret specification-based differential privacy (SSDP), where the term “secret specification” implies enabling users to decide what aspects of their information are sensitive and what are not, prior to data generation or processing. By allowing individuals to independently define their secret specifications, the SSDP achieves personalized privacy protection and facilitates effective data analysis. To enable the targeted application of SSDP, we further present task-specific mechanisms designed for database and graph data scenarios. Finally, we assess the trade-offs between privacy and utility inherent in the proposed mechanisms through comparative experiments conducted on real datasets, demonstrating the utility enhancements offered by SSDP mechanisms in practical applications.},

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Local High-order Graph Learning for Multi-View Clustering (LHGL_MVC). Our method aims to explore high-order relationships within a view while also considering diverse information between views. In LHGL_MVC, we learn the initial graphs of each view through self-representation, which are decomposed into consistent and diverse parts to better capture the diversity of different views. Based on consistent parts, we propose a novel local high-order graph learning approach to more effectively explore high-order relationships between samples within each view. At the same time, we leverage high-order relationships between views using the rotated tensor nuclear norm. Finally, we obtain a unified graph for clustering by fusing all consistent affinity graphs and their high-order graphs with adaptive weights. All procedures are integrated into an overall objective function, which mutually promotes during the optimization process. The comprehensive experiments conducted on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that LHGL_MVC significantly outperforms existing algorithms in various measurements, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method.},

To address this, we propose an Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (EHGNN) that leverages heterogeneous personalized PageRank (HPPR) to preserve the influence between all nodes, then approximates message passing and selectively loads neighbor information for one aggregation, significantly reducing memory and time usage. In addition, we employ some lightweight techniques to ensure the performance of EHGNN. Evaluations on various HIN benchmarks in node classification and link prediction tasks unequivocally establish the superiority of EHGNN, surpassing the State-of-the-Art by 11$\%$ in terms of performance. In addition, EHGNN achieves a remarkable 400$\%$ boost in training and inference speed while utilizing less memory. Notably, EHGNN can handle a 200-million-node, 1-billion-link HIN within 18 hours on a single machine, using only 170 GB of memory, which is much lower than the previous minimum requirement of 600 GB.},

  abstract = {Sequential recommendation seeks to understand user preferences based on their past actions and predict future interactions with items. Recently, several techniques for sequential recommendation have emerged, primarily leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for their ability to model relationships effectively. However, real-world scenarios often involve sparse interactions, where early and recent short-term preferences play distinct roles in the recommendation process. Consequently, vanilla GCNs struggle to effectively capture the explicit correlations between these early and recent short-term preferences. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Graph Convolutional Networks with Collaborative Feature Fusion (COFF). Specifically, our method addresses the issue by initially dividing each user interaction sequence into two segments. We then construct two separate graphs for these segments, aiming to capture the user&#39;s early and recent short-term preferences independently. To obtain robust prediction, we employ multiple GCNs in a collaborative distillation manner, incorporating a feature fusion module to establish connections between the early and recent short-term preferences. This approach enables a more precise representation of user preferences. Experimental evaluations conducted on five popular sequential recommendation datasets demonstrate that our COFF model outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.},

This paper proposes a Robust Joint Graph learning for Multi-view Clustering (RJGMC) based on $ \ell _{1}$-norm to address these problems. RJGMC integrates the learning processes of the graph similarity matrix and the unified graph matrix to improve mutual reinforcement between these graph matrices. Simultaneously, employing the $ \ell _{1}$-norm to generate the unified graph matrix enhances the algorithm&#39;s robustness. A rank constraint is imposed on the graph Laplacian matrix of the unified graph matrix, where clustering can be divided directly without additional processing. In addition, we also introduce a method for automatically assigning optimal weights to each view. The optimization of this objective function employs an alternating optimization approach. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques regarding clustering performance and robustness.},

  abstract = {In real-world crowdsourcing scenarios, it is a common phenomenon that each worker only annotates a few instances, resulting in a significantly sparse crowdsourcing label matrix. Consequently, only a small number of workers influence the inferred integrated label of each instance, which may weaken the performance of label integration algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a novel label completion algorithm called Worker Similarity-based Label Completion (WSLC). WSLC is grounded on the assumption that workers with similar cognitive abilities will annotate similar labels on the same instances. Specifically, we first construct a data set for each worker that includes all instances annotated by this worker and learn a feature vector for each worker. Then, we define a metric based on cosine similarity to estimate worker similarity based on the learned feature vectors. Finally, we complete the labels for each worker on unannotated instances based on the worker similarity and the annotations of similar workers. The experimental results on one real-world and 34 simulated crowdsourced data sets consistently show that WSLC effectively addresses the problem of the sparse crowdsourcing label matrix and enhances the integration accuracies of label integration algorithms.},

  abstract = {The performance of graph collaborative filtering (GCF) models could be affected by noisy user-item interactions. Existing studies on data denoising either ignore the nature of noise in implicit feedback or seldom consider the long-tail distribution of historical interaction data. For the first challenge, we analyze the role of noise from a causal perspective: noise is an unobservable confounder. Therefore, we use the instrumental variable for causal intervention without requiring confounder observation. For the second challenge, we consider degree distribution of nodes in the course of causal intervention. And then we propose a model named causal graph collaborative filtering (CausalGCF) to denoise implicit feedback for GCF. Specifically, we design a degree augmentation strategy as the instrumental variable. First, we divide nodes into head and tail nodes according to their degree. Then, we purify the interactions of the head nodes and enrich those of the tail nodes based on similarity. We perform degree augmentation strategy from the user and item sides to obtain two different graph structures, which are trained together with self-supervised learning. Empirical studies on four real and four synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CausalGCF, which is more robust against noisy interactions in implicit feedback than the baselines.},

Recent advances in graph representation learning have brought a new upsurge to network alignment. Most existing representation-based methods extract local structural information of social networks from users’ neighborhoods, but the global structural information has not been fully exploited. Therefore, this manuscript proposes a dual graph convolutional networks-based method (DualNA) for social network alignment, which combines user representation learning and user alignment in a unified framework. Specifically, we design dual graph convolutional networks as feature extractors to capture the local and global structural information of social networks, and apply a two-part constraint mechanism, including reconstruction loss and contrastive loss, to jointly optimize the graph representation learning process. As a result, the learned user representations can not only preserve the local and global features of original networks, but also be distinguishable and suitable for the downstream task of social network alignment. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method outperforms all baselines. The ablation studies further illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of our method.},

We theoretically model the DHT query delay and introduce a fat Merkle tree structure as well as the DHT caching to reduce it. We design the query plan for read and write operations on top of Apache Drill that enables the collaborative query with decentralized workers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Minerva, and the results show that Minerva achieves up to $2.08 \times$ query performance acceleration compared to the original IPFS data query, and can complete data analysis queries on the Internet-like environments within an average latency of 0.615 second. With a collaborative query, Minerva could perform up to $1.39 \times$ performance acceleration than the centralized query with raw data shipment.},

Unfortunately, this approach often demands fine-tuning step sizes based on the level of data similarity. When data similarity is low, these small step sizes result in an unacceptably slow convergence speed for federated methods. In this paper, we present a novel and unified framework for analyzing the convergence of federated learning algorithms without the need for data similarity conditions. Our analysis centers on an inequality that captures the influence of step sizes on algorithmic convergence performance. By applying our theorems to well-known federated algorithms, we derive precise expressions for three widely used step size schedules: fixed, diminishing, and step-decay step sizes, which are independent of data similarity conditions. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of the performance of these federated learning algorithms, employing the proposed step size strategies to train deep neural network models on benchmark datasets under varying data similarity conditions. Our findings demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed and overall performance, marking a substantial advancement in federated learning research.},

  abstract = {Federated Learning (FL), as an efficient decentralized distributed learning approach, enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data. Despite its advantages, the performance of FL models is substantially impacted by the domain feature shift arising from different acquisition devices/clients. Moreover, existing FL methods often prioritize accuracy without considering reliability factors such as confidence or uncertainty, leading to unreliable predictions in safety-critical applications. Thus, our goal is to enhance FL performance by addressing non-domain feature issues and ensuring model reliability. In this study, we introduce a novel approach named RFedDis (Reliable Federated Disentangling Network). RFedDis leverages feature disentangling to capture a global domain-invariant cross-client representation while preserving local client-specific feature learning. Additionally, we incorporate an uncertainty-aware decision fusion mechanism to effectively integrate the decoupled features. This ensures dynamic integration at the evidence level, producing reliable predictions accompanied by estimated uncertainties. Therefore, RFedDis is the FL approach to combine evidential uncertainty with feature disentangling, enhancing both performance and reliability in handling non-IID domain features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RFedDis outperforms other state-of-the-art FL approaches, providing outstanding performance coupled with a high degree of reliability.},

  abstract = {Recently, Contrastive Learning (CL) has made impressive progress in natural language processing, especially in sentence representation learning. Plenty of data augmentation methods have been proposed for the generation of positive samples. However, due to the highly abstract nature of natural language, these augmentations cannot maintain the quality of generated positive samples, e.g., too easy or hard samples. To this end, we propose to improve the quality of positive examples from a data arrangement perspective and develop a novel model-agnostic approach: Dynamic Curriculum Learning based Contrastive Sentence Embedding framework (DCLCSE) for sentence embeddings. Specifically, we propose to incorporate a curriculum learning strategy to control the positive example usage. At the early learning stage, easy samples are selected to optimize the CL-based model. As the model&#39;s capability increases, we gradually select harder samples for model training, ensuring the learning efficiency of the model. Furthermore, we design a novel difficulty measurement module to calculate the difficulty of generated positives, in which the model&#39;s capability is considered for the accurate sample difficulty measurement. Based on this, we develop multiple arrangement strategies to facilitate the model learning process based on learned difficulties. Finally, extensive experiments over multiple representative models demonstrate the superiority of DCLCSE. As a byproduct, we have released the codes to facilitate other researchers.},

The proposed algorithm can adaptively determine the number and the position of initial seeds, and is robust to the segmentation of small objects and slender regions. First, we propose a seed initialization scheme based on the side of the circumscribed rectangle of the small object and interval boundary gradient. To enhance the regularity of superpixels, we equally added seeds for grids with sparse seed distribution. Second, we construct a weighted distance measure with search region and feature constraints, which reduces the computational complexity and enhances the precision of pixel label assignment. Finally, we quantify the disconnected regions are present in abundance, and propose a post-processing method based on the area of predefined small objects. The proposed method can significantly improve the connectivity and regularity of the generated superpixels. Extensive experiments on the widely-used BSDS and CamVid datasets demonstrate that the non-uniform seed initialization is effective, and the performance of the proposed superpixel segmentation is favorably compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, their performances heavily depend on accurate annotations to train the hashing model. In real applications, we usually only obtain low-quality label annotations owing to labor and time consumption limitations. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by noisy labels, in this paper, we propose a robust deep hashing method, called deep hashing with ranking learning (DHRL), for cross-modal retrieval. The proposed DHRL method consists of a refined semantic concept alignment module and a ranking-swapping module. In this first module, we adopt two transformers to perform the semantic alignment tasks between different modalities on a set of refined concepts, and then convert them into hash codes to reduce heterogeneous differences between multimodalities. The second module first identifies the noisy labels in the training set and ranks them according to ranking loss. Then it swaps the ranking information of different modal network branches. Unlike existing robust hashing methods for assuming noise distribution, our proposed DHRL method requires no prior assumptions for the input data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have shown that our proposed DHRL method has stronger advantages over other state-of-the-art hashing methods.},

In this study, we present SGAMF, a Sparse Gated Attention-based Multimodal Fusion strategy, designed to amalgamate text features and auxiliary features for the purpose of fake news identification. Compared with traditional multimodal fusion methods, SGAMF can effectively balance accuracy and inference time while selecting the most important features. A novel sparse-gated-attention mechanism has been proposed which instigates a shift in text representation conditioned on auxiliary features, thereby selectively filtering out non-essential features. We have further put forward an enhanced ALBERT for the encoding of text features, capable of balancing efficiency and accuracy. To corroborate our methodology, we have developed a multimodal COVID-19 fake news detection dataset.

In this context, there is sometimes a need for a specialized process called machine unlearning, which is required when the effect of some specific training samples needs to be removed from a learning model due to privacy, security, usability, and/or legislative factors. However, problems arise when current centralized unlearning methods are applied to existing federated learning, in which the server aims to remove all information about a class from the global model. Centralized unlearning usually focuses on simple models or is premised on the ability to access all training data at a central node. However, training data cannot be accessed on the server under the federated learning paradigm, conflicting with the requirements of the centralized unlearning process. Additionally, there are high computation and communication costs associated with accessing clients’ data, especially in scenarios involving numerous clients or complex global models. To address these concerns, we propose a more effective and efficient federated unlearning scheme based on the concept of model explanation. Model explanation involves understanding deep networks and individual channel importance, so that this understanding can be used to determine which model channels are critical for classes that need to be unlearned. We select the most influential channels within an already-trained model for the data that need to be unlearned and fine-tune only influential channels to remove the contribution made by those data. In this way, we can simultaneously avoid huge consumption costs and ensure that the unlearned model maintains good performance. Experiments with different training models on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Knowledge Bases (KBs) have become more complex because some facts in KBs include more than two entities. The construction and completion of these KBs require a new relation extraction task to retrieve complex facts from the text. To address this issue, we present a new N-ary Document-Level relation extraction task that involves extracting relations that 1) include an arbitrary number of entities, and 2) can span multiple sentences within a document. This new task requires inferring relation labels and entity completeness, i.e., whether the entities in the document are (insufficient to describe the relation. We propose a reinforcement learning-based relation classifier training framework that can adapt most existing binary document-level relation extractors to this task. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed framework is effective in reducing the impact of noise introduced by distant supervision or unrelated sentences in the document.},

  abstract = {Network alignment, which integrates multiple network resources by identifying anchor nodes that exist in different networks, is beneficial for conducting comprehensive network analysis. Although there have been many studies on network alignment, most of them are limited to static scenarios and only can achieve acceptable top-$\alpha$ ($\alpha &amp;gt; 10$) results. In the absence of considering dynamic changes in networks, accurate network alignment (i.e., top-1 result) faces two problems: 1) Missing information: focusing solely on aligning networks at a specific time leads to low top-1 performance due to the lack of information from other time periods; 2) Confusing information: ignoring temporal information and focusing on aligning networks across the entire time span leads to low top-1 performance due to inability to distinguish the neighborhood nodes of anchor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network alignment method, which aims to achieve better top-1 alignment results with consider changing network structures over time. Towards this end, we learn the representations of nodes in the changing network structure with time, and preserve the consistency of anchor node pairs during the time-evolution process. First, we employ a Structure-Time-aware module to capture network dynamics while preserving network structure and learning node representations that incorporate temporal information. Second, we ensure the global and local consistency of anchor node pairs over time by utilizing linear and similarity functions, respectively. Finally, we determine whether two nodes are anchor node pairs by maintaining consistency between global, local, and node representations. Experimental results obtained from real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves performance comparable to several state-of-the-art methods.},

Nevertheless, the majority of unsupervised active learning algorithms are based on shallow linear representation and lack sufficient interpretability. Furthermore, certain diversity-based methods face challenges in selecting samples that adequately represent the entire data distribution. Inspired by these reasons, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised active learning method on orthogonal projections to construct a deep neural network model. By optimizing the orthogonal projection process, we establish the connection between projection and active learning, consequently enhancing the interpretability of the proposed method. The proposed method can efficiently project the feature space onto a spanned subspace, deriving an indicator matrix while calculating the projection loss. Moreover, we consider the redundancy among samples to ensure both data point diversity and enhancement of clustering-based algorithms. Through extensive comparative experiments on six public datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively select more informative and representative samples and improve performance by up to 11%.},

  abstract = {Time-series prediction has drawn considerable attention during the past decades fueled by the emerging advances of deep learning methods. However, most neural network based methods fail in extracting the hidden mechanism of the targeted physical system. To overcome these shortcomings, an interpretable sparse system identification method without any prior knowledge is proposed in this study. This method adopts the Fourier transform to reduces the irrelevant items in the dictionary matrix, instead of indiscriminate usage of polynomial functions in most system identification methods. It shows an visible system representation and greatly reduces computing cost. With the adoption of $l_{1}$ norm in regularizing the parameter matrix, a sparse description of the system model can be achieved. Moreover, three data sets including the water conservancy data, global temperature data and financial data are used to test the performance of the proposed method. Although no prior knowledge was known about the physical background, experimental results show that our method can achieve long-term prediction regardless of the noise and incompleteness in the original data more accurately than the widely-used baseline data-driven methods. This study may provide some insight into time-series prediction investigations, and suggests that a white-box system identification method may extract the easily overlooked yet inherent periodical features and may beat neural-network based black-box methods on long-term prediction tasks.},

However, current digital adversarial attacks and physical adversarial attacks both have drawbacks, with the former ones impractical and the latter one conspicuous, high-computational and low-executable. To address the issues, we propose a practical, executable, stealthy and low computational adversarial attack based on LED illumination modulation. To fool the systems, the proposed attack generates physically imperceptible luminance changes to human eyes through fast intensity modulation of scene LED illumination and uses the rolling shutter effect of CMOS image sensors in face recognition systems to implant luminance information perturbation to the captured face images. In summary, we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack for face detection and an evasion attack for face verification. We also evaluate their effectiveness against well-known face detection models, Dlib, MTCNN and RetinaFace, and face verification models, Dlib, FaceNet, and ArcFace. The extensive physical experiments show that the success rates of DoS attacks against face detection models reach 97.67$\%$, 100$\%$, and 100$\%$, respectively, and the success rates of evasion attacks against all face verification models reach 100$\%$.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in Big Data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client&#39;s training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce $ \tt {zkFL}$, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients’ local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that $ \tt {zkFL}$ achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed.},

Nevertheless, the noisy nodes usually propagate their semantics via the edges of the reasoning graph, which misleads the semantic representations of other nodes and amplifies the noise signals. To mitigate the propagation of noisy semantic information, we introduce a Confidential Graph Attention Network (CO-GAT), which proposes a node masking mechanism for modeling the nodes. Specifically, CO-GAT calculates the node confidence score by estimating the relevance between the claim and evidence pieces. Then, the node masking mechanism uses the node confidence scores to control the noise information flow from the vanilla node to the other graph nodes. CO-GAT achieves a 73.59% FEVER score on the FEVER dataset and shows the generalization ability by broadening the effectiveness to the science-specific domain.},

The collected data is multivariate in nature containing hourly generated information about several air pollutants and atmospheric parameters from a non-polluted city of India.

The predictor model is responsible for predicting the value at the next timestamp, corresponding to a given window of the time series data. A subsequent anomaly detector is utilized to identify the anomalous pollutant levels based on the predictions of predictor model. Anomalies detected by the proposed framework are utilized to analyze the correlation of temporal and atmospheric parameters with the anomalous concentration levels.

  abstract = {Personalized search aims at re-ranking search results with reference to users’ background information. The state-of-the-art personalized search methods often consider both the short-term search interests from current session behaviors and the long-term search interests from previous session behaviors. However, sessions in real-world search scenarios are usually very short, and a large number of sessions contain only one query, which makes it difficult to model short-term search interests. Intuitively, apart from current session behaviors, some recent historical session behaviors could also contribute to the current search interests, and the influence of these behaviors typically decays over time. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph based Hawkes process to improve the effectiveness of personalized search. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous graph to model multiple relations between users, queries, and documents. Then, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based algorithm to encode the representations of users’ historical search behaviors. After that, we develop a multivariate Hawkes process to capture the influence of historical search behaviors on the current search intent. Our approach can dynamically model the influence of historical behaviors in a continuous time space. Thus, both the current session behaviors and the historical session behaviors can be utilized to characterize a more accurate current search intent. We evaluate our method using three real-life datasets, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of several widely-used precision metrics.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal neural networks have been successfully applied to weather forecasting tasks recently. The key notion is to learn spatio-temporal features concurrently from spatial and temporal dependencies. Existing methods are mainly based on local smoothness assumptions where the features are learned by accumulating information in local spatio-temporal regions. However, the weather conditions in a certain spatio-temporal region are usually influenced by global meteorological changes and long-range historical weather conditions. Therefore, these methods that ignore the large-scale spatio-temporal effects can hardly learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal Transformer network in weather forecasting to address the above challenges. The main idea is to leverage the Transformer architecture to carefully capture the multi-scale spatial and long-range temporal information in weather data. First, we propose to combine the global and local position encodings based on absolute geographic locations and relative geodesic distances and insert them into the spatial Transformer to extract the multi-scale spatial information in meteorological graphs. Then, we further capture the long-range temporal dependencies by a temporal Transformer where the attention mechanism is used to improve the representation ability and scalability of the models. Extensive experiments over real weather datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

  abstract = {Accurate segmentation of organelle instances from electron microscopy (EM) images plays an essential role in many neuroscience researches. However, practical scenarios usually suffer from high annotation costs, label scarcity, and large domain diversity. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) that assumes no annotation effort on the target data is promising to alleviate these challenges, its performance on complicated segmentation tasks is still far from practical usage. To address these issues, we investigate a highly annotation-efficient weak supervision, which assumes only sparse center-points on a small subset of object instances in the target training images. To achieve accurate segmentation with partial point annotations, we introduce instance counting and center detection as auxiliary tasks and design a multitask learning framework to leverage correlations among the counting, detection, and segmentation, which are all tasks with partial or no supervision. Building upon the different domain-invariances of the three tasks, we enforce counting estimation with a novel soft consistency loss as a global prior for center detection, which further guides the per-pixel segmentation. To further compensate for annotation sparsity, we develop a cross-position cut-and-paste for label augmentation and an entropy-based pseudo-label selection. The experimental results highlight that, by simply using extremely weak annotation, e.g., 15% sparse points, for model training, the proposed model is capable of significantly outperforming UDA methods and produces comparable performance as the supervised counterpart. The high robustness of our model shown in the validations and the low requirement of expert knowledge for sparse point annotation further improve the potential application value of our model.},

  abstract = {Entity alignment is the most critical technology of knowledge fusion, which aims to identify and align entities that exist in different knowledge graphs (KGs) but represent the same real-world objects. Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) extend static triples into quadruples by introducing temporal information, which is more in line with the dynamic changes of the real world and is often used to enhance the performance of various applications. However, the existing entity alignment methods mainly focus on traditional KGs, ignoring the temporal information contained in TKGs may lead to misalignment between some similar entities. The latest method enhances the performance of entity alignment by learning temporal information embedding, but it does not make full use of the advantages of temporal information. In this paper, we propose a new Entity Alignment method for Cross-lingual TKG with BERT (EACTB). EACTB uses the BERT model of multi-language training to learn the semantic relevance of entity description. For temporal information, we propose a new and more efficient method to calculate the similarity of temporal information. EACTB uses graph convolution network (GCN) to embed structural information. In addition, iterative method is used to deal with the problem of insufficient training datasets. Experimental results on three cross-lingual TKGs datasets show that EACTB is significantly superior to existing methods.},

  abstract = {Trajectory clustering is a cornerstone task in the field of trajectory mining. With the proliferation of deep learning, deep trajectory clustering has been widely researched to mine mobility patterns from massive unlabeled trajectories. Nevertheless, existing methods mostly ignore trajectories’ temporal regularities, which are essential for mining fine-grained mobility patterns for applications including traveling group identification, transportation mode discovering, social security emergency, etc. To fill this gap, we propose ConDTC, a contrastive deep trajectory clustering method targeting for fine-grained mobility pattern mining. Specifically, we first design a spatial-temporal trajectory representation learning method which can capture both spatial and temporal regularities of trajectories synchronously. The proposed trajectory representation model can be used as a pre-trained model to serve various downstream trajectory mining tasks. Then, we construct a contrastive trajectory clustering module which optimizes trajectory representations and clustering performance simultaneously. Experimental results on three datasets validate that ConDTC can identify fine-grained mobility patterns by clustering trajectories with similar spatial-temporal mobility patterns together while separating those with different mobility patterns apart. Actually, ConDTC outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors substantially in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and robustness.},

In addition, PE satisfy requirements such as porosity, flexibility, and conformity. However, the large feature sizes in PE and limited device counts incur high restrictions and increased area and power overheads, prohibiting the realization of complex circuits. As a result, although printed Machine Learning (ML) circuits could open new horizons and bring “intelligence” in such domains, the implementation of complex classifiers, as required in target applications, is hardly feasible. In this paper, we aim to address this and focus on the design of battery-powered printed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). To that end, we exploit fully-customized circuit (bespoke) implementations, enabled in PE, and propose a hardware-aware neural minimization framework dedicated for such customized MLP circuits. Our evaluation demonstrates that, for up to 3% accuracy loss, our co-design methodology enables, for the first time, battery-powered operation of complex printed MLPs.},

  abstract     = {Structured sparsity has been proposed as an efficient way to prune the complexity of Machine Learning (ML) applications and to simplify the handling of sparse data in hardware. Accelerating ML models, whether for training, or inference, heavily relies on matrix multiplications that can be efficiently executed on vector processors, or custom matrix engines. This work aims to integrate the simplicity of structured sparsity into vector execution to speed up the corresponding matrix multiplications. Initially, the implementation of structured-sparse matrix multiplication using the current RISC-V instruction set vector extension is comprehensively explored. Critical parameters that affect performance, such as the impact of data distribution across the scalar and vector register files, data locality, and the effectiveness of loop unrolling are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the addition of a single new instruction would reap even higher performance. The newly proposed instruction is called vindexmac, i.e., vector index-multiply-accumulate. It allows for indirect reads from the vector register file and it reduces the number of instructions executed per matrix multiplication iteration, without introducing additional dependencies that would limit loop unrolling. The proposed new instruction was integrated in a decoupled RISC-V vector processor with negligible hardware cost. Experimental results demonstrate the runtime efficiency and the scalability offered by the introduced optimizations and the new instruction for the execution of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks. More particularly, the addition of a custom instruction improves runtime by 25% and 33%, when compared with highly-optimized vectorized kernels that use only the currently defined RISC-V instructions.},

  abstract     = {The rise of machine learning as a service (MLaaS) has driven the demand for complex and customized real-time inference tasks, often requiring cascading multiple deep neural network (DNN) models into inference pipelines. However, these pipelines pose significant challenges due to scheduling complexity, particularly in maintaining strict latency service level objectives (SLOs). Existing systems serve pipelines with model-independent scheduling policies, which ignore the unique workload characteristics introduced by model cascading in the inference pipeline, leading to SLO violations and resource inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose that the serving system should exploit the model-cascading nature and intermodel workload dependency of the inference pipeline to ensure strict latency SLO cost-effectively. Based on this, we design and implement SLOpt, a serving system optimized for real-time inference pipelines with a three-stage codesign of workload estimation, resource provisioning, and request execution. SLOpt proposes cascade workload estimation and ahead-of-time tuning, which together address the challenge of cascade blocking and head-of-line blocking in workload estimation and resource provisioning. SLOpt further implements an adaptive batch drop policy to mitigate latency amplification issues within the pipeline. These innovations enable SLOpt to reduce the 99th percentile latency (P99 latency) by $1.4$ to $2.5$ times compared to the state of the arts while lowering serving costs by up to $29\%$. Moreover, to achieve comparable P99 latency, SLOpt requires up to $70\%$ less cost than existing systems. Extensive evaluations on a 64-GPU cluster demonstrate SLOpt&#39;s effectiveness in meeting strict P99 latency SLOs under diverse real-world workloads.},

To address this challenge, we propose performing CRC computation and verification directly in the network path. Specifically, we introduce NetCRC-NR, a 5G New Radio (NR) standard-compliant in-network CRC accelerator. NetCRC-NR implements the 5G NR CRC algorithms specified in 3GPP TS 38.212, including CRC24A, CRC24B, CRC24C, CRC16, CRC11, and CRC6. It leverages programmable switches to perform in-network CRC generation and validation for the Transport Blocks (TBs) and Code Blocks (CBs), aiming at providing high CRC computation throughput and alleviating the computational burden on General-Purpose Processors (GPPs). We design and implement NetCRC-NR on Intel Tofino programmable switch and commodity servers running the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). Extensive experiments demonstrate that NetCRC-NR performs CRC generation and verification at the switch line rate of up to 4+Tbps CRC throughput, showcasing its efficiency and potential in accelerating the 5G RAN error detection process.},

To search through encrypted multimodal data in the cloud, privacy-preserving cross-modal retrieval (PPCMR) techniques have attracted extensive attention. However, most of the existing PPCMR schemes lack the ability to resist quantum attacks and have low search efficiency on large-scale datasets. To solve above problems, we first propose a basic PPCMR scheme FECMR using the enhanced Single-key Function-hiding Inner Product Functional Encryption for Binary strings (SFB-IPFE) and cross-modal hashing technology, which achieves the measurement of similarity over encrypted multimodal data while resisting quantum attacks. Then, we design an efficient index KM-tree utilizing the K-modes clustering algorithm. On this basis, we propose an improved scheme FECMR+, which achieves sub-linear search complexity. Finally, formal security analysis proves that our schemes are secure against quantum attacks, and extensive experiments prove that our schemes are efficient and feasible for practical application.},

However, because of its 3D vertical stacking technique and array designs, 3D NAND flash memory has more complicated data loss mechanisms compared to 2D NAND flash memory. As bit densities rise to Quad-level-cells (QLC), the small read margins will further complicate and make the situation more unpredictable. In this work, we propose an error-bit prediction model in this paper for 3D QLC NAND flash memory with the charge-trap (CT) cell structure based on a thorough analysis of multiple parameters that affect the error-bit distributions, including read disturb (RD) and degradation from program/erase (PE) cycles. Specifically, we develop the whole-block prediction (WBP) and the dynamic-worst-page prediction (DWPM) models.

Recent researches adopt in-network aggregation (INA) that offloads the gradient aggregation process to programmable switches, thereby reducing network traffic amount and transmission latency. Unfortunately, due to the bandwidth competition in shared training clusters, the straggler will slow down the training efficiency of INA. To address this issue, we propose an Asynchronous Control based Aggregation Transport Protocol (AC-ATP), which makes full use uncongested links to transmit gradients and the switch memory to cache gradients from the fast workers to accelerate the gradient aggregation. Meanwhile, AC-ATP performs congestion control according to the transmission progress of worker and the remaining completion time of the job.

In this paper, we present LUNA-CiM, a lookup table (LUT)-based programmable fabric for flexible and efficient mapping of artificial neural network (ANN) in memory. Its objective is to tackle scalability challenges in LUT-based computation by minimizing hardware, storage elements, and energy consumption. The proposed method utilizes the divide and conquer (D&amp;C) strategy to enhance the scalability of LUT-based computation. For example, in a 4b $\boldsymbol{\times}$ 4b lookup table-based multiplier, as one of the main components in ANN, decomposing high-precision operations into lower-precision counterparts leads to a substantial reduction in area overheads, approximately 73% less compared to conventional LUT-based approaches. Importantly, this efficiency gain is achieved without compromising accuracy. Extensive simulations were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method. The analysis presented in this paper reveals a noteworthy advancement in energy efficiency, indicating a 58% reduction in energy consumption per computation compared to the conventional lookup table approach. Additionally, the introduced approach demonstrates a 36% improvement in speed over the traditional lookup table approach. These findings highlight notable advancements in performance, showcasing the potential of this inventive method to achieve low power, low-area overhead, and fast computations through the utilization of LUTs within an SRAM array.},

  abstract     = {Control flow is the execution order of individual statements, instructions, or function calls within an imperative program. Malicious operation of control flow (e.g., tampering with normal function addresses) leads to severe consequences such as data leakage and system crash. Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is a defense restricting the execution order of program within Control Flow Graph (CFG). IndexHooks is an existing CFI solution designed against forward function calls tampering (including direct and indirect jump). This solution constructs a read-only linear function table that stores function addresses during compilation. Then, IndexHooks checks the table to make program jump to the correct target address during runtime. However, IndexHooks faces limitations in backtracking CFG construction, which can lead to excessive memory usage; the linear structure of the function table is vulnerable to brute force tampering. Addressing the limitations of IndexHooks, this study develops an obfuscated CFI solution called LeafHooks. LeafHooks is implemented during compilation by the LLVM compiler, which performs static analysis and instrumentation on the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code of a program. We make the following three innovations: 1) we propose a speculation-free identification method for indirect function calls by linear traversing and analyzing codes to obtain legal function information (function address); 2) we save this information into a function table in the form of a Balanced Binary Tree (also known as AVL), enhancing the fuzzification of function addresses to defend against brute force; 3) we design a method to simulate control tamper attacks on ARM64 architecture to verify the ability of LeafHooks to protection. LeafHooks shows less overhead than state-of-the-art solutions and reduces 2.9% and 0.55% overhead on average using UnixBench and Phoronix, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In-Network Aggregation (INA) solutions represent the forefront in advancing All-Reduce, utilizing limited switch memory for efficient gradient aggregation. However, existing INA solutions primarily focus on enhancing aggregation efficiency, often overlooking the efficient utilization of memory. Isolation solutions typically pre-allocate resources for each job, leading to memory wastage due to the uncontrolled use of resources. In contrast, the sharing solutions encounter significant memory contention, resulting in performance degradation within a multi-tenant environment. In this paper, we propose DynaINA, a flexible job scheduler to support multi-tenant training. The core idea of DynaINA is to provide spatial and temporal compatibility between jobs. For spatial compatibility, DynaINA utilizes multiple dynamic memory pools to provide job isolation. For temporal compatibility, DynaINA employs contention-aware job scheduling to facilitate memory sharing. Furthermore, DynaINA prioritizes communication-intensive jobs, leveraging the benefits of INA to enhance overall performance in training clusters. Extensive experiments with popular vision and language models demonstrate that DynaINA reduces training time by up to 65.16% and improves switch memory utilization by up to 85.02% compared to state-of-the-art solutions in a 100Gbps network.},

  abstract     = {Quantum circuits are fundamental components of quantum computing, and state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation is a widely used technique for tracking qubit behavior throughout circuit evolution. However, simulating a circuit with $n$ qubits requires $2^{n+4}$ bytes of memory, making simulations of more than 40 qubits feasible only on supercomputers. To address this limitation, we propose the Qu-Trefoil, a system designed for large-scale quantum circuit simulations on an FPGA-based platform called Trefoil. Trefoil is a multi-FPGA system connected to eight storage subsystems, each equipped with 32 SATA disks. Qu-Trefoil integrates a suite of HLS-based universal quantum gates, including Clifford gates (Hadamard (H), Pauli-Z (Z), Phase (S), Controlled-NOT (CNOT)), the T gate, and unitary matrix computation, along with HDL-designed modules for system-wide integration. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the system&#39;s robustness and flexibility, covering quantum gate performance, chunk size, disk extensibility, and efficiency across different SATA generations. We successfully simulated quantum circuits with over 43 qubits, which required more than 128 TB of memory, in approximately 3.72 to 13.06 hours on a single storage subsystem equipped with one FPGA. This achievement represents a significant milestone in the advancement of quantum computing simulations. Furthermore, thanks to its unique architecture, Qu-Trefoil is more accessible, flexible, and cost-efficient than other existing simulators for large-scale quantum circuit simulations, making it a viable option for researchers with limited access to supercomputers.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the trade-offs of reducing scan test patterns during Wafer Sort, accepting additional packaging costs, and screening more chips during Package Tests. Previous works proposed ways of selecting or reordering patterns to bring the most efficient to the left. Unlike such studies, this work quantifies the benefit of removing patterns directly from the tail of any pattern set. The paper elaborates on novel formulas to propose a comprehensive cost model that combines yield, Wafer Sort, packaging, and Package Test costs. The model evolves from known concepts by assuming that mass production defectivity is non-uniformly distributed over the die population and accounts for sacrificial lots to extract guiding information. It is shown that reducing patterns at Wafer Sort is beneficial under certain conditions of yield, fault coverage, and considering equipment and production costs. The model accurately estimates the number of patterns to remove for maximum gain in these cases. As a further by-product, the paper shows that a significant cost advantage can be achieved if pattern generation is guided based on the basics of the non-uniform failure distribution. This approach is validated with an academic benchmark and by observing six months of production for a real-world microcontroller by STMicroelectronics.},

  abstract     = {DNA computing has proven to possess strong parallel processing capabilities, offering notable advantages for multi-objective computation. Traditional, complex nonlinear DNA molecular logic circuits require the pre-construction of basic logic gates, followed by their cascading to achieve logic functions. However, as the number of cascade levels increases, more DNA strands are required to amplify and recover signals, causing the system&#39;s reaction time to grow exponentially. This paper introduces a novel approach for building complex nonlinear digital logic circuits using DNA winner-take-all neural networks. The logic circuit comprises four computational modules: weight multiplication, summation, competitive annihilation, and reporting. First, an annihilation strand is designed to control the reaction rate between two competing signals, resolving the interference between weight multiplication and competitive annihilation. Second, new grouping strategies—complementary annihilation, equal annihilation, and denoise annihilation—are introduced. These strategies exponentially reduce the number of competitive strands and significantly decrease system reaction time. The effect becomes more pronounced as the number of input patterns increases. Finally, 2-4, 3-8, and 4-16 decoder circuits are built using the winner-take-all neural networks, and an $\boldsymbol{n}\boldsymbol{-}\boldsymbol{2}^{\boldsymbol{n}}$ universal decoder model is further developed. This study presents an effective method for implementing complex nonlinear logic circuits through DNA strand displacement reactions.},

Consequently, the retirement may stall differently depending on the execution time of the first instruction in the RCU, causing varying stalling in the RCU reception. Moreover, We find that the RCU reception in AMD processors and retirement in Intel processors are shared between two logical cores of the same physical core, allowing an attacker to infer the instructions executed by another logical core based on its retire resources efficiency. Based on these findings, we introduce the retirement covert channel on Intel processors and the RCU covert channel on AMD processors. Furthermore, we explores additional applications of retire resources. On the one hand, we combined the misprediction penalty mechanism to apply our covert channels to the Spectre attacks. On the other hand, based on the principle that different programs result in varied usage patterns of retire resources, we propose an attack method that leverages the retire resources to infer the program run by the victim. Finally, we design the corresponding mitigations and extend our mitigation to fetch unit to reduce the performance overhead.},

In this paper, we present an energy efficient and high speed Big-computing and Little-storing STT-MRAM PIM (BCLS-SP) architecture, which can increase the number of active row-lines with almost no area overhead. In the BCLS-SP architecture, a charge domain-based STT-MRAM PIM (CD-SP) structure is employed to concurrently activate many row-lines by improving MAC operation reliability. Filter-wise weight compression (FWC) and weight sharing (WS) are also devised to compress the weights stored in CD-SP, thus reducing area cost. In addition, the proposed architecture performs MAC operations with skipping zero-valued input (SZI) and zero-conversion scheme (ZCS) for better energy efficiency and performance. The simulations using 28nm CMOS process show that the BCLS-SP architecture shows energy reduction of 29% and performance improvement of 3.6 compared to the recent memristive device-based PIM using weight compression and input skipping.},

This work proposes HDViT, a full-fledged heterogeneous hardware accelerator on FPGA, to enhance the ViT acceleration by comprehensively analyzing and addressing the challenges of heterogeneous architecture design. Specifically, HDViT first develops a heterogeneous architecture design that is composed of multiple processing engines (PEs) to accelerate various operators in the ViT model. Then, HDViT devises a hybrid-oriented dataflow mapping strategy to reduce data transmission granularity and alleviate storage resource pressure. Lastly, to achieve the latency balancing among multiple PEs, we formulate the HDViT architecture and implement an automated exploration process to identify optimized parallelism parameters that satisfy computation and storage demands while enhancing the heterogeneous architectural performance. Experimental results indicate that HDViT achieves significant performance speedups of 2.16$\times$ and 3.51$\times$ compared to previous heterogeneous and unified accelerators, respectively.

In contrast, collaborative measurement achieves load balancing through flow distribution across software switches but requires high resource usage. This paper presents a novel distributed deployment framework that overcomes the limitations above. First, our framework is lightweight such that it splits sketches into segments and allocates them across forwarding paths to minimize resource usage and achieve load balancing. This also enables per-packet load balancing by distributing computations across software switches. Second, through a novel collaborative strategy, our framework achieves finer-grained flow distribution and further optimizes load balancing. Third, we further optimize load balancing by eliminating the mutual influence among forwarding paths. We evaluate the proposed framework on various network topologies and different sketches. Results indicate our solution matches the load balancing of collaborative measurement while approaching the low resource usage of centralized deployment.

However, there are still three challenges for hybrid parallelism on commodity GPU servers: i) a balanced model partition is crucial for efficiency, whereas prior works lack a sound solution to generate a balanced partition automatically; ii) an orchestrated device mapping is essential to reduce communication contention, however, prior works ignore server heterogeneity, exacerbating communication contention; iii) the startup overhead is inevitable and especially significant for deep pipelines, which is an essential source of pipeline bubbles and severely affects pipeline scalability. We propose AutoPipe-H to solve these three problems, which contains i) a pipeline partitioner component for automatically and quickly generating a balanced sub-block partition scheme; ii) a device mapping component that assigns pipeline stages to devices, considering server heterogeneity, to reduce communication contention; and iii) a distributed training runtime component that reduces pipeline startup overhead by splitting the micro-batch evenly. The experimental results show that AutoPipe-H can accelerate training by up to 1.26x over the hybrid parallelism framework DAPPLE and Piper, with a 2.73x-12.7x improvement in the partition balance and an order-of-magnitude time reduction in partition scheme searching.},

However, the efficiency of sparse models is hampered by irregular memory access patterns in sparse matrix multiplication kernels. Hardware-level support for 2:4 granularity in sparse tensor cores presents an opportunity for designing efficient sparse matrix multiplication kernels. Existing approaches often involve adjusting sparse structures or secondary sparsification, introducing additional computational errors. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a flexible 2:4 structured adaptive sparse matrix multiplication (FS-AMM) method, a hardware-friendly sparse matrix multiplication kernel that leverages model context to accelerate convolutional neural networks. First, we propose a model context-aware matrix pre-processing method that employs heuristic algorithms to estimate a loss of accuracy due to weight sparsity at each layer. Second, we design a hardware-friendly sparse storage format that combines 2:4 sparse and dense storage formats, enabling more versatile sparsity ratio selection. Third, we implement efficient matrix multiplication kernels to optimize GPU utilization. Finally, experimental results on A100 GPUs show that our method effectively utilizes the sparse tensor kernel and obtains an average 3.09 times speedup ratio compared to other sparse methods while maintaining a high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Real-time rendering offers instantaneous visual feedback, making it crucial for mixed-reality applications. The light field captures both light intensity and direction in a 3D environment, serving as a data-rich medium to enhance mixed-reality experiences. However, two major challenges remain: 1) current light field rendering techniques are unsuitable for real-time computation, and 2) existing real-time methods cannot efficiently process high-dimensional light field data on GPU platforms. To overcome these challenges, we propose an framework utilizing a compact neural representation of light field data, implemented on a GPU platform for real-time rendering. This framework provides both compact storage and high-fidelity real-time computation. Specifically, we introduce a ray global alignment strategy to simplify the framework and improve practicality. This strategy enables the learning of an optimal embedding for all local rays in a globally consistent way, removing the need for camera pose calculations. To achieve effective compression, the neural light field is employed to map each embedded ray to its corresponding color. To enable real-time rendering, we design a novel super-resolution network to enhance rendering speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances compression efficiency and real-time rendering performance, achieving nearly 50$\mathbf{\times}$ compression ratio and 100 FPS rendering.},

  abstract     = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) is imperative in discovering the properties of the same data owned by two competitive parties, without revealing anything else of their respective data asset. Existing PSI solutions such as APSI and ORI-PSI suffer from severe communication and computation overhead due to inefficient communication and FHE polynomial evaluation, which hinders their deployment in practice. This issue is evident in both the upper-level protocol and the lower-level hardware platform. In this paper, we propose a novel software/hardware co-design acceleration architecture for PSI, termed as “Trident”, which includes two tightly coupled segments: from the protocol perspective, we investigate existing bottlenecks and propose a new PSI protocol with significantly less communication and computation under the security guarantee; besides, we re-architect the hardware platform by designing a PSI-specific accelerator, implemented with both FPGA and ASIC, targeting the key operations in the proposed protocol. We build a real-world experimental environment with two instantiated parties to verify the acceleration architecture, and highlight the following results: (1) up to 130$\boldsymbol{\times}$/145$\boldsymbol{\times}$ speedup for the computation of receiver and sender parties; (2) up to 37$\boldsymbol{\times}$ reduction of communication overhead. (3) up to 93,651$\boldsymbol{\times}$ and 74,326$\boldsymbol{\times}$ higher energy efficiency over the CPU-based ORI-PSI and APSI, respectively.},

However, existing hashing methods may cause high extra write amplification to NVM and bring high additional storage overhead on NVM while providing low request performance. To solve these problems, we have proposed a dynamic hashing method called Hierarchical Hashing, whose basic idea is to leverage a novel hash collision resolution mechanism that can dynamically expand the size of the hash table. Hierarchical Hashing can incur no extra write amplification to NVM when resolving hash collisions. Additionally, it can directly address all cells when resizing the hash table, thereby avoiding the additional storage overhead caused by non-addressable linked lists. Furthermore, the request performance can be improved as all cells of the hash table are addressable when resizing to resolve hash collisions. The experimental results demonstrate that Hierarchical Hashing brings no extra write amplification to NVM and achieves nearly 90% space utilization and high request performance while providing 99% memory utilization, compared with existing representative hashing methods.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning, as a promising distributed learning paradigm, enables collaborative training of a global model across multiple network edge clients without the need for central data collecting. However, the heterogeneity of edge data distribution drags the model towards the local minima, which can be distant from the global optimum. Such heterogeneity often leads to slow convergence and substantial communication overhead. To address these issues, we propose a novel federated learning framework called FedCMD, a model decoupling tailored to the Cloud-edge supported federated learning that separates deep neural networks into a body for capturing shared representations in Cloud and a personalized head for migrating data heterogeneity. Our motivation is that, by the deep investigation of the performance of selecting different neural network layers as the personalized head, we found rigidly assigning the last layer as the personalized head in current studies is not always optimal. Instead, it is necessary to dynamically select the personalized layer that maximizes the training performance by taking the representation difference between neighbor layers into account. To find the optimal personalized layer, we utilize the low-dimensional representation of each layer to contrast feature distribution transfer and introduce a Wasserstein-based layer selection method, aimed at identifying the best-match layer for personalization. Additionally, a weighted global aggregation algorithm is proposed based on the selected personalized layer for the practical application of FedCMD. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our solution compared with nine state-of-the-art solutions.

  abstract     = {Graph processing plays an important role in many practical applications. However, the inherent characteristics of graph processing, including random memory access and the low computation-to-communication ratio, make it difficult to efficiently execute on traditional computing architectures, such as CPUs and GPUs. Near-memory computing has the characteristics of low latency and high bandwidth. It is widely regarded as a promising direction for designing graph processing accelerators. However, the storage space of a single device cannot meet the demand of large-scale graph processing. Using multiple devices will bring lots of inter-device data transmission, which may counteract the benefits of near-memory computing. To fundamentally reduce the data transmission overhead, we propose a data-centric graph processing framework for systems with multiple near-memory computing devices. The framework uses a data-centric programming model as the software hardware interface. For software, we propose an optimized data flow and a heuristic multi-step weighted maximum matching algorithm to achieve efficient inter-device communication and ensure load balancing. For hardware, we design a data reuse driven task controller and a data type-aware on-chip memory, which can effectively improve the utilization of the on-chip memory. Compared with the two most recent near-memory graph accelerators, our framework significantly reduces energy consumption and inter-device communication.},

  abstract     = {Stream processing is integral to edge computing due to its low-latency attributes. Nevertheless, variability in user group sizes and disparate computing capabilities of edge devices necessitate frequent operator migrations within the stream. Moreover, intricate dependencies among stream operators often obscure the detection of potential bottleneck operators until an identified bottleneck is migrated in the stream. To address this, we propose a Cost-Aware Operator Migration (CAOM) scheme. The CAOM scheme incorporates a bottleneck operator detection mechanism that directly identifies all bottleneck operators based on task running metrics. This approach avoids multiple consecutive operator migrations in complex tasks, reducing the number of task interruptions caused by operator migration. Moreover, CAOM takes into account the temporal variance in operator migration costs. By factoring in the fluctuating data generation rate from data sources at different time intervals, CAOM selects the optimal start time for operator migration to minimize the amount of accumulated data during task interruptions. Finally, we implemented CAOM on Apache Flink and evaluated its performance using the WordCount and Nexmark applications. Our experiments show that CAOM effectively reduces the number of necessary operator migrations in tasks with complex topologies and decreases the latency overhead associated with operator migration compared to state-of-the-art schemes.},

In particular, new features implemented on the framework will be presented as well as updates on the architecture of an existing prototype of the MLaaS4HEP cloud service will be provided.

Additionally, the framework explores the influence of cloud-edge collaboration on ES competition, offering new insights into these dynamics.

Specifically, we design an additional homomorphic bitmap index structure by using a pre-trained CNN model with modified fully connected layers to extract image feature vectors and organize them into a bitmap. It makes the extracted features more representative and robust compared to manually designed features, and only performs vector addition during the search process, improving search efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, we design a reversible data hiding (RDH) technique with color images, which embeds the verification information into the least significant bits of the encrypted image pixels to improve the security of the verification information. Finally, we analyze the security of our scheme against chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA) in the security analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme on two real-world datasets (i.e., COCO and Flickr-25 k) through experiments.},

In applications built on microservice architecture, sharing common microservices in multiple environments is an effective way to reduce resource consumption. Previous methods extend application layer protocols like HTTP and gRPC to propagate contexts including environment identifiers and to route requests. However, microservices also use other protocols such as MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and AMQP, and extending each protocol requires lots of effort to implement the extensions. This paper proposes PiCoP, a framework to share microservices in multiple environments by propagating contexts and routing requests independently of application layer protocols. PiCoP provides a protocol that propagates contexts by appending them to the front of each TCP byte stream and constructs a service mesh that uses the protocol to route requests. We design the protocol to make it easy to instrument into a system. We demonstrate that PiCoP can reduce resource usage and that it applies to a real-world application, enabling the sharing of microservices in multiple environments using any application layer protocol.},

Then, we transform the initial problem into one that can be adaptively optimized in each cloud interval.

  abstract     = {Cloud Data Centres deal with dynamic changes all the time. Networks in particular, need to adapt their configurations to changing workloads. Given these expectations, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) using Software Defined Networks (SDNs) has realized the aspect of programmability in networks. NFVs allow network services to be programmed as software entities that can be deployed on commodity clusters in the Cloud. Being software, they inherently carry the ability to be customized to specific tenants’ requirements and thus support multi-tenant variations with ease. However, the ability to exploit scaling in alignment with changing demands with minimal loss of service, and improving resource usage efficiency still remains a challenge. Several recent works in literature have proposed platforms to realize Virtual Network functions (VNFs) on the Cloud using service offerings such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and serverless computing. These approaches are limited by deployment difficulties (configuration and sizing), adaptability to performance requirements (elastic scaling), and changing workload dynamics (scaling and customization). In the current work, we propose a Hybrid Serverless Platform (HSP) to address these identified lacunae. The HSP is implemented using a combination of persistent IaaS, and FaaS components. The IaaS components handle the steady state load, whereas the FaaS components activate during the dynamic change associated with scaling to minimize service loss. The HSP controller takes provisioning decisions based on Quality of Service (QoS) rules and flow statistics using an auto recommender, alleviating users of sizing decisions for function deployment. HSP controller design exploits data locality in SFC realization, reducing data-transfer times between VNFs. It also enables the usage of application characteristics to offer higher control over SFC deployment. A proof-of-concept realization of HSP is presented in the paper and is evaluated for a representative Service Function Chain (SFC) for a dynamic workload, which shows minimal loss in flowlet service, up to 35% resource savings as compared to a pure IaaS deployment and up to 55% lower end-to-end times as compared to a baseline FaaS implementation.},

  abstract     = {In cloud-native environments, executing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) tasks in edge nodes close to users significantly reduces service end-to-end latency. Containerization further reduces resource and time consumption, and, subsequently, application latency. Since edge nodes are typically resource and energy-constrained, optimizing offloading decisions and managing edge energy consumption is crucial. However, the offloading of containerized tasks has not been thoroughly explored from a practical implementation perspective. This paper proposes an optimization framework for energy-aware offloading of V2X tasks implemented as Kubernetes pods. A weighted utility function is derived based on cumulative pod response time, and an edge-to-cloud offloading decision algorithm (ECODA) is proposed. The system&#39;s energy cost model is derived, and a closed-loop repeated reward-based mechanism for CPU adjustment is presented. An energy-aware (EA)-ECODA is proposed to solve the offloading optimization problem while adjusting CPU usage according to energy considerations. Simulations show that ECODA and EA-ECODA outperform first-in, first-served (FIFS) and EA-FIFS in terms of utility, average pod response time, and resource usage, with low computational complexity. Additionally, a real testbed evaluation of a vulnerable road user application demonstrates that ECODA outperforms Kubernetes vertical scaling in terms of service-level delay. Moreover, EA-ECODA significantly improves energy usage utility.},

  abstract     = {Containerization has become popular for the deployment of applications on public clouds. Large enterprises may host 100 s of applications on 1000 s containers that are placed onto Virtual Machines (VMs). Such placement decisions happen continuously as applications are updated by DevOps pipelines that deploy the containers. Managing the placement of container resource requests onto the available capacities of VMs needs to be cost-efficient. This is well-studied, and usually modelled as a multi-dimensional Vector Bin-packing Problem (VBP). Many heuristics, and recently machine learning approaches, have been developed to solve this NP-hard problem for real-time decisions. We propose CARL, a novel approach to solve VBP through Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RL) for cost minimization. It mimics the placement behavior of an offline semi-optimal VBP solver (teacher), while automatically learning a reward function for reducing the VM costs which out-performs the teacher. It requires limited historical container workload traces to train, and is resilient to changes in the workload distribution during inferencing. We extensively evaluate CARL on workloads derived from realistic traces from Google and Alibaba for the placement of 5 k–10 k container requests onto 2 k–8 k VMs, and compare it with classic heuristics and state-of-the-art RL methods. (1) CARL is fast, e.g., making placement decisions at $\approx 1900$ requests/sec onto 8,900 candidate VMs. (2) It is efficient, achieving $\approx 16\%$ lower VM costs than classic and contemporary RL methods. (3) It is robust to changes in the workload, offering competitive results even when the resource needs or inter-arrival time of the container requests skew from the training workload.},

Watermark is the general term for various trigger and release thresholds of RoCEv2 flow control protocols, and its reasonable configuration is an important factor affecting RoCEv2 performance. In this paper, we propose ByteTuning, a centralized watermark tuning system for RoCEv2. First, three real cases of network performance degradation caused by non-optimal or improper watermark configuration are reported, and the network performance results of different watermark configurations in three typical scenarios are traversed, indicating the necessity of watermark tuning. Then, based on the RDMA Fluid model, the influence of watermark on the RoCEv2 performance is modeled and evaluated. Next, the design of the ByteTuning is introduced, which includes three mechanisms. They are 1) using simulated annealing algorithm to make the real-time watermark converge to the near-optimal configuration, 2) using network telemetry to optimize the feedback overhead, 3) compressing the search space to improve the tuning efficiency. Finally, We validate the performance of ByteTuning in multiple real datacenter networking environments, and the results show that ByteTuning outperforms existing solutions.},

This study proposes a Cloud-Edge Large-Tiny Model Collaborative (CELTC) architecture grounded in deep reinforcement learning to optimize the processing and decision-making of surveillance data in offshore drilling platform scenarios. CELTC architecture leverages edge-cloud computing, deploying complex, high-precision large models on cloud servers and lightweight tiny models on edge devices. This dual deployment strategy capitalizes on tiny models’ rapid response and large cloud models’ high-precision capabilities. Additionally, the architecture integrates a deep reinforcement learning algorithm designed to optimize the scheduling and offloading of computational tasks between large and tiny models in the cloud-edge environment. The efficacy of the proposed architecture is validated using real-world surveillance data from ODPs through simulations and comparative experiments.},

  abstract     = {Cloud-Edge Collaborative Architecture (CEA) is a prominent framework that provides low-latency and energy-efficient solutions for video stream processing. In Cloud-Edge Collaborative Video Streaming Systems (CEAVS), efficient online offloading strategies for video tasks are crucial for enhancing user experience. However, most existing works overlook budget constraints, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios constrained by finite resources. Moreover, they fail to adequately address the heterogeneity of video task redundancies, leading to suboptimal utilization of CEAVS&#39;s limited resources. To bridge these gaps, we propose an Efficient Online Computing framework for CEAVS (EOCA) that jointly optimizes accuracy, energy consumption, and latency performance through adaptive online offloading and redundancy compression, without requiring future task information. Technically, we formulate computing offloading and adaptive compression under budget constraints as a stochastic optimization problem that maximizes system satisfaction, defined as a weighted combination of accuracy, latency, and energy performance. We employ Lyapunov optimization to decouple the long-term budget constraint. We prove that the decoupled problem is a generalized ordinal potential game and propose algorithms based on generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) and the best response to obtain Nash equilibrium strategies for computing offloading and task compression. Finally, we analyze EOCA&#39;s performance bound, convergence rate, and worst-case performance guarantees. Evaluations demonstrate that EOCA effectively improves satisfaction while effectively balancing satisfaction and computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of network function virtualization (NFV), many users resort to network service provisioning through virtual network function instances (VNFIs) run on the standard physical server in clouds. Following this trend, NFV markets are emerging, which allow a user to procure VNFIs from cloud service providers (CSPs). In such procurement process, it is a significant challenge to ensure differential privacy and truthfulness while explicitly considering dynamic resource provisioning, location sensitiveness and budget of each VNFI. As such, we design a differentially private and truthful reverse auction with dynamic resource provisioning (PTRA-DRP) to resolve the VNFI procurement (VNFIP) problem. To allow dynamic resource provisioning, PTRA-DRP enables CSPs to submit a set of bids and accept as many as possible, and decides the provisioning VNFIs based on the auction outcomes. To be specific, we first devise a greedy heuristic approach to select the set of the winning bids in a differentially privacy-preserving manner. Next, we design a pricing strategy to compute the charges of CSPs, aiming to guarantee truthfulness. Strict theoretical analysis proves that PTRA-DRP can ensure differential privacy, truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency and approximate social cost minimization. Extensive simulations also demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PTRA-DRP.},

  abstract     = {Data Center Network (DCN) flexibility is critical for providing adaptive and dynamic bandwidth while optimizing network resources to manage variable traffic patterns generated by heterogeneous applications. To provide flexible bandwidth, this work proposes a machine learning approach with a new Scalable and Reconfigurable Optical DCN (SROdcn) architecture that maintains dynamic and non-uniform network traffic according to the scale of the high-performance optical interconnected DCN. Our main device is the Fiber Optical Switch (FOS), which offers competitive wavelength resolution. We propose a new top-of-rack (ToR) switch that utilizes Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) to investigate Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with machine learning-enabled flow prediction for reconfigurable optical Data Center Networks (DCNs). Our architecture provides highly scalable and flexible bandwidth allocation. Results from Mininet experimental simulations demonstrate that under the management of an SDN controller, machine learning traffic flow prediction and graph connectivity allow each optical bandwidth to be automatically reconfigured according to variable traffic patterns. The average server-to-server packet delay performance of the reconfigurable SROdcn improves by 42.33% compared to inflexible interconnects. Furthermore, the network performance of flexible SROdcn servers shows up to a 49.67% latency improvement over the Passive Optical Data Center Architecture (PODCA), a 16.87% latency improvement over the optical OPSquare DCN, and up to a 71.13% latency improvement over the fat-tree network. Additionally, our optimized Unsupervised Machine Learning (ML-UnS) method for SROdcn outperforms Supervised Machine Learning (ML-S) and Deep Learning (DL).},

CARE aims to enhance the practicality and efficiency of remote attestation while addressing trust issues within environments involving multiple stakeholders. Specifically, CARE adopts the concept of swarm verification, and employs a circular collaboration model with multiple verifiers to collect and validate evidence, thereby resolving trust issues and enhancing verification efficiency. Moreover, CARE introduces a meticulously designed filtering mechanism to address the issue of false positives in verification outcomes non-invasively. CARE utilizes a multiway tree structure to construct the baseline value library, which enhances the flexibility and fine-grained management capability of the system. Security analysis indicates that CARE can effectively resist collusion attacks. Further, detailed simulation experiments have validated its capability to convincingly attest to the trustworthiness of the dynamically constructed environment. Notably, CARE is also suitable for the remote attestation of large-scale virtual machines, achieving an efficiency 9 times greater than the classical practice approach. To the best of our knowledge, CARE is the first practical solution to address inaccuracies in remote attestation results caused by the activation of Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) at the application layer.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing brings several challenges when it comes to data movement. First, moving large data from edge devices to the server is likely to waste bandwidth. Second, complex data patterns (e.g., traffic cameras) on devices require flexible handling. An ideal approach is to move code to data instead. However, since only a small portion of code is required, moving the executable as well as their libraries to the devices can be an overkill. While loading code on demand from remote such as NFS can be a stopgap, but on the other hand leads to low efficiency for irregular access patterns. This article presents StreamSys, a lightweight executable delivery system that loads code on demand by redirecting the local disk IO to the server through optimized network IO. We employ a Markov-based prefetch mechanism on the server side. It learns the access pattern of code and predicts the block sequence for the client to reduce the network round trip. Meanwhile, server-side StreamSys asynchronously prereads the block sequence from the disk to conceal disk IO latency beforehand. Evaluation shows that the latency of StreamSys is up to 71.4% lower than the native Linux file system based on SD card and up to 62% lower than NFS in wired environments.},

To address this issue, this paper conducts a deep analysis based on the OpenFaaS platform—a popular open-source serverless platform for mobile edge environments—to investigate the overhead of performing deep learning inference tasks on mobile devices. To thoroughly evaluate the inference overhead, we develop a performance benchmark, named ESBench, whereby a set of comprehensive experiments are conducted with respect to a bunch of simulated mobile devices associated with an edge cluster. Our investigation reveals that the performance of deep learning inference tasks is significantly influenced by the model size and resource contention in mobile devices, leading to up to $3\times$ degradation in performance. Moreover, we observe that the network environment can negatively impact the performance of mobile inference, increasing the CPU overhead under poor network conditions. Based on our findings, we further propose some recommendations for designing efficient serverless platforms and resource management strategies as well as for deploying serverless computing in the mobile edge environment.},

  abstract     = {The growth, development, and commercialization of artificial intelligence-based technologies such as self-driving cars, augmented-reality viewers, chatbots, and virtual assistants are driving the need for increased computing power. Most of these applications rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which demand substantial computing capacity to meet user demands. However, this capacity cannot be fully provided by users’ local devices due to their limited processing power, nor by cloud data centers due to high transmission latency from long distances. Edge cloud computing addresses this issue by processing user requests through 5G, which reduces transmission latency from local devices to computing resources and allows the offloading of some computations to cloud back-ends. This paper introduces a model for a Mobile Edge Cloud system designed for an application based on a DNN. The interaction among multiple mobile users and the edge platform is formulated as a one-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, resulting in a challenging non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To tackle this, we propose a heuristic approach based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, which solves the MINLP problem significantly faster than the commercial state-of-the-art solvers (up to 50,000 times). Furthermore, we present an algorithm to estimate optimal platform profit when sensitive user parameters are unknown. Comparing this with the full-knowledge scenario, we observe a profit loss of approximately 1%. Lastly, we analyze the advantages for an edge provider to engage in a Stackelberg game rather than setting a fixed price for its users, showing potential profit increases ranging from 16% to 66%.},

  abstract     = {Container-based task scheduling is critical for ensuring a reliable, flexible and cost-effective cloud computing mode. However, in different business cloud systems, state-of-the-art scheduling models are not as effective as those in the simulated world due to the sparsity issues associated with sample sizes and features. Herein, we propose a novel containerized task scheduling framework (SA2CTS) based on reinforcement learning (RL) that incorporates cross-modal contrastive learning (CL) loss. This framework optimizes the scheduler&#39;s understanding of the container-based cloud state in RL by adding a pretraining stage, promoting accurate scheduling action inference. Specifically, we design a two-stage learning pipeline. The initial stage involves pretraining the model on a large collection of aligned image-text pairs to extract fine-grained scheduling affinity features, and the high-level semantic representations of scheduling tasks are learned in the multimodal space. In the second stage, we fine-tune the pretrained model with multisource cluster feedback, i.e., build a mapping from state representations to scheduling actions through the RL paradigm, achieving task-oriented and semantic-aware scheduling. The experimental results obtained on three large-scale production cluster datasets substantiate that the proposed SA2CTS method can provide average convergence efficiency and resource utilization improvements of 17.57% and 10.42%, respectively, over the state-of-the-art RL scheduling methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the use of container cloud platforms has experienced rapid growth. However, because containers are operating-system-level virtualization, their isolation is far less than that of virtual machines, posing considerable challenges for multi-tenant container cloud platforms. To address the issues associated with current container anomaly detection algorithms, such as the difficulty in mining periodic features and the high rate of false positives due to noisy data, we propose an anomaly detection method named SST-LOF, based on singular spectrum transformation and the local outlier factor. Our method enhances the traditional Singular Spectrum Transformation (SST) algorithm to meet the needs of streaming unsupervised detection. Furthermore, our method improves the calculation mode of the anomaly score of the Local Outlier Factor algorithm (LOF) and reduces false positives of noisy data with dynamic sliding windows. Additionally, we have designed and implemented a container cloud anomaly detection system that can perform real-time, unsupervised, streaming anomaly detection on containers quickly and accurately. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in detecting anomalies in containers in both simulated and real cloud environments.},

  abstract     = {Post-deduplication in traditional cloud environments primarily focuses on single-node, where delta compression is performed on the same deduplication node located on server side. However, with data explosion, the multi-node post-deduplication, also called global deduplication, has become a hot issue in research communities, which aims to simultaneously execute delta compression on data distributed across all nodes. Simply setting up single-node deduplication systems on multi-node environments would significantly affect storage utilization and incur secondary overhead from file migration. Nevertheless, existing global deduplication solutions suffer from lower data compression ratios and high computational overhead due to their resemblance detection&#39;s inherent limitations and overly coarse granularities. Similar blocks typically have high correlations between sub-blocks; inspired by this observation, we propose IBNR (Intra-Block Neighborhood Relationship-Based Resemblance Detection for High-Performance Multi-Node Post-Deduplication), which introduces a novel resemblance detection based on relationships between sub-blocks and determines the ownership of blocks in entry stage to achieve efficient global deduplication. Furthermore, the by-products of IBNR have shown powerful scalability by replacing internal resemblance detection scheme with existing solutions on practical workloads. Experimental results indicate that IBNR outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving an average 1.99× data reduction ratio and varying degrees of improvement across other key metrics.},

As these applications require massive computing resources, graphics processing units (GPUs) are being widely used as high-speed parallel computing devices to meet the stringent demands. Although current GPUs allow application components to be executed concurrently via spatial multitasking, they face several challenges. The first challenge is allocating the computing resources to components dynamically to maximize efficiency. The second challenge is avoiding performance degradation caused by the data transfer overhead between the components. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient GPU resource management technique that dynamically allocates GPU resources to application components. The proposed method allocates resources based on component workloads and uses online performance monitoring to guarantee the application&#39;s performance. We also propose a GPU memory manager to reduce the data transfer overhead between components via shared memory. Our evaluation results indicate that the proposed dynamic resource allocation method improves application throughput by up to 134.12% compared to the state-of-the-art spatial multitasking techniques. We also show that using a shared memory results in 6x throughput improvement compared to the baseline User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based technique.},

Their application in data center networks is motivated by emerging hardware technologies, such as 3D MEMS Optical Circuit Switches (OCS). The Matching Model (MM) has been introduced to study the hybrid architecture of such networks. It abstracts from the electrical switches and focuses on the added (reconfigurable) optical ones. MM defines any SAN topology as a union of matchings over a set of top-of-rack (ToR) nodes, and assumes that rearranging the edges of a single matching comes at a fixed cost. In this work, we propose and study the Scalable Matching Model (SMM), a generalization of the MM, and present OpticNet, a framework that maps a set of ToRs to a set of OCSs to form a SAN topology. We prove that OpticNet uses the minimum number of switches to realize any bounded-degree topology and allows existing SAN algorithms to run on top of it, while preserving amortized performance guarantees. Our experimental results based on real workloads show that OpticNet is a flexible and efficient framework for the implementation and evaluation of SAN algorithms in reconfigurable data center environments.},

However, challenges arise in diverse user domains where data is encrypted with different keys, giving rise to the development of delegatable order-revealing encryption (DORE) schemes. Regrettably, existing DORE schemes are susceptible to authorization token forgery attacks and rely on computationally intensive bilinear pairings. This work proposes a novel solution to address these challenges. We first introduce a delegatable equality-revealing encryption scheme, enabling the comparison of ciphertexts encrypted by distinct secret keys through authorization tokens. Building upon this, we present a delegatable order-revealing encryption that leverages bitwise encryption. DORE supports efficient multi-user ciphertext comparison while robustly resisting authorization token forgery attacks. Significantly, our approach distinguishes itself by minimizing bilinear pairings. Experimental results highlight the efficacy of DORE, showcasing a notable speedup of $2.8\times$ in encryption performance and $1.33\times$ in comparison performance compared to previous DORE schemes, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Currently, deduplication techniques are utilized to minimize the space overhead by deleting redundant data blocks across large-scale servers in data centers. However, such a process exacerbates the fragmentation of data blocks, causing more cross-server file retrievals with plummeting retrieval throughput. Some attempts prefer better file retrieval performance by confining all blocks of a file to one single server, resulting in non-trivial space consumption for more replicated blocks across servers. An ideal network storage system, in effect, should take both the deduplication and retrieval performance into account by implementing reasonable assignment of the detected unique blocks. Such a fine-grained assignment requires an accurate and comprehensive abstraction of the files, blocks, and the file-block affiliation relationships. To achieve this, we innovatively design the weighted hypergraph to profile the multivariate data correlations. With this delicate abstraction in place, we propose HyperPart, which elegantly transforms this complex block allocation problem into a hypergraph partition problem. For more general scenarios with dynamic file updates, we further propose a two-phase incremental hypergraph repartition scheme, which mitigates the performance degradation with minimal migration volume. We implement a prototype system of HyperPart, and the experiment results validate that it saves around 50% of the storage space and improves the retrieval throughput by approximately 30% of state-of-the-art methods under the balance constraints.},

  abstract     = {In edge computing, energy-limited distributed edge clients present challenges such as heterogeneity, high energy consumption, and security risks. Traditional blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) struggles to address all three of these challenges simultaneously. This article proposes a Graph-Partitioning Multi-Granularity Federated Learning method on a consortium blockchain, namely GP-MGFL. To reduce the overall communication overhead, we adopt a balanced graph partitioning algorithm while introducing observer and consensus nodes. This method groups clients to minimize high-cost communications and focuses on the guidance effect within each group, thereby ensuring effective guidance with reduced overhead. To fully leverage heterogeneity, we introduce a cross-granularity guidance mechanism. This mechanism involves fine-granularity models guiding coarse-granularity models to enhance the accuracy of the latter models. We also introduce a credit model to adjust the contribution of models to the global model dynamically and to dynamically select leaders responsible for model aggregation. Finally, we implement a prototype system on real physical hardware and compare it with several baselines. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the GP-MGFL algorithm is 5.6% higher than that of ordinary BFL algorithms. In addition, compared to other grouping methods, such as greedy grouping, the accuracy of the proposed method improves by about 1.5%. In scenarios with malicious clients, the maximum accuracy improvement reaches 11.1%. We also analyze and summarize the impact of grouping and the number of clients on the model, as well as the impact of this method on the inherent security of the blockchain itself.},

In response to this pressing challenge, we propose a novel approach in this paper: adapting the workload to match the renewable energy supply. Our solution involves dynamic overbooking of resources, providing energy flexibility to data center operators. We propose a framework that stochastically models both workload and energy source information, leveraging Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to determine the optimal overbooking degree based on the workload flexibility of data center clients. We validate the proposed algorithm in realistic settings through extensive simulations. Results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing approaches, achieving better matching with the renewable energy supply by 55.6%, 34.65%, and 40.7% for workload traces from Nectar Cloud, Google, and Wikipedia, respectively.},

First, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-UAV centralized control strategy to maximize the accumulated communication service score. In the proposed framework, curiosity can act as an internal incentive signal, allowing UAVs to explore the environment without any prior knowledge. Second, a two-phase exploring protocol is proposed for practical implementation.

  abstract     = {In physical human–robot interaction (pHRI), the interaction profiles, such as impedance and interaction force are greatly influenced by the operator&#39;s muscle activities, impedance and interaction force between the robot and the operator. Actually, parameters of interaction profiles are easy to be measured, such as position, velocity, acceleration, and muscle activities. However, the impedance cannot be directly measured. In some areas, it is difficult to capture the force information, especially where the force sensor is hard to be attached on the robots. In this sense, it is worth developing a feasible and simple solution to recognize the impedance parameters by exploring the potential relationship among the above mentioned interaction profiles. To this end, a framework of impedance recognition based on different time-based weight membership functions with broad learning system (TWMF-BLS) is developed for stable/unstable pHRI. Specifically, a linear weight membership function and a nonlinear weight membership function are proposed for stable and unstable pHRI by using the hybrid features for estimating the interaction force. And then the human arm impedance can be estimated without a biological model or a robot&#39;s model. Experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

First, regarding the issue of user emotional reactions in mining topics. In this article, we quantify the affective influence among users by considering user behaviors as continuous conversations through conversation-level sentiment analysis and the proximity centrality of social networks. Second, considering that user behavior is influenced by multidimensional cognition, this article proposes a method based on S(Sensibility) R(Rationality) 2vec to simulate the dialectical relationship between sensibility and rationality in the user decision-making process. Finally, considering the cooperative and competitive relationship among derived topics, this article uses evolutionary game theory to analyze the topic life cycle and quantify its impact on user behavior by time discretization method. Accordingly, we propose a CG-back-propagation (BP) model incorporating a BP neural network to efficiently simulate the nonlinear relationship of user behavior. Experiments show that the model can not only effectively tap the influence of multidimensional cognition on users’ retweeting behavior, but also effectively perceive the propagation dynamics of derived topics.},

  abstract     = {Since sudden and recurrent epileptic seizures seriously affect people&#39;s lives, computer-aided automatic seizure detection is crucial for precise diagnosis and prompt treatment. A novel seizure detection algorithm named channel selection-based temporal convolutional network (CS-TCN) was proposed in this article. First, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were segmented into 2-s intervals and features were extracted from both the time and frequency domains. Then, the expanded fisher score channel selection method was employed to select channels that contribute the most to seizure detection. Finally, the features from selected EEG channels were fed into the TCN to capture inherent temporal dependencies of EEG signals and detect seizure events. Children Hospital Boston and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) and Siena datasets were used to verify the detection performance of the CS-TCN algorithm, achieving sensitivities of 98.56% and 98.88%, and specificities of 99.80% and 99.88% in samplewise analysis, respectively. In eventwise analysis, the algorithm achieved sensitivities of 97.57% and 95.00%, with delays of 6.91 and 18.62 s, and FDR/h of 0.11 and 0.39, respectively. These results surpassed state-of-the-art few-channel algorithms for both datasets. CS-TCN algorithm offers excellent performance while simplifying model complexity and computational requirements, thus showcasing its potential for facilitating seizure detection in home environments.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) has significant advantages in terms of reliability and accuracy. However, individual differences in EEG limit the ability of sentiment classifiers to generalize across subjects. Furthermore, due to the nonstationarity of EEG, subject signals can vary with time, an important challenge for temporal emotion recognition. Several emotion recognition methods have been developed that consider the alignment of conditional distributions, but do not balance the weights of conditional and marginal distributions. In this article, we propose a novel approach to generalize emotion recognition models across individuals and time, i.e., global and local associative domain adaptation (GLADA). The proposed method consists of three parts: 1) deep neural networks are used to extract deep features from emotional EEG data; 2) considering that marginal and conditional distributions between domains can contribute to adaptation differently, a method that combines coarse-grained adversarial adaptation and fine-grained adversarial adaptation is used to narrow the domain distance of the joint distribution in the EEG data between subjects (i.e., reduce intersubject variability), and the weights of the marginal and conditional distributions are automatically balanced using dynamic balancing factors; and 3) domain adaptation is used to accelerate model convergence. Using GLADA, subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is improved by reducing the influence of the subject’s personal information on EEG emotion. Experimental results demonstrate that the GLADA model effectively addresses the domain transfer problem, resulting in improved performance across multiple EEG emotion recognition tasks.},

  abstract     = {Emotion plays an important role in human life. In recent years, memristor-based emotion circuits have been proposed extensively, but few circuits simulate the neural circuity that generates specific emotions in the limbic system. In this article, a memristor-based circuit of brain-like fear generalization is proposed. It is described from two dimensions of perception and higher cognition, respectively, both of which are realized by simulating the limbic system of human brain. The main difference between these two dimensions lies in the circuit design of the hippocampus module. Moreover, the memory enhancement effect caused by fear is one of the reasons for the phenomenon of fear generalization. That is, high arousal of fear leads to enhanced memory. Herein, the memristor-based circuit associated with different emotional arousal and memory is designed. The simulation results in SPICE show that the circuit is able to implement the brain-like fear generalization and the emotional memory under different arousal. The circuit design of these neural networks may provide some references for the field of brain-like robots.},

Despite its undeniable relevance, the underlying process governing the relationship between unpleasant sound events, and the annoyance they may cause has not been systematically studied yet. In this context, this work focuses on the disturbance caused by interfloor sound events, i.e., the audio signals transmitted through the floors of a building. Activities such as walking, running, using household appliances or other daily actions generate sounds that can be heard by those on an adjacent floor. To this end, we implemented a suitable dataset including diverse interfloor sound events annotated according to the perceived disturbance. Subsequently, we propose a framework able to quantify similarities exhibited by interfloor sound events starting from standardized time-frequency representations, which are processed by a Siamese neural network composed of a series of convolutional layers. Such similarities are then employed by a $k$-medoids regression scheme making disturbance predictions based on interfloor sound events with neighboring latent representations. After thorough experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of such a framework and its superiority over popular regression algorithms. Last but not least, the proposed solution offers interpretable predictions, which may be meaningfully utilized by human experts.},

  abstract     = {Event cameras have unique advantages in object detection, capturing asynchronous events without continuous frames. They excel in dynamic range, low latency, and high-speed motion scenarios, with lower power consumption. However, aggregating event data into image frames leads to information loss and reduced detection performance. Applying traditional neural networks to event camera outputs is challenging due to event data&#39;s distinct characteristics. In this study, we present a novel spiking neural networks (SNNs)-based object detection model, the spiking vision transformer (SpikingViT) to address these issues. First, we design a dedicated event data converting module that effectively captures the unique characteristics of event data, mitigating the risk of information loss while preserving its spatiotemporal features. Second, we introduce SpikingViT, a novel object detection model that leverages SNNs capable of extracting spatiotemporal information among events data. SpikingViT combines the advantages of SNNs and transformer models, incorporating mechanisms such as attention and residual voltage memory to further enhance detection performance. Extensive experiments have substantiated the remarkable proficiency of SpikingViT in event-based object detection, positioning it as a formidable contender. Our proposed approach adeptly retains spatiotemporal information inherent in event data, leading to a substantial enhancement in detection performance.},

  abstract     = {The acoustic startle reflex (ASR) relies on the sensorimotor system and is affected by aging, sex, and psychopathology. ASR can be modulated by the prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm, which achieves the inhibition of reactivity to a startling stimulus (pulse) following a weak prepulse stimulus. Additionally, neurophysiological studies have found that brain activity is characterized by irregular patterns with high complexity, which however reduces with age. Our study investigated the relationship between prestartle nonlinear dynamics and PPI in healthy children versus adults. Fifty-six individuals took part in the experiment: 31 children and adolescents and 25 adults. Participants heard 51 pairs of tones (prepulse and startle) with a time difference of 30 to 500 ms. Subsequently, we assessed neural complexity by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) during the prestartle period and assessed PPI by analyzing the poststartle event-related potentials (ERPs). Results showed higher neural complexity for children compared to adults, in line with previous research showing reduced complexity in the physiological signals in aging. As expected, PPI (as reflected in the P50 and P200 components) was enhanced in adults compared to children, potentially due to the maturation of the ASR for the former. Interestingly, prestartle complexity was correlated with the P50 component in children only, but not in adults, potentially due to the different stage of sensorimotor maturation between age groups. Overall, our study offers novel contributions for investigating brain dynamics, linking nonlinear with linear measures. Our findings are consistent with the loss of neural complexity in aging, and suggest differentiated links between nonlinear and linear metrics in children and adults.},

  abstract     = {The NMDA receptor (NMDAR), as a ubiquitous type of synapse in neural systems of the brain, presents slow dynamics to modulate neural spiking activity. For the cerebellum, NMDARs have been suggested for contributing complex spikes in Purkinje cells (PCs) as a mechanism for cognitive activity, learning, and memory. Recent experimental studies are debating the role of NMDAR in PC dendritic input, yet it remains unclear how the distribution of NMDARs in PC dendrites can affect their neural spiking coding properties. In this work, a detailed multiple-compartment PC model was used to study how slow-scale NMDARs together with fast-scale AMPA, regulate neural coding. We find that NMDARs act as a band-pass filter, increasing the excitability of PC firing under low-frequency input while reducing it under high frequency. This effect is positively related to the strength of NMDARs. For a response sequence containing a large number of regular and irregular spiking patterns, NMDARs reduce the overall regularity under high-frequency input while increasing the local regularity under low-frequency. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of NMDA receptors during high-frequency stimulation is associated with a reduced conductance of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel. Taken together, our results suggest that NMDAR plays an important role in the regulation of neural coding strategies by utilizing its complex dendritic structure.},

  abstract     = {Object recognition and object identification are complex cognitive processes where information is integrated and processed by an extensive network of brain areas. However, although object recognition and object identification are similar, they are considered separate functions in the brain. Interestingly, the difference between object recognition and object identification has still not been characterized in a way that brain–computer interface (BCI) applications can detect or use. Hence, in this study, we investigated neural features during object recognition and identification tasks through functional brain connectivity. We conducted an experiment involving 25 participants to explore these neural features. Participants completed two tasks: an object recognition task, where they determined whether a target object belonged to a specified category, and an object identification task, where they identified the target object among four displayed images. Our aim was to discover reliable features that could distinguish between object recognition and identification. The results demonstrate a significant difference between object recognition and identification in the participation coefficient (PC) and clustering coefficient (CC) of delta activity in the visual and temporal regions of the brain. Further analysis at the category level shows that this coefficient differs for different categories of objects. Utilizing these discovered features for binary classification, the accuracy for the animal category reached 80.28%. The accuracy for flower and vehicle categories also improved when combining the PC and CC, although no improvement was observed for the food category. Overall, what we have found is a feature that might be able to be used to differentiate between object recognition and identification within a BCI object recognition system. Further, it may help BCI object recognition systems to determine a user’s intentions when selecting an object.},

  abstract     = {Emotions are mental states that determine the behavior of a person in society. Automated identification of a person&#39;s emotion is vital in different applications such as brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), recommender systems (RSs), and cognitive neuroscience. This article proposes an automated approach based on multivariate fast iterative filtering (MvFIF) and an ensemble machine learning model to recognize cross-subject emotions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The multichannel EEG signals are initially decomposed into multichannel intrinsic mode functions (MIMFs) using the MvFIF. The features, such as differential entropy (DE), dispersion entropy (DispEn), permutation entropy (PE), spectral entropy (SE), and distribution entropy (DistEn), are extracted from MIMFs. The binary atom search optimization (BASO) technique is employed to reduce the dimension of the feature space. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and ensemble bagged tree (EBT) classifiers are used to recognize different human emotions using the features of EEG signals. The results demonstrate that the LGBM classifier has achieved the highest average accuracy of 99.50% and 98.79%, respectively, using multichannel EEG signals from the GAMEEMO and DREAMER databases for cross-subject emotion recognition (ER). Compared to other multivariate signal decomposition algorithms, the MvFIF-based method has demonstrated higher accuracy in recognizing emotions using multichannel EEG signals. The proposed (MvFIF+DE+BASO+LGBM) technique outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in ER using EEG signals.},

  abstract     = {Mental workload (MWL) assessment is crucial in information systems (IS), impacting task performance, user experience, and system effectiveness. Deep learning offers promising techniques for MWL classification using electroencephalography (EEG), which monitors cognitive states dynamically and unobtrusively. Our research explores deep learning&#39;s potential and challenges in EEG-based MWL classification, focusing on training inputs, cross-validation methods, and classification problem types. We identify five types of EEG-based MWL classification: within-subject, cross subject, cross session, cross task, and combined cross task and cross subject. Success depends on managing dataset uniqueness, session and task variability, and artifact removal. Despite the potential, real-world applications are limited. Enhancements are necessary for self-reporting methods, universal preprocessing standards, and MWL assessment accuracy. Specifically, inaccuracies are inflated when data are shuffled before splitting to train and test sets, disrupting EEG signals’ temporal sequence. In contrast, methods such as the time-series cross validation and leave-session-out approach better preserve temporal integrity, offering more accurate model performance evaluations. Utilizing deep learning for EEG-based MWL assessment could significantly improve IS functionality and adaptability in real time based on user cognitive states.},

Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to significant improvements in this domain. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review that covers the application of DL methods for decoding imagined speech via EEG. In this article, we survey SI and DL literature to address critical questions regarding preferred paradigms, preprocessing necessity, optimal input formulations, and current trends in DL-based techniques. Specifically, we first search major databases across science and engineering disciplines for relevant studies. Then, we analyze the DL-based techniques applied in SI decoding from five main perspectives: dataset, preprocessing, input formulation, DL architecture, and performance evaluation. Moreover, we summarize the key findings of this work and propose a set of practical recommendations. Finally, we highlight the practical challenges of DL-based imagined speech decoding and suggest future research directions.},

Therefore, understanding the associated neural pathways and mathematical underpinnings is crucial. In this article, a systematic review of the proposed neural and computational models associated with SMI is performed. While the neural models discuss the neural architecture and regions, the computational models explore the mathematical or computational mechanisms involved in SMI. The article then explores how PD may impair SMI, reviewing studies that discuss deficits in the perception of various modalities, pointing to an SMI impairment. This helps in understanding the nature of SMI deficits in PD. Overall, the review offers comprehensive insights into the basis of SMI and the effect of PD on SMI, enabling clinicians to better understand the SMI mechanisms and facilitate the development of targeted therapies to mitigate SMI deficits in PD.},

First, consensus-based adaptive Nash equilibrium seeking is studied for first-order nonlinear systems with parameter uncertainties. The case of high-order systems with mismatched parameter uncertainties and nonlinearities is then considered, and a distributed adaptive Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is designed by incorporating the celebrated adaptive backstepping technique. Under the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that the players&#39; actions can globally asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium by the proposed seeking strategies. Finally, simulation results show the validness of the seeking strategies.},

GNSS positioning relies on pseudorange measurements from satellites to receivers. A pseudorange is the apparent distance between two agents deduced from the time-of-flight of a signal sent from one agent to the other, because of the lack of synchronization between the agents&#39; clocks, it is a biased version of their distance. In this article, we introduce a new rigidity theory adapted to pseudorange measurements. The peculiarity of pseudoranges is that they are asymmetrical measurements. Therefore, unlike other usual rigidities, the graphs of pseudorange frameworks are directed. In this article, pseudorange rigidity is proved to be a generic property of the underlying undirected graph of constraints. The main result is a characterization of rigid pseudorange graphs as combinations of rigid distance graphs and connected graphs. This new theory is adapted for GNSS. It provides new insights into the minimum number of satellites needed to locate a receiver and is applied to the localization of GNSS cooperative networks of receivers. The interests of asymmetrical constraints in the context of formation control are also discussed.},

The design of efficient control policies for grid-forming inverters is, however, a nontrivial problem where multiple control objectives need to be satisfied. We consider the problem of designing a controller that achieves desirable objectives. We propose in this article a decentralized polytopic control design that yields a state feedback voltage controller that stabilizes the inverters in the presence of droop-like controllers aiming to achieve power sharing. The voltage controller is synthesized via a convex optimization problem that uses a detailed nonlinear inverter model, where the nonlinearities are taken into account via a quasi-linear parameter-varying formulation. Our control design guarantees stability and plug-and-play capability via a decentralized condition with passivity properties, and appropriate performance specifications are satisfied, including voltage tracking capability, restricted control input, and robustness to state deviations. Our approach allows using a user-defined operating point, and through the polytopic control design, it allows us to take into account the bounds on the inverter state deviations. The performance of the controller is illustrated via simulations with detailed nonlinear models in a realistic setting.},

The advantage of the controller in this article lies in its robustness against random disturbances, which unavoidably exist in real networks because of environmental changes. Moreover, the proposed ETC effectively reduces energy consumption, because it achieves the control objective using the shortest possible time without unnecessary updates of the feedback gain. First, robust synchronization is equivalently converted to robust set stabilization of an augmented PBN using the semitensor product. Second, a feasible algorithm is presented to calculate the largest robust control invariant set of a given set, based on which a necessary and sufficient condition is developed for the existence of event-triggered controllers. Then, a detailed configuration of all feasible controllers is provided by a constructive algorithm. Under some mild conditions, global controllers are designed to further reduce computation load.

Each agent only measures some signals that are linear functions of the system states or inputs, and does not know the functional form of this dependence. The proposed distributed algorithm consists of two steps that rely on the collected data: first, the identification of an unforced trajectory of the system, and second, the estimation of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the system matrix using this unforced trajectory. We show that each step can be formulated as a problem of finding a common solution to a set of linear algebraic equations, which are amenable to distributed algorithmic solutions. We prove that under mild assumptions on the collected data, when the initial condition of the system is random, the proposed distributed algorithm accurately estimates the spectrum with probability 1.},

To characterize the generation power against the fuel cost, we denote various fuel choices by segmented nonconvex costs. To help address the lack of prior knowledge of the system model, we propose a novel distributed actor–critic algorithm to find the feasible power. The algorithm combines the actor policy network with the multiplier splitting approach and projected gradient method, maps the action&#39;s policy distribution to a feasible power interval, and finally realizes real-time dispatching in continuous action space by approximating the evaluation function from the critic network. The convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by several simulations.},

A key reason for this reluctance could be the competitive advantage that comes with lax regulation. A popular platform that starts enforcing content moderation rules may fear that it could lose users to less-regulated alternative platforms. Moreover, if users continue harmful activities on other platforms, regulation ends up being futile. This article examines the competitive aspect of content moderation by considering the motivations of all involved players (platformer, news source, and social media users), identifying the regulation policies sustained in equilibrium, and evaluating the information quality available on each platform. Applied to simple yet relevant social networks, such as stochastic block models, our model reveals the conditions for a popular platform to enforce strict regulation without losing users. Effectiveness of regulation depends on the diffusive property of news posts, friend interaction qualities in social media, the sizes and cohesiveness of communities, and how much sympathizers appreciate surprising news from influencers.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate aggregative game problems in dynamic environments, where the cost functions of players change over time and are revealed gradually after players select their strategies in given strategy sets. Specifically, after selecting strategies, players observe the corresponding cost functions with feedback delays. Moreover, players receive the information of their neighbors with communication delays in weight-unbalanced digraphs. To handle such aggregative game problems, a robust learning algorithm is proposed to track time-varying Nash equilibria. The upper bounds of dynamic regrets are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. We quantify the impact of both feedback delays and communication delays on dynamic regrets and give the framework to analyze the convergence of strategies in the case of delays. The proposed algorithm achieves the sublinearity of dynamic regrets in the absence of delays. A numerical example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed learning algorithm.},

This article is devoted to address the cooperative control problem of multitrain systems with self-adjusting zones, constraints, communication delays, and collision avoidance. To enhance the rapidity of the systems, a distributed bang–bang control algorithm is introduced with communication delays. It is shown that all trains will eventually achieve stable operation with a desired velocity while remaining in the self-adjusting zones in the absence of communication delays or remaining in the neighborhood of the self-adjusting zones in the presence of communication delays. The analysis is mainly based on linear equivalent transformations of the sign functions and constraints, and the convexity of stochastic matrices. Finally, numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Numerous approaches to manage this impact have been proposed, ranging from stochastic and chance-constrained programming to robust optimization. However, these approaches either tend to be conservative or leave the system vulnerable to low-probability, high-impact uncertainty realizations. To address this issue, we propose a new formulation for stochastic optimal power flow that explicitly distinguishes between “normal operation,” in which automatic generation control (AGC) is sufficient to guarantee system security, and “adverse operation,” in which the system operator is required to take additional actions, e.g., manual reserve deployment. The new formulation has been compared with the classical ones in a case study on the IEEE-118 and IEEE-300 bus systems. We observe that our consideration of extreme scenarios enables solutions that are more secure than typical chance-constrained formulations, yet less costly than solutions that guarantee robust feasibility with only AGC.},

This article proposes two algorithms for distributed optimization problems in multiplex networks using the supra-Laplacian matrix and its diffusion dynamics. The algorithms include a distributed saddle-point algorithm and its variation as a distributed gradient descent algorithm. By relating consensus and diffusion dynamics, we obtain the multiplex supra-Laplacian matrix. We extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm for multiplex networks using this matrix and analyze the convergence of both algorithms with several theoretical results. Numerical examples validate our proposed algorithms, and we explore the impact of interlayer diffusion on consensus time.

The primary emphasis of this study is the safeguarding of power-sensitive information in the distributed economic dispatch issue prevalent in microgrids. This pursuit leads us to the development of a distributed optimization algorithm that preserves privacy, tailored for directed networks. The algorithm strives to secure a balance between supply and demand at the lowest economic cost, all while adhering to real-world constraints and maintaining the confidentiality of power-sensitive information. To fulfill this objective, we propose a novel privacy-preserving distributed algorithm that capitalizes on the inherent resilience exhibited by system dynamics toward uncertainty. Specifically, to ensure privacy preservation, we strategically incorporate randomness into the mixing weights, thereby generating a degree of uncertainty in communication messages during the initial iteration. Rigorous analysis is built to delineate that our method can achieve exact convergence and ensure the confidentiality of power-sensitive information. Further, additional numerical trials conducted on an IEEE 14-bus system substantiate the algorithm&#39;s practical efficiency.},

This framework allows us to prescribe the static-dynamic performance of the controlled system in advance. In the process of the state estimator, the communication load of multiple secondary robots is deployed in a distributed and cost-effective way. In the local controller, the tracking error is transformed and well regulated by using the newly designed prescribed-performance constrained boundary. Besides, the novel adaptive fuzzy strategy is presented to eliminate the effects of input saturation and dead zone.

Difficulty in achieving formation control is exacerbated when agents are unable to access their absolute attitudes relative to a common frame of reference, and initial attitude matrices are required to be restricted to special sets. Addressing this issue, we present a distributed fixed-time attitude synchronization law, which utilizes only relative attitude measurements to align the agents&#39; coordinate frames almost globally in finite time and locally in fixed time. The proposed law ensures the global asymptotic convergence of formation tracking error for displacement-based formation control in a leader–follower topology. We also establish global uniformly asymptotic stability for bearing-only formation tracking. A Lyapunov-based attitude estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the attitudes up to a common reference frame in finite time without using Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization. For nonholonomic agents, formation stabilization in agents&#39; local coordinate frame is studied using these attitude estimates and bearing-only measurements.

Following such adverse events, we investigate scenarios where a node of a linear network suffers a loss of control authority over some of its actuators. These actuators are not following the controller&#39;s commands and are instead producing undesirable outputs. The repercussions of such a loss of control can propagate and destabilize the whole network despite the malfunction occurring at a single node. To assess system vulnerability, we establish resilience conditions for networks with a subsystem enduring a loss of control authority over some of its actuators. Furthermore, we quantify the destabilizing impact on the overall network when such a malfunction perturbs a nonresilient subsystem. We illustrate our resilience conditions on two academic examples, on an islanded microgrid and on the linearized IEEE 39-bus system.},

Then, a suitable event-triggered adaptive sliding-mode control strategy is developed to actualize the reachability of the specified integral sliding surface, which is capable of diminishing the impacts of model uncertainties. Stochastic admissibility and strict dissipativity conditions of closed-loop fuzzy implicit Markov jump systems are derived under the framework of linear matrix inequalities.

The algorithms rely on event-driven updates in order to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage. Finally, once the algorithms converge, nodes distributively terminate their operation. We prove that our algorithms converge in a finite number of iterations to the exact optimal solution depending on the quantization level, and we present applications of our algorithms to, first, optimal task scheduling for data centers, and second, global model aggregation for distributed federated learning.

The basic underlying formulation for these problems is nonlinear and is known to be NP-hard. Our approach formulates this problem as a mixed-integer semidefinite program, later reformulated into a mixed-integer linear program for obtaining optimal solutions using cutting plane algorithms. We introduce a novel upper bounding algorithm based on the principal minor characterization of positive semidefinite matrices and discuss a degree-constrained lower bounding formulation inspired by robust network structures. In addition, we propose a maximum cost heuristic with low computational complexity to identify high-quality feasible solutions for instances involving up to 100 nodes. We show extensive computational results corroborating our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a framework to incorporate ride-pooling from a mesoscopic point of view, within time-invariant network flow models of Mobility-on-Demand systems. The resulting problem structure remains identical to a standard network flow model, a linear problem, which can be solved in polynomial time. In order to compute the ride-pooling assignment, which is the matching between two or more users so that they can be pooled together, we devise a polynomial-time knapsack-like algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. the minimum vehicle travel time with users on-board. Finally, we conduct two case studies of Sioux Falls and Manhattan, where we validate our models against state-of-the-art results, and we quantitatively highlight the effects that maximum waiting time and maximum delay thresholds have on the vehicle hours traveled, overall pooled rides, and actual delay experienced. Last, we show that allowing four people ride-pooling can significantly boost the performance of the system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address the leader-following coordination control issue for flexible manipulators modeled by fourth-order partial differential equations (PDEs) within an event-triggered communication framework. Most of the existing research on the coordination control of multiple PDE systems assumes that the communication topology is undirected and that communication between neighboring agents is continuous, leading to significant consumption of communication resources. However, in this study, the communication topology among the virtual leader and followers is described by a directed graph, where the leader&#39;s reference signal is accessible only to a subset of the followers. Moreover, an event-triggering mechanism is proposed to avoid continuous signal transmission among agents, effectively mitigating the communication burden. An adaptive boundary control scheme based on filters is designed for each following flexible manipulator to track the leader&#39;s angle and eliminate unexpected vibrations in the presence of unknown external disturbances. All the signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. Simulation results show that the presented control scheme is effective.},

Here, attack strategies against the edge measurements in power systems are provided as well to achieve a larger estimation error. Moreover, it is found that attack signals with a dependent nature perform better than the independent ones under the same stealthiness constraints. For dependent attacks, a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the unboundedness of the estimation error was obtained. Then, the problem of designing dependent attacks is further analyzed. Different suboptimal attack strategies are provided by solving nonconvex problem or transforming the nonconvex problem into a convex one. It is worth noting that all the attack signals concerned in this article are independent of real-time data of system operation, thus can be designed offline and be easier for application. Finally, simulation results are provided based on the IEEE 4-bus system to demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of theoretical results.

  abstract     = {Ambient monitoring through remote sensing is the first required step of many control operations in cyber-physical systems to enable accurate decision-making by network intelligence. We consider a controller that sends status updates about a process to a receiver, incurring a cost when doing so. The process is dynamic, implying that the information the receiver has may become outdated due to a natural drift of the process. To determine the correctness of the information at the receiver, we model this interaction using a Markov chain with two states, namely, right (R) and wrong (W). The controller can restore the receiver status to R by performing a new transmission, which comes at a cost. The staleness of information, when the system state is erroneous, is quantified through the average value of the age of incorrect information metric. Moreover, an adversary may inject false data at a price to make the information available at the receiver less fresh, which can only be contrasted by additional measurements by the controller. This results in a game played by strategic agents, namely, the controller and the adversary. The adversary&#39;s objective is to maximize the time the receiver is in the W state of the Markov chain, while the controller&#39;s objective is to minimize it. We provide a mathematical formulation of this strategic interaction using game-theory, demonstrating the existence of a Nash equilibrium. In our analysis, we discuss the role of different system parameters and the implications on the resulting system performance, providing a quantitative evaluation of the parameter ranges where an adversary can be effectively counteracted is an important guideline to improve the security of cyber-physical systems.},

In this work, we focus on constructing an abstracted system, named traffic model. This model can capture the sampling behaviors generated by a DPETC system and is equivalent to a timed automaton. During the construction, we first confine the infinite state space to a finite number of regions. Then, the interevent interval related to each region is calculated by the linear matrix inequality technique. Finally, the reachability analysis is used to locate state transitions between different regions. A numerical example demonstrates the validity of the proposed construction approach.},

Furthermore, combining the neural network approximation mechanism and the adaptive communication policy of time-varying unknown weights, a novel fully distributed adaptive cooperative–antagonistic control strategy is presented to achieve the leader-following BI-consensus.

The restriction on the switching signal is removed such that system switchings can happen more than once over each interevent interval. Then, specific iteration procedures are provided for the generator matrix in synchronous and asynchronous intervals. Solvable conditions are proposed to jointly optimize the event-triggered parameters and observer gains by constructing observer-mode-dependent radius functions. The boundedness and ${\mathcal {L}}_{\infty }$ performance are analyzed for the radius of the zonotope under restricted switchings.

Specifically, we propose a more accurate gradient evaluation method based on an unbalanced three-phase nonlinear distribution power flow model to mitigate the errors arising from linearization. The resultant gradients feature a blocked structure that enables our development of an improved hierarchical primal–dual algorithm to solve the OPF problem.

This emerging notion is of significance as it accommodates the multivariable characteristics of power networks, where active power and reactive power are inherently coupled with both voltage amplitude and phase. We propose the notion of complex-frequency synchronization to study the phase–amplitude multivariable stability issue in a power system with dispatchable virtual oscillator-controlled converters. To achieve this, we separate the system into linear fast dynamics and approximately linear slow dynamics. The linearity property makes it tractable to analyze fast complex-frequency synchronization and slower voltage stabilization. From the perspective of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization, we provide novel insights into the equivalence of dispatchable virtual oscillator control and complex-power–frequency droop control, stability analysis methods, and stability criteria.

That is, the players in each agent minimize their costs, while the players from neighboring agents go against and maximize the costs. This approach finds the Nash control solutions for players within each agent and the worst control solutions for players in neighboring agents. The asymptotic stability under mild conditions and Nash-minmax solutions are guaranteed in the games. Offline policy iteration and online data-driven off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms are proposed, with proven convergence, to compute the Nash-minmax solutions.

  abstract     = {For a system of collocated nodes sharing a time-slotted wireless channel, we seek a medium access control that provides low mean delay, has distributed control, and does not require explicit exchange of state information or control signals. We consider a practical information structure where each node has local information and some common information obtained from overhearing. We approach the problem via two steps: 1) we show that it is sufficient for the policy to be “greedy” and “exhaustive”; limiting the policy to this class reduces the problem to obtaining a queue switching policy at queue emptiness instants; and 2) by formulating the delay optimal scheduling as a partially observed Markov decision process, we show that the optimal switching rule is stochastic largest queue. Using this theory as the basis, we develop a practical, tunable, distributed scheduler, QZMAC, which is an extension to the existing ZMAC protocol. We implement QZMAC on standard off-the-shelf TelosB motes and also use simulations to compare QZMAC with the full-knowledge centralized scheduler and with ZMAC. We use our implementation to study the impact of false detection, while overhearing the common information, and the efficiency of QZMAC. Simulation results show that the mean delay with QZMAC is close to that of the full-knowledge centralized scheduler.},

Specifically, this article presents the modeling framework of the system subject to covert cyberattacks and disturbances as well as the design of dynamic observers for state estimation. The proposed scheme relies on two types of observers, namely, decentralized dynamic observer and distributed dynamic observer. Exploiting the combination of the dynamic observers, this article demonstrates how the detection and isolation of attacked subsystems are achieved. Moreover, extensive detectability analyses are provided, while also having multiple attackers and with using a reduced number of observers.

To protect the privacy of each PEV from being revealed to curious parties or external eavesdroppers, the Paillier cryptosystem-based confidential communication protocol was developed to encrypt the transmitted information. Furthermore, a novel event-triggered mechanism is developed to adjust the frequency of communication and cryptosystem execution in order to reduce the communication and computation consumption caused by the confidential communication protocol and shield the charging scheduling from the effects of DoS attacks.

In view of the fact that the system dynamics of CPSs are usually high dimensional, coupled, and unknown, this article studies the privacy enhancement of CPSs by optimizing the injection direction of artificial noises with data-driven technologies. However, as the excitation signals, artificial noises and their direction matrix are given in advance. Therefore, optimizing the noise direction matrix will lead to the re-excitation of CPSs, which is a significant challenge for the data-driven privacy enhancement. To solve this problem, a searchable virtual noise space is introduced to jointly design the controller gain and noise injection direction with the data-driven parameterization method. Then, the privacy of monitored data is optimally enhanced to prevent eavesdroppers from obtaining real data, while ensuring that the influence of the noises on the system performance remains below a specified level. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft model, and the simulation results show that the privacy of monitored data is greatly enhanced under a slight loss of the control performance.},

To be specific, this article deploys a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme to directly compute control inputs in an encrypted form without decryption, thus avoiding data eavesdropping. Note that the deployment of FHE in observer-based controllers inevitably faces challenges in handling quantization errors due to the quantization required by the encryption–decryption processes. This motivates us to propose a novel encrypted form for computations of the continuous-time controller and present rigorous stability analysis based on its virtual dynamics. Consequently, stability criteria are formulated in terms of tractable conditions associated with quantization gains and sampling intervals. Numerical results on dc motor control corresponding to several quantization gains and sampling intervals demonstrate the validity of our method.},

The proofs of the algorithm&#39;s convergence, stability, and nonuniqueness of the state reward weight are presented.

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop distributed computation algorithms for Nash equilibriums of linear–quadratic network games with proven differential privacy guarantees. In a network game with each player&#39;s payoff being a quadratic function, the dependencies of the decisions in the payoff function naturally encode a network structure governing the players&#39; interpersonal influences. Such social influence structure and the individual marginal payoffs of the players indicate economic spillovers and individual preferences, and thus, they are subject to privacy concerns. For distributed computing of the Nash equilibrium, the players are interconnected by a public communication graph, over which dynamical states are shared among neighboring nodes. When the players&#39; marginal payoffs are considered to be private knowledge, we propose a distributed randomized gradient descent algorithm, in which each player adds a Laplacian random noise to her marginal payoff in the recursive updates. It is proven that the algorithm can guarantee differential privacy and convergence in expectation to the Nash equilibrium of the network game at each player&#39;s state. Moreover, the mean-square error between the players&#39; states and the Nash equilibrium is shown to be bounded by a constant related to the differential privacy level. Next, when both the players&#39; marginal payoffs and the influence graph are private information, we propose two distributed algorithms by randomized communication and randomized projection, respectively, for privacy preservation. The differential privacy and convergence guarantees are also established for such algorithms.},

As we show, beyond certain coupling thresholds, the systems within each module synchronize rapidly with a weighted-average dynamical system that evolves more slowly than the individual systems. Then, the average dynamical systems corresponding to each and all the modules synchronize among themselves. Furthermore, we establish global asymptotic stability for the overall network under the conditions that the average dynamics admit the origin as a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium and each system be semipassive. Finally, we explore stabilization techniques that consist in controlling the average dynamics to make the origin globally asymptotically stable.},

Its novelty lies in the optimization of the performance index while ensuring constraints handling abilities on states and inputs. First, an improved discounted cost function is constructed, and the state and input constraint information are encoded into the cost function by barrier functions and nonquadratic utility functions, respectively. Then, the approximate distributed optimal containment control policy is derived by an integral reinforcement learning (IRL)-based adaptive critic design, where the IRL technique can overcome the limitation of known drift dynamics in previous results. In critic neural networks learning, the weight tuning law is presented by virtue of the concurrent learning technique, which relaxes the persistence of excitation conditions by storing appropriate historical data. In order to reduce the amount of information transmitted through the controller-to-actuator channel, a containment error-dependent dynamic event-triggered mechanism is defined. Theoretical results indicate that signals in closed-loop systems driven by event-triggered optimal controllers are uniformly ultimately bounded, and Zeno behavior is avoided.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problems of finite-time and fixed-time bipartite containment control for single-integrator cooperative-antagonistic networks with multiple leaders over arbitrary weakly connected signed digraphs. The leaders can be either stationary or evolving dynamically through interacting with other leaders in their neighborhood. Based on the nearest neighbor rule, a unified distributed nonlinear control scheme is proposed. With rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis, it is shown that under the proposed control scheme, all followers can converge toward the convex hull formed by each leader&#39;s trajectory and its symmetrical trajectory having the same amplitude but different sign in a finite time or fixed time if and only if the underlying weakly connected signed digraph contains at least one structurally balanced closed strong component. As a byproduct, necessary and sufficient criteria are established for single-integrator cooperative-antagonistic networks to achieve finite-time and fixed-time bipartite consensuses, interval bipartite consensus, and stability. The effectiveness of the presented control scheme is illustrated via simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the hybrid cooperative output regulation problem for linear multiagent systems is formulated and investigated, where both the exosystem and the agent dynamics are hybrid linear systems with periodic jumps. To solve this problem, a distributed observer approach is proposed, which consists of two steps. First, a novel output-based hybrid distributed observer is designed which can achieve distributed information estimation for various practical hybrid exosystems. Second, by incorporating a decentralized hybrid output feedback control law with the proposed hybrid distributed observer, a hybrid distributed output feedback control law is synthesized to solve the hybrid cooperative output regulation problem. In comparison with the existing works targeting purely continuous-time multiagent systems, the simplified forms for both the hybrid distributed observer and the hybrid output feedback control law proposed in this article exhibit prominent advantages from various aspects, such as robustness against intermittent communication links and the sampled measurement of system output for feedback. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is validated by solving the output synchronization problem for a hybrid electrical system made up of multiple heterogeneous RC circuits, where the capacitors are switched on and off periodically.},

For the multiagent systems under switching topologies, a second-order switched system is obtained by applying the time-varying protocol. An explicit solution of the system is presented by constructing a new nested function and a Gramian-type criterion on the controllability of the system is established. On this basis, a new nested subspace is constructed, which turns out to be equivalent to the controllable state set of the system.

Unlike traditional finite-/fixed-time convergence, the upper bounds of settling time for achieving the predefined-time PA and FS are explicit constants, which are tunable and set beforehand without depending on the network information, initial conditions, and controlling parameters. In particular, the proposed control protocols are differentiable, namely, chattering-free, which do not comprise the conventional discontinuous absolute value and/or signum functions anymore. Therefore, the undesirable chattering problem is effectively overcome. Then, in the light of the second Lyapunov method, the sufficient conditions are deduced for guaranteeing the predefined-time global PA and FS of Kuramoto-oscillator networks accordingly.

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel algorithm for solving network utility maximization (NUM) problems that arise in resource allocation schemes over networks with known safety-critical constraints, where the constraints form an arbitrary convex and compact feasible set. Inspired by applications where customers&#39; demand can only be affected through posted prices and real-time two-way communication with customers is not available, we require an algorithm to generate “safe prices.” This means that at no iteration should the realized demand in response to the posted prices violate the safety constraints of the network. Thus, in contrast to existing distributed first-order methods, our algorithm, called safe pricing for NUM (SPNUM), is guaranteed to produce feasible primal iterates at all iterations. At the heart of the algorithm lie two key steps that must go hand in hand to guarantee safety and convergence: first, applying a projected gradient method on a shrunk feasible set to get the desired demand, and second, estimating the price response function of the users and determining the price so that the induced demand is close to the desired demand. We ensure safety by adjusting the shrinkage to account for the error between the induced demand and the desired demand. In addition, by gradually reducing the amount of shrinkage and the step size of the gradient method, we prove that the primal iterates produced by the SPNUM achieve a sublinear static regret of ${\mathcal O}(\log {(T)})$ after $T$ time steps.},

The control objective is to achieve similar formation transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) while maintaining the desired formation shape. The desired formation shape is determined by a set of similarity constraints on the signed angle and the distance ratio of a pair of edges joining a common vertex. Instead of the error variables with respect to the angle or distance ratio usually used in traditional similarity-rigidity control methods, the relative position errors are obtained by the constant rigidity matrix. Once the position of each USV overlaps with the configuration of the target formation, the desired formation maneuver can be achieved. The proposed control strategy can be implemented in a local coordinate system and directed graphs without intervehicle communication.

We demonstrate that a malicious attacker can degrade system performance simply by directly injecting an inverter into the event scheduler without any system knowledge. The stealthiness of the inversion attack is quantified by two types of failure detectors. To mitigate the attack effect, we further construct an alternative estimator as a countermeasure, based on which a defense strategy is designed for systems at risk of inversion attacks.

Next, we prove that simply flying at the optimal airspeed will never lead to emergent flocking behavior and propose a new decentralized “aneroid” behavior that yields emergent V formations. We encode these behaviors in a constraint-driven control algorithm that minimizes the locomotive power of each UAV.

  abstract     = {We consider a spatially distributed demand for electrical vehicle recharging, which must be covered by a fixed set of charging stations. Arriving electrical vehicles receive feedback on transport times to each station, and waiting times at congested ones, based on which they make a selfish selection. This selection determines total arrival rates in station queues, which are represented by a fluid state; departure rates are modeled under the assumption that clients have a given sojourn time in the system. The resulting differential equation system is analyzed with tools of optimization. We characterize the equilibrium as the solution to a specific convex program, which has connections to optimal transport problems, and also with road traffic theory. In particular, a price of anarchy appears with respect to a social planner&#39;s allocation. From a dynamical perspective, global convergence to equilibrium is established, with tools of Lagrange duality and Lyapunov theory. An extension of the model that makes customer demand elastic to observed delays is also presented, and analyzed with extensions of the optimization machinery. Simulations to illustrate the global behavior are presented, which also help validate the model beyond the fluid approximation.},

For this purpose, an efficient distributed discrete-time algorithm is developed over the time-varying unbalanced graph sequence by improving the classical push–pull algorithms. Moreover, for the developed distributed discrete-time algorithm, a rigorous analysis is made of its convergence property to the optimal solution as well as its convergence rate under some standard assumptions.

  abstract     = {The attitude synchronization control problem of multiple uncertain spacecraft with event-triggered communication is an interesting research topic. However, the existing results are difficult to ensure the positive minimum interevent times (MIETs) while achieving asymptotic convergence performance. Besides, the drawback that the controllers of the spacecraft suffer from chattering may exist, due to the transmitted discontinuous neighbors&#39; states. To overcome the difficulty and drawback, two novel distributed adaptive control strategies are presented under event-triggered communication condition. Specifically, we first consider the attitude synchronization convergence. To estimate the final synchronization value of the attitude while avoiding the undesirable chattering phenomenon of the controllers, a distributed attitude filter with event-triggered state transmission is presented for each spacecraft, which can generate a continuous reference signal for each spacecraft. To ensure the positive MIETs, a novel triggering condition is designed, by resorting to a clock-like variable. Based on the attitude filter and triggering condition, a distributed adaptive attitude synchronization control scheme is presented. Then, we further generalize the design idea to consider the attitude synchronization tracking of a stationary leader, where a distributed event-triggered adaptive attitude tracking control scheme is proposed. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.},

  abstract     = {This work studies a multiagent Markov decision process (MDP) that can undergo agent dropout and the computation of policies for the postdropout system based on control and sampling of the predropout system. The central planner&#39;s objective is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the value of the expected system given a priori knowledge of the agents&#39; dropout probabilities. For MDPs with a certain transition independence and reward separability structure, we assume that removing agents from the system forms a new MDP comprised of the remaining agents with new state and action spaces, transition dynamics that marginalize the removed agents, and rewards that are independent of the removed agents. We first show that under these assumptions, the value of the expected postdropout system can be represented by a single MDP; this “robust MDP” eliminates the need to evaluate all $2^{N}$ realizations of the system, where $N$ denotes the number of agents. More significantly, in a model-free context, it is shown that the robust MDP value can be estimated with samples generated by the predropout system, meaning that robust policies can be found before dropout occurs. This fact is used to propose a policy importance sampling (IS) routine that performs policy evaluation for dropout scenarios while controlling the existing system with good predropout policies. The policy IS routine produces value estimates for both the robust MDP and specific postdropout system realizations and is justified with exponential confidence bounds. Finally, the utility of this approach is verified in simulation, showing how structural properties of agent dropout can help a controller find good postdropout policies before dropout occurs.},

Thus, a novel distributed algorithm is proposed with the masked interactive information to seek NE. Moreover, a discrete-time communication scheme is designed based on an event-triggering rule without the Zeno behavior for the multiagent noncooperative game. The accurate convergence of the designed distributed algorithm is established, rather than the bounded convergence of the differential privacy-based algorithms. The performance of the designed algorithm with communication delay is also analyzed. Cournot competition with distributed energy resources is taken as an example to verify the proposed algorithm.},

To address this challenge, a distributed event-triggered observer is proposed for each agent to estimate the upper bound of the norm of the exosystem matrix, based on which all agents can obtain the same upper bound in finite time. In particular, two types of distributed event-triggered observers are designed to estimate the exosystem matrix and the exosystem state. Meanwhile, with a clock-like variable being incorporated into the event-triggered mechanism, the existence of a positive minimum interevent time can be guaranteed for each agent. Furthermore, external disturbances with known dynamics can be compensated effectively by the proposed adaptive controllers.

The second algorithm operates over heterogeneous networks, i.e., nodes have varying processing delays and communicate in an asynchronous fashion. Our algorithms exhibit efficient communication, finite-time convergence, and operation termination after convergence, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments. We also present topological conditions under which our algorithms enable privacy preservation.

The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community&#39;s aggregate renewable generation. We also analyze the impact of exogenous parameters, such as NEM rates and OEs, on the value of joining the community.

We then formulate optimization problems for unweighted complete graphs and transcribe it to the well-known maximum $k$-cut problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we identify a special solution structure of the optimization problem, and we develop an efficient heuristic descent-based algorithm by taking advantage of this special property of the optimal solution.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of regret as a metric to model and quantify our problem, independent of any assumptions regarding disturbances. We define regret as the measure of deviation from an ideal synchronization outcome. Furthermore, we prove that the problem inherently possesses a lower bound of regret, which remains unaffected by disturbances. By appropriately setting the regret requirement, we can transform the problem into an $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ optimal control problem equivalently, which allows us to determine the corresponding synchronization strategy.

  abstract     = {Given a linear unknown system with $m$ inputs, $p$ outputs, $n$-dimensional state vector, and $q$-dimensional exosystem, the problem of the adaptive optimal output regulation of this system boils down to iteratively solving a set of linear equations and each of these equations contains $\frac{n (n+1)}{2} + (m+q)n$ unknown variables. A problem with a moderate size may entail forming and then solving a few hundreds of such linear equations. Thus, the computational cost of solving such a problem can be formidable. In this article, we first improve the existing algorithm by decoupling each of these linear equations into two lower dimensional linear equations. The first one contains $nq$ unknown variables, and the second one contains $\frac{n (n+1)}{2} + mn$ unknown variables. Thus, this improved algorithm reduces a linear equation with $\frac{n (n+1)}{2} + (m+q)n$ unknown variables to a linear equation with $nq$ unknown variables and a linear equation with $\frac{n (n+1)}{2} + mn$ unknown variables. As a result, not only the computational cost of the problem is drastically reduced but also the solvability conditions for these equations are significantly weakened. Moreover, we also apply this improved algorithm to the adaptive cooperative optimal output regulation of linear multiagent unknown systems and reduce the computational cost of the problem more saliently.},

  abstract     = {The exploding deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) brings unprecedented challenges to the optimization of large-scale power distribution networks—numerous grid-tied devices pose severe control scalability crises. Besides, the exposure of private DER data, such as energy generation and consumption profiles, is leading to prevalent customer privacy breaches. Despite the importance, research on privacy-preserving DER control in a fully scalable manner is still lacking. To fill this gap, a hierarchical DER aggregation and control framework is first developed to achieve scalability over a large DER population size. Second, a novel privacy-preserving optimization algorithm is proposed for the developed DER aggregation and control framework based on the secret sharing technique. Finally, privacy preservation guarantees of the developed algorithm are provided against honest-but-curious adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Simulations on a 13-bus test feeder demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in preserving private DER data within power distribution networks.},

The system is comprised of interconnected subsystems represented by vertices. A malicious adversary selects a single vertex on which to conduct a stealthy data injection attack with the purpose of maximally disrupting a distant target vertex while remaining undetected. Defense resources against the adversary are allocated by a defender on several selected vertices. First, the objectives of the adversary and the defender with uncertain targets are formulated in a probabilistic manner, resulting in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded. This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to dominating sets of the graph representing the network. Then, the security allocation problem is solved through a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. Finally, the obtained results are validated through a numerical example of a 50-vertex networked control system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address a composite optimization problem in a distributed network. Each agent in the network possesses a private local convex function consisting of a differentiable term, a nonsmooth term, and a nonsmooth term combined with a linear operator. The objective is to minimize the sum of all local functions while achieving consensus among the local states through information exchange with neighboring agents. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel distributed proximal alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). By introducing the proximal operator of the nonsmooth term, linearizing the smooth term, and incorporating an additional proximal term, the ADMM subproblem can be solved more efficiently. One key advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it allows each agent to select parameters without being constrained by the network topology. In some instances, the algorithm can be transformed into some classical optimization algorithms. The algorithm is further extended to an asynchronous version by introducing randomized block coordinate. We further analyze the convergence of the proposed asynchronous algorithm and establish the sublinear convergence rate under synchronous conditions. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In contrast to the classical scalar epidemic SIR model, where the infection curve is known to be unimodal (either always decreasing over time, or initially increasing until reaching a peak and from then on monotonically decreasing and asymptotically vanishing), we show the possible occurrence of multimodal infection curves in the network SIR epidemic model with $n\geq 2$ subpopulations. We then focus on the special case of rank-1 interaction matrices, modeling subpopulations of homogeneously mixing individuals with different activity rates, susceptibility to the disease, and infectivity levels. For this special case, we find $n$ invariants of motion and provide an explicit expression for the limit equilibrium point. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the equilibrium points. We then establish an upper bound on the number of changes of monotonicity of the infection curve at the single node level and provide sufficient conditions for its multimodality. Finally, we present some numerical results revealing that in the case of interaction matrices with rank larger than 1, the single nodes&#39; infection curves may display multiple peaks.},

Importantly, the underlying HMM demonstrates applicability to a broader range of scenarios than certain existing works. Furthermore, data are vulnerable to cyberattacks before being transmitted to the controller due to the open communication architecture, in which adversaries are assumed to inject false data that are capable of affecting data security. To effectively mitigate unnecessary utilization, we develop a novel dynamic event-based protocol involving dynamic threshold parameter and system modes in the feedback channel. Our methodology tackles the vulnerability of data to cyberattacks in open communication architectures, and the proposed protocol provides a feasible security solution for the hidden Markov jump systems. Eventually, the theoretical findings are demonstrated by two provided simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {It is still an open problem to output feedback stabilization with input quantizations and deception attacks for nonlinear cyber-physical systems subject to mismatched parametric uncertainties via backstepping design. This is because: first, the system contains mismatched uncertainties; second the output is corrupted by an additional attack signal, making the conventional recursive control design strategy using traditional error surfaces unsuitable; and third, since only the compromised output signal is available, the impacts of nonlinear items related to unknown attack weights become difficult to be explicitly addressed in the existing available output feedback control results. In this article, we present a solution to circumvent these obstacles by constructing a set of new $K$-filters using compromised output only, which, together with a coordinate transformation involving the attacked output and filter variables, allow a new form of state-observer-based resilient adaptive control scheme to be developed. Meanwhile, a novel compensation term is incorporated into the real controller to eliminate the effect of quantization on the system stability. It is shown that, by establishing Lyapunov functions appropriately, the original output of the system converges to zero, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded. A practice example is provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

By properly designing the network cost, it is shown that the optimal control law always exists, and the explicit expression of the optimal control gain is given.

  abstract     = {The distributed event-triggered controller is proposed for the containment control of linear multiagent systems under asynchronous denial of service (DoS) cyber-attacks and external disturbances. Using disturbance observer, event-triggered containment control under DoS attacks and disturbance is guaranteed. It is assumed that separate attacks occurred on the control channels and the communication channels. Moreover, when effective DoS attacks occur, it becomes impossible to communicate data through a communication network, and if the DoS attack is ineffective, the topology graph has a united directed spanning tree. Our method does not require the continuous sharing of state information between neighboring agents; rather, at event times, information is sent to reduce the consumption of communication resources. Using state estimators, trigger times are determined according to the estimator&#39;s data without any continuous information of the neighbor&#39;s state. Using accurate analysis of the time and frequency of DoS attacks, the resilient conditions are obtained, and then, exponential stability of containment behavior under asynchronous attacks is proved by Lyapunov analysis. Moreover, the obtained strictly positive minimal interevent time for agents prevents Zeno behavior. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is shown by simulation.},

Our findings suggest that a wide range of coupling functions can be effectively learned from just one sample trajectory in the network. This approach is practical, as it often aligns with the preference in many applications to conduct a single, extended experiment rather than repeating the same experiment under different initial conditions. Drawing on concentration inequalities for geometrically ergodic Markov chains, we present several results regarding the empirical estimator&#39;s convergence to the actual coupling function, substantiated by extensive simulations.},

To solve this problem, a novel integrated distributed control strategy consisting of a set of optimal reference generators and a group of tracking controllers is proposed. The reference generator is based on the estimation of the left eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix and is suitable for unbalanced digraphs. Moreover, the backstepping design technique is efficiently combined with the distributed optimization scheme, leading to a systematic solution for the high-order nonlinear MAS. It is proven that all the outputs of the MAS exponentially converge to the optimal solution of the resource allocation problem under the proposed control. Compared with the existing optimal resource allocation strategies for MASs, the proposed control strategy is applicable to high-order nonlinear MASs and shows favorable exponential convergence, even for unbalanced digraphs. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the above-mentioned theoretical findings.},

Subsequently, state feedback controllers are designed to address the ORP of BCNs under different scenarios. In the first scenario, ORP is addressed by developing control strategies that ensure the system&#39;s output remains within a predefined MSE threshold. In the second scenario, we focus on achieving the minimum MSE through the optimization of control strategies.

Sufficient conditions for dissipativity (specializing to, e.g., stability or $L_{2}$ gain bounds) are provided in the case that uncertainties are characterized by integral quadratic constraints. For polynomial or linear dynamics, these conditions can be efficiently verified through sum-of-squares or semidefinite programming. The performance analysis of the IEEE 39-bus power network with a set of potential line failures modeled as an uncertainty set provides an illustrative example that highlights the computational tractability of this approach; conservatism introduced in this example is shown to be quite minimal.},

A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. This model is applicable in scenarios where the opinions pertain to the usage of resources, such as money, time, computational resources, etc. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. In addition, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.},

We probe into pure bundle and mixed bundle pricing decisions for the product line and value-added services in monopolistic settings and delve into the impacts of the reference price and search cost on pricing, profit, product variety, and strategy. Based on model analysis and numerical simulations, the results show that the reference price effect benefits low-priced offerings but undermines high-priced products, overall market share, and profit. As the reference price effect or search cost increases, product variety diminishes. In scenarios where the reference price effect and the proportion of bundled purchases are minimal, the pure bundling strategy is preferable; otherwise, the mixed bundling strategy is more advantageous. When enterprises overlook the reference price effect, there is an imbalance in the pricing of various products and services within the product line, which results in the actual market share and profit consistently falling below the ideal expectations.},

  abstract     = {The graph-based multiview clustering has gained significant attention due to its effectiveness in representing complex relationships among multiview data for enhanced clustering. Among the previous graph-based methods, the multiview graph learning (or graph fusion) technique has rapidly emerged as a promising direction, which, however, still suffers from two critical limitations. First, most of previous methods adopt a single-level of graph fusion, which lack the ability to go from single-level graph fusion to multilevel (deep) graph fusion. Second, they generally focus on constructing an optimal unified graph but cannot fully investigate the correlations among multiple views. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a comprehensive and obvious graph structure. In light of this, this article presents a new multiview graph learning method called deep similarity graph fusion (DSGF) for the multiview clustering task, where three pathways are simultaneously leveraged to fuse multilevel similarity into a unified graph. Particularly, multilevel graph fusion is utilized to obtain a view-specific similarity graph for each view and then fuse these single-view graphs (via three levels of graph fusion) into a robust graph, which takes advantage of deeper consensus information between various similarity graphs and improves the quality of the learned graph for the final spectral clustering process. Extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world multiview datasets, which demonstrate the highly competitive clustering performance of DSGF in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning, as an important branch of machine learning, has been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. However, recent studies have revealed that deep learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attackers inject a hidden backdoor into the deep learning model, such that the predictions of the infected model will be maliciously changed if the hidden backdoor is activated by input with a backdoor trigger while behaving normally on any benign sample. This kind of attack can potentially result in severe consequences in the real world. Therefore, research on defending against backdoor attacks has emerged rapidly. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive survey of backdoor attacks, detections, and defenses previously demonstrated on deep learning. We have investigated widely used model architectures, benchmark datasets, and metrics in backdoor research and have classified attacks, detections and defenses based on different criteria. Furthermore, we have analyzed some limitations in existing methods and, based on this, pointed out several promising future research directions. Through this survey, beginners can gain a preliminary understanding of backdoor attacks and defenses. Furthermore, we anticipate that this work will provide new perspectives and inspire extra research into the backdoor attack and defense methods in deep learning.},

Due to users’ cognitive inertia, followers of antecedent topics tend to pay more attention to derivative topics than ordinary users, and this cognitive inertia is directly related to the correlation between these two topics. Based on this finding, we propose a derivation topic dissemination model based on iterative multitopic derivation and social psychology, taking into full consideration users’ emotional accumulation of antecedent topics and repeated derivation of topics. First, a multiple linear regression model is used to construct a metric algorithm for user antecedent sentiment and to effectively analyze the dynamics of antecedent sentiment accumulation affecting the spread of derivative topics. Second, to analyze the interactions between and within multitopic layers in full, an iterative multitopic dissemination model iterative-susceptible infectious recovery (SIR) is proposed. In addition, the association degree is introduced to define the cross-model state transition equation by considering the association and differences among multitopics. Last, considering the influence of cognitive inertia and “continuous attention psychology” in social psychology, we construct a user psychology-based driving force model which can further improve the cross-model state transition equation. According to the experiments, the model can effectively reveal the influence of different factors on the dissemination trend of derivative topics in social networks, as well as depict the dissemination dynamics of derivative topics.},

The traditional propagation model, based mainly on rumor and antirumor messages, provides a static analysis of the rumor propagation situation. This article introduces the concept of a prom-rumor (promoting rumor) message and thoroughly investigates competition and cooperation among multitype rumor messages. First, we employ a multiple linear regression method to construct the information influence mechanism by extracting network structure, topic content information, and historical behavior information, considering the complexity of spreading multitype compound rumor messages. Then, we introduce game theory and formulate a game strategy to capture the competition and cooperation among rumors, antirumors, and prom-rumors. Furthermore, we consider the interactivity in multitype compound rumor messages and combine the dynamic game to construct the driving mechanism of rumors, antirumors, and prom-rumors. Finally, we define the user-state transfer equation and propose a dynamic model of information propagation based on rumors, antirumors, prom-rumors, and the dynamic game while considering the multidimensionality and polymorphism of multitype compound rumor messages and combining mean-field theory and the infectious disease model.

However, some recommendation systems are vulnerable to shilling attacks, which create rating biases or fake reviews that will eventually affect the authenticity and integrity of the generated recommendations. This survey comprehensively covers various shilling attack methods, including high-knowledge, low-knowledge attacks, and obfuscated attacks. It explores malicious review generators that generate fake text. In addition to that, this survey covers shilling attack detection methods such as supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and hybrid techniques. Natural Language Processing techniques are also thoroughly explored for fake text review detection using large language models (LLMs). A wide range of detection mechanisms incorporated in the literature is examined, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), long short term memory (LSTM)-based detectors for rating-based shilling attacks, and bidirectional encoder representation (BERT) and RoBERTa-based detectors for fake reviews that are accompanied by shilling attacks, aiming to offer insights into the evolving methods of shilling attack strategies and the corresponding advancements in the detection methods.},

We show through the use of three continuous space games, that certain algorithmic hyperparameters are better suited to allow to agents learn altruistic behaviors. The agents learn using fuzzy actor critic learning algorithms in either a hierarchical structure or a single actor critic policy. The genetic algorithm selects the discount factors, the reward weights, and the standard deviation of noise applied to actor during learning. The genetic algorithm uses a fitness function based on the ratio of successful tests the group of agents can pass after training. This automated selection of these specific hyperparameters show that they are important for cooperation and also not trivial to select.},

However, these diffusion models are progressive and focus on the diffusion of one opinion. In this article, we introduce a general diffusion model for ordinal opinions expressed as linear orderings over a finite set of candidates. We employ agent-based modeling to simulate a nonprogressive diffusion process, allowing multiple types of opinion diffusion about different candidates. The proposed agent-based diffusion model can forecast long-term trends of opinion diffusion in social networks by capturing voters’ personalized features and incorporating dynamic social contexts. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of affecting election outcomes by externally changing the ordinal opinions of certain vertices, i.e., campaigning. Since finding influential voters from the social network is computationally challenging, we propose a heuristic approach, i.e., backward influence rank (BIR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BIR approach is superior to the classic greedy approach for campaigning by achieving a similar margin of victory to that of the greedy approach but running two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approach did.},

Numerous incidents have been reported that have resulted in a substantial loss of cryptocurrency. The existing literature in this area primarily leverages traditional feature engineering or network representation learning to recover crucial information from transaction records to identify suspected users. However, these methods mainly rely on handcrafted feature engineering or conventional node representation learning from a static network while ignoring the network dynamism and inherent temporal sparsity in the user behavior that results in underperformance after an extended period. This article proposes a novel sparsity-aware tensor decomposition-based architecture: SpaTeD, which retrieves efficient user representation utilizing the evolving transaction and structural information and subsequently mitigates the temporal sparsity problem. Our model is evaluated on a real-world Ethereum phishing scam dataset and reports a significant performance improvement over the baselines (96% recall and 96% F1-score). We have conducted an extensive set of experiments to verify the temporal robustness of the model. Additionally, we have provided the ablation study to demonstrate the contribution of each component of the framework.},

However, the overwhelming volume of conversations during such periods can escalate to unprecedented levels, necessitating the automated identification and matching of requests and offers to streamline relief operations. Additionally, there is a notable absence of studies conducted in multilingual settings despite the fact that any geographical area can have a diverse linguistic population. Therefore, we propose crisis response matcher (CReMa), a systematic approach that integrates textual, temporal, and spatial features to address the challenges of effectively identifying and matching requests and offers on social media platforms during emergencies. Our approach utilizes a crisis-specific pretrained model and a multilingual embedding space. We emulate human decision-making to compute temporal and spatial features and nonlinearly weigh the textual features. The results from our experiments are promising, outperforming strong baselines. Additionally, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset, simulating help-seeking and offering assistance on social media in 16 languages, and conduct comprehensive cross-lingual experiments. Furthermore, we analyze a million-scale geotagged global dataset to understand patterns in seeking help and offering assistance on social media.

However, the existing research predominantly focuses on platform-user interactions, often neglecting the potential for user collaboration, which is crucial for improving data quality and task efficiency. In practical applications, mobile users tend to cooperate with familiar individuals based on their preferences in sensing tasks. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel MCS model that integrates user cooperation, significantly enhancing the system&#39;s overall effectiveness. Specifically, users’ capabilities and costs are synthesized and managed through a cooperation degree matrix. Additionally, cooperation is updated based on historical behaviors and user preferences. To incentivize user participation, currencies are employed for recruitment. Within this framework, we investigate the maximum collaborative user selection (MCUS) problem, which is dedicated to the problem of maximizing the amount of recruitment under user cooperation. The MCUS problem is proved to be an NP-hard problem and thus intractable. To address this, we propose the minimum weighted cost replacement (MWCR) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the MWCR algorithm exhibits low complexity and high efficiency across various scales, making it an excellent solution for collaborative crowd recruitment.},

We apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments and emotional cues across datasets from social media and other text-based communication. Using ML, deep learning, and transfer learning models such as bidirectional encoder representations (BERTs), robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa), distilled BERT (DistilBERT), and generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding (XLNet), we assess their ability to detect early signs of mental health concerns. The results show that BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet consistently achieve over 95% accuracy, highlighting their strong contextual understanding and effectiveness in this application. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize mental health diagnostics by providing a scalable, data-driven approach to early detection.

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) theory is a promising paradigm for problem-solving in complex systems. Multigroup role assignment (MGRA) specifically tackles the task of assigning roles for multigroup collaboration. However, due to the constraint that an agent can only play a role in one group, the current MGRA models are incapable of handling when required agents outnumber the available supply. Group multirole assignment (GMRA) resolves the problem by permitting an agent to be assigned multiple roles, but it cannot address the assignment involving multiple environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, objects (E-CARGO) groups. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive overview of the GMRA problem in multiple E-CARGO groups under various conditions, generalized as the multigroup multirole assignment (MGMRA) problem. The MGMRA problem primarily revolves around two key factors: the maximum number of roles that an agent can undertake within an E-CARGO group, and the maximum number of different roles across all E-CARGO groups, which have a significant impact on the sufficiency or necessity conditions of the algorithm as well as its performance. Therefore, a unified model and its special cases are proposed to solve the concrete assignment problems under different conditions.

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has been spreading globally from 2019 to 2022, prompting many countries to establish consistent, timely, and strict intervention policies during this period. However, the existing analysis of central epidemiological parameters (CPPs) falls short in exploring the consistency of transmission laws implied by these policies. To resolve this limitation, we propose a consistent transmission law inference framework. This framework first provides a coarse-to-fine detection method to extract outbreaks and devises an autonomous inference sliding window (ASW) algorithm to estimate the infected-case-dependent CPPs of these outbreaks. Then, we reveal consistent transmission laws through a differential analysis of the estimated CPPs. Focusing on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, a typical country with a consistent intervention policy, our model reveals remarkably consistent outbreak laws. In short, the policy controls the effective growth rate almost to zero (to a 1E-03 scale) within three days since the outbreak started. Specifically: 1) the policy was very effective at the beginning of the outbreak, leading to the exposure rate hitting the bottom on one day between the second and eleventh days and then keeping it at a plateau; 2) under large-scale nucleic acid testing and contact tracking, the incubation rate decreased and reached a plateau mainly on the third day; and 3) the recovery rate fluctuated extremely little on a 1E-03 scale, showing no significant breakthrough in COVID-19 treatment that helped the policy work. Our method can be readily adapted to other countries and SEIR epidemic.},

Despite numerous approaches being developed, many existing methods rely on centrality metrics that have inherent deficiencies and limitations. These approaches face challenges such as network sparsity and ignoring relationships between distant nodes. To address these issues, this article proposes an efficient and influential node identification approach named semilocal (SL) average shortest path with augmented graph (ASPAG). We configure the average shortest path (ASP) theory with the extended neighborhood concept to address the network sparsity problem with less complexity. The aim is to develop a SL centrality metric based on ASP that can extract a local subgraph for each node in a distributed manner. ASPAG, on the other hand, uses a combined augmented graph and the SL ASP centrality metric to improve the representation of global relationships in the network and make the most of relationships between nodes that are far apart. By leveraging local topological information and incorporating additional graph structures, our method provides a comprehensive analysis of node influence. Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that ASPAG outperforms traditional centrality metrics and other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational efficiency. Specifically, ASPAG improves Kendall’s τ coefficient under the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model by 4.6% compared to the best available method.},

Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, there is a substantial amount of noise in students’ response records. These noises may amplify the inherent risk of overfitting in deep neural networks, leading to a decrease in model performance. To address these issues, we introduce a new model called filter knowledge tracing (FKT). This innovative model incorporates a learnable filter into KT to filter out noise information from students’ exercise sequences. We redefine the input paradigm of the data, using learnable filters to perform filtering operations in its frequency domain representation space, effectively removing noise. Additionally, an attention module has been introduced in the FKT model to evaluate the impact of students’ historical interactions on their current knowledge state. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments utilizing four publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that FKT outperforms existing benchmarks, particularly on larger datasets, signifying an improvement in KT performance while effectively reducing the risk of overfitting.},

However, we face significant challenges in isolated attribute manipulation and balancing the tradeoff between editing fidelity and facial identity preservation. Here, this article presents a novel approach to constructing an orthogonal decomposition subspace, enabling precise editing control over individual attributes with minimal impact on others and maintaining identity consistency. We introduce an adaptive weight modulation (AWM) method and a maximum slope truncation (MST) formula. The AWM method, founded on a sufficient convergent criterion, performs singular value decomposition to yield subspace parameters that preserve rich facial knowledge within the generative model, facilitating high-quality facial generation with reduced parameterization. This empowers meaningful semantic interpretation of attributes, supporting diverse editing tasks such as pose, age, and eyewear adjustments. The MST formula rigorously defines the editing bounds to effectively navigate the tradeoff between editing depth and identity retention. We also propose a guideline for deciphering the specific meanings of unsupervised semantics, potentially advancing interpretability in social behavioral studies. An accompanying web application, available at https://github.com/mickoluan/GreenLimeSia, has been developed, granting users the freedom to perform tailored facial edits.

  abstract     = {The devastation led by the COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a plethora of misinformation, laden with pseudoscience, hoaxes, and myths, often intertwined with hate speech. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in India, where the intricate political and communal landscape provided fertile ground. The misinformation, with its elements of hate speech, posed a significant threat to societal cohesion. In response, this article delves into the dynamics of misinformation during the COVID-19 crisis in India, with a specific focus on differentiating general misinformation (GM) from hateful misinformation (HM). To this end, we construct an Indian COVID-19 misinformation dataset collected from various online social and mainstream media and analyze it from various perspectives. Mainly, we focus on temporal evolution, content and topics involved, and emotions and sentiment sensationalism of COVID-19 misinformation. We found the emotions of sadness and fear as key amplifiers of misinformation in general, with negative sentiments dominating HM. Through our comprehensive analysis, we found many such interesting insights and patterns. We also perform hate detection within misinformation content using various unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. Our results show that while GM is relatively easier to identify, it is challenging to detect HM. Overall, deep learning models are found to be more effective than unsupervised methods. By discovering key insights and patterns, this study serves as a foundation for developing robust strategies to combat information disorder.},

The selection of a profile picture in social media is crucial as it serves as a visual representation of virtual identity. It not only reflects the user&#39;s personality but also influences the level of empathy and identification that others feel toward them. However, the potential impact of profile pictures with different styles (e.g., real faces, cartoon faces, and landscape images) on empathy and identity recognition is still unclear. To explore its effects, a controlled laboratory experiment and an ecological online experiment were conducted. Participants were shown a picture each time, informed to imagine interacting with the person using it as his/her profile picture, and instructed to rate an item from the basic empathy scale (BES) based on it. After rating all pictures, users then completed an identity recognition task. Results show that participants’ empathy scores for users with cartoon or real face profile pictures are greater than those with landscape profile pictures. In addition, participants performed better in identity recognition for users with real face or landscape images as profile pictures than for those with cartoon face profile pictures. Moreover, users of social media often make social categorizations (i.e., in-group/out-group categorization) based on the social identities expressed by their profile pictures. Our results also indicate that the affective empathy scale rating score was positively associated with the degree to which users of the corresponding profile pictures were categorized as in-group members.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is an essential technique in recommender systems that provides personalized recommendations by only leveraging user-item interactions. However, most CF methods represent users and items as fixed points in the latent space, lacking the ability to capture uncertainty. While probabilistic embedding is proposed to intergrate uncertainty, they suffer from several limitations when introduced to graph-based recommender systems. Graph convolutional network framework would confuse the semantic of uncertainty in the nodes, and similarity measured by Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence suffers from degradation problem and demands an exponential number of samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, called the Wasserstein dependent Graph ATtention network (W-GAT), for collaborative filtering with uncertainty. We utilize GAT and Wasserstein distance to learn Gaussian embedding for each user and item. Additionally, our method incorporates Wasserstein-dependent mutual information further to increase the similarity between positive pairs. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of W-GAT compared to several representative baselines. Extensive experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of W-GAT in capturing uncertainty by modeling the range of user preferences and categories associated with items.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, shared social images often contain multiple privacy subjects, and the disclosure of these privacy subjects increases the risk of privacy violations; thus, the protection of visual privacy is particularly important. However, existing means of visual privacy protection render images unavailable and are typically protected only for images with a single privacy subject. Combining compressed sensing (CS) and 2DCS, this article proposes a multilevel visual privacy protection scheme (MLVPP) via thumbnail preservation (TPE) and key sharing (KS), which includes two stages, that is, CS-TPE multilevel encryption and KS multilevel decryption. In the first stage, we utilize 2DCS to enable the compressed sampled observations to preserve the structural similarity of the nonsensitive part and leverage CS to encrypt multiple sensitive parts of the image. The CS-processed image is then made to strike a good balance between privacy and availability through TPE. In the second stage, with the help of KS mechanism, the CS encryption keys and TPE key are shared in different combinations with the users related to the privacy subjects for meeting the MLVPP requirements. The quality of decrypted images varies for different classes of related users, e.g., unrelated users, semirelated users, and full-related users. The proposed approach preserves the visual information in the nonsensitive part of the image while providing security for the sensitive parts. Compared with related works, MLVPP reveals that the PSNR of the fully decrypted image can reach 34.04, and the SSIM is greater than 0.96 at a compression rate of 0.25. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MLVPP.},

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to multiple influencing factors, its nonlinear and volatile nature, and complex interdependencies. Recent approaches have neglected the interconnections between stocks and relied on predefined static relationships. The collection of relational data is difficult to access due to confidentiality and privacy agreements for emerging economies. Moreover, these predefined relationships lack the ability to explain the latent interactions between stocks. This work proposes a data-driven end-to-end framework, dynamic relation aware relational temporal network (DR2TNet), that learns the hidden intra- and intersector associations between stock pairs and temporal patterns. A financial knowledge graph is built from historical data and is updated dynamically during the training process to reflect the interactions between the stocks according to the current market situation. We have proposed a new loss function that considers prediction loss and directional movement loss to train a model. The applicability of prediction results obtained by DR2TNet is demonstrated in the portfolio optimization problem. The results show a higher return compared to other existing baseline models.},

In particular, at the departmental level, the substance flow is primarily patient-centric, while at the hospital level, it includes orders, bills, and report flows. Interhospital scenarios may involve case flows and healthcare personnel movements. Therefore, this article proposes a healthcare system domain modeling framework based on the function-context-behavior-principle-state-structure (FCBPSS) tool, outlining its application in three hierarchical healthcare system levels. Unlike FCBPSS applications in other systems engineering fields, this framework not only captures the system&#39;s semantics but also encompasses ethical rules and operational standards within the healthcare system, making it an ideal tool for healthcare system domain modeling. Finally, the model&#39;s effectiveness is validated through the optimization of a case study at Sheng-Jing Hospital in Shenyang.},

The MultiSEAO-Mix is annotated with offensiveness, sentiment, emotion, and their respective intensities. Additionally, it is also annotated with author support. A multimodal, multitask framework is proposed that considers offensive detection, intensity prediction, and author support as the primary tasks and improves their performance using sentiment, emotion, and corresponding intensities as the auxiliary tasks. Further, we propose a fusion technique that captures the enhanced multimodal representation to improve the performance of our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multitask framework improves the model performance by more than 4.5 points compared to multitask system without sentiment and emotion as the auxiliary tasks.},

This user-generated content (UGC) serves various purposes, including user profiling, sentiment analysis, and disease detection or tracking. Notably, researchers recognized the potential of UGC for assessing mental health due to its unobtrusive and real-time monitoring capabilities. Recent reviews on depression identification from textual UGC using AI models covered tools and techniques but overlooked critical components such as datasets, lexicons, features, and subtasks, which are essential for understanding the progress and tasks undertaken. This survey adopts a systematic approach and formulates five research questions to examine the relevant literature concerning these elements. Additionally, it organizes machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) training features from textual UGC in a hierarchical manner and maps the literature on depression detection into various subtasks. The review highlights that despite the prevalence studies, datasets are limited in both quantity and size, with many relying on less reliable ground truth collection methods such as self-reported diagnosis statements (SRDS). Furthermore, the review identifies an overemphasis on certain textual features, such as n-grams and affective elements, while others, such as life events, egocentric graphs, and intervention/coping style, remain largely unexplored. It is crucial for practical AI depression detection systems to develop expertise in tasks such as severity, symptom detection, and explainable/interpretable depression analysis to instill confidence and trust among users.},

The number of individuals diagnosed with depression continues to rise each year. Currently, clinical practice relies entirely on self-reporting and clinical assessment, which carries the risk of subjective biases. In this article, we propose a multimodal method based on facial expression and pupil to detect depression more objectively and precisely. Our method first extracts the features of facial expressions and pupil diameter using residual networks and 1-D convolutional neural networks. Second, a cross-modal fusion model based on self-attention networks (CMF-SNs) is proposed, which utilizes cross-modal attention networks within modalities and parallel self-attention networks between different modalities to extract CMF features of facial expressions and pupil diameter, effectively complementing information between different modalities. Finally, the obtained features are fully connected to identify depression. Multiple controlled experiments show that compared to single modality, the multimodal fusion method based on self-attention networks has a higher ability to recognize depression, with the highest accuracy of 75.0%. In addition, we conducted comparative experiments under three different stimulation paradigms, and the results showed that the classification accuracy under negative and neutral stimuli was higher than that under positive stimuli, indicating a bias of depressed patients toward negative images. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multimodal fusion method.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of e-commerce, where online shopping has become a staple of daily life, the generation of personalized product descriptions presents a unique challenge and opportunity for enhancing customer experience. Traditional retail interactions allow for personalized communication between salespersons and customers, ensuring that consumer needs are directly addressed. This level of personalization is harder to achieve online, where customers must navigate through generic, often lengthy product descriptions to make informed purchasing decisions. Recognizing the dual necessity of personalizing content to individual preferences while ensuring the descriptions remain faithful to the product&#39;s core attributes, this article introduces a novel approach, the gated pointer-generator transformer (GPGT). This framework is designed to bridge the gap between customer preferences and product features, enabling the generation of descriptions that are not only customized to the user&#39;s interests—such as emphasizing appearance for fashion-forward individuals or functionality for tech enthusiasts—but also accurately reflect the product&#39;s distinctive qualities, including brand names and technical specifications. GPGT leverages the select-attention mechanism combined with a Transformer encoder to capture the nuanced interactions between user attributes and product features, further refined by a copy mechanism during the decoding phase for the precise inclusion of specific product-related terms. Extensive experiments show that our framework substantially improves the quality of generation ($+$10.6% on ROUGE-2 and $+$15.9% on BLEU) while being more faithful to draw people&#39;s attention. The results on human evaluation, in terms of fluency, faithfulness, and personalization, also exhibit that descriptions generated by GPGT can be better accepted by real users.},

However, due to the influence of time, space, and other factors, the problem of integrity becomes severe in the real trading environment. As the platforms, sellers, and consumers are the main participants and their decision-making is restricted by historical experiences and contextual conditions, they exhibit constrained rationality. Utilizing evolutionary game theory, the study constructs a tripartite game model that analyses the influence of relevant parameters on the behavior of the participants. To deal with the behaviors of the participants, we built a simulation system on MATLAB to demonstrate the effects of beginning circumstances and associated parameter adjustments on the evolution outcomes for participants. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation analysis, we identify that the e-commerce platforms should standardize the good faith behavior of sellers by increasing the punishment, which can reduce the malicious return behavior of consumers. Sellers can mitigate the probability of fraud by improving production technology. Consumers can improve their learning to avoid returning products. This research provides a theoretical framework and decision support for e-commerce platforms, and it also promotes the long-term growth of online transactions.},

  abstract     = {The multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) is widely used for analyzing data streams that interact with each other, where events generate new events within their own dimension (via self-excitation) or across different dimensions (via cross excitation). However, in certain applications, the timestamps of individual events in some dimensions are unobservable, and only event counts within intervals are known, referred to as partially interval-censored data. The MHP is unsuitable for handling such data since its estimation requires event timestamps. In this study, we introduce the partially censored multivariate Hawkes process (PCMHP), a novel point process that shares parameter equivalence with the MHP and can effectively model both timestamped and interval-censored data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the PCMHP using synthetic and real-world datasets. First, we illustrate that the PCMHP can approximate MHP parameters and recover the spectral radius using synthetic event histories. Next, we assess the performance of the PCMHP in predicting YouTube popularity and find that the PCMHP outperforms the popularity estimation algorithm Hawkes intensity process (HIP) [1]. Comparing with the fully interval-censored HIP, we show that the PCMHP improves prediction performance by accounting for point process dimensions, particularly when there exist significant cross-dimension interactions. Last, we leverage the PCMHP to gain qualitative insights from a dataset comprising daily COVID-19 case counts from multiple countries and COVID-19-related news articles. By clustering the PCMHP-modeled countries, we unveil hidden interaction patterns between occurrences of COVID-19 cases and news reporting.},

  abstract     = {While the development of e-commerce brings convenience to consumers, a large quantity of products and information increase the difficulty of making purchase decisions. This study constructs a classification-based product selection method driven by online reviews to assist consumers in making purchase decisions. First, the multifaceted attribute evaluations of products are extracted from textual reviews that contain more abundant and useful information than those provided by vendors. The evaluations are modeled by probabilistic linguistic term sets such that sentiment words in texts are described at different frequencies. Then, a classification-based product selection method is developed to rank products considering multifaceted attributes in which alternative products are divided into the acceptance class, rejection class, and uncertainty class through a classification strategy. Each class of products is compared based on the performance scores calculated by a probabilistic linguistic aggregation operator. A case study of selecting laptops based on real data from Amazon.com is given to illustrate the method. Comparative analysis with existing ranking methods shows the advantages of the proposed method in matching consumers’ risk aversion behavior and preserving uncertain information.},

To solve both linear quadratic regulation and tracking problems for continuous-time systems with unknown value functions, this article develops a discounted inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL) method that inherits the model-independent property of reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we first formulate a standard paradigm for solving linear quadratic control using DIRL. To recover the value function and the target control gain, an error metric is elaborately constructed, and a quasi-Newton algorithm is adopted to minimize it. Furthermore, three DIRL algorithms, including model-based, model-free off-policy, and model-free on-policy algorithms, are proposed. The latter two rely on the expert’s demonstration data or the online observed data, requiring no prior knowledge of the system dynamics and value function. The stability, convergence, and existence conditions of multiple solutions are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Acquiring optimal distributed secure control policies requires solving the game-related Hamilton-Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Based on the critic-only neural network (NN) structure, the reinforcement learning (RL) method is employed in solving coupled HJI equations. The fixed-time convergence technique is introduced to improve the convergence rate of RL, and the experience replay mechanism is utilized to relax the persistence of excitation condition. The associated NN convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed. In the attitude loop, the optimal feedback control law is obtained by solving Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equations using the fixed-time convergent RL method.

Compared to previous works on output constraints, the main challenge addressed in this article is the unavailability of the true system states during the controller design process and the nondifferentiability of the sensor’s output functions. To achieve the control objectives, the following control scheme is proposed in this study. First, a novel barrier Lyapunov function is introduced, which is specifically designed to handle systems with unknown measurement drifts. This function can be uniformly applied to satisfy both scenarios of systems with or without output constraints. Second, the adding a power integrator (AAPI) technique and dynamic surface control (DSC) techniques are enhanced to effectively handle the unknown measurement drifts and avoid singularity problems in the controller design. The decentralized controller proposed in this article can realize that the outputs are strictly constrained within predefined boundaries and guarantees convergence of all system states to an arbitrarily small neighborhood. Finally, we provide two simulation examples to validate the effectiveness of our proposed control strategy.},

It can be used to deal with the challenges coming from a stochastic controller’s switching and state signals sampled, whose results are also less conservative compared to some existing results. In order to get the best mode separation having the best performance, an optimization problem is proposed by applying an augmented Lagrangian cost function, which can ensure the existence and calculability of a locally optimal solution. Moreover, an improved hill-climbing algorithm is established to reduce computational complexity while retaining as much performance as possible, which is enhanced by applying Q-learning technique to determine an optimal attenuation coefficient.

  abstract     = {The agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem (AEOSSP) with time-dependent transition time is a combinatorial optimization challenge. Due to its NP-hardness, problem-tailored methods are sensitive to instances and require massive computational overhead. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have shown promise in efficiently addressing the AEOSSP. However, these models may make decision mistakes in specific scenarios due to prioritizing maximizing average reward expectation over individual decision accuracy during DRL training, directly leading to resource wastage. To address these issues, we propose a reconstruction model (RCM), which is a DRL-based two-stage construction model (CM), including a CM and a reconstruction mechanism (RM). RCM constructs solutions initially using a DRL-trained CM, which are subsequently refined by RM. CM utilizes a more efficient network for policy representation to make decisions. RM applies two operators, “repair” and “removal,” with a “repair-removal-repair” solution reconstruction process to identify and rectify decision mistakes from CM, offering a modular component to enhance the stability and solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RCM outperforms the state-of-the-art AEOSSP iterative search method, achieving such performance within a computational time of 0.1 s. Additionally, CM surpasses the state-of-the-art DRL policy model and RM can effectively rectify decision errors or suboptimalities, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing DRL outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to develop a foundational model capable of detecting anomalies across arbitrary categories without relying on reference images. However, since “abnormality” is inherently defined in relation to “normality” within specific categories, detecting anomalies without reference images describing the corresponding normal context remains a significant challenge. As an alternative to reference images, this study explores the use of widely available product standards to characterize normal contexts and potential abnormal states. Specifically, this study introduces AnomalyVLM, which leverages generalized pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to interpret these standards and detect anomalies. Given the current limitations of VLMs in comprehending complex textual information, AnomalyVLM generates hybrid prompts—comprising prompts for abnormal regions, symbolic rules, and region numbers—from the standards to facilitate more effective understanding. These hybrid prompts are incorporated into various stages of the anomaly detection process within the selected VLMs, including an anomaly region generator and an anomaly region refiner. By utilizing hybrid prompts, VLMs are personalized as anomaly detectors for specific categories, offering users flexibility and control in detecting anomalies across novel categories without the need for training data. Experimental results on four public industrial anomaly detection datasets, as well as a practical automotive part inspection task, highlight the superior performance and enhanced generalization capability of AnomalyVLM, especially in texture categories.

The framework integrates continuous system dynamics, used for low-level control, with discrete Markov decision processes (MDP) for high-level decision making. To capture the interactions between these domains, the decision-making system is modeled as a hybrid system consisting of a controlled MDP and autonomous (uncontrolled) continuous dynamics, collectively referred to as the hybrid Markov decision process (HMDP). The design focuses on ensuring safety and optimality by accounting for both discrete and continuous state variables across different levels. With the help of the model predictive control (MPC) concept, a decision-making scheme is developed for the hybrid model, with guarantees for recursive feasibility and stability.

Initially, the system under investigation is reformulated into a new system that encompasses both the original system state and the compromised state, enabling the use of compromised states for feedback control. Subsequently, two innovative asymptotic integral barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs) are developed by directly imposing constraints on the compromised state, thereby eliminating the necessity to convert state constraints into error constraints as required by traditional BLFs-based methods. Furthermore, controllers designed using relative/switched threshold event-triggered strategies ensure that all signals within the entire closed-loop system remain bounded, that the constant or time-varying full-state constraints are not breached, and that asymptotic stability is attained without Zeno behavior. Ultimately, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed strategies through a practical example.},

With this approach, the entire network is globally stabilized onto an objective trajectory by impulsively controlling only a small fraction of oscillators.

These criteria are easily verified and shed light on the interplay among network parameters, the percentage of controlled oscillators, impulsive intensity, and impulsive frequency.

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on solving the problem of online multiplayer differential games (MDGs) of Markov jump systems (MJSs) using a reinforcement learning (RL) method. We consider MDGs of MJSs from the following two scenarios. In the first scenario, we propose a distributed minmax strategy, where each player can derive their optimal control policy from distributed game algebraic Riccati equations (DGAREs) without prior knowledge of the policies adopted by other players, distinguishing it from existing RL algorithms. We design a novel online distributed RL algorithm to approximate the solution of DGAREs without completely knowing system dynamics and initial admissible control policy. The second scenario involves applying Nash strategy to address MDGs of MJSs. Different from existing synchronous RL algorithm, we propose a novel online asynchronous RL algorithm that employs asynchronous iterative calculations for both policy evaluation and policy improvement, incorporating the latest information into the iterative process. The convergence of the designed RL algorithms is rigorously analyzed. Finally, two inverted pendulum system applications validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

We study Gaussian process (GP) regression in two cases: 1) an offline learning-based control method and 2) an event-triggered online data-driven modeling method, to learn unknown system dynamics. Considering the computational complexity of GP regression in practical applications, we discuss the case of computational delays in real-time predictions. Moreover, we develop four theoretical criteria to ensure the probabilistic stability of closed-loop systems.

A key challenge in analyzing the SGFTS of such systems lies in the evolving integration methods caused by the impulses. To address this, we dynamically partition the semi-global attraction set (SGAS) and solve the corresponding differential equations within each subset. Additionally, by constructing the transition dynamics of impulse points and iteratively computing these points, we establish the conditions for SGFTS under both stabilizing and destabilizing impulses. For GFTS, the primary difficulty arises from the distinct trajectories and dynamics of points located inside and outside the SGAS. To overcome this, we introduce the concept of the maximum-minimum impulse interval and derive a sufficient condition that ensures the system can enter the SGAS from a distance under a finite number of impulses. Furthermore, we develop a criterion for GFTS under varying impulse degrees and provide convergence time estimation based on the research on SGFTS of NIS. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results. Notably, in Example 3, a fixed-time impulse controller is designed based on the proposed theoretical framework to achieve global stabilization of complex systems. This example highlights the potential applications of this work in the field of control.},

Note that most existing TVF controllers can only achieve formation targets under small delays, which significantly limits their performance. The proposed TVF control method in this article demonstrates remarkable robustness by effectively accommodating larger delays and additionally mitigating the impact of disturbances on MASs. On this basis, a robust TVF controller optimization scheme of MASs combined with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. Comparing the optimized results with those under conventional control methods, it has been proved that optimized controller has obvious improvement on the formation performance of MASs. Finally, the feasibility and the superiority of the developed TVF control approach are validated by a simulation of an autonomous aerial vehicle swarm system (AAVSS) composed of six AAVs.},

  abstract     = {Zeroing neural network (ZNN), as a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is very competitive in solving time-varying linear matrix-vector equations. Recently, various ZNNs with predefined-time convergence (PTC) capabilities have been reported. Such ZNNs with PTC capabilities can achieve the predefined convergence time via explicitly presetting multiple parameters related to the upper bounds of their convergence time. However, obtaining suitable and robust values for these parameters through reasonable adjustments is a challenging task in many engineering applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNN (APTC-RNN) with a novel nonlinear piecewise activation-function (NPAF). Unlike most existing ZNNs with PTC capabilities, the proposed APTC-RNN, due to its NPAF, can achieve arbitrarily PTC (APTC) without adjusting any upper bound parameters. Furthermore, due to the piecewise computation form of the NPAF, the proposed APTC-RNN can provide a lower computational cost compared to most existing RNNs. The stability and APTC capability of the proposed APTC-RNN are proven by rigorous theoretical analysis and mathematical derivation. Numerical simulations show that APTC-RNN has faster and more accurate PTC capability than three state-of-the-art RNNs, while having less computational time. Finally, the practicality of the APTC-RNN is verified by applying it to the UR3 robotic arm and multiagent systems.},

This area has garnered significant research interest due to its extensive applications in robotics, particularly concerning household robots. Nevertheless, the majority of task planning methodologies exhibit suboptimal performance regarding the success and efficiency of completing household tasks, primarily due to a lack of cognitive capacity of household items and home environments. To address these challenges, we propose an efficiency-driven adaptive task planning approach based on hierarchical item-environment cognition. Initially, we establish a multiple semantic attribute-based priori knowledge (MSAPK) framework to facilitate the attributive representation of household items. Utilizing MSAPK, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) based item cognition model that assigns relevant attributes and substitutes to specified household items, thereby enhancing the cognitive capabilities of household robots at the attribute level. Subsequently, we construct an environment cognition model that delineates the relationships between household items and room types, enabling household robots to locate target items more efficiently. Through hierarchical item-environment cognition, we introduce a strategy for adaptive task planning, empowering household robots to execute household tasks with both flexibility and efficiency. The generated plans are evaluated in both virtual and real-world experiments, with promising results affirming the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet, multisource information fusion has become a forefront issue due to its ability to merge different information. Granular computing (GrC), as a methodology simulating human hierarchical cognition, provides a new approach for multisource information fusion. However, on one hand, the existing information fusion studies in GrC all focus on feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion based on multisource data, neglecting the basic characteristics and advantages of GrC: granulation. On the other hand, the existing methods for fusing the knowledge spaces in GrC suffer from losing the necessary information or artificially adding information. In order to address these issues, a novel information fusion mode from the perspective of GrC is proposed in this article, named knowledge-level fusion. First, by introducing a new step, that is, granulate data to construct the knowledge space, into the multisource information fusion process, the knowledge-level fusion mode is proposed. Second, the optimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus and information gap of multisource knowledge spaces in the static data environment. The pessimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus in the dynamic data environment. Related theorems are given to describe the characteristics of the core quotient spaces. Then, the knowledge-level fusion method driven jointly by the data space and the knowledge space is introduced based on the principle of extracting the core quotient space first and then allocating other objects in the candidate set. On the basis, the superiority of the proposed method over the existing methods is demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Finally, experiments on 12 UCI datasets and three UKB datasets are carried out to verify the promoting effect on classification and clustering algorithms, the effectiveness compared to feature-level and decision-level fusion modes, efficiency and statistical significance of the proposed knowledge-level fusion method and mode.},

The problem is complicated by random state dropouts occurring in two crucial scenarios: 1) the reception of the target’s state and 2) feedback of the controlled system’s states. Our approach enables the controlled system to infer the target’s cost function and optimal control policy, thereby facilitating effective tracking. Specifically, we develop a model-based IRL algorithm that integrates the Smith predictor for state estimation. Then, we advance a state-dropout-aware inverse Q-learning algorithm that uses solely accessible system data, eliminating the need for system models.

  abstract     = {Determining the optimal number of clusters in cluster analysis without prior knowledge remains a critical and challenging task. Existing methods often depend on calculating clustering validity indices (CVIs), which increases complexity and may reduce efficiency. Furthermore, different CVIs frequently suggest varying optimal cluster numbers, complicating the selection process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, self-regulating possibilistic C-means (PCM) with high-density points (SR-PCM-HDP), which simplifies cluster number determination while improving clustering efficiency. First, the density-based knowledge extraction (DBKE) method is introduced to estimate an appropriate initial cluster number and identify high-density points. DBKE enhances the density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm by removing the need for a predefined density radius. Second, SR-PCM-HDP refines the clustering process by incorporating a parameter to balance the interactions between high-density points and cluster centers, reducing sensitivity to initial configurations and accelerating convergence. Third, the parameter adjustment mechanism in classical PCM is redefined to enable adaptive updates during SR-PCM-HDP iterations. This mechanism facilitates the gradual elimination of obsolete clusters and iterative cluster formation. The theoretical foundations of the SR-PCM-HDP cluster elimination mechanism are rigorously established. Experimental results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of SR-PCM-HDP in determining cluster numbers and ensuring clustering validity, particularly for datasets with overlapping or imbalanced distributions. Comparisons are conducted against 13 state-of-the-art algorithms, including fuzzy clustering, possibilistic clustering, and CVI-based cluster determination methods.},

Initially, a mapping function is designed to map the state and control of the USV into a safe environment. Subsequently, IRL-based coupled Hamilton-Jacobi equations, which avoid dependence on system dynamics, are derived to solve the Nash equilibrium. To conserve computational resources and reduce network transmission burdens, a static event-triggered control is initially designed, followed by the development of a more flexible dynamic form. Finally, a critic neural network is designed for each player to approximate its value function and control policy. Rigorous proofs are provided for the uniform ultimate boundedness of the state and the weight estimation errors. The effectiveness of the present method is demonstrated through simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {This brief presents an adaptive neural zeta-backstepping control strategy for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems, which allows these systems to be practically stabilized with predefined damping ratios. By introducing the zeta-backstepping technique, system damping ratios can be predetermined based on specific parameter selection rules. To reduce the impact of unknown nonlinearities, neural networks (NNs) with gradient descent training are applied to compensate such nonlinearities online. A new filter, called dynamic command filter, is used to construct the gradient of the NNs. By resorting to second-order Lyapunov stability criteria, it is proved that the closed-loop system is practically stable and has predefined damping ratio. Finally, experiments on a perturbed direct current (DC) motor system demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and robust data clustering remains a challenging task in data analysis. Recent efforts have explored the integration of granular-ball (GB) computing with clustering algorithms to address this challenge, yielding promising results. However, existing methods for generating GBs often rely on single indicators to measure GB quality and employ threshold-based or greedy strategies, potentially leading to GBs that do not accurately capture the underlying data distribution. To address these limitations, this article leverages the principle of justifiable granularity (POJG) to measure the quality of a GB for clustering tasks and introduces a novel GB generation method, termed GB-POJG. Specifically, a comprehensive metric integrating the coverage and specificity of a GB is introduced to assess GB quality. Utilizing this quality metric, GB-POJG incorporates a strategy of maximizing overall quality and an anomaly detection method to determine the generated GBs and identify abnormal GBs, respectively. Compared to previous GB generation methods, GB-POJG maximizes the overall quality of generated GBs while ensuring alignment with the data distribution, thereby enhancing the rationality of the generated GBs. Experimental results obtained from both synthetic and publicly available datasets underscore the effectiveness of GB-POJG, showcasing improvements in clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information.

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is a significant research topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but it becomes complicated in the high dimensional search space due to the vast number of features. Evolutionary computation (EC) has been widely used in solving FS by modeling it as an expensive wrapper-form optimization task, where a classifier is used to obtain classification accuracy for fitness evaluation (FE). In this article, we propose that the FS problem can be also modeled as a cheap filter-form optimization task, where the FE is based on the relevance and redundancy of the selected features. The wrapper-form optimization task is beneficial for classification accuracy while the filter-form optimization task has the strength of a lighter computational cost. Therefore, different from existing multitask-based FS that uses various wrapper-form optimization tasks, this article uses a multiform optimization technique to model the FS problem as a wrapper-form optimization task and a filter-form optimization task simultaneously. An evolutionary multitask FS (EMTFS) algorithm for parallel tacking these two tasks is proposed followed by, in which a two-channel knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to transfer positive knowledge across the two tasks. Experiments on widely used public datasets show that EMTFS can select as few features as possible on the premise of superior classification accuracy than the compared state-of-the-art FS algorithms.},

Inspired by the idea of deep learning, those basic latent variable models have been extended to deep forms, based on which the quality prediction performance has been significantly improved. However, different latent variable models have their own strengths and weaknesses, a model works well under one scenario might not provide satisfactory performance under another. The motivation of this article is based on the viewpoint of information fusion and ensemble learning for heterogeneous latent variable models. Particularly, a collaborative deep learning and model fusion framework is formulated for the purpose of industrial quality prediction. In the first stage of the framework, collaborative layer-by-layer feature extractions are implemented among different latent variable models, through which different patterns of latent variables are identified in different layers of the deep model. Then, in the second stage, an ensemble regression modeling strategy is proposed to fuse the quality prediction results from different latent variable models, which is based on a well-designed data description method. Two real industrial examples are used for performance evaluation of the proposed method, based on which we can observe that information fusions in terms of both collaborative layer-by-layer feature extraction and heterogeneous model ensemble have positive effects in improving prediction accuracy and stability.},

From a centralized perspective, we first develop a controller with adaptive control gains to guide the output of a double-integrator system toward the time-varying optimal solution. By employing the modified average estimators, we extend the centralized design to a distributed implementation to address the OOSP for uncertain EL systems. Using matrix trace properties and composite Lyapunov analysis, we prove that the system outputs can asymptotically converge to the desired time-varying optimal solution.

Building on these systems, an enhanced fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode (NITSM) surface and a new virtual control law are designed, respectively. Next, a novel saturated adaptive fuzzy fixed-time NITSM controller is proposed, circumventing the restrictions on uncertainties and input saturation in the existing results. The proposed controller ensures that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed time. Furthermore, to facilitate the adaptive fixed-time stability analysis, two new inequalities are established and rigorously proved. Using the two inequalities, the fixed-time stability of closed-loop systems is demonstrated by the Lyapunov’s theory. Finally, representative numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Discovering clusters remains challenging when dealing with complex data structures, including those with varying densities, arbitrary shapes, weak separability, or the presence of noise. In this article, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called representative point-based clustering with neighborhood information (RPC-NI), which highlights the significance of neighborhood information often overlooked by existing clustering methods. The proposed algorithm first introduces a new local centrality metric that integrates both neighborhood density and topological convergence to identify core representative points, effectively capturing the structural characteristics of the data. Subsequently, a density-adaptive distance is defined to evaluate dissimilarities between these core representative points, and such distance is used to construct a minimum spanning tree (MST) over these points. Finally, an MST-based clustering algorithm is employed to yield the desired clusters. Incorporating neighborhood information enables RPC-NI to comprehensively determine representative points, and having multiple representative points per cluster allows RPC-NI to adapt to clusters of arbitrary shapes, varying densities, and different sizes. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that RPC-NI outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy and robustness. These results provide further evidence for the importance of incorporating neighborhood information discovering clusters with complex structures.},

Additionally, several rigorous proofs are provided for the conclusions that all efficient paths could be found within a tolerable time by the developed algorithm and the algorithm could be implemented in a distributed manner under mild assumptions.

Existing gaze or gesture-based interaction systems are often constrained by their dependence on continuous visual engagement, limited interaction surfaces, or cumbersome hardware. To address these challenges, we propose MetaSkin, a novel neurohaptic interface that uniquely integrates neural signals with on-skin interaction for bare-handed, eyes-free interaction by exploiting human’s natural proprioceptive capabilities. To support the interface, we developed a deep learning framework that employs multiscale temporal-spectral feature representation and selective feature attention to effectively decode neural signals generated by on-skin touch and motion gestures. In experiments with 12 participants, our method achieved offline accuracies of 81.95% for touch location discrimination, 71.00% for motion type identification, and 46.08% for 10-class touch-motion classification. In pseudo-online settings, accuracies reached 99.43% for touch onset detection, and 80.34% and 67.02% for classification of touch location and motion type, respectively. Neurophysiological analyses revealed distinct neural activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, underscoring the efficacy of our multiscale approach in capturing rich temporal and spectral dynamics. Future work will focus on optimizing the system for diverse user populations and dynamic environments, with a long-term goal of advancing human-centered, neuroadaptive interfaces for next-generation HMI systems. This work represents a significant step toward a paradigm shift in design of brain-computer interfaces, bridging sensory and motor paradigms for building more sophisticated systems.},

In this article, we first define fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) with single and continuous support; and consider TSK-FIS with a grid partition strategy for computing its firing strengths with product T-norm (here after denoted as TSK-FIS-product). We also define a more general joint necessary condition, whereby each constituent itself is a necessary condition for the TSK-FIS-product model. The first necessary condition indicates that the normalized firing strength must not be indeterminate (i.e., 0/0), i.e., susceptible to the tomato classification problem. The second necessary condition indicates that all restricted consequents of fuzzy if-then rules must be defined. Based on the principle of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator as well as the concept of increasing orness in OWA and hyperboxes, a general joint sufficient condition for a TSK-FIS-product model to be monotone is derived. Three case studies of the developed methods for undertaking failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and image processing tasks are presented. The results are compared, analyzed, and discussed, demonstrating the usefulness of our developed methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiview semi-supervised learning is a popular research area in which people utilize cross-view knowledge to overcome the limitation of labeled data in semi-supervised learning. Existing methods mainly utilize deep neural network, which is relatively time-consuming due to the complex network structure and back propagation iterations. In this article, co-training broad Siamese-like network (Co-BSLN) is proposed for coupled-view semi-supervised classification. Co-BSLN learns knowledge from two-view data and can be used for multiview data with the help of feature concatenation. Different from existing deep learning methods, Co-BSLN utilizes a simple shallow network based on broad learning system (BLS) to simplify the network structure and reduce training time. It replaces back propagation iterations with a direct pseudo inverse calculation to further reduce time consumption. In Co-BSLN, different views of the same instance are considered as positive pairs due to cross-view consistency. Predictions of views in positive pairs are used to guide the training of each other through a direct logit vector mapping. Such a design is fast and effectively utilizes cross-view consistency to improve the accuracy of semi-supervised learning. Evaluation results demonstrate that Co-BSLN is able to improve accuracy and reduce training time on popular datasets.},

In this article, we introduce a novel learning-based method for event-triggered model predictive control with initially unknown dynamics. The formulation of optimal control problems (OCPs) is based on predictive states derived from Gaussian process (GP) regression under terminal constraints. The event-triggered condition proposed in this article is derived from the recursive feasibility, so that the OCPs are solved only when an error between the predictive and the actual states exceeds a certain threshold. This article analyzes the convergence of the closed-loop system under the event-triggered condition, demonstrating that the system’s state will enter the terminal set within a finite time, assuming small-enough uncertainty in the GP model. We validate this approach through a tracking control problem, illustrating its practical effectiveness.},

A new variant of IM, fair IM (FIM), which primarily enhances the fair propagation of information, has attracted increasing attention in academia. However, existing algorithms for FIM suffer from a trade-off between fairness and running time, as it is difficult to ensure that users are fairly influenced in terms of sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, while maintaining a high influence spread. To tackle this problem, herein, we propose an effective and efficient community-based evolutionary algorithm for FIM (named CEA-FIM). In CEA-FIM, a community-based node selection strategy is proposed to identify potential nodes, which not only considers the size of the community but also the attributes of the nodes in the community. Subsequently, we designed an evolutionary algorithm based on the proposed node selection strategy to hasten the solution search, including the novel initialization, crossover, and mutation strategies. We validated the proposed algorithm by performing experiments on real-world and synthetic networks. The experimental results show that the proposed CEA-FIM achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency than state-of-the-art methods do.},

  abstract     = {Ising machines are next-generation computers expected to efficiently sample near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Combinatorial optimization problems are modeled as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems to apply an Ising machine. However, current state-of-the-art Ising machines still often fail to output near-optimal solutions due to the complicated energy landscape of QUBO problems. Furthermore, the physical implementation of Ising machines severely restricts the size of QUBO problems to be input as a result of limited hardware graph structures. In this study, we take a new approach to these challenges by injecting auxiliary penalties preserving the optimum, which reduces quadratic terms in QUBO objective functions. The process simultaneously simplifies the energy landscape of QUBO problems, allowing the search for near-optimal solutions, and makes QUBO problems sparser, facilitating encoding into Ising machines with restriction on the hardware graph structure. We propose linearization of QUBO problems using variable posets as an outcome of the approach. By applying the proposed method to synthetic QUBO instances and to multi-dimensional knapsack problems, we empirically validate the effects on enhancing minor-embedding of QUBO problems and the performance of Ising machines.},

Edge clouds place computing and service capabilities at the network edges to reduce network transmission overhead, which has been widely recognized as the critical infrastructure for AIoT applications. Meanwhile, to accelerate computation-intensive edge cloud AI operations, specialized AI accelerators such as GPU, NPU, and TPU have been increasingly integrated into edge clouds. For such emerging XPU edge clouds, utilizing costly XPUs more efficiently has become a significant challenge. In this paper, we present an online optimization framework for joint resource provisioning and batch scheduling for more cost-efficient AIoT inference serving in an XPU edge cloud. The essential optimization process for the online framework is to first adaptively batch inference tasks to increase the system throughput without compromising the service level agreement (SLA). Next, heterogeneous XPU resources are provisioned for the batches. Finally, the resource instance is consolidated to a minimum of physical servers. Via extensive trace-driven simulations, we verify the performance of the presented online optimization framework.},

We also propose a “low-light image-detail-recovery network” to enhance the boundary details of low-light images after removing glare to further improve image quality. The experimental results show that our proposed approaches can effectively improve low-light image quality.

This is expected to avoid building and maintaining reduplicative predictive models. The fundamental challenge, however, is the detection of reusable tasks and tuning models in order to improve predictive capacity while being reused. We introduce a two-phase Distributed Multi-task Machine Learning (DMtL) framework coping with this challenge. In the first phase, similar tasks are identified and efficiently grouped together according to locally trained models’ performance meta-features, using Partial Learning Curves (PLC). In the subsequent phase, we leverage the PLC-driven DMtL paradigm to boost the performance of candidate reusable models per group of tasks in distributed computing environments. We provide a thorough analysis of our framework along with a comparative assessment against relevant approaches and prior work found in the respective literature.

However, they often require a large number of labeled data for training. To directly tackle this challenge, this paper proposes SelfVis, a novel visualization-based self-supervised learning technique, which aims to extract effective features without the need of labeled data. To achieve this goal, it encodes time-series IMU sensor readings into images and then employs ResNet, a pre-trained, state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone feature extractor. It leverages the fact that there exist multiple sensors often being used and uses sensor identifications that are generated automatically as a prediction target during the self-supervised learning process. With these two, SelfVis has achieved high activity recognition accuracy even when only a small number of labeled data are available; that is, with only 1% training data, SelfVis has demonstrated the ability to achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art techniques by up to 0.46 in macro F1-scores.},

The new design structure that we use is called the substitution convolution network. The novelty of the approach lies in that the substitution function does not use fixed S-boxes. Instead, it uses a key-driven lookup table storing a permutation of all 8-bit values. If the lookup table is sufficiently randomly shuffled, the round sub-operations achieve good confusion and diffusion to the cipher. While designing the cipher, the security, cost, and performances are balanced, keeping the requirements of encryption of data-at-rest in mind. The round sub-operations are massively parallelizable and designed such that a single active bit may make the entire state (an $8 \times 16$ binary matrix) active in one round. We analyze the security of the cipher against linear, differential, and impossible differential cryptanalysis. The cipher&#39;s resistance against many other attacks like algebraic attacks, structural attacks, and weak keys are also shown. We implemented the cipher in software and hardware; found that the software implementation of the cipher results in better throughput than many well-known ciphers. Although HARPOCRATES is appropriate for the encryption of data-at-rest, it is also well-suited in data-in-transit environments.},

  abstract     = {As spiking neural networks (SNNs) are event-driven, energy efficiency is higher than conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Since SNN delivers data through discrete spikes, it is difficult to use gradient methods for training, limiting its accuracy. To keep the accuracy of SNNs similar to ANN counterparts, pre-trained ANNs are converted to SNNs (ANN-to-SNN conversion). During the conversion, encoding activations of ANNs to a set of spikes in SNNs is crucial for minimizing the conversion loss. In this work, we propose a single-spike phase coding as an encoding scheme that minimizes the number of spikes to transfer data between SNN layers. To minimize the encoding error due to single-spike approximation in phase coding, threshold shift and base manipulation are proposed. Without any additional retraining or architectural constraints on ANNs, the proposed conversion method does not lose inference accuracy (0.58% on average) verified on three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. In addition, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are converted to SNNs successfully with an average accuracy loss of 0.90%. Most importantly, the energy efficiency of our SNN improves by 4.6$\sim\!\! 17.3\times$ compared to the ANN baseline.},

  abstract     = {Star networks play an essential role in designing parallel and distributed systems. With the massive growth of faulty edges and the widespread applications of the longest paths and cycles, it is crucial to embed the longest fault-free paths and cycles in edge-faulty networks. However, the traditional fault model allows a concentrated distribution of faulty edges and thus can only tolerate faults that depend on the minimum degree of the network vertices. This article introduces an improved fault model called the partitioned fault model, which is an emerging assessment model for fault tolerance. Based on this model, we first explore the longest fault-free paths and cycles by proving the edge fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceability, edge fault-tolerant strongly Hamiltonian laceability, and edge fault-tolerant Hamiltonicity in the $n$-dimensional star network $S_{n}$. Furthermore, based on the theoretical proof, we give an $O(nN)$ algorithm to construct the longest fault-free paths in star networks based on the partitioned fault model, where $N$ is the number of vertices in $S_{n}$. We also make comparisons to show that our result of edge fault tolerance has exponentially improved other known results.},

  abstract     = {Face-swap DeepFake is an emerging AI-based face forgery technique that can replace the original face in a video with a generated face of the target identity while retaining consistent facial attributes such as expression and orientation. Due to the high privacy of faces, the misuse of this technique can raise severe social concerns, drawing tremendous attention to defend against DeepFakes recently. In this article, we describe a new proactive defense method called FakeTracer to expose face-swap DeepFakes via implanting traces in training. Compared to general face-synthesis DeepFake, the face-swap DeepFake is more complex as it involves identity change, is subjected to the encoding-decoding process, and is trained unsupervised, increasing the difficulty of implanting traces into the training phase. To effectively defend against face-swap DeepFake, we design two types of traces, sustainable trace (STrace) and erasable trace (ETrace), to be added to training faces. During the training, these manipulated faces affect the learning of the face-swap DeepFake model, enabling it to generate faces that only contain sustainable traces. In light of these two traces, our method can effectively expose DeepFakes by identifying them. Extensive experiments corroborate the efficacy of our method on defending against face-swap DeepFake.},

In this regard, neuromorphic engineering focuses on mimicking the basic principles that govern the brain in order to develop systems that achieve such computational capabilities. Within this field, bio-inspired learning and memory systems are still a challenge to be solved, and this is where the hippocampus is involved. It is the region of the brain that acts as a short-term memory, allowing the learning and storage of information from all the sensory nuclei of the cerebral cortex and its subsequent recall. In this work, we propose a novel bio-inspired hippocampal memory model with the ability to learn memories, recall them from a fragment of itself (cue) and even forget memories when trying to learn others with the same cue. This model has been implemented on SpiNNaker using Spiking Neural Networks, and a set of experiments were performed to demonstrate its correct operation. This work presents the first simulation implemented on a special-purpose hardware platform for Spiking Neural Networks of a fully functional bio-inspired spike-based hippocampus memory model, paving the road for the development of future more complex neuromorphic systems.},

Furthermore, for the three-tier architecture, a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme without a trusted authority is proposed by adopting fog computing, permissioned blockchain, Paillier homomorphic encryption system, and Goldwasser-Micali cryptosystems. This scheme can realize range query in batch, while it can also protect privacy and resist collusion attack.

In this research, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework called Intelligent Tumor Analytics (ITA). ITA facilitates on-the-fly assessment of Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) at the histopathological level, primarily utilizing cellular appearance, spatial arrangement, and the relative proximities of various cell types (e.g., tumor cells, immune cells, and other objects of interest) observed within scanned WSI images of tumors. By automatically quantifying relevant indicators and estimating their scores, ITA establishes a standardized evaluation that aligns with widely recognized international tumor grading standards, including the TNM and Nottingham Grading Standards. The objective measurements and assessments offered by ITA provide informative and unbiased insights to users (i.e., pathologists) involved in determining prognosis and treatment plans. The quantified information regarding tumor risk and potential for further metastasis possibilities serves as crucial early knowledge during cancer development.},

A prior study demonstrated that integrating machine learning with sonification—an interpretation method that converts bio-signals into sound—can mitigate the black-box problem while enhancing seizure detection performance. This AI-assisted sonification algorithm can provide a valuable complementary tool in seizure monitoring besides the traditional visualization method. A low-power and affordable implementation of the algorithm is presented in this study using a microcontroller. To improve its practicality, we also introduce a real-time design that allows the sonification algorithm to function in parallel with data acquisition.

Our study introduces a novel robust aggregation mechanism utilizing the Fourier Transform (FT), which is able to effectively handle sophisticated attacks without prior knowledge of the number of attackers. Employing this data technique, weights generated by FL clients are projected into the frequency domain to ascertain their density function, selecting the one exhibiting the highest frequency. Consequently, malicious clients’ weights are excluded.

Developing modular solutions that can be leveraged by the vast majority of FL structures and are independent of the application people use is the new research direction opened by this paper. In this work, we propose a plugin (named FedPredict) to address three problems simultaneously: data heterogeneity, low performance of new/untrained and/or outdated clients, and communication cost. We do so mainly by combining global and local parameters (which brings generalization and personalization) in the inference step while adapting layer selection and matrix factorization techniques to reduce the downlink communication cost (server to client). Due to its simplicity, it can be applied to federated learning of different number of topologies. Results show that adding the proposed plugin to a given FL solution can significantly reduce the downlink communication cost by up to 83.3% and improve accuracy by up to 304% compared to the original solution.},

First, it presents a novel performance assessment approach designed explicitly for constrained multiobjective optimization. This methodology offers a first attempt at simultaneously measuring the performance in approximating the Pareto front and constraint satisfaction. Second, it proposes an approach to measure the capability of the given optimization problem to differentiate among algorithm performances. Finally, this approach is used to compare eight frequently used artificial test suites of CMOPs.

  abstract     = {Many nature-inspired metaheuristics have been published, with claims of originality based on the metaphor that inspired the algorithm. Rarely is empirical evidence given to show algorithmic originality. In order to provide an easy and computationally cheap approach to characterize algorithm search behavior, a suite of 20 behavioral characteristics is proposed. This behavioral characteristic suite allows for the search behavior of an algorithm to be quantified without manual inspection. By doing so, behavioral novelty of any given algorithm may be determined by comparing the behavioral characteristics to those of well-known metaheuristics. To illustrate this use, and to evaluate whether metaheuristics are behaviorally distinct, a host of metaheuristics is run on various benchmark functions. To evaluate behavioral similarity across all problems, while acknowledging behavior to be problem dependant, a novel method is proposed. In addition to this method, new behavioral characteristics are also proposed. The behavioral vectors generated for each benchmark function are clustered. The relationships and trends present in the different clusters are summarized by creating a pair-wise matrix for every metaheuristic pair, which tallies the number of times that the pair are found within the same cluster. The tallies are then analyzed in order to make inference regarding the distinctness of any metaheuristic’s behaviors, across many different benchmark functions. The analysis finds that the range of unique search behaviors is small and that most metaheuristics share their behaviors with most other metaheuristics. The analysis also identifies both unique algorithms, as well as algorithms which have no unique behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Due to the curse of dimensionality, the search efficiency of existing operators in large-scale decision space deteriorates dramatically. The competitive swarm optimizer (CSO)-based framework has great potential in tackling large-scale single-objective optimization problems. However, the existing CSOs only focus on the loser to winner learning paradigm and neglect the significance of the winner determination mechanism for large-scale search, which makes the algorithm difficult to escape from local optima. To remedy this issue, a flexible ranking-based CSO has been tailored for handling large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Concretely, a novel winner determination strategy is introduced to broadly identify high-quality individuals in the population to enhance diversity maintenance. In addition, a special competitive mechanism is adopted to guide the search direction, which is capable of efficiently increasing search space utilization. The simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the exploration and exploitation ability of the conventional CSO, and outperforms several state-of-the-art large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithms on both large-scale benchmark MOPs and application examples.},

Additionally, the growing consideration about realistic constraints, such as transportation time and finite transportation resources, has made the scheduling problem increasingly complex. Facing these challenges, special mechanisms are required to improve the efficiency of solving algorithms. In this article, a bi-learning evolutionary algorithm (BLEA) is proposed to solve the distributed energy-efficient flexible job shop problem with transportation constraints (DEFJSP-T). First, we integrate statistical learning (SL) and evolutionary learning (EL) in the framework, while decomposition and Pareto dominance methods are employed in different stages to handle conflicting objectives. During the SL stage, probability models are established to statistically search for advantageous substructures on each weight vector, and an update mechanism is devised to improve the exploration. In the EL stage, the genetic operators are introduced and an improved local search that takes into account the problem properties is proposed to realize sufficient exploitation. Finally, according to the performance of the SL, a novel switching mechanism between SL and EL is designed to ensure the rational allocation of computing resources. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the performances of the BLEA. The statistical comparison shows that the BLEA is superior in solving the DEFJSP-T in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.},

Flow control operations are crucial in concisely describing complex knowledge of dispatching rules, such as different dispatching rules in different conditions. However, existing linear genetic programming (LGP) methods for DJSS have not fully considered the use of flow control operations. They simply included flow control operations in their primitive set, which inevitably leads to a huge number of redundant and obscure solutions in LGP search spaces. To move one step toward evolving effective and interpretable dispatching rules, this article explicitly considers the characteristics of flow control operations via grammar-guided LGP and focuses on IF operations as a starting point. Specifically, this article designs a new set of normalized terminals to improve the interpretability of IF operations and proposes three restrictions by grammar rules on the usage of IF operations: 1) specifying the available inputs; 2) the maximum number; and 3) the possible locations of IF operations. The experiment results verify that the proposed method can achieve significantly better-test performance than state-of-the-art LGP methods and improves interpretability by IF-included dispatching rules. Further investigation confirms that the explicit introduction of IF operations helps effectively evolve different dispatching rules according to their decision situations.},

In this area, multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO) utilizes EMT to solve multiple multiobjective optimization tasks simultaneously. The key to addressing MO-MTO problems (MO-MTOPs) is to transfer appropriate knowledge among optimization tasks to assist the multiobjective evolutionary process. Both the type and the amount of knowledge can significantly affect the KT process. To achieve better KT behavior, we propose a multiple knowledge types and transfer adaptation (MKTA) framework for handling MO-MTOPs. The MKTA framework incorporates multiple types of knowledge in order to obtain comprehensive KT performance. It also provides transfer adaptation strategies to control: 1) the type of knowledge and 2) the amount of knowledge for KT via parameter adaptation approaches, thereby mitigating negative KT. Furthermore, we propose an evolution-path-model-based knowledge type and incorporate the existing unified-search-space-based knowledge type to form the knowledge pool for MKTA. Finally, the MKTA framework is coupled with a ranking-based differential evolution operator to constitute the complete algorithm MTDE-MKTA. In the experimental study, MTDE-MKTA outperformed ten advanced algorithms on 39 benchmark MO-MTOPs and six groups of realworld application problems.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the challenge of selecting the most suitable optimization algorithm by presenting a comprehensive computational comparison between stochastic and deterministic methods. The complexity of algorithm selection arises from the absence of a universal algorithm and the abundance of available options. Manual selection without comprehensive studies can lead to suboptimal or incorrect results. In order to address this issue, we carefully selected 25 promising and representative state-of-the-art algorithms from both aforementioned classes. The evaluation with up to the 20 dimensions and large evaluation budgets $(10^{5}{\times }n)$ was carried out in a significantly expanded and improved version of the DIRECTGOLib v2.0 library, which included ten distinct collections of primarily continuous test functions. The evaluation covered various aspects, such as solution quality, time complexity, and function evaluation usage. The rankings were determined using statistical tests and performance profiles. When it comes to the problems and algorithms examined in this study, EA4eig, EBOwithCMAR, APGSK-IMODE, 1-DTC-GL, OQNLP, and DIRMIN stand out as superior to other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality. While deterministic algorithms can locate reasonable solutions with comparatively fewer function evaluations, most stochastic algorithms require more extensive evaluation budgets to deliver comparable results. However, the performance of stochastic algorithms tends to excel in more complex and higher-dimensional problems. These research findings offer valuable insights for practitioners and researchers, enabling them to tackle diverse optimization problems effectively.},

  abstract     = {Handling conflicting objectives and finding multiple Pareto optimal solutions are two challenging issues in solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Inspired by the efficiency of multitask optimization (MTO) in finding multiple optimal solutions of MTO problem (MTOP), we propose to treat MOP as a MTOP and solve it by using MTO. By transforming the MOP into a MTOP, not only that the difficulty in handling conflicting objectives can be avoided, but also that MTO can help efficiently find well-distributed multiple optimal solutions for MOP. With the above idea, this article proposes a new multiobjective optimization method via MTO, with the following three contributions: 1) a theorem is proposed to theoretically show the relationship between MOP and MTOP and how MOP can be transformed into a MTOP; 2) based on the theoretical analysis, a multiple tasks for multiple objectives (MTMOs) framework is proposed for solving MOP efficiently; and 3) a MTMO-based evolutionary algorithm is developed to solve MOP, together with two novel strategies. One is a target point estimation strategy for transforming the MOP into a MTOP automatically and accurately. The other is an archive-based implicit knowledge transfer strategy for efficiently transferring knowledge across multiple tasks to enhance the optimization results of multiple tasks together. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is validated in extensive experiments on 15 MOPs with objective numbers varying from 3 to 20 and with six state-of-the-art algorithms as competitors. Therefore, solving MOP and even many-objective optimization problem via MTO is a new, promising, and efficient method.},

To widen the service range, some works have recommended adding facilities, such as drone stations, considering the problem in discrete space by choosing from a predefined set. In this article, an evolutionary optimization approach to the design decision of where to locate drone stations in the continuous plane is introduced, modeled, and solved. Drone stations serve as facilities for storage, charging, and launching. A truck (or other land transport means) transports parcels to the drone stations from a depot and the drones launch from the stations and deliver the parcels to each customer. The objective is to determine the positions of the drone stations in 2-D space and establish the shortest fixed truck route from the depot through all the stations and returning to the depot. The problem is constrained by the radius of service for each drone and all customers must be served, if possible. We formulate the problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and present two versions of an algorithm using particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a subordinate dynamic program. Computational results show that our approach achieves much better results than a standard commercial nonlinear solver in a similar amount of computational time for both maximizing coverage of customers and minimizing distance of the truck delivery route.

In other words, the quest is restricted to optimal solutions. In this work, we argue that the entire set of nearly optimal solutions—which includes all optimal ones—is of potential interest for the decision maker as they contain in addition to the optimal solutions alternative realizations or backup solutions. We further make a first effort to reliably compute the set of nearly optimal solutions via EMO algorithms. To this end, we first propose a new set of interest, $N_{Q,\epsilon }$ , and analyze its topology. In a next step, we propose an unbounded archiver that aims to capture $N_{Q,\epsilon }$ and analyze it with respect to monotonicity and limit behavior. After this, we discuss the related subset selection problem which comes with unbounded archivers leading to four different algorithms. Finally, we numerically investigate the behavior of the archiver and the selection strategies, and present some results when using the archiver as external archiver to three widely used multiobjective evolutionary algorithms indicating the benefit of the new approach.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) is an emerging research direction within the evolutionary computation community, attempting to concurrently solve multiple optimization tasks by exploiting the underlying synergies between the tasks. Recently, numerous explicit transfer strategies have been developed for enhancing positive transfer among optimization tasks. Nevertheless, most of these methods conduct knowledge transfer by transferring the best solutions from a source task to the target task, while ignoring the proper use of information from the target task in solution selection. As a result, the transferred solutions could not well adapt to the target task, thus limiting the effectiveness of knowledge transfer across tasks. To address this issue, this article proposes a solution selection method based on the lower confidence bound (LCB) for EMT, which is designed by leveraging task-specific information of both source and target tasks. With the proposed LCB metric, a number of high-quality solutions that could be more helpful for the target task can be selected and transferred to enhance positive transfer in EMT. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the solution selection method is embedded into several existing EMT algorithms and then evaluated on the single-objective multitasking benchmarks, the multiobjective multitasking benchmark, and a real-world application. The obtained results confirmed the generality and efficacy of the proposed solution selection approach.},

They employ a selection mechanism to choose the best solutions from a given population after comparing their objective values, which are then used to generate the next population. This iterative process explores the solution space efficiently, leading to improved solutions over time. However, one of the challenges of these algorithms is that they require a large number of evaluations to provide a quality solution, which might be computationally expensive when the evaluation cost is high. In some cases, it is possible to replace the original objective function with a less accurate approximation of lower cost. This introduces a tradeoff between the evaluation cost and its accuracy. In this article, we propose a technique capable of choosing an appropriate approximate function cost during the execution of the optimization algorithm. The proposal finds the minimum evaluation cost at which the solutions are still properly ranked, and consequently, more evaluations can be computed in the same amount of time with minimal accuracy loss. An experimental section on four very different problems reveals that the proposed approach can reach the same objective value in less than half of the time in certain cases.},

In this article, we show that in domains where evaluation data is at a premium, e.g., in scientific and engineering disciplines involving time-consuming computer simulations or complex real-world experimentation, knowledge transfer through surrogate models can be pivotal in saving sample evaluation costs. While state-of-the-art algorithms (without transfer) typically assume budgets in the order of only a few hundred evaluations, we seek to explore how far we can get on even tighter budgets. The uniqueness of our proposed expensive transfer evolutionary multiobjective optimizer (ExTrEMO) is that it can maximally utilize external information from hundreds of source datasets, including those that may be negatively correlated with the target task. This is achieved by melding evolutionary search with factorized transfer Gaussian process surrogates, capturing varied source-target correlations in potentially decentralized computation environments. We provide a regret bound analysis for ExTrEMO that translates to a theoretical proof of increasingly faster convergence as a result of multisource transfers. The theory is experimentally verified on benchmark functions and toward accelerated design of biomedical microdevices. We release our code at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/ExTrEMO.},

  abstract     = {The growing ubiquity of machine learning (ML) has led it to enter various areas of computer science, including black-box optimization (BBO). Recent research is particularly concerned with Bayesian optimization (BO). BO-based algorithms are popular in the ML community, as they are used for hyperparameter optimization and more generally for algorithm configuration. However, their efficiency decreases as the dimensionality of the problem and the budget of evaluations increase. Meanwhile, derivative-free optimization methods have evolved independently in the optimization community. Therefore, we urge to understand whether cross-fertilization is possible between the two communities, ML and BBO, i.e., whether algorithms that are heavily used in ML also work well in BBO and vice versa. Comparative experiments often involve rather small benchmarks and show visible problems in the experimental setup, such as poor initialization of baselines, overfitting due to problem-specific setting of hyperparameters, and low statistical significance. With this article, we update and extend a comparative study presented by Hutter et al. in 2013. We compare BBO tools for ML with more classical heuristics, first on the well-known Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking test suite from the COCO environment and then on Direct Policy Search for OpenAI Gym, a reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results confirm that BO-based optimizers perform well on both benchmarks when budgets are limited, albeit with a higher computational cost, while they are often outperformed by algorithms from other families when the evaluation budget becomes larger. We also show that some algorithms from the BBO community perform surprisingly well on ML tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of Big Data, managing large-scale portfolios of thousands of securities is one of the most challenging tasks in the asset management industry. This study uses an evolutionary multiobjective technique to solve large-scale portfolio optimization problems with both long-term listed and newly listed securities. The future returns of long-term listed securities are defined as random variables whose probability distributions are estimated based on sufficient historical data, while the returns of newly listed securities are defined as uncertain variables whose uncertainty distributions are estimated based on experts’ knowledge. Our approach defines security returns as theoretically uncertain random variables and proposes a three-moment optimization model with practical trading constraints. In this study, a framework for applying arbitrary multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to portfolio optimization is established, and a novel evolutionary algorithm based on large-scale optimization techniques is developed to solve the proposed model. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in large-scale portfolio optimization.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to tackle expensive inequality-constrained optimization problems through global exploration and local exploitation. The algorithm begins with an exploration stage that involves sampling in three kinds of global regions: 1) the feasible region; 2) the better-objective region; and 3) the converging region. Specifically, sampling in the uncertain feasible region mitigates issues caused by inaccurate objective surrogates. In addition, sampling in the uncertain region containing better-objective values than the current best-feasible solution reduces the risk of missing the global optimum due to inaccurate constraint surrogates. Moreover, sampling in the converging region facilitates quick convergence to the global feasible optimum. Following the exploration stage, promising feasible and infeasible solutions are further refined using local surrogate-based search strategies. To address the risk of missing the global optimum resulting from limited local region scope, the regions are adaptively extended if predicted infill points lie on the boundary. If an infill point is determined to showcase a better-objective value after accurate evaluation, a rewarding local search is performed within the local region. This exploration-exploitation process iterates until the computation budget is exhausted. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the selected state-of-the-art algorithms on the majority of tested problems.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation reuses the knowledge learned from an existing (source) domain to classify unlabeled data from another related (target) domain. However, the two domains have different data distributions. Common approaches to bridge the two distributions are selecting/reweighting instances, building domain-invariant feature subspaces, or directly building adaptive classifiers. Recent domain adaptation work has shown that combining the above first two approaches before applying the third approach achieves better performance than performing each approach individually. However, most existing instance selection approaches are based on a ranking mechanism, ignore interdependences between instances, and require a predefined number of selected instances. Furthermore, adaptive classifiers are sensitive to their parameters which are challenging to optimize due to the lack of target labeled instances. This article introduces a novel evolutionary instance selection approach for domain adaptation. We propose a compacted representation and an efficient fitness function for particle swarm optimization to automatically determine the number of selected instances while considering the interdependencies among instances. This article also proposes to use multiple partial classifiers to build a more reliable and robust adaptive classifier. The results show that evolutionary instance selection selects better instances than the ranking approach. In cooperation with multiple partial classifiers, the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than nine state-of-the-art and well-known domain adaptation approaches.},

However, most existing algorithms tend to underperform when facing problems with complex constraints. To address these issues, a constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm named DPTPEA, which combines dual-population and two-phase strategies, is proposed in this article. DPTPEA employs two collaborative populations [the exploitive population (expPop) and the tractive population (tracPop)] and divides the evolutionary process of the tracPop into two phases (Phase 1 and Phase 2). In Phase 1, the tracPop ignores constraints and drags the expPop across the infeasible region by sharing offspring information. In Phase 2, the tracPop adopts the epsilon-constrained method to converge toward the constrained Pareto front and to guide the expPop exploiting different feasible regions. Moreover, a dynamic cooperation strategy, a boundary point direction sampling strategy, and a dynamic environmental selection are proposed to improve the exploration ability of tracPop for solving complex problems. Comprehensive experiments on three popular test suites demonstrate that DPTPEA outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms on most test problems.},

In the EC algorithm, there is a huge amount of data generated during the evolutionary process. These data reflect the evolutionary behavior and therefore mining and utilizing these data can obtain promising knowledge for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of EC algorithms to better solve optimization problems. Considering this and inspired by the ability of human beings that acquire knowledge from the historical successful experiences of their predecessors, this article proposes a novel EC paradigm, named knowledge learning EC (KLEC). The KLEC aims to learn from historical successful experiences to obtain a knowledge library and to guide the evolutionary behaviors of individuals based on the knowledge library. The KLEC includes two main processes named learning from experiences to obtain knowledge and utilizing knowledge to guide evolution. First, KLEC maintains a knowledge library model (KLM) and updates this model by learning the successful experiences collected in every generation. Second, KLEC not only adopts the evolutionary operation but also utilizes the KLM to guide individuals for better evolution. The KLEC is a generic and effective framework, and we propose two algorithm instances of KLEC, which are knowledge learning (KL)-based differential evolution and KL-based particle swarm optimization. Also, we combine the KL framework with several state-of-the-art EC algorithms, showing that the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms can be significantly enhanced by incorporating the KL framework.},

  abstract     = {Constraints may scatter the Pareto optimal solutions of a constrained multiobjective optimization problem (CMOP) into multiple feasible regions. To avoid getting trapped in local optimal feasible regions or a part of the global optimal feasible regions, a constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) should consider both the escape force and the expansion force carefully during the search process. However, most CMOEAs fail to provide these two forces effectively. As a remedy for this limitation, this article proposes a method called three-population evolutionary algorithm (TPEA). TPEA maintains three populations, termed Pop1, Pop2, and Pop3. Pop1 is a regular population, updated with a constrained NSGA-II variant. Pop2 and Pop3 are two auxiliary populations, containing the innermost and outermost nondominated infeasible solutions, respectively. The analysis reveals that these two types of nondominated infeasible solutions can contribute to the generation of escape and expansion forces, respectively. Due to these two forces, TPEA is likely to identify more global optimal feasible regions, which is crucial for constrained multiobjective optimization. Also, a mating selection strategy is developed in TPEA to coordinate the interaction among these three populations. Extensive experiments on 58 benchmark CMOPs and 35 real-world ones demonstrate that TPEA is significantly superior or comparable to six state-of-the-art CMOEAs on most test instances.},

This article proposes a new method for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of radiator-heated buildings and measuring model uncertainties. Specifically, a nonlinear dynamic model is established according to the heat conservation between independent heat storage units in heating buildings. The model uncertainties are measured based on the fuzzy set theory by a number of sub-optimal parameter vectors that reproduce certain measured outputs and approach the optimal value of a modeling objective function. These sub-optimal parameter vectors can describe the uncertainties in the presence of model structure deviations and unknown noise distributions, without making restrictive assumptions that the noise follows a Gaussian distribution as in existing methods. The proposed method is validated by practical examples in a radiator-heated residential building. The examples illustrate that the proposed method can provide more accurate measurements of the model uncertainties than the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.},

  abstract     = {Networked control systems (NCSs) suffer from various communication imperfections, including varying transmission intervals, packet losses, and false data injection (FDI) attacks. The majority of the existing literature on NCSs tends to emphasize certain aspects while neglecting others. In this article, we propose a general framework for addressing the stabilization problem of networked nonlinear systems that incorporates multiple stochastic transmission intervals (MSTIs), successive packet losses (SPLs), and FDI attacks. We assume that the nonlinear system can be precisely modeled using a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system. MSTIs can be described using the categorical distribution, while both the sensor-to-controller channel and the controller-to-actuator channel are affected by SPLs and FDI attacks. In order to facilitate the stabilization problem, we first establish the equivalent stochastic transmission interval between adjacent nonpacket-loss instants, where the occurrence probability of the length of the equivalent transmission interval can be accurately calculated by using the probabilistic information of SPLs and MSTIs. Furthermore, considering two-channel FDI attacks, a discrete-time T–S fuzzy system model is obtained. The controller design conditions, represented by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are derived based on this model. Specifically, using a novel matrix reconstruction approach, the dimension of the obtained controller design condition does not change with the number of maximum packet losses and the number of MSTIs, which is more general than existing results and avoids the high computational complexity associated with solving LMIs in some cases. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.},

To overcome the challenges brought by the introduction of nonlinear coupling strengths, this article adopts a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model to characterize the nonlinear variation of coupling strengths reasonably. Then, in the framework of average impulsive interval applicable to a wider range of impulsive signals, this article proposes a novel method for analyzing the fixed-time stability of impulsive systems, which not only loosens the restriction of the derivative of the Lyapunov function in the existing studies, but also gives a more accurate estimation of the settling time, and more importantly, provides a theoretical basis for designing appropriate impulsive signals to modulate the dynamic behavior of SNs toward achieving the desired goal. Based on the newly suggested method, this article derives a unified synchronization criterion suitable for evaluating the implementation of FxTBS of SNs under both desynchronizing and synchronizing impulses.

The complex knowledge comes from a proposed hybrid NFN-LSTM model (teacher) composed of a long shor-term memory (LSTM) coupled to a neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN) structure. The proposed student model, the NFN-MOD, is an explainable Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model that resembles modular characteristics to mimic the temporal memory of the LSTM part in the teacher model. The NFN-MOD is adaptable across many scenarios, including solo learning (without a teacher), with the estimation of a previously trained teacher, or training in parallel with the teacher. The complexity reduction of the student model is achieved through the pruning of its consequent parameters with the lowest L1-norm. Application of NFN-MOD in industrial case studies (sulfur recovery unit and cement manufacturing process) demonstrates the efficiency of NFN-MOD in distilling complex knowledge from the teacher model NFN-LSTM, with emphasis on parallel training and parameter pruning. In addition, a novel explainability analysis is introduced, which evaluates the influence of antecedent parameters of the student model in relation to the expected real system output.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the asynchronous fault detection (FD) problem for interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy Markov jump systems with medium access constraints and false data injection attacks. Considering that the medium access constraints allow only the measurement information from a single node to be transmitted and the authenticity of the measured values is corrupted by attacks, a fuzzy-model-based asynchronous FD filter with only partially available measurements is designed. Then, based on the residual signals generated by the filter, a generalized detection scheme for sensor faults and actuator faults is proposed. By applying the information about membership functions and relaxation matrices, the existence conditions of the filter are obtained that guarantee the stochastic stability and strict dissipativity of the filtering error system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which shows that it can more accurately identify the actual fault signal than the existing methods without generating false alarms.},

  abstract     = {Although the construction of multilinear trend fuzzy information granules (FIG) achieves a win–win situation in terms of interpretability and trend extraction, in its second stage of segmentation, the equal-length segmentation will result in the loss of local trend. The granulation effect will further affect the forecasting performance of the time series. To this end, this article establishes a convolutional neural network (CNN) prediction method based on improved multilinear trend FIGs. First, considering the natural cycle characteristics of the time series, this article establishes a time series segmentation algorithm based on the valley points, which replaces the equal-length segmentation in the second stage of the construction of the multilinear trend FIGs, thus enhancing the interpretability of the granulation process. Later, an evaluation index of Gaussian fuzzy information granules (GLFIGs) is proposed for improving the trend extraction effect of each multilinear trend FIG. Since the multilinear trend FIGs are constructed in the natural period segment, in order to fully exploit the correlation of the corresponding positions of each granule to enhance the prediction accuracy, a GLFIG correspondence algorithm based on the segmentation and merging is introduced in this article. Finally, CNN is selected as the prediction model based on the data characteristics. We conduct experiments on six datasets and two artificial cycle datasets, and compare the constructed model with commonly used prediction models and the latest granularity model. At last, the experiments reveal that our model performs better.},

Different from current approaches, our method ensures enhanced prescribed performance by guaranteeing finite-time convergence and avoiding high frequency chattering. To achieve this, we directly develop discrete-time PPC protocols using a low-computational fuzzy approximation strategy based on completely unknown system dynamics, thus eliminating the need for complex model equivalent reconstruction as demanded by previous studies.

  abstract     = {Impressive advancements have been achieved in utilizing information granulation for solving long-term time series prediction problems. However, most state-of-the-art methods suffer from limitations due to not only using the single-scale information granulation but also the lack of trend information. As a result, the prediction models are difficult to capture the multiscale temporal dependencies and dynamic behavior of time series. To address these problems, this article proposes a multiscale information granule-based time series forecasting model. First, the trend-based information granulation strategy is proposed to generate trend information granules that can capture dynamic behavior and trend information in an incremental manner. Then, the multiscale fusion mechanism is proposed to form multiscale information granules with diversified information, which fuses local and global information at different scales. Finally, the two-stage prediction mechanism is proposed to capture multiscale temporal dependencies and perform long-term prediction. A series of experiments were conducted on publicly available time series. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed method outperforms existing numeric models and granular models in long-term prediction on regular and large data time series.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multilabel feature selection (MFS) has gained considerable attention as a key technique in the field of data mining. Embedded methods have been widely adopted due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, most embedded MFS methods assume that all labels share the same feature space. Although previous works have noted this issue and proposed solutions, they still suffer from the inability to accurately identify a specific subset of features for each label. Furthermore, most embedded MFS methods often only consider feature similarity through manifold learning concepts, neglecting the impact of feature redundancy, leading to suboptimal performance. In addition, their weight matrix is usually derived from a single perspective of the loss function. To address these limitations, we propose a novel embedded label-specific MFS method based on fuzzy implication granularity information called LSFSFI. This method uses the partial fuzzy mutual implication granularity information to capture the relationships between labels and features, and introduces an auxiliary matrix to achieve label-specific feature selection, which provides a new perspective for the calculation of the weight matrix. In addition, the normalized fuzzy mutual implication granularity information is used to describe the redundancy between features, and a new redundancy constraint regularization term is proposed to ensure a more reasonable assignment of feature weights. Experimental results on several multilabel datasets show that LSFSFI outperforms existing methods in terms of both performance and practicality.},

Then, different from the previous control strategies in which they only focused on the balanced directed topology, the classification optimization algorithm is presented to accomplish the bipartite consensus tracking control according to the structurally unbalanced directed topology. Besides, by combining the adaptive backstepping technique with the adding power integration methodology, the nonsingular fixed-time control strategy is proposed. The proposed adaptive fuzzy fixed-time control strategy ensures that the bipartite consensus tracking errors converge to a region near zero in fixed time and all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability.

Linear fuzzy information granulation is a well-recognized and powerful tool for long-term forecasting. However, existing studies on this topic have been restricted to univariate time series, falling short of meeting the real-world demands of complex forecasting issues. In this regard, this article proposes a multivariate long-term time-series forecasting model using fuzzy information granules and demonstrates its application to a transportation forecasting task. Our model begins by designing a multilinear trend fuzzy information granulation scheme within a justifiable granularity framework. This scheme effectively granulates and delineates time-series information for each feature. To ensure the normalization of the granular time series within each time window, we propose a scale equalization strategy that leverages the dynamic time warping algorithm. Building upon this foundation, our model introduces a long-term forecasting mechanism for multivariate time series. Notably, this mechanism fosters interconnections, bridging the temporal gap between past and future granular time series while concurrently linking the granular series of influential features and the target feature. Empirical validation on six real-world traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed model.},

By utilizing multiple linguistic variables with associated distribution proportions, DLPRs offer a flexible way to represent preferences. However, current models that use DLPRs often overlook two crucial factors: the ordinal consistency of preference relations and the fairness of adjustment allocation within the DLPRs-based consensus reaching process. In this article, we propose a cooperative game-based minimum adjustment consensus reaching mechanism that accounts for both ordinal consistency and the hesitant degree in DLPRs. This approach leverages the properties of indices in cooperative game theory to ensures a fair allocation of consistency and consensus adjustments, while maintaining ordinal consistency and controlling the hesitant degree of DLPRs through the construction of appropriate constraints to preserve their quality. In addition, a new algorithm is developed to manage completeness, ordinal and acceptable cardinal consistency, consensus-reaching, and hesitation in scenarios involving incomplete DLPRs. Finally, a case study is provided to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed method. Sensitivity and comparative analyzes with existing models are performed to assess the performance of the approach in terms of quality, fairness, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in processing graph structure. Due to the diversity and complexity of real-world graph data, heterogeneous GCN have attracted significant attention. However, existing research predominantly relies on explicit connections to explore graph heterogeneity. In the case of edgeless graphs, such as information systems, the absence of direct edges poses a significant challenge for employing GCNs to analyze the latent heterogeneity within these graphs. Traditional approaches overlook the topological features of information systems, resulting in information loss. This article introduces a heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network based on shadowed deviation relationship (SDHGCN) to investigate the heterogeneity of information systems, thereby improving the generalizability of heterogeneous GCNs. First, shadow deviation relationship and attribute deviation relationship are constructed derived from shadow sets and information gain, respectively. Then, dexterously integrated with the feature matrix of the information system (the relationship between objects and attributes), a highly expressive heterogeneous graph is constructed. Second, by performing graph convolution operations on the heterogeneous graph, effective node representations can be obtained to complete node classification tasks. Finally, the effectiveness and nonrandomness of SDHGCN are validated by extensive comparison and ablation experiments.},

In addition, a set of MTBFs is designed to prevent the excessive overshoot or jitter of system errors in the transient-state performance. Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic event-triggered control strategy is constructed on the basis of the auxiliary dynamic variable.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of finite-time filtering for a class of discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy-model-based networked control systems (NCSs) subject to switching communication channels and cyber attacks. Specifically, the fluctuations of the state estimator gain parameters are taken into account in the design of the filter. Further, cyber attacks are supposed to take place in the communication channel and can modify the sensor signals by injecting false data if an attack is successful. Meanwhile, the transition probability of the Markov process is a switching phenomenon along with the minimum and maximum bounds of the multichannel communication scheme. By employing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional along with reciprocally convex approach, a set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the finite-time mixed $H_\infty$ and passivity performance for NCSs are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. In the end, two illustrated examples quantify the effectiveness of the proposed analysis and filter design method.},

Then, a unique complex-valued fuzzy nonlinear delayed feedback controller is devised, and by virtue of the FMLF method and newly derived inequalities herein, several sufficient criteria are derived to ensure complete synchronization of DFTSFCNNs.

  abstract     = {A novel waypoint navigation controller for a skid-steer vehicle is presented, where the controller is a multiple input-multiple output nonlinear angular velocity and linear speed controller. Hierarchical rule-base reduction was used in defining the controller. This entailed selecting inputs/outputs, determining the most globally influential inputs, generating a hierarchy relating inputs, selecting only the rules corresponding to the hierarchy, and, in effect, designing a symmetric rule-base. This dramatically reduced the rule-base size, by 97.7%, while maintaining global operating environment coverage. The stability analysis proved the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop controller-vehicle system. In addition, test courses were used to examine the effects of steering disturbance, phase lag, and overshoot as expressed in root mean square error (RMSE) and max error (ME). Outdoor experimental results for the controller&#39;s performance were contrasted with a benchmark waypoint navigation controller, pure pursuit, and a simpler implementation that only output linear speed. The controller was found to outperform the pure pursuit and simpler implementation experimentally by 72% and 50% in RMSE, 71% and 40% in ME, validating the controllers viability.},

However, the seamless integration of biosignals with mechanical counterparts continues to pose significant challenges. To address this, fuzzy logic (FL) emerges as a potential key to these challenges, offering a promising solution for handling the uncertainties and ambiguity inherent in biosignals. It thereby facilitates improved cyborg intelligence in an array of applications, including but not limited to wireless body area networks, brain–computer interfaces, prosthetics, and exoskeletons. Although previous works have highlighted the enhancement of cyborg intelligence using fuzzy sets, all of them only dived single aspects of the cyborg intelligence enhancement applications, leading to a lack of comprehensive understanding. Therefore, we provide a holistic overview of the state-of-the-art applications of FL in cyborg enhancement technology, encompassing its benefits, challenges, and potential directions for future research.},

Traditional game theory limits players to two choices, i.e., either cooperation or defection. However, player behavior in real-world scenarios is often multidimensional and complex; therefore, this work employs a continuous action iterated dilemma that allows players to choose a wider range of strategies. Moreover, traditional convergence analysis often relies on Jacobian matrices, which entail complex derivations. In contrast, the proposed strategy employs a time generator-based protocol that achieves agreement between all the players at a prescribed time, explicitly set by the user through a time parameter within the protocol. A comprehensive Lyapunov analysis affirms the prescribed time convergence even when the network is exposed to information loss during data transfer. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme leads to a faster agreement at the preassigned time and with a better resilience performance compared to existing methods.},

To address challenges, such as obstructed views and limitations in camera placement in real-world scenarios, the CV method utilized video-derived coordinates from a selected set of landmarks. A 2-D pose estimator (HR-Net) detected landmark coordinates in each video frame, and a 3-D algorithm (VideoPose3D) estimated the depth of each 2-D landmark by analyzing its trajectories. The mean absolute precision error for the CV method, compared to MoCap measurements using the same subset of landmarks for estimating A, was 6.25° (SD = 10.19°, N = 360).

Then, the information granule can be constructed based on the time domain information, which completes complexity information. Together with the support vector machine algorithm, the proposed granulation method outperformed the existing classification methods in accuracy. It is utilized by classifying three motor imaginary EEG signals. Two of them are binary-class datasets, i.e., one dataset includes two-hand actions, and another includes hand and foot actions. The third dataset is multiclass, including two hands and two feet actions. In addition, the proposed granulation method overcomes the difficulties in cross-individual cases when classifying the EEG signals with a higher accuracy than the existing methods.

Therefore, this article proposes a miner mental state evaluation scheme with decision-level fusion based on multidomain EEG information. First, in the comprehensive lab for coal-related programs of Xi&#39;an University of Science and Technology, the coal mine environment is simulated, and a realistic EEG dataset is constructed. Second, the multidomain features are extracted to represent abundant information in time, frequency, time-frequency, and space domain. These features with low dimension are classified adopting support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and back propagation (BP) network to obtain the optimal evaluation submodel (four domains corresponding to four submodels). Finally, based on the state probabilities provided by the optimal evaluation submodel, we adopt stack fusion and an improved Yager rule to fuse four submodels in order to find the most suitable fusion algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy can reach 93.19% on the self-built dataset when utilizing the improved Yager rule with weight, and it realizes a better evaluation accuracy.},

To fill this gap, we assessed virtual presence, system usability, engagement, and ease of task completion, in subjects using two iterations of a VR application (controllers or hand tracking) designed to address the major limitations of current systems. Results revealed that both systems exceeded the benchmark usability score of 68. System 1 (controllers) performed better for interactions with the virtual tablet interface to answer questions, whereas interactions with the food objects were easier using System 2 (hand tracking). Participants also experienced a high sense of virtual presence using both systems. When measured in System 2, a high level of subject engagement during the immersive product evaluations was observed.

  abstract     = {Neural or muscular injuries, such as due to amputation, spinal cord injury, and stroke, can affect hand functions, profoundly impacting independent living. This has motivated the advancement of cutting-edge assistive robotic hands. However, unintuitive myoelectric control of these devices remains challenging, which limits the clinical translation of these devices. Accordingly, we developed a robust motor-intent decoding approach to continuously predict the intended fingertip forces of single and multiple fingers in real time. We used population motor neuron discharge activities (i.e., neural drive from brain to spinal cord) decoded from a high-density surface electromyogram (HD-sEMG) signals as the control signals instead of the conventional global sEMG features. To enable real-time neural-drive prediction, we employed a convolutional neural network model to establish the mapping from global HD-sEMG features to finger-specific neural-drive signals, which were then employed for continuous and real-time control of three prosthetic fingers (index, middle, and ring). As a result, the neural-drive-based approach can decode the motor intent of single-finger and multifinger forces with significantly lower force estimation errors than that obtained using the global HD-sEMG-amplitude approach. Besides, the force prediction accuracy was consistent over time and demonstrated strong robustness to signal interference. Our network-based decoder can also achieve better finger isolation with minimal forces predicted in unintended fingers. Our work demonstrates that the accurate and robust finger force control could be achieved through this new decoding approach. The outcomes offer an efficient intent prediction approach that allows users to have intuitive control of prosthetic fingertip forces in a dexterous way.},

This research presents a novel approach to quantitatively measure human comfort levels during HRC through the development of two metrics: a comfortability index (CI) and an uncomfortability index (UnCI). We conducted HRC experiments where participants performed assembly tasks while the robot&#39;s behavior was systematically varied. Participants&#39; subjective responses (including surprise, anxiety, boredom, calmness, and comfortability ratings) were collected alongside physiological signals, including electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and pupillometry data. We propose two novel approaches for estimating CI/UnCI: an adaptation of the emotion circumplex model that maps comfort levels to the arousal–valence space, and a kernel density estimation model trained on physiological data. Time-domain features were extracted from the physiological signals and used to train machine learning models for real-time comfort levels estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively estimate human comfort levels from physiological signals alone, with the circumplex model showing particular promise in detecting high discomfort states. This work enables real-time measurement of human comfort during HRC, providing a foundation for developing more adaptive and human-aware collaborative robots.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition. However, existing works have predominantly focused on closed-set paradigms, where all testing gestures are predefined during training. This poses a significant challenge in real-world applications, as unseen gestures might be misclassified as known class during testing. To address this issue, we propose WiOpen, a robust Wi-Fi-based open-set gesture recognition (OSGR) framework. Implementing OSGR requires addressing challenges caused by the unique uncertainty in Wi-Fi sensing. This uncertainty, resulting from noise and domains, leads to widely scattered and irregular data distributions in collected Wi-Fi sensing data. Consequently, data ambiguity between classes and challenges in defining appropriate decision boundaries to identify unknowns arise. To tackle these challenges, WiOpen adopts a twofold approach to eliminate uncertainty and define precise decision boundaries. Initially, it addresses uncertainty induced by noise during data preprocessing by utilizing the channel state information (CSI) ratio. Next, it designs the OSGR network based on an uncertainty quantification method. Throughout the learning process, this network effectively mitigates uncertainty stemming from domains. Ultimately, the network leverages relationships among samples&#39; neighbors to dynamically define open-set decision boundaries, successfully realizing OSGR. Comprehensive experiments on publicly accessible datasets confirm WiOpen&#39;s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces the global-local image perceptual score (GLIPS), an image metric designed to assess the photorealistic image quality of AI-generated images with a high degree of alignment to human visual perception. Traditional metrics such as Fréchet inception distance (FID) and kernel inception distance scores do not align closely with human evaluations. The proposed metric incorporates advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to assess local similarity and maximum mean discrepancy to evaluate global distributional similarity. To evaluate the performance of GLIPS, we conducted a human study on photorealistic image quality. Comprehensive tests across various generative models demonstrate that GLIPS consistently outperforms existing metrics like FID, structural similarity index measure, and multiscale structural similarity index measure in terms of correlation with human scores. In addition, we introduce the interpolative binning scale, a refined scaling method that enhances the interpretability of metric scores by aligning them more closely with human evaluative standards. The proposed metric and scaling approach not only provide more reliable assessments of AI-generated images but also suggest pathways for future enhancements in image generation technologies.},

Yet, there still exists a challenge in designing chatbot dialog systems that achieve widespread diffusion among scientific communities. In this article, we propose a novel Vidura advisor design framework (VADF) to develop dialog system designs for information retrieval (IR) and question-answering (QA) tasks, while enabling the quantification of system utility based on human performance in diverse application environments. We adopt a socio-technical approach in our framework for designing dialog systems by utilizing domain expert feedback, which features a sparse retriever for enabling accurate responses in QA settings using linear interpolation smoothing. We apply our VADF for an exemplar science gateway, viz. KnowCOVID-19, to conduct experiments that demonstrate the utility of dialog systems based on IR and QA performance, application utility, and perceived adoption. Experimental results show our VADF approach significantly improves IR performance against retriever baselines (up to 5% increase) and QA performance against large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (up to 43% increase) on scientific literature datasets. In addition, through a usability survey, we observe that measuring application utility and human performance when applying VADF to KnowCOVID-19 translates to an increase in perceived community adoption.},

However, the controlling of an upper limb exoskeleton for rehabilitation is a challenging task because of its nonlinear characteristics. This article presents a novel fuzzy adaptive controller that utilizes a high-dimensional integral-type Lyapunov function for a wearable assistive upper limb exoskeleton. A disturbance observer had been used to tackle uncertainties in the exoskeleton&#39;s dynamic model, thereby enhancing the tracking performance of the joints. The aim of this control scheme was to overcome unknown parameters in the dynamic model. The performance of the adaptive controller was validated through human interactive experiments and periodically repeated reference trajectory tests. The results demonstrated that the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller, with the inclusion of a disturbance observer, could effectively compensate for uncertain disturbances and could achieve efficient tracking of the reference trajectory. The statistical analysis revealed that the fuzzy adaptive controller performed 45%, 44%, and 31% less in average error compared to adaptive conventional controllers. The findings ascertained the potential of the proposed controller in improving the recovery of motor functions of hemiplegic patients.},

We determined that wearing exoskeletons reduced the biomechanical efforts of workers measured by joint kinematics and electromyography as well as the estimated shoulder joint reaction forces and torques derived from simulation. These quantitatively measured variables were statistically associated with subjective measures collected through satisfaction questionnaires. We specifically found that participants increased the shoulder flexion and abduction angles as well as the shoulder range of motion while wearing exoskeletons. Participants also reduced muscle activities, joint torques for shoulder flexion, and reaction forces exerted on the shoulder joints while wearing exoskeletons. Interestingly, our analysis also found that the increased shoulder movement while wearing the device was negatively associated with the satisfaction level. This indicates that although the assistance provided by the device allows users to perform a wider range of arm lifting movements, the deviation from their original movement with the device may lead to decreases in satisfaction levels. This integrative approach using biomechanics and ergonomics suggests that we can potentially predict the subjective scale of satisfaction based on biomechanical variables and preliminarily evaluate the usability and comfort while wearing exoskeletons in real-world settings.},

However, traditional virtual fixtures with constant stiffness are inadequate for scenarios where robots need to leave the constraints to perform tasks. To address this, we propose an adaptive virtual fixture based on the motion refinement tube, which dynamically adjusts the guiding force according to the distribution of trajectories. To prevent tube deformation in the Cartesian space due to the neglect of off-diagonal elements of covariance matrices, the refinement tube radii and nonlinear stiffness terms are computed in local coordinate systems based on the decomposed covariance matrix. An energy-tank-based passivity controller is designed to ensure system stability when employing the virtual fixture with state-dependent stiffness terms. In the validation tests with 18 participants, the proposed method showed improvements in task efficiency (18.69% increase) and collision avoidance (97.87% reduction) for a typical pick-and-place task with scattered materials. It also provided better subjective experiences of the users than traditional virtual fixtures. Meanwhile, compared with the method that neglects off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, the proposed method exhibited a 4.28% efficiency improvement and a 40.42% decrease in collision occurrences.},

  abstract     = {Human–machine shared control has recently been regarded as a promising paradigm to improve safety and performance in complex driving scenarios. One crucial task in shared control is dynamically optimizing the driving weights between the driver and the intelligent vehicle to adapt to dynamic driving scenarios. However, designing an optimal human–machine shared controller with guaranteed performance and stability is challenging due to nonnegligible time delays caused by communication protocols and uncertainties in driver behavior. This article proposes a novel receding-horizon reinforcement learning approach for time-delayed human–machine shared control of intelligent vehicles. First, we build a multikernel-based data-driven model of vehicle dynamics and driving behavior, considering time delays and uncertainties of drivers&#39; actions. Second, a model-based receding horizon actor–critic learning algorithm is presented to learn an explicit policy for time-delayed human–machine shared control online. Unlike classic reinforcement learning, policy learning of the proposed approach is performed according to a receding-horizon strategy to enhance learning efficiency and adaptability. In theory, the closed-loop stability under time delays is analyzed. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments on the time-delayed human–machine shared control of intelligent vehicles have been conducted in variable curvature road scenarios. The results demonstrate that our approach has significant improvements in driving performance and driver workload compared with pure manual driving and previous shared control methods.},

This method could be used in the realm of brain disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to facilitate prompt identification. We propose a novel radiomic features [deep radiomic features (DTF)], involving the use of principal component analysis to encode convolutional neural network (CNN) features, thereby capturing distinctive features related to brain regions in subjects with ASD subjects and their age. Using these features in random forest (RF) models, we explore two scenarios, such as site-specific radiomic analysis and feature extraction from unaffected brain regions to alleviate site-related variations. Our experiments involved comparing the proposed method with standard radiomics (SR) and 2-D/3-D CNNs for the classification of ASD versus healthy control (HC) individuals and different age groups (below median and above median). When using the RF model with DTF, the analysis at individual sites revealed an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) range of 79%–85% for features, such as the left lateral-ventricle, cerebellum-white-matter, and pallidum, as well as the right choroid-plexus and vessel. In the context of fivefold cross validation with the RF model, the combined features (DTF from 3-D CNN, ResNet50, DarketNet53, and NasNet_large with SR) achieved the highest AUC value of 76.67%. Furthermore, our method also showed notable AUC values for predicting age in subjects with ASD (80.91%) and HC (75.64%). The results indicate that DTFs consistently exhibit predictive value in classifying ASD from HC subjects and in predicting age.},

Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand interaction dataset, i.e., the Assembely101 dataset, and two large-scale human-to-human interaction datasets, i.e., NTU60-Interaction and NTU120-Interaction consistently verify the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based and Transformer-based methods.},

It is of great importance to consider human factors in a disassembly process. This work considers two human disassembly postures, namely standing and sitting. The multiobjective disassembly line balancing problem considering human posture changes is studied. A mathematical model with the objective functions of maximizing profit, minimizing the number of posture changes at a workstation, and minimizing the difference of maximum posture changes between any two workstations is established. The model is solved through a newly proposed Pareto-based discrete harmony search algorithm. Three neighborhood structures are designed to enlarge the search space for better solutions. Furthermore, an elite reserve strategy is used to improve the global optimization ability of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to cases of different scales of complexities, and the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified in comparison with four competitive algorithms.},

The main task of the supervisor in such a center is balancing the workload of each air traffic control officer by allocating airports accordingly. This study analyzes the supervisor&#39;s visual attention during interaction with a planning tool for their daily tasks. Five use cases were identified as the main tasks of the supervisor representing a mixture of planned and unplanned events. A mixed methods within-subjects design was used to assess the workload and eye-movement patterns associated with each of these use cases. In total, 15 professional air traffic control officers participated in the study. Workload and eye movement were analyzed independently in relation to the use cases but also in combination with each other. Across all use cases, a small correlation between subjective workload ratings and fixation duration was found, supporting previous findings of fixation duration being associated with information processing. Transitions between areas of interest on the supervisor planning tool provided valuable insights into the layout design of future supervisor planning tools.},

  abstract     = {Authentication is an important security issue for multi-access edge computing (MEC). To restrict user access from untrusted devices, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy has been proposed to authenticate users and devices simultaneously. However, when integrating BYOD policy into MEC authentication to improve security, issues of efficient binding and user-device conditional anonymity have not been well supported. To address these issues, we propose Bring Your Device Group (BYDG) policy by constructing efficient and privacy-preserving user-device authentication. Our core idea is to use key sequences generated by PUFs-based key derivation functions (KDFs) to not only construct efficient binding relationships, but also achieve conditional anonymity for device groups. Specifically, a flexible and secure binding method is first developed by leveraging Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to bind user with device groups. Each device’s CRT modulus is derived from the key sequence to construct many-to-many user-device binding relationships, which are managed in the form of on-chain Pedersen Commitment. Moreover, we design an identity anonymizing and tracing method for device groups. The key sequence is regarded as traceable device pseudo-identities, and then inserted into the cuckoo filter to reduce the on-chain storage overhead and mitigate malicious login attempts with low costs. Based on above two methods, the combination of Pedersen Commitment and Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge is used to achieve user-device authentication with conditional anonymity. The security analysis was presented to demonstrate important security properties. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented to conduct performance evaluation and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {The continuous evolution of malware is posing a serious threat to personal privacy, enterprise data security, and global network infrastructure. For example, attackers can use phishing emails, botnets, etc. to induce victims to execute malware for nefarious purposes such as stealing sensitive information. Therefore, it is significant to develop effective and efficient methods to detect malware. Towards this, most state-of-the-art methods are focused on learning-based method. In order to adapt to the characteristics of sample scarcity and dynamic evolution of malware detection tasks, few-shot class incremental learning has been proposed as an efficient pairwise solution. Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: 1) Catastrophic Forgetting: the erosion of existing knowledge by newly acquired knowledge during incremental learning. 2) Decision boundary confusion: after continuous multiple incremental sessions, the discriminative ability of the classification model is weakened. To address the above challenges, we propose a new Malware detection framework based on Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning, MalFSCIL, which utilizes a decoupled training strategy combined with a variational autocoder to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and designs a dynamic boundary delineation method based on class prototyping to achieve accurate delineation of incremental decision boundaries. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in malware detection and classification with high classification accuracy with open-source dataset and Internal enterprise dataset.},

A part of applications require labeled PSI in the unbalanced setting, where a server holds a label for each item in a set that is much larger than the set held by a client, and the client obtains the intersection and the corresponding labels. In this paper, we present a new concretely efficient labeled PSI protocol in the unbalanced setting, without using computation-heavy homomorphic encryption. Our protocol is based on Distributed Point Function (DPF) with hardware acceleration from fixed-key AES-NI, and has communication complexity linear in the size of a small set of the client and sublinear in the size of a large set of the server. Our protocol exploits two Oblivious Pesudorandom Function (OPRF) protocols, based on Diffle-Hellman PRFs or block ciphers, to achieve a trade-off between computation and communication. Our implementation demonstrates that our protocol outperforms the previous labeled and unbalanced PSI protocols. In particular, for two sets with respective $2^{24}$ and 1 items, where each item has a 32-byte label, our protocol takes 1.19 seconds for an end-to-end performance, resulting in $26 \times $ improvement compared to the state-of-the-art protocol by Cong et al.

  abstract     = {Sonar imagery is substantially degraded by speckle noise, making the task of despeckling crucial for improving image quality. Self-supervised despeckling methods, represented by blind-spot networks (BSNs), have shown promise in this regard. However, these methods consistently face significant challenges due to the spatial correlation of speckle noise and the inherent information loss within BSNs. In this paper, we introduce SEGSID, a BSN-based, semantic-guided sonar despeckling framework designed to address these challenges. Specifically, the SEGSID framework primarily comprises a Receptive Field Augmentation (RFA) module and a Global Semantic Enhancement (GSE) module. To address the noise spatial correlation, the RFA module is crafted to strategically extract valuable local information while avoiding the exploitation of noise-correlated pixels. Concurrently, the GSE module extracts the global semantic information from entire images and injects it into the extracted local features. This enhances BSNs’ ability to harness more comprehensive image information and compensates for their inherent information loss. Furthermore, to bolster efficiency, we employ knowledge distillation techniques to transfer the expertise from the trained SEGSID into a more streamlined network suitable for broader practical applications. Extensive experiments on three distinct sonar datasets demonstrate that SEGSID outperforms both traditional despeckling methods and state-of-the-art self-supervised despeckling techniques. The implementation is publicly accessible at https://github.com/deng-ai-lab/SEGSID.},

  abstract     = {Image fusion facilitates the integration of information from various source images of the same scene into a composite image, thereby benefiting perception, analysis, and understanding. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities in the field of computer vision, suggesting significant potential for application in image fusion. The forward process in the diffusion models requires the gradual addition of noise to the original data. However, typical unsupervised image fusion tasks (e.g., infrared-visible, medical, and multi-exposure image fusion) lack ground truth images (corresponding to the original data in diffusion models), thereby preventing the direct application of the diffusion models. To address this problem, we propose a versatile diffusion model-based unsupervised framework for image fusion, termed as VDMUFusion. In the proposed method, we integrate the fusion problem into the diffusion sampling process by formulating image fusion as a weighted average process and establishing appropriate assumptions about the noise in the diffusion model. To simplify the training process, we propose a multi-task learning framework that replaces the original noise prediction network, allowing for simultaneous prediction of noise and fusion weights. Meanwhile, our method employs joint training across various fusion tasks, which significantly improves noise prediction accuracy and yields higher quality fused images compared to training on a single task. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers very competitive performance across various image fusion tasks.

The light transport condition plays an important role in this task since changing the conditions will lead to different imaging models. Existing learning-based NLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport conditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality of the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging method that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a single network. We achieve this by inferring a latent light transport representation from the projection image and using this representation to modulate the network that reconstructs the hidden image from the projection image. We train a light transport encoder together with a vector quantizer to obtain the light transport representation. To further regulate this representation, we jointly learn both the reconstruction network and the reprojection network during training. A set of light transport modulation blocks is used to modulate the two jointly trained networks in a multi-scale way. Extensive experiments on a large-scale passive NLOS dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/JerryOctopus/NLOS-LTM.},

  abstract     = {Recently, neural networks have become the dominant approach to low-light image enhancement (LLIE), with at least one-third of them adopting a Retinex-related architecture. However, through in-depth analysis, we contend that this most widely accepted LLIE structure is suboptimal, particularly when addressing the non-uniform illumination commonly observed in natural images. In this paper, we present a novel variant learning framework, termed residual quotient learning, to substantially alleviate this issue. Instead of following the existing Retinex-related decomposition-enhancement-reconstruction process, our basic idea is to explicitly reformulate the light enhancement task as adaptively predicting the latent quotient with reference to the original low-light input using a residual learning fashion. By leveraging the proposed residual quotient learning, we develop a lightweight yet effective network called ResQ-Net. This network features enhanced non-uniform illumination modeling capabilities, making it more suitable for real-world LLIE tasks. Moreover, due to its well-designed structure and reference-free loss function, ResQ-Net is flexible in training as it allows for zero-reference optimization, which further enhances the generalization and adaptability of our entire framework. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the proposed residual quotient learning, and our trained ResQ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, a practical application in dark face detection is explored, and the preliminary results confirm the potential and feasibility of our method in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Image degradation caused by noise and blur remains a persistent challenge in imaging systems, stemming from limitations in both hardware and methodology. Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art deblurring and denoising methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

  abstract     = {With the evolution of storage and communication protocols, ultra-low bitrate image compression has become a highly demanding topic. However, all existing compression algorithms must sacrifice either consistency with the ground truth or perceptual quality at ultra-low bitrate. During recent years, the rapid development of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) has made it possible to balance these two goals. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method called Multimodal Image Semantic Compression (MISC), which consists of an LMM encoder for extracting the semantic information of the image, a map encoder to locate the region corresponding to the semantic, an image encoder generates an extremely compressed bitstream, and a decoder reconstructs the image based on the above information. Experimental results show that our proposed MISC is suitable for compressing both traditional Natural Sense Images (NSIs) and emerging AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) content. It can achieve optimal consistency and perception results while saving 50% bitrate, which has strong potential applications in the next generation of storage and communication.

Our analysis indicates that this approach can give rise to a bubble phenomenon in StyleNeRF. We argue that the style modulation introduces extraneous information into the implicit space, disrupting 3D implicit modeling and degrading image quality. We introduce HomuGAN, incorporating two key improvements. First, we disentangle the style modulation applied to implicit modeling from that utilized for super-resolution, thus alleviating the bubble phenomenon. Second, we introduce Cylindrical Spatial-Constrained Sampling and Parabolic Sampling. The latter sampling method, as an alternative method to the former, specifically contributes to the performance of foreground modeling of vehicles. We evaluate HomuGAN on publicly available datasets, comparing its performance to existing methods.

In this paper, we consider these two paradigms together for a better overall estimation. To this end, we propose a novel HYbrid REgressor (HYRE) that greatly benefits from the joint learning of both paradigms. The core of our HYRE is a hybrid intermediary across paradigms that provides complementary clues to each paradigm at the shared feature level and fuses their results at the part-based decision level, thereby bridging the gap between the two. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through both quantitative and qualitative experimental analyses, resulting in improvements for each approach and ultimately leading to better hybrid results.

It additionally implements a Monte Carlo algorithm specifically tailored for sampling from the resulting posterior distribution, based on an asymptotically exact data augmentation (AXDA). The proposed algorithm is an approximate instance of split Gibbs sampling (SGS) which embeds one Langevin Monte Carlo step. The proposed method is applied to common imaging tasks such as deblurring, inpainting and super-resolution, demonstrating its efficacy through extensive numerical experiments. These contributions advance Bayesian inference in imaging by leveraging data-driven regularization strategies within a probabilistic framework.},

  abstract     = {In real-world scenarios, the number of training samples across classes usually subjects to a long-tailed distribution. The conventionally trained network may achieve unexpected inferior performance on the rare class compared to the frequent class. Most previous works attempt to rectify the network bias from the data-level or from the classifier-level. Differently, in this paper, we identify that the bias towards the frequent class may be encoded into features, i.e., the rare-specific features which play a key role in discriminating the rare class are much weaker than the frequent-specific features. Based on such an observation, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, normalizing the parameters of Batch Normalization (BN) layer to explicitly rectify the feature bias. To achieve this end, we represent the Weight/Bias parameters of a BN layer as a vector, normalize it into a unit one and multiply the unit vector by a scalar learnable parameter. Through decoupling the direction and magnitude of parameters in BN layer to learn, the Weight/Bias exhibits a more balanced distribution and thus the strength of features becomes more even. Extensive experiments on various long-tailed recognition benchmarks (i.e., CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist 2018) show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts remarkably.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the radiation dose in CT scanning is important to alleviate the damage to the human health in clinical scenes. A promising way is to replace the normal-dose CT (NDCT) imaging by low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging with lower tube voltage and tube current. This often brings severe noise to the LDCT images, which adversely affects the diagnosis accuracy. Most of existing LDCT image denoising networks are trained either with synthetic LDCT images or real-world LDCT and NDCT image pairs with huge spatial misalignment. However, the synthetic noise is very different from the complex noise in real-world LDCT images, while the huge spatial misalignment brings inaccurate predictions of tissue structures in the denoised LDCT images. To well utilize real-world LDCT and NDCT image pairs for LDCT image denoising, in this paper, we introduce a new Patch Similarity Purification (PSP) strategy to construct high-quality training dataset for network training. Specifically, our PSP strategy first perform binarization for each pair of image patches cropped from the corresponding LDCT and NDCT image pairs. For each pair of binary masks, it then computes their similarity ratio by common mask calculation, and the patch pair can be selected as a training sample if their mask similarity ratio is higher than a threshold. By using our PSP strategy, each training set of our Rabbit and Patient datasets contain hundreds of thousands of real-world LDCT and NDCT image patch pairs with negligible misalignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our PSP strategy on purifying the training data and the effectiveness of training LDCT image denoising networks on our datasets. The code and dataset are provided at https://github.com/TuTusong/PSP.},

Due to the significance of this topic in various applications, researchers in the computer vision community have proposed many excellent models in the past few decades, and many models have begun to focus on natural daily life scenarios in recent years. However, existing mainstream models usually ignore a basic fact that human attention is a typical interdisciplinary concept. Specifically, the mainstream definition is direction-level or pixel-level, while many interdisciplinary studies argue the object-level definition. Additionally, the mainstream model structure converges to the dual-pathway architecture or its variants, while the majority of interdisciplinary studies claim attention is involved in the human-environment interaction procedure. Grounded on solid theories and studies in interdisciplinary fields including computer vision, cognition, neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, this paper proposes a fine-grained Human-Environment-Object Interaction (HEOI) model, which for the first time integrates multi-granularity human cues to predict human attention. Our model is explainable and lightweight, and validated to be effective by a wide range of comparison, ablation, and visualization experiments on two public datasets.},

  abstract     = {Accurately matching local features between a pair of images corresponding to the same 3D scene is a challenging computer vision task. Previous studies typically utilize attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs) with fully-connected graphs over keypoints within/across images for visual and geometric information reasoning. However, in the background of local feature matching, a significant number of keypoints are non-repeatable due to factors like occlusion and failure of the detector, and thus irrelevant for message passing. The connectivity with non-repeatable keypoints not only introduces redundancy, resulting in limited efficiency (quadratic computational complexity w.r.t. the keypoint number), but also interferes with the representation aggregation process, leading to limited accuracy. Aiming at the best of both worlds on accuracy and efficiency, we propose MaKeGNN, a sparse attention-based GNN architecture which bypasses non-repeatable keypoints and leverages matchable ones to guide compact and meaningful message passing. More specifically, our Bilateral Context-Aware Sampling (BCAS) Module first dynamically samples two small sets of well-distributed keypoints with high matchability scores from the image pair. Then, our Matchable Keypoint-Assisted Context Aggregation (MKACA) Module regards sampled informative keypoints as message bottlenecks and thus constrains each keypoint only to retrieve favorable contextual information from intra- and inter-matchable keypoints, evading the interference of irrelevant and redundant connectivity with non-repeatable ones. Furthermore, considering the potential noise in initial keypoints and sampled matchable ones, the MKACA module adopts a matchability-guided attentional aggregation operation for purer data-dependent context propagation. By these means, MaKeGNN outperforms the state-of-the-arts on multiple highly challenging benchmarks, while significantly reducing computational and memory complexity compared to typical attentional GNNs.},

ShareChat provides a safe and cultural community oriented space for users to generate and share content in their preferred Indian languages and dialects. Our subjective quality study, which is based on this data, supplies much needed cultural, visual, and language diversification to the overall shareable corpus of video quality data.

  abstract     = {Cross-view geo-localization aims to match the same geographic location from different view images, e.g., drone-view images and geo-referenced satellite-view images. Due to UAV cameras’ different shooting angles and heights, the scale of the same captured target building in the drone-view images varies greatly. Meanwhile, there is a difference in size and floor area for different geographic locations in the real world, such as towers and stadiums, which also leads to scale variants of geographic targets in the images. However, existing methods mainly focus on extracting the fine-grained information of the geographic targets or the contextual information of the surrounding area, which overlook the robust feature for scale changes and the importance of feature alignment. In this study, we argue that the key underpinning of this task is to train a network to mine a discriminative representation against scale variants. To this end, we design an effective and novel end-to-end network called Self-Adaptive Feature Extraction Network (Safe-Net) to extract powerful scale-invariant features in a self-adaptive manner. Safe-Net includes a global representation-guided feature alignment module and a saliency-guided feature partition module. The former applies an affine transformation guided by the global feature for adaptive feature alignment. Without extra region annotations, the latter computes saliency distribution for different regions of the image and adopts the saliency information to guide a self-adaptive feature partition on the feature map to learn a visual representation against scale variants. Experiments on two prevailing large-scale aerial-view geo-localization benchmarks, i.e., University-1652 and SUES-200, show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results. In addition, our proposed Safe-Net has a significant scale adaptive capability and can extract robust feature representations for those query images with small target buildings.

  abstract     = {Recent advances in learning-based methods have markedly enhanced the capabilities of image compression. However, these methods struggle with high bit-depth volumetric medical images, facing issues such as degraded performance, increased memory demand, and reduced processing speed. To address these challenges, this paper presents the Bit-Division based Lossless Volumetric Image Compression (BD-LVIC) framework, which is tailored for high bit-depth medical volume compression. The BD-LVIC framework skillfully divides the high bit-depth volume into two lower bit-depth segments: the Most Significant Bit-Volume (MSBV) and the Least Significant Bit-Volume (LSBV). The MSBV concentrates on the most significant bits of the volumetric medical image, capturing vital structural details in a compact manner. This reduction in complexity greatly improves compression efficiency using traditional codecs. Conversely, the LSBV deals with the least significant bits, which encapsulate intricate texture details. To compress this detailed information effectively, we introduce an effective learning-based compression model equipped with a Transformer-Based Feature Alignment Module, which exploits both intra-slice and inter-slice redundancies to accurately align features. Subsequently, a Parallel Autoregressive Coding Module merges these features to precisely estimate the probability distribution of the least significant bit-planes. Our extensive testing demonstrates that the BD-LVIC framework not only sets new performance benchmarks across various datasets but also maintains a competitive coding speed, highlighting its significant potential and practical utility in the realm of volumetric medical image compression.},

However, how to better match heterogeneous event-image data and exploit rich complementary cues from them still remains an open issue. In this paper, we align event-image modalities by proposing a motion adaptive event sampling method, and we revisit the cross-complementarities of event-image data to design a bidirectional-enhanced fusion framework. Specifically, this sampling strategy can adapt to different dynamic scenes and integrate aligned event-image pairs. Besides, we design an image-guided motion estimation unit for extracting explicit instance-level motions, aiming at refining the uncertain event clues to distinguish primary objects and background. Then, a semantic modulation module is devised to utilize the enhanced object motion to modify the image features. Coupled with these two modules, this framework learns both the high motion sensitivity of events and the full texture of images to achieve more accurate and robust tracking. The proposed method is easily embedded in existing tracking pipelines, and trained end-to-end. We evaluate it on four large benchmarks, i.e. FE108, VisEvent, FE240hz and CoeSot. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, and large improvements are pointed as contributions by our sampling strategy and fusion concept.},

Although existing work in this field makes substantial progress, these methods tend to overlook information in the background areas. However, this background information not only contains some important illumination cues but also plays a pivotal role in achieving lighting harmony between the face and the background after shadow elimination. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware Illumination Restoration Network (CIRNet) for portrait shadow removal. Our CIRNet consists of three stages. First, the Coarse Shadow Removal Network (CSRNet) mitigates the illumination discrepancies between shadow and non-shadow areas. Next, the Area-aware Shadow Restoration Network (ASRNet) predicts the illumination characteristics of shadowed areas by utilizing background context and non-shadow portrait context as references. Lastly, we introduce a Global Fusion Network to adaptively merge contextual information from different areas and generate the final shadow removal result. This approach leverages the illumination information from the background region while ensuring a more consistent overall illumination in the generated images. Our approach can also be extended to high-resolution portrait shadow removal and portrait specular highlight removal. Besides, we construct the first real facial shadow dataset for portrait shadow removal, consisting of 6200 pairs of facial images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the advantages of our proposed dataset as well as our method.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the well-known Ziv-Zakai family. The Ziv-Zakai technique relies on connecting the bound to an $\mathsf M$ -ary hypothesis testing problem. There are three versions of the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB): the first version relies on the so-called valley-filling function, the second one is a relaxation of the first bound which omits the valley-filling function, and the third one, namely the single-point ZZB (SZZB), replaces the integration present in the first two bounds with a single point maximization. The first part of this paper focuses on providing the most general version of the bounds. It is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. This makes the bounds applicable to discrete and mixed distributions. Then, the SZZB is extended to an $\mathsf M$ -ary setting and a version of it that holds for the multivariate setting is provided. In the second part, general properties of these bounds are provided. First, unlike the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound, it is shown that all the versions of the ZZB tensorize. Second, a characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, a complete low-noise asymptotic is provided under the assumptions of mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. In the low-noise, it is shown that the ZZB is generally tight, but there are examples for which the SZZB is not tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB without the valley-filling function, and, therefore, also the ZZB with the valley-filling function, are tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs it is shown that the ZZB with the valley-filling function is always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the valley-filling function. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are provided in which the bounds in the Ziv-Zakai family outperform other well-known Bayesian lower bounds, namely the Cramér-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.},

  abstract     = {Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence’s autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence’s Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only +1 and −1. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length 44, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer n is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length n that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise n is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$ , we found that the unequivocal lengths are 1–8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 22, 23, 26, 29, 37, and 38. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.},

  abstract     = {Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If f is a sequence, then the demerit factor of f is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing f to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay’s merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^{\ell } $ binary sequences of length $\ell $ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell $ . These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$ , the pth central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$ . This article shows that for every p, the pth central moment is $\ell ^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell $ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell $ tends to infinity, the pth standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.},

  abstract     = {Plagued by slow or failing workers (also known as stragglers), the speedup gain assumed by distributed learning often falls short. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to mitigating this straggling effect with coding-theoretic techniques, existing pioneering works often suffer from two issues: dense combination and inflexibility. In particular, a code that involves dense combination of sub-tasks may destroy sparsity and lead to heavy workload. In contrast, an inflexible code that conservatively designs its computation procedure according to the presumed maximum number of stragglers may entail unnecessary redundancy when the actual number of stragglers is small. To this end, a generic framework based on matrix splitting is proposed in this work to construct sparse and flexible codes. Specifically, by splitting an original sparse coding matrix into two sparser sub-matrices, a two-layer coded computation that maintains sparsity can be created accordingly. In the meantime, when the actual number of stragglers is small, the computation may be flexibly terminated at layer-one without executing layer-two, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Based on this framework, a novel flexible Bernoulli code is proposed. In addition, by deriving a lower bound in closed-form through the lens of a bipartite graph, its decoding probability is shown to be high and asymptotically one. Moreover, extensive simulations including an application in distributed learning of LeNet are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study the Distributed Wireless Link Scheduling (DWLS) problem: there is a set of n autonomous stations, called senders, each with a message to be delivered to some other station, called receiver. The names and locations of all stations are arbitrarily selected and unknown to each other, to mirror an arbitrary scenario that may occur in mobile communication. Each pair ((sender,receiver),message) is called a request, and the event of successfully delivering the message is called the realization of the request. In the DWLS problem, the requests are realized through wireless communication links (which is a conceptual notion of two nodes being capable of direct wireless delivery of a message) between the stations. The decision to transmit a message is made locally by each station. We consider networks where communication links may interfere with each other, where the interference is an arbitrary input function of each pair of links, customarily called affectance; if the total affectance of other links whose senders are currently transmitting is above a given threshold, the considered transmission is not successful. In the above context, we study the impact of the number of truly random bits used by each link/sender, on the length of the transmission schedules. Specifically, for any set L of n requests with maximum average affectance $A(L)$ , we present a deterministic algorithm (i.e., 0 random bits) and a randomized algorithm using $O(\log A(L)\log n)$ random bits per link. (In this abstract we present formulas in simplified forms, for brevity.) The lengths of their transmission schedules are $O(A(L)^{2}\log ^{3} n)$ and $O(A(L)\log n)$ , respectively. We then combine both approaches to get a randomized solution using $O(\log W \log n)$ truly random bits per station with schedules of length $O\left ({{\frac {A(L)^{2}}{W}\log n}}\right)$ , for any $W\le A(L)$ . To the best of our knowledge, our study is a first step towards understanding the trade-offs between randomness and time complexity of Link Scheduling under arbitrary interference. It is particularly important as currently used (in practice) wireless protocols are either deterministic or use a very small random seed of (truly) random bits.},

Previous works propose the use of MDS codes to treat the responses from malicious workers as errors and correct them using the error-correction properties of the code. This comes at the expense of increasing the replication, i.e., the number of workers each partial gradient is computed by. In this work, we propose a way to reduce the replication to $ {s} +1$ instead of $2 {s} +1$ in the presence of s malicious workers. Our method detects erroneous inputs from the malicious workers, transforming them into erasures. This comes at the expense of s additional local computations at the main node and additional rounds of light communication between the main node and the workers. We define a general framework and give fundamental limits for fractional repetition data allocations. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and local computation and incurs a communication cost that is asymptotically, in the size of the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound. We furthermore show how additional redundancy can be exploited to reduce the number of local computations and communication cost, or, alternatively, tolerate straggling workers.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies covert communication over channels with Action-Dependent State Information (ADSI) when the state is available either non-causally or causally at the transmitter. Covert communication refers to reliable communication between a transmitter and a receiver while ensuring a low probability of detection by an adversary, which we refer to as “warden”. It is well known that in a point-to-point Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC), it is possible to communicate on the order of $\sqrt {N}$ bits reliably and covertly over N channel uses while the transmitter and the receiver are required to share a secret key on the order of $\sqrt {N}$ bits. This paper studies achieving reliable and covert communication of positive rate, i.e., reliable and covert communication on the order of N bits in N channel uses, over a channel with ADSI while the transmitter has non-causal or causal access to the ADSI, and the transmitter and the receiver share a secret key of negligible rate. We derive achievable rates for both the non-causal and causal scenarios by using block-Markov encoding and secret key generation from the ADSI, which subsumes the best achievable rates for channels with random states. We also derive upper bounds, for both non-causal and causal scenarios, that meet our achievable rates for some special cases. As an application of our problem setup, we study covert communication over channels with rewrite options, which are closely related to recording covert information on memory, and show that a positive covert rate can be achieved in such channels. As a special case of our problem, we study the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and provide lower and upper bounds on the covert capacity that meet when the transmitter and the receiver share a secret key of sufficient rate and when the warden’s channel is noisier than the legitimate receiver channel. As another application of our problem setup, we show that cooperation can lead to a positive covert rate in Gaussian channels. A few other examples are also worked out in detail.},

The channel is governed by discrete memoryless and i.i.d. channel states, and the channel state information (CSI) is revealed to the encoders in a causal manner. The main results of this paper are inner and outer bounds of the capacity region, for which we investigate coding schemes incorporating wiretap coding and secret key agreements between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Two kinds of block Markov coding schemes are proposed. The first is a new coding scheme that uses backward decoding and the Wyner-Ziv coding, and the secret key is constructed from a lossy description of the CSI. The other is an extended version of an existing coding scheme for point-to-point wiretap channels with causal CSI. A numerical example shows that the achievable region given by the first coding scheme can be strictly larger than the second one. However, these two schemes do not outperform each other in general, and there exist some numerical examples in which each coding scheme achieves some rate pairs that cannot be achieved by another scheme. Our established inner bound reduces to some best-known results in the literature as special cases. We further investigate some capacity-achieving cases for state-dependent multiple access wiretap channels (SD-MAWCs) with degraded message sets. It turns out that the two coding schemes are both optimal in these cases.},

  abstract     = {We consider the federated submodel learning (FSL) problem in a distributed storage system. In the FSL framework, the full learning model at the server side is divided into multiple submodels such that each selected client needs to download only the required submodel(s) and upload the corresponding update(s) in accordance with its local training data. The server comprises multiple independent databases and the full model is stored across these databases. A fundamental problem in FSL is to enable these multiple databases at the parameter server to collectively maintain a consistent view of the global parameters to facilitate parallel computing across distributed clients. In addition, a practically implementable FSL scheme should possess high throughput, efficient performance, fault tolerance, sufficient privacy, adequate security, certifiable stability, elastic scalability and easy usability features. To specifically resolve the fault tolerance and adequate security issues together, we propose a novel coding mechanism coined ramp secure regenerating coding (RSRC), which is a synthesis of ramp secret sharing and secure regenerating code. This coding technique matches FSL perfectly, as the system performance can be further improved when the full model is stored using RSRC in a distributed manner. By incorporating and extending available techniques cleverly, our new RSRC-based distributed FSL approach that is constructed on top of our earlier two-database FSL scheme which uses private set union (PSU), achieves all of the aforementioned important features. A complete one-round FSL process consists of: 1) an FSL-PSU phase where the union of the submodel indices to be updated by the selected clients in the current round is determined, 2) an FSL-write phase where the updated submodels are written back to the databases, and 3) additional auxiliary phases where sufficient amounts of necessary common randomness are generated at both server and client sides.},

We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results.

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding the convergence and generalization properties of gradient-based methods for training overparameterized learning models. However, many aspects including the role of small random initialization and how the various parameters of the model are coupled during gradient-based updates to facilitate good generalization remain largely mysterious. A series of recent papers have begun to study this role for non-convex formulations of symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank PSD matrix from a few linear measurements. The underlying symmetry/PSDness is crucial to existing convergence and generalization guarantees for this problem. In this paper, we study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing problem where one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric rectangular low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements. We prove that an overparameterized model trained via factorized gradient descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating the measurements. We show that in this setting, factorized gradient descent enjoys two implicit properties: (1) coupling of the trajectory of gradient descent where the factors are coupled in various ways throughout the gradient update trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization property where the iterates show a propensity towards low-rank models despite the overparameterized nature of the factorized model. These two implicit properties in turn allow us to show that the gradient descent trajectory from small random initialization moves towards solutions that are both globally optimal and generalize well.},

  abstract     = {A more general formulation of the linear bandit problem is considered to allow for dependencies over time. Specifically, it is assumed that there exists an unknown $\mathbb {R}^{d}$ -valued stationary $\varphi $ -mixing sequence of parameters $(\theta _{t}, \; t \in \mathbb {N})$ which gives rise to payoffs. This instance of the problem can be viewed as a generalization of both the classical linear bandits with iid noise, and the finite-armed restless bandits. In light of the well-known computational hardness of optimal policies for restless bandits, an approximation is proposed whose error is shown to be controlled by the $\varphi $ -dependence between consecutive $\theta _{t}$ . An optimistic algorithm, called LinMix-UCB, is proposed for the case where $\theta _{t}$ has an exponential mixing rate. The proposed algorithm is shown to incur a sub-linear regret of $\mathcal {O}\left ({{\sqrt {d n\mathop {\mathrm {polylog}} (n) }}}\right)$ with respect to an oracle that always plays a multiple of $\mathbb {E}\;\theta _{t}$ . The main challenge in this setting is to ensure that the exploration-exploitation strategy is robust against long-range dependencies. The proposed method relies on Berbee’s coupling lemma to carefully select near-independent samples and construct confidence ellipsoids around empirical estimates of $\mathbb {E}\;\theta _{t}$ .},

To address this, we note score functions can often be well-approximated in graphical models through variational inference denoising algorithms. Furthermore, these algorithms can be efficiently represented by neural networks. We demonstrate this through examples, including Ising models, conditional Ising models, restricted Boltzmann machines, and sparse encoding models. Combined with off-the-shelf discretization error bounds for diffusion-based sampling, we provide an efficient sample complexity bound for diffusion-based generative modeling when the score function is learned by deep neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Non-malleable codes are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in settings where error correction and detection are impossible, and have found applications to several other cryptographic tasks. One of the strongest and most well-studied adversarial tampering models is 2-split-state tampering. Here, a codeword is split into two parts which are stored in physically distant servers, and the adversary can then independently tamper with each part using arbitrary functions. This model can be naturally extended to the secret sharing setting with several parties by having the adversary independently tamper with each share. Previous works on non-malleable coding and secret sharing in the split-state tampering model only considered the encoding of classical messages. Furthermore, until recent work by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2024 &amp; arXiv 2022), adversaries with quantum capabilities and shared entanglement had not been considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous schemes remain secure in this model. In this work, we introduce the notions of split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages secure against quantum adversaries with shared entanglement. Then, we present explicit constructions of such schemes that achieve low-error non-malleability. More precisely, for some constant $c\gt 0$ , we construct efficiently encodable and decodable split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages preserving entanglement with external systems and achieving security against quantum adversaries having shared entanglement with codeword length n, any message length at most $n^{c}$ , and error $\varepsilon =2^{-{n^{c}}}$ . In the easier setting of average-case non-malleability, we achieve efficient non-malleable coding with rate close to $1/11$ .},

This paper delves into the entanglement cost for discriminating two bipartite quantum states, employing positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) with positive partial transpose (PPT) to achieve optimal success probability through general entangled measurements. We first introduce two quantities called the spectral PPT-distance and relative spectral PPT-distance of a POVM to quantify the localness of a general measurement. We show these quantities are related to the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Following this, we establish bounds and develop SDP hierarchies to estimate the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs for any pair of states. Leveraging these results, we show that a pure state can be optimally discriminated against any other state with the assistance of a single Bell state. This study advances our understanding of the pivotal role played by entanglement in quantum state discrimination, serving as a crucial element in unlocking quantum data hiding against locally constrained measurements.},

Charlie uses local and pairwise shared randomness to compute a bivariate function of the measurement outcomes. The objective of three agents is to faithfully simulate the given distributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state while minimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new inner bound to the rate region using random structured POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic codes, and characterize the performance limit using single-letter quantum mutual information quantities. This new bound subsumes the largest known inner bound and improves upon it strictly for identified examples. One of the challenges in analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only pairwise independence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions.

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate the behavior of quantum entropy under quantum convolution and its application in quantifying magic. We first establish an entropic, quantum central limit theorem (q-CLT), where the rate of convergence is bounded by the magic gap. We also introduce a new quantum divergence based on quantum convolution, called the quantum Ruzsa divergence, to study the stabilizer structure of quantum states. We conjecture a “convolutional strong subadditivity” inequality, which leads to the triangle inequality for the quantum Ruzsa divergence. In addition, we propose two new magic measures, the quantum Ruzsa divergence of magic and quantum-doubling constant, to quantify the amount of magic in quantum states. Finally, by using the quantum convolution, we extend the classical, inverse sumset theory to the quantum case. These results shed new insight into the study of the stabilizer and magic states in quantum information theory.},

The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.},

A particularly important class of noise models is that of Pauli channels, as randomized compiling techniques can effectively bring any quantum channel to this form and are significantly more structured than general quantum channels. In this paper, we show fundamental lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning Pauli channels in diamond norm. We consider strategies that may not use auxiliary systems entangled with the input to the unknown channel and have to perform a measurement before reusing the channel. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{3n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ to learn an n-qubit Pauli channel. In particular, this shows that the recently introduced learning procedure by Flammia and Wallman (2020) is essentially optimal. In the adaptive setting, we show a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{2.5n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ for $\varepsilon ={\mathcal {O}}(2^{-n})$ , and a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{2n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ for any $\varepsilon \gt 0$ . This last lower bound holds even in a stronger model where in each step, before performing the measurement, the unknown channel may be used arbitrarily many times sequentially interspersed with unital operations.},

In the coherent case, where the channel state information (CSI) is known at the receiver’s side, we characterize the asymptotic capacity and derive the exact scaling in the extreme regimes of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of transmit antennas. In the non-coherent case, where the CSI is unknown but remains constant during T symbol periods, we first obtain the exact asymptotic capacity for $T\le 3$ . Then, we propose a scheme involving uniform signaling in the covariance space and derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the capacity for an arbitrary block size T. Furthermore, we propose a genie-aided upper bound where the channel is revealed to the receiver. We show that the upper and lower bounds coincide when T is large. In the low SNR regime, we derive the asymptotic capacity up to a vanishing term, which, remarkably, matches our capacity lower bound.},

  abstract     = {In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a K user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of the Shuffle phase of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. We approach this problem by decomposing it into distinctive stages that help identify key ingredients of the overall solution. The novel elements that emerge from the first stage, called broadcast with groupcast messages, include an outer maximum distance separable (MDS) code structure at the transmitter, and an algorithm for iteratively determining groupcast-optimal reconfigurable antenna switching patterns at the receiver to achieve intra-message (among the symbols of the same message) alignment. The next stage, called unicast with side-information, reveals optimal inter-message (among symbols of different messages) alignment patterns to exploit side-information, and by a relabeling of messages, connects to the desired MapReduce setting.},

  abstract     = {The goal of the trace reconstruction problem is to recover a string $\mathbf {x}\in \{0,1\}^{n}$ given many independent traces of x, where a trace is a subsequence obtained from deleting bits of x independently with some given probability $p\in [0,1$ ). A recent result of Chase (STOC 2021) shows how x can be determined (in exponential time) from $\exp ({O}(n^{1/5})\log ^{5} n)$ traces. This is the state-of-the-art result on the sample complexity of trace reconstruction. In this paper we consider two kinds of algorithms for the trace reconstruction problem. We first observe that the bound of Chase, which is based on statistics of arbitrary length-k subsequences, can also be obtained by considering the “k-mer statistics”, i.e., statistics regarding occurrences of contiguous k-bit strings (a.k.a, k-mers) in the initial string x, for $k = 2n^{1/5}$ . Mazooji and Shomorony (arXiv.2210.10917) show that such statistics (called k-mer density map) can be estimated within $\varepsilon $ accuracy from $ {\mathrm {poly}} (n, 2^{k}, 1/ {\varepsilon })$ traces. We call an algorithm to be k-mer-based if it reconstructs x given estimates of the k-mer density map. Such algorithms essentially capture all the analyses in the worst-case and smoothed-complexity models of the trace reconstruction problem we know of so far. Our first, and technically more involved, result shows that any k-mer-based algorithm for trace reconstruction must use $\exp (\Omega (n^{1/5} \sqrt {\log n}))$ traces, thus establishing the optimality of this number of traces. The analysis of this result also shows that the analysis technique used by Chase (STOC 2021) is essentially tight, and hence new techniques are needed in order to improve the worst-case upper bound. This result is shown by considering an appropriate class of real polynomials, that have been previously studied in the context of trace estimation (De, O’Donnell, Servedio. Annals of Probability 2019; Nazarov, Peres. STOC 2017), and proving that two of these polynomials are very close to each other on an arc in the complex plane. Our proof of the proximity of such polynomials uses new technical ingredients that allow us to focus on just a few coefficients of these polynomials. Our second, simple, result considers the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which specifically picks the source string that has the maximum likelihood to generate the samples (traces). We show that the MLE algorithm uses a nearly optimal number of traces, i.e., up to a factor of n in the number of samples needed for an optimal algorithm, and show that this factor of n loss may be necessary under general “model estimation” settings.},

Finding the error locator polynomial is one of the key steps in the error correction procedure of RS codes. Modular Approach (MA) is an effective algorithm for solving the Welch-Berlekamp (WB) key-equation problem to find the error locator polynomial that needs $2t$ steps, where t is the error correction capability. In this paper, we first present a new MA algorithm that only requires $2e$ steps and then propose two fast decoding algorithms for RS codes based on our MA algorithm, where e is the number of errors and $e\leq t$ . We propose the Improved-Frequency Domain Modular Approach (I-FDMA) algorithm that needs $2e$ steps to solve the error locator polynomial and present our first decoding algorithm based on the I-FDMA algorithm. We show that, compared with the existing methods based on MA algorithms, our I-FDMA algorithm can effectively reduce the decoding complexity of RS codes when $e\lt t$ . Furthermore, we propose the $t_{0}$ -Shortened I-FDMA ( $t_{0}$ -SI-FDMA) algorithm ( $t_{0}$ is a predetermined even number less than $2t-1$ ) based on the new termination mechanism to solve the error number e quickly. We propose our second decoding algorithm based on the SI-FDMA algorithm for RS codes and show that the multiplication complexity of our second decoding algorithm is lower than our first decoding algorithm (the I-FDMA decoding algorithm) when $2e\lt t_{0}+1$ .},

This generalization which we term “higher-order staircase codes” arises from the marriage of two distinct combinatorial objects: difference triangle sets and finite-geometric nets, which have typically been applied separately to code design. We demonstrate one possible realization of these codes, obtaining powerful, high-rate, low-error-floor, and low-complexity coding schemes based on simple iterative syndrome-domain decoding of coupled Hamming component codes. We anticipate that the proposed codes could improve performance–complexity–latency tradeoffs in high-throughput communications applications, most notably fiber-optic, in which classical staircase codes and zipper codes have been applied. We consider the construction of difference triangle sets having minimum scope and sum-of-lengths, which lead to memory-optimal realizations of higher-order staircase codes. These results also enable memory reductions for early families of convolutional codes constructed from difference triangle sets.},

  abstract     = {We address the multi-node failure repair challenges for MDS array codes. Presently, two primary models are employed for multi-node repairs: the centralized model where all failed nodes are restored in a singular data center, and the cooperative model where failed nodes acquire data from auxiliary nodes and collaborate amongst themselves for the repair process. This paper focuses on the cooperative model, and we provide explicit constructions of optimal MDS array codes with d helper nodes under this model. The sub-packetization level of our new codes is $(d-k+h)(d-k+1)^{\lceil n/2 \rceil }$ where h is the number of failed nodes, k the number of information nodes, and n the code length. This improves upon recent constructions by Liu et al. (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 69, 2023).},

A related bound for covering codes is known as the van Wee bound. Codes that meet this bound will be called nearly perfect covering codes. This work studies such codes with covering radius 1. It is shown that the set of these codes can be partitioned into three families, depending on the distribution of the Hamming distances between neighboring codewords. General properties of these code families are presented, including a characterization of their weight and distance distributions. Constructions of codes for each of the families are presented.

When the matrix X is input, the channel outputs $Y=A(X+W)$ where A is a uniformly chosen $n\times n$ invertible matrix over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ and where W is a uniformly chosen $n\times m$ matrix over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ of rank t. Silva et al. considered the case when $2n\leq m$ . They determined the asymptotic capacity of the AMMC when t, n and m are fixed and $q\rightarrow \infty $ . They also determined the leading term of the capacity when q is fixed, and t, n and m grow linearly. We generalise these results, showing that the condition $2n\geq m$ can be removed. (Our formula for the capacity falls into two cases, one of which generalises the $2n\geq m$ case.) We also improve the error term in the case when q is fixed.},

  abstract     = {Batched sparse (BATS) codes were proposed as a reliable communication solution for networks with packet loss. In the finite-length regime, the error probability of BATS codes under belief propagation (BP) decoding has been studied in the literature and can be analyzed by recursive formulae. However, all existing analyses have not considered precoding or have treated the BATS code and the precode as two separate entities. In this paper, we analyze the word-wise error probability of finite-length BATS codes with a precode under joint decoding, including BP decoding and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. The joint BP decoder performs peeling decoding on a joint Tanner graph constructed from both the BATS and the precode Tanner graphs, and the joint ML decoder solves a single linear system with all linear constraints implied by the BATS code and the precode. We derive closed-form upper bounds on the error probability for both decoders. Specifically, low-density parity-check (LDPC) precodes are used for BP decoding, and any generic precode can be used for ML decoding. Even for BATS codes without a precode, the derived upper bound for BP decoding is more accurate than the approximate recursive formula, and easier to compute than the exact recursive formula. The accuracy of the two upper bounds has been verified by many simulation results. Based on the two upper bounds, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the degree distribution of LDPC-precoded BATS codes, which improves BP performance, ML performance, or both. In our experiments, to transmit 128 packets over a line network with packet loss, the optimized LDPC-precoded BATS codes reduce the transmission overhead to less than 50% of that of standard BATS codes under comparable decoding complexity constraints.},

  abstract     = {A simple, recently observed generalization of the classical Singleton bound to list-decoding asserts that rate R codes are not list-decodable using list-size L beyond an error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R)$ (the Singleton bound being the case of $L=1$ , i.e., unique decoding). We prove that in order to approach this bound for any fixed $L \gt 1$ , one needs exponential alphabets. Specifically, for every $L\gt 1$ and $R\in (0,1)$ , if a rate R code can be list-of-L decoded up to error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R -\varepsilon)$ , then its alphabet must have size at least $\exp (\Omega _{L,R}(1/\varepsilon))$ . This is in sharp contrast to the situation for unique decoding where certain families of rate R algebraic-geometry (AG) codes over an alphabet of size $O(1/\varepsilon ^{2})$ are unique-decodable up to error fraction $(1-R-\varepsilon)/2$ . Our bounds hold even for subconstant $\varepsilon \ge 1/n$ , implying that any code exactly achieving the L-th generalized Singleton bound requires alphabet size $2^{\Omega _{L,R}(n)}$ . Previously this was only known only for $L=2$ under the additional assumptions that the code is both linear and MDS. Our lower bound is tight up to constant factors in the exponent—with high probability random codes (or, as shown recently, even random linear codes) over $\exp (O_{L}(1/\varepsilon))$ -sized alphabets, can be list-of-L decoded up to error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R -\varepsilon)$ .},

  abstract     = {In conventional DNA synthesis machines, usually many strands are synthesized in parallel by iterating through a supersequence $\boldsymbol {s}$ and adding in each cycle the next nucleotide to a programmable subset of the strands. The length of $\boldsymbol {s}$ determines the number of the cycles, hence the time and the cost of the synthesis process. Recently, in order to reduce the number of synthesis cycles, researchers have suggested to append in each cycle a shortmer, i.e., a sequence of nucleotides, instead of a single one. The present work studies this synthesis technique from a theoretical point of view. In particular, it discusses which shortmers are the best to use (in order to reduce the number of cycles), and how to calculate the number of cycles required to synthesize in parallel a set of strands using a given set of shormers. Lastly, and following a previously described connection between the DNA synthesis problem and costly constrained graphs, this paper investigates calculating the capacity of non-deterministic costly constrained graphs.},

Twenty five years later, an infinite family of binary self-dual cyclic codes with lengths $n_{i}$ and minimum distances $d_{i} \geq \frac {1}{2} \sqrt {n_{i}+2}$ was presented in a paper of IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 55, 2009. However, no infinite family of Euclidean self-dual binary cyclic codes whose minimum distances have the square-root lower bound and no infinite family of Euclidean self-dual nonbinary cyclic codes whose minimum distances have a lower bound better than the square-root lower bound are known in the literature. In this paper, an infinite family of Euclidean self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\mathrm { F}}_{2^{s}}$ with a square-root-like lower bound is constructed. An infinite subfamily of this family consists of self-dual binary cyclic codes with the square-root lower bound. Another infinite subfamily of this family consists of self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\mathrm { F}}_{2^{s}}$ with a lower bound better than the square-root bound for $s \geq 2$ . Consequently, two breakthroughs in coding theory are made in this paper. An infinite family of self-dual binary cyclic codes with a square-root-like lower bound is also presented in this paper. An infinite family of Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes over the fields ${\mathrm { F}}_{2^{2s}}$ with a square-root-like lower bound and an infinite family of Euclidean self-dual linear codes over ${\mathrm { F}}_{q}$ with $q \equiv 1 \pmod {4}$ with a square-root-like lower bound are also constructed in this paper.},

Our construction considers the gaps in a Weierstrass semigroup of a rational place in an algebraic function field to achieve a similar increase in the rate.

We first provide some general results on minimal pseudocodewords with support size 3 of a binary parity-check matrix. We also prove a lower bound on the minimum binary symmetric channel (BSC) pseudoweight of a binary parity-check matrix. Then we prove that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimal pseudocodewords of certain types whose support sizes are larger than 3. Interestingly enough, the BSC pseudoweight of all these minimal pseudocodewords is 2. Using this fact as well as the above-mentioned lower bound, we further prove that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimum BSC pseudoweight 2. Moreover, the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) pseudoweight of all these minimal pseudocodewords is 3. Based on numerical observations, we conjecture that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimum AWGNC pseudoweight 3. Finally, we provide more properties of a subset of minimal pseudocodewords of a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental limits on the error probabilities of a family of decentralized detection algorithms (e.g., the social learning rule proposed by Lalitha et al., 2018) over directed graphs are investigated. In decentralized detection, a network of nodes locally exchanging information about the samples they observe with their neighbors to collectively infer the underlying unknown hypothesis. Each node in the network weighs the messages received from its neighbors to form its private belief and only requires knowledge of the data generating distribution of its observation. In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al., 2018 achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities. To elucidate the price of decentralization, further analysis on the higher-order asymptotics of the error probability is conducted. It turns out that the price is at most a constant multiplicative factor in the error probability, equivalent to an $o(1/t)$ additive gap in the error exponent, where t is the number of samples observed by each agent in the network and the number of rounds of information exchange. This constant depends on the network connectivity and captures the level of network imbalance. Results of simulation on the error probability supporting our learning rule are shown. Further discussions and extensions of results are also presented.},

  abstract     = {3D occupancy perception holds a pivotal role in recent vision-centric autonomous driving systems by converting surround-view images into integrated geometric and semantic representations within dense 3D grids. Nevertheless, current models still encounter two main challenges: modeling depth accurately in the 2D-3D view transformation stage, and overcoming the lack of generalizability issues due to sparse LiDAR supervision. To address these issues, this paper presents GEOcc, a Geometric-Enhanced Occupancy network tailored for vision-only surround-view perception. Our approach is three-fold: 1) Integration of explicit lift-based depth prediction and implicit projection-based transformers for depth modeling, enhancing the density and robustness of view transformation. 2) Utilization of mask-based encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained semantic predictions; 3) Adoption of context-aware self-training loss functions in the pertaining stage to complement LiDAR supervision, involving the re-rendering of 2D depth maps from 3D occupancy features and leveraging image reconstruction loss to obtain denser depth supervision besides sparse LiDAR ground-truths. Our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with the least image resolution needed and the most weightless image backbone compared with current models, marking an improvement of 3.3% due to our proposed contributions. Comprehensive experimentation also demonstrates the consistent superiority of our method over baselines and alternative approaches.

  abstract     = {Flight safety incidents, such as hard landings and tail strike risks, represent critical concerns during the landing phase. Although Quick Access Recorder (QAR) systems collect extensive multivariate flight data, previous studies have faced challenges in effectively modeling the complex interdependencies between flight parameters, which has limited their ability to predict multiple safety incidents simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, named MDGNN, to capture hidden spatio-temporal dependencies and predict both hard landing and tail strike risk incidents. Specifically, we employ temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to extract both localized representations and long-term temporal trends from multivariate flight data, ensuring the standardization of flight parameters across varying frequencies. Additionally, we are the first to construct a dynamic graph to model temporal relationships, applying a dynamic graph neural network and a temporal convolution module to accurately capture intricate spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on 37,904 Airbus A320 flight samples demonstrate that the MDGNN model surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a case study visualizing key flight parameters highlights the model’s ability to reveal the root causes of safety exceedances, offering valuable insights for flight safety analysis.},

The presence of dynamic objects incurs camera motion estimation errors, motion blur, and occlusions, which induce significant challenges for network training. To address these issues, we introduce EDS-Depth, a self-supervised learning framework, that improves monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes. Firstly, we propose a novel TCE (Temporal Continuity Enhancement) strategy to reduce camera motion estimation errors and motion blur caused by dynamic objects. Video frames are interpolated to generate more continuous frames in order to smooth dynamic changes and enrich motion details. Secondly, we design a novel IPDM (Iterative Pseudo Depth Masking) module to address inaccurate object motion and occlusions in dynamic scenes. The module integrates multiple optical flows from different frames for triangulation, generating optimal depth as pseudo-supervision labels in dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EDS-Depth, which surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods, particularly in dynamic scenes.},

The final dataset includes forty variables related to pedestrian characteristics, environmental circumstances, and vehicle specifications. Pedestrian injury severity was divided into three categories: fatal, injury, and no injury. The novelty of this approach lies in the application of explainable AI (XAI), specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, to interpret the AutoML model’s predictions. This combination not only addressed the opaqueness typically associated with AI “black box” models but also illuminated the critical variables influencing pedestrian injury severity outcomes. The results revealed that the weighted ensemble model emerged as top performers, showcasing high accuracy with minimal prediction times, demonstrating the potential of ensemble methods in improving prediction outcomes by integrating the strengths of various individual models. Furthermore, the global and local explainability analyses provided by SHAP values afforded us an in-depth understanding of the variables influencing pedestrian injury severity. This dual-level explanation offered valuable insights into the complex dynamics at play, ranging from pedestrian impairment and driver condition to environmental variables like lighting and weather conditions. These findings underscore the importance of specific variables in crash outcomes, offering actionable intelligence for targeted interventions.},

This paper presents a performance-prescribed optimal control algorithm using control barrier function (CBF)-based reinforcement learning (RL) to address the above problem, which contains two key contributions. First, a special CBF-based argument term is developed and embedded into the reward function to characterize environmental feedback regarding the risk of violating constraints, which enables the controller to confine enclosing errors within declared boundaries with minimal intervention. Second, a critic-only neural network is utilized to synthesize the optimal control policy, where a novel fixed-time updating law is presented to accelerate the weight convergence to ideal values within a fixed settling time, thereby enhancing the online learning ability and further improving control performance. Theoretical outcomes related to learning convergence, safety, stability, and robustness are rigorously verified. Simulations reveal that the proposed strategy outperforms the previously designed enclosing controllers based on the non-RL and RL ways in terms of complying with prescribed safety constraints and optimizing long-term performance.},

This work studies the optimal real-time bidding strategy for an EV aggregator. Since the charging process of EVs is time-coupled, it is necessary for EV aggregators to consider future operational conditions (e.g., future EV arrivals) when deciding the current bidding strategy. However, accurately forecasting future operational conditions is challenging under the inherent uncertainties. Hence, there demands a real-time bidding strategy based solely on the up-to-date information, which is the main goal of this work. We start by developing an online optimal EV charging management algorithm for the EV aggregator via Lyapunov optimization. Based on this, an optimal real-time bidding strategy (bidding function and bounds) for the aggregator is derived. Then, an efficient yet practical algorithm is proposed to obtain the bidding strategy. It shows that the cost of the aggregator is nearly offline optimal with the proposed bidding strategy. Moreover, the wholesale electricity market clearing result aligns with the individual aggregator’s optimal charging strategy given the prices. Case studies against several benchmarks are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high line-of-sight communications have been explored as a complement to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), particularly when ground Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is dysfunctional resulting from natural disasters. To protect the communication security and integrity of this air-ground integrated networks created in an untrusted and open wireless environment, authentication and key agreement (AKA) is an essential mechanism to establish a secure communication channel by negotiating a session key. Nonetheless, general AKA protocols are typically not ideal for time-sensitive and computing-intensive UAVs-assisted IoVs emergency rescue, in that they are unable to simultaneously satisfy efficiency and key security requirements including accountability, resilience, thresholds changeability, shares verifiability, group adaptability, and key update. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an accountable group authentication and key agreement (GAKA) protocol with changeable thresholds and verifiable shares supporting adaptive group memberships and updatable keys (i.e. SecER). To safeguard accurate rescue decisions for ground ECVs enabled by reliable collaboration among multiple UAVs, we propose a pseudonym mechanism that aims to provide accountability for UAVs. To achieve resilience and thresholds changeability, our SecER utilizes secret sharing coupled with random parameters to seamlessly transform our GAKA protocol into one running with a new threshold in one round (i.e. round-optimal), rather than two rounds. Finally, verifiable parameters and updatable keys are respectively applied to counter deception attacks caused by maliciously distributed shares and to support adaptive network topology (i.e. UAVs joining and leaving). Extensive simulations show that compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our SecER is superior in balancing security and efficiency.},

This approach quantifies the probability of positioning failure, which is the probability of the position estimator being outside a safety-region, and compares it against an application specific requirement. The design of positioning algorithms for safety-critical applications, such as automated/autonomous vehicles, should consider the dependence between parameter or state estimation and statistical hypothesis testing for model misspecifications in the evaluation of positioning safety. If this dependence is not considered, as this article shows, the conclusions drawn from the positioning safety analysis might be overly-optimistic. Therefore, this article focuses on the aforementioned dependence through a vehicle positioning scenario based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Detection, Identification, and Adaptation (DIA) method for misspecifications in the motion and measurement models. Grounded in the distributional theory for the DIA method, our positioning safety analysis utilizes the conditional probability density functions (PDFs) of the combined EKF and DIA position error, which are generally nonnormal. We compute the probability of vehicle positioning failure in two cases 1) when the dependence is considered and 2) when it is not, to quantify the over-optimism introduced by ignoring this dependence. Finally, we present our conclusions and recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Although the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been successfully applied in search and rescue operations for locating lost or damaged vehicles due to its significance in precise positioning, there are still challenges. To enhance the accuracy of localization, positioning can be done with the collaborative estimation provided by neighbouring mobile terminals as reference vehicles. Meanwhile, there are security and privacy implications associated with such an approach – e.g., potential for privacy leakage of both the positioning-related data (e.g., positions of reference vehicles, distances between reference vehicles and the target vehicle) and the estimated positions of the target vehicle. Such concerns are important to address in deployments for sensitive applications such as defense. For example, the location information of a damage vehicle on the battlefield should only be securely evaluated by search unit and be successfully decrypted by an authorized set of officers in rescue unit with the required authorization levels. Accordingly, the threshold should be flexibly allocated and changed for types of security surroundings. However, existing techniques of threshold public key homomorphic encryption approaches are not only computationally and communication intensive, but merely support a fixed pre-defined threshold. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient multilevel threshold changeable homomorphic data encapsulation mechanism (MCTh-HDEM). In MCTh-HDEM, we leverage the technique of multilevel threshold changeable secret sharing in order to support both batch encryption and lightweight matrix calculations in the encrypted domain, and also multilevel threshold changeable decryption. Then, we design a lightweight privacy-preserving vehicle positioning scheme (PPVPS), by refining our proposed MCTh-HDEM. The position of the lost and damaged target vehicle on the battlefield would be efficiently inferred by a set of reference vehicles in search unit while protecting positioning related data, and the target vehicle location can be flexibly decrypted by rescue unit. Finally, we give the formal security proofs of our proposed MCTh-HDEM and PPVPS. The performance evaluation and extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposal.},

This paper introduces a Digital Twin (DT)-based collaboration architecture for resource management in UAV swarms, connecting realistic task crowdsourcing and virtual traffic flow scheduling to achieve a complementary multi-UAV swarm allocation. We propose an intelligent dynamic task crowdsourcing scheme that manages the swarm scale and membership configuration of multiple UAV swarms based on theoretical evaluation results. The architecture constructs DTs of UAV swarms and shifts the scheduling of traffic flow paths to the virtual world, thereby sidestepping the overhead of routing configuration and network reorganisation. With the aid of a traffic flow allocation algorithm based on Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC), the virtual swarm pre-schedules traffic flows and assesses end-to-end delay theoretically, so as to achieve a collaborative deployment of sensing, computational, and communication resources within the swarm. The simulation results substantiate that our architecture can uphold a 90% achievement ratio for task requirements while keeping UAV costs comparable to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Technological advancements focus on developing comfortable and acceptable driving characteristics in autonomous vehicles. Present driving functions predominantly possess predefined parameters, and there is no universally accepted driving style for autonomous vehicles. While driving may be technically safe and the likelihood of road accidents is reduced, passengers may still feel insecure due to a mismatch in driving styles between the human and the autonomous system. Incorporating driving style preferences into automated vehicles enhances acceptance, reduces uncertainty, and poses the opportunity to expedite their adoption. Despite the increased research focus on driving styles, there remains a need for comprehensive studies investigating how variations in the driving context impact the assessment of automated driving functions. Therefore, this work evaluates lateral driving style preferences for autonomous vehicles on rural roads, considering different weather and traffic situations. A controlled study was conducted with a variety of German participants utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator. The participants experienced four different driving styles, including mimicking of their own driving behavior under two weather conditions. A notable preference for a more passive driving style became evident based on statistical analyses of participants’ responses during and after the drives. This study could not confirm the hypothesis that people prefer to be driven by mimicking their own driving behavior. Furthermore, the study illustrated that weather conditions and oncoming traffic substantially influence the perceived comfort during autonomous rides. The gathered dataset is openly accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhaselberger/idcld-subject-study-on-driving-style-preferences.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based techniques hold considerable promise in achieving human-like autonomous driving. However, one deployed policy encounters difficulties in satisfying the drivers’ diverse decision-making preferences simultaneously. Meanwhile, training personalized policies for each driver from scratch is time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a human-guided continual learning framework, wherein the human drivers could real-time take over a deployed policy when it performs unsatisfactorily, and the autonomous vehicle (AV) agent would automatically acquire human demonstrations and dynamically alter itself in accordance with personalized decision-making preference. Furthermore, a priority experience memory-enabled elastic weight consolidation (PEM-EWC) mechanism is developed to prevent the AV agent from overfitting to a limited number of human demonstrations and catastrophically forgetting its acquired fundamental driving abilities. Driver-in-the-loop simulations and real-world experiments are conducted in representative autonomous driving decision-making scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the superior equilibrium of our proposed approach in terms of driving safety, human likeness, and training efficiency, compared to other baselines, which suggests that it provides a promising solution for personalized decision-making in autonomous driving.

First, we establish the path tracking control system for the tractor-trailer truck, incorporating the hitch angle and hitch angle rate into the system state to minimize trailer sway. On this basis, an adaptive robust preview control method is developed, integrating feedforward and feedback control to improve tracking performance and robustness. The feedforward controller is designed to proactively minimize tracking errors. In the feedback control, an adaptive observer-based $H_{\infty } $ robust feedback controller is developed to limit the effects of stochastic disturbances, where an innovative preview distance model, considering variable vehicle velocity and path curvature, is applied to achieve preview control. Then, based on the $H_{\infty } $ theory, the design criterion of the proposed feedback controller is established, where bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) is transformed into linear matrix inequality (LMI) to solve the observer and controller gains. Additionally, the fuzzy algorithm is performed to enable the feedback controller to adapt to variable velocity. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a hardware-in-the-loop platform.

  abstract     = {Traffic flow imputation aims to estimate missing flow values within a traffic network. While machine learning methods have been widely applied to this challenge and outperformed conventional approaches, the current literature must explore the potential benefits of integrating network indices into traffic flow imputation. Network indices encompass attributes associated with nodes and links, such as centrality measures, which provide valuable insights into the network’s structure. This study proposes adopting network indices in addition to link features to enhance the accuracy of traffic flow imputation. Our proposed feature set incorporates network indices from the original graph and its line graph transformation, alongside inherent link features. Subsequently, we employ a correlation matrix analysis to discern relationships between features, thus excluding dependent features. We estimate missing traffic flow based on the proposed feature set by utilizing five state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods, including KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT). The results of testing our proposed method across various traffic networks with varying sizes (Sioux Falls, Anaheim, and Chicago) and under different missing rates (0.1-0.9) consistently demonstrate that each machine learning method experiences an improvement in imputation accuracy when augmented with network indices. More specifically, on the Anaheim dataset, our proposed approach improves by 8.74% with KNN, 3.26% with Random Forest, 2.69% with XGBoost, 4.88% with GCN, and 4.85% with GAT, compared to using only link properties as the feature set, in terms of PCC. Our study also includes further investigations into feature importance and computational cost analysis of network indices.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian intent prediction is critical for autonomous driving, as accurately predicting crossing intentions helps prevent collisions and ensures the safety of both pedestrians and passengers. Recent research has focused on vision-based deep neural networks for this task, but challenges remain. First, current methods suffer from low efficiency in multi-feature fusion and unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. Additionally, real-time performance is essential in practical applications, so the efficiency of the algorithm is crucial. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture, Dual-STGAT, which uses a dual-level spatio-temporal graph network to extract pedestrian pose and scene interaction features, reducing information loss and improving feature fusion efficiency. The model captures key features of pedestrian behavior and the surrounding environment through two modules: the Pedestrian Module and the Scene Module. The Pedestrian Module extracts pedestrian motion features using a spatio-temporal graph attention network, while the Scene Module models interactions between pedestrians and surrounding objects by integrating visual, semantic, and motion information through a graph network. Extensive experiments conducted on the PIE and JAAD datasets show that Dual-STGAT achieves over 90% accuracy in pedestrian crossing intention prediction, with inference latency close to 5ms, making it well-suited for large-scale production autonomous driving systems that demand both performance and computational efficiency.},

However, directly applying traditional single-authority CP-ABE schemes may result in single-point performance bottleneck. Besides, the secrets of the whole system may be leaked if any node is attacked. To solve these challenging tasks, we proposed MA-CP-ABE-CRF, a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme with cryptographic reverse firewalls. The system is designed to grant vehicles fine-grained access control by encrypting data under vehicle attributes. Besides, load balancing of authorization in distributed systems is achieved based on the characteristic of multi-authority. Meanwhile, specific nodes are equipped with cryptographic reverse firewalls (CRFs) to prevent information leakage. As the first scheme with the above features for Internet of vehicles, the system achieves adaptive CPA-security and ASA-security.

In this work, the synthetic image generation model (SIGM) is proposed to generate images to synthesize rain and fog effects for testing CFs. First, to synthesize the rain blur effects on raw images, the geometric-physical fusion model is proposed based on the properties of raindrop microparticles and vehicle features. In this model, the position distribution of raindrops is determined by the geometric model part, and the image pixel effects are realized by the physical model part. Second, the atmospheric scattering model is used to synthesize the fog effect and contains two parts: an airlight estimation model to estimate airlight values and a transmittance estimation model, where the corrected image depth and fog microphysical information based on the Mie theory are used to determine the fog transmittance. Finally, SIGM is validated through real rain and fog in image quality, testing CFs with synthetic images and videos. The result absolute error sum obtained with SIGM (0.45) is smaller than that of the simulation software (0.57) and another synthetic method (0.65), and all unrecognized targets identified by SIGM match the real test results, whereas both the simulation software and another synthetic method fail to accurately test CF. The experimental results indicate that the proposed SIGM has higher authenticity and reliability than testing using the simulation platform and has higher efficiency, controllability, repeatability, and safety than testing using real vehicle.},

An advanced multi-frequency impedance measurement (MFIM) system was used to operate the IL sensors. For a passing vehicle, the impedance of every IL sensor at three different operating frequencies is computed and finally recorded at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. Each of the 12 recorded signals provides a complex-value vehicle magnetic profile (VMP).

The inherent stochasticity and dynamic nature in both passenger demand and drivers’ decision-making pose challenges in capturing vacant taxis movements. This study proposes a novel deep clustering framework to comprehensively uncover passenger-searching strategies from extensive trajectory data. Specifically, multiple features from vacant searching trips are extracted and analogously defined as multi-channel images, where each channel corresponds to a specific feature. A novel deep image clustering approach is then proposed, integrating a feature representation module utilizing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), a self-expression module for affinity learning, a spectral clustering module, and a classification module for self-supervision. An effective training procedure is also presented for the proposed deep clustering framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against benchmark methods. Based on the clustering results, common and specific passenger searching strategies are further revealed. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of individual’s contextual experience in explaining searching behavior and operational efficiency. Moreover, drivers cruising without clear searching strategy often exhibit lower performance, and some drivers may gamble with peers to increase their chances of picking up passengers. These results deliver important justifications for future studies and provide managerial implications to improve on-demand mobility.},

However, current terrestrial networks and resource management mechanisms may only partially guarantee vehicle and in-vehicle user equipment (VUE)’s quality of service due to the limited coverage of roadside units (RSU), especially in remote areas. This paper investigates vehicular edge computing (VEC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks with multiple low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, ground RSUs, and VUEs. In remote areas without RSU coverage, VUEs can offload their partial tasks to satellites to save energy and guarantee latency. We aim to minimize VUEs’ weighted sum energy consumption by jointly optimizing VUEs’ association, data partition, computing resource allocation, power control, and bandwidth assignment under the constraints of maximum tolerant latency, maximum number of outage time slots, computation capacity at each satellite and each RSU, and maximum allowable transmission power at VUEs. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative algorithm by decomposing the original non-convex problem into several sub-problems. We efficiently solve each sub-problem by utilizing variable substitutions, the difference of convex functions algorithms, the Lagrangian dual method, and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucke conditions. Simulation results show that the introduced satellite-terrestrial integrated networks-enabled VEC scheme significantly reduces VUEs’ energy consumption compared to other schemes.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid evolution of vehicular network technology, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) with Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) presents both remarkable opportunities and formidable challenges. This paper addresses the crucial need for efficient ML model training in the context of Federated Learning (FL) within vehicular networks. Recognizing the limitations imposed by the tradeoff between the high energy cost at the local level with the performance problem at the global level, we propose an innovative approach that harmonizes cost optimization with strategic model selection. Our strategy primarily focuses on optimizing energy consumption during model training and updating at the vehicle end, thereby resolving the prevalent issue of limited end-user participation in FL due to high energy demands. Additionally, we introduce an advanced model selection method, prioritizing local model uploads and adaptively allocating bandwidth to clients with more extensive training data. This method enhances the efficiency and reliability of model updates, ensuring robust global model performance. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating not only improved learning performance but also a significant reduction in energy consumption among participating clients.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled numerous inventive solutions to multiple problems, considerably facilitating our daily lives; however, UAVs frequently rely on an open wireless channel for communication, making them susceptible to cyber-physical threats. Also, UAVs cannot execute complicated cryptographic algorithms due to their limited onboard computing capabilities. Balancing high-security levels and minimum computation costs is imperative when developing a security solution for UAVs. Consequently, several proxy signature schemes have been proposed in the literature to fulfill these requirements. Nevertheless, many of these solutions face the issue of high computation costs, and some exhibit security vulnerabilities that could not be more feasible options for UAV communication. Considering these constraints in mind, in this article, we introduce an improvised certificate-based proxy signature scheme (ICPS), which leverages the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) to meet the security and efficiency requirements of UAV networks. The proposed ICPS scheme offers a range of notable features, including its ability to address key escrow and secret key distribution issues. The proposed ICPS scheme’s security hardness has been evaluated using the widely known security tool, the random oracle model (ROM), proving its resilience against known and unknown cybersecurity threats. Finally, this study conducts a performance comparison of the proposed scheme against existing schemes, emphasizing its outstanding cost-efficiency. Notably, the computation cost is measured at 5.3536 ms and the communication cost at 1120 bits, substantially lower than relevant existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) empower vehicles equipped with onboard units to exchange traffic-related messages, enhancing vehicle navigation safety and efficiency. Providing secure privacy-preserving authentication schemes for VANETs is indispensable. It ensures that only legitimate vehicles can communicate, preventing external adversaries from injecting falsifiable information that could mislead vehicles, cause accidents, or disrupt traffic flow. Simultaneously, the privacy-preserving features prevent curious adversaries from compromising vehicle privacy and tracking users. Secure centralized vehicular communication protocols, where a single entity issues certificates for all vehicles, face challenges in enabling cross-domain communications. Adoption of such centralized protocols necessitates that vehicles within each domain possess their certificate authority, restricting cross-domain communication due to inherent distrust in the certificate authorities of other domains. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Privacy-preserving Message Authentication protocol for VANET Emergency message exchange (CP-MAVE), designed to ensure message authentication, integrity, and anonymity of vehicles across different domains. In the event of misbehavior, distributed key generation centers collaborate to trace back the identity of the vehicle. To evaluate the security of our protocol, we formally prove the existential unforgeability of CP-MAVE against chosen message attacks based on the intractability of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that CP-MAVE achieves message authentication, conditional privacy preservation, and resilience against replay and modification attacks. Moreover, we model and analayze CP-MAVE using the Tamarin prover and show that CP-MAVE maintains the secrecy and the message authentication of the vehicle traffic messages. Furthermore, we evaluate CP-MAVE’s performance regarding communication overhead and computation complexity. On a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B/8GB, equipped with a 1.5 GHz 64-bit Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, CP-MAVE requires a 304-byte communication overhead and 9.4897 msec as cryptographic operation overhead. Finally, to simulate the flow of messages between entities in our protocol, we implement CP-MAVE using socket programming, resulting in an end-to-end delay of 111.05 msec.},

  abstract     = {Currently, heterogeneous driving scenarios and complex traffic conditions challenge connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to achieve accurate sensing of road conditions. Existing research on the sensing capabilities of vehicles only relys on adding more onboard sensors, which makes the driving safety unable to be guaranteed due to the installment and cost limit of various sensors. Therefore, this paper proposes an enhanced 3D sensor deployment method to break through the sensing capabilities of CAVs’ own equipment limitations. By efficiently utilizing road infrastructure, reasonable roadside sensor deployment will effectively assist CAVs to expand the sensing range and improve overall sensing accuracy. Firstly, in order to address the limitations of existing works that often rely on simplified sensor models and idealized road conditions, we propose a Bresenham-based sensor and environment model that can be used to construct realistic road environments. Secondly, a decision transformer (DT)-based method is adopted to solve the problem of optimal deployment of sensors in road environments. Our approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional static deployment methods, which often fail to consider the complexities of real-world driving conditions and the diverse factors influencing optimal sensor deployment. Finally, in order to solve the problem of DT delayed rewards, we propose a two-layer optimization method to redistribute the reward function to solve the challenge of local optimization. A large number of simulations oriented to sensing effects not only verify the effectiveness of the sensor deployment method but also ensure the reliability of sensing assistance.},

Most previous lane detection methods focus exclusively on analyzing individual images and overlook the inter-frame dynamics, while car-mounted cameras capture continuous streams amenable to leveraging intra-video context. In challenging scenes with blur, occlusion, or illumination variations, considering visible lanes from previous frames can aid current frame interpretation. To tackle above challenges, we introduce a parallel heterogeneous framework, called PHNet, for video lane detection. First, a novel router automatically analyzes multi-level features to determine the inference route of candidates with different visual cues. Then, a cross-frame attention mechanism leverages relationships between current candidates and positive embeddings from past frame to aggregate contextual cues. Unlike existing offline video lane detection methods, which face limitations in handling long video sequences and real-time video streams due to computational constraints, our proposed method operates as an online framework capable of processing clips of any length. Our method demonstrates robust lane detection through temporally association modeling and efficient online inference. The extensive experiments on public benchmark show that PHNet has superior performance versus state-of-the-art video lane detection methods.},

We introduce a synergistic methodology that combines SwAV for effective unsupervised learning and YOLO for efficient object detection, enabling the model to learn intricate feature representations of pavement surface distress. Furthermore, we propose RE-RPN-K(Road Enhanced Region Proposal Network in K), a specialized region proposal network that distills precise road surface information, and integrates a transformer-based DETR-Head, eliminating the need for conventional NMS(Non-Maximum Suppression) post-processing. Our experiments on the GRDDC and IRRDD datasets demonstrate that CL-PSDD achieves competitive mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of 76% and 60%, respectively, rivaling the performance of supervised methods and excelling in generalization.

The CGC module constructs a spatiotemporal graph model of the cyclist with both the behavioral and risk information. The RLG module leverages the graph representation method (GRM) to extract features and assigns risk labels using unsupervised learning. The RA module employs spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCN) to extract features from the cyclist graph. Additionally, it facilitates feature fusion through interactions between the human body and the two-wheeler and between hierarchical levels. The fused features, along with the risk labels, are used to train a classifier for the risk assessment of cyclists.

First, the road code that contains sufficient location information is designed, and the regression-based one-stage road code detection network is developed. The network can detect road code accurately and in real-time, and then road-end location information can be obtained through decoding and pose estimation. An inertial odometer is used to acquire vehicle-end location measurements. Then an Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF) is designed to correct the vehicle-end location with that of the road-end and output high-precision location information. We conducted road tests to validate the performance of the proposed positioning system. The results demonstrate that this system can provide reliable and high-precision vehicle positioning without GNSS signals. The positioning precision can reach the decimeter level.},

However, existing array self-position determination methods show decrease in performance under multipath environments. To deal with this problem, we propose an array self-position determination method based on orthogonal grid matching with the spatial differencing method. Specifically, the direction of arrival (DOA) of direct path and multipath signals are respectively estimated by array spatial differencing method. The matching accuracy is enhanced by utilizing the prior information of direct path signal. After calculating correlation coefficients of different sources, estimated angles with high correlation are then classified into the same set. Then, the noise subspace of each angle set is reconstructed and the position is estimated by grid matching with the orthogonal property between the noise subspaces and the characteristic steering vectors. The matching results of redundant angle sets are removed as non-matching items, thus averting positioning deviations. The simulation results demonstrate that the computational complexity of the proposed method is comparable to that of the signal subspace fitting (SSF). Moreover, in terms of positioning precision, the proposed method outperforms multiple signal classification with enhanced spatial smoothing (ESSMUSIC), initial signal fitting (ISF), and SSF.},

This study introduces an unsupervised learning algorithm for detecting risky driving behaviors on expressways within Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) environments, employing deep clustering techniques to analyze individual driving patterns from Probe Vehicle Data (PVD). Utilizing data from 116 vehicles, including buses and heavy trucks, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based autoencoder was employed to extract latent hierarchical features, facilitating the clustering of similar driving patterns. Elementary Driving Behaviors (EDBs) were identified for different vehicle types and driving statuses, serving as a foundation for detecting risky driving behaviors against the proposed criteria. The research revealed a clear positive correlation between detected risky driving behaviors and traffic crashes across the vehicle types. Furthermore, when comparing our model’s criteria with traditional safety indexes, our proposed model demonstrated stronger correlations with traffic crashes, indicating its effectiveness in expressway driving environments. This research not only introduces a novel method for identifying risky driving behaviors but also underscores the importance of tailored traffic safety interventions in enhancing C-ITS environments.},

  abstract     = {The assessment of safety performance plays a pivotal role in the development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). A common approach involves designing testing scenarios based on prior knowledge of CAVs (e.g., surrogate models), conducting tests in these scenarios, and subsequently evaluating CAVs’ safety performances. However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency. In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process. Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency. We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming. To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency. Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps.

  abstract     = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can capture spatio-temporal vibration images of vehicles on expressways, which can be utilized for traffic monitoring. Compared to ubiquitously deployed cameras, DAS traffic monitoring offers advantages such as full coverage, resistance to environmental interference, low computational requirements, and cost-effectiveness. However, real-world complexities result in challenges for DAS traffic images, including low signal-to-noise ratio, signal missing, and uneven intensity. As DAS traffic applications are still in their early stages, effective solutions to these challenges are yet to be developed. This paper proposes a new deep learning method named DAS High Speed Traffic Trajectory (DAS-HTT) network, which contributes threefold: (i) Multi-Scale Context Extraction Module (MSCE) effectively enlarges the receptive field to capture long-range contextual information comprehensively; (ii) Stripe Convolution Decoder (SCD) acquires remote information along four directions, preventing irrelevant region interference in feature learning; (iii) Hierarchically Hough Transform Fusion Decoder (HHTFD) introduces the structural information of trajectory linearity, reducing the reliance on label data while enhancing trajectory continuity. We conducted experiments on an operating expressway, demonstrating that DAS-HTT outperforms existing methods across seven metrics, providing trajectories that are more consistent with ground truthes.},

  abstract     = {Commercial complex is a compositional scenario that involves pedestrians with different travel purposes such as commuting, shopping and business. Simulation of pedestrian behavior in a commercial complex is difficult due to the heterogeneity of pedestrians and different attractions from various kinds of shops. Inspired from the law of universal gravitation and the pedestrian dynamics theory, we propose an attractive potential based social force framework for pedestrian simulation in commercial complexes. Our framework consists of an attractive potential model and an attractive potential based social force model. The former model evaluates the attractive force of different types of shops towards heterogeneous pedestrians, by associating the attributes of pedestrians with the types of shops. The latter model effectively evaluates the travel direction of pedestrians by incorporating the attractive force with the social force model via a synthesis force criterion. We conduct the simulation experiment based on 600 groups of pedestrian tracking data collected in the China World Mall, Beijing, a typical commercial complex. The simulation results show that the model can effectively simulate not only the trajectory of real pedestrians, but also the behavior of entering shops. Our research significantly improves the authenticity of pedestrian simulation and provides support for travel behavior modeling of heterogeneous pedestrians in the commercial complex.},

High-resolution loop detector data and signal state records from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) offer new opportunities for traffic signal optimization at intersections. However, additional factors such as geometry, traffic volumes, Turning-Movement Counts (TMCs), and human driving behaviors complicate this task. Existing simulators (e.g., SUMO, Vissim) are computationally intensive, while machine learning models often lack lane-specific traffic flow estimation. To address these issues, we propose two computationally efficient Attentional Graph Auto-Encoder frameworks as “Digital Twins” for urban traffic intersections. Leveraging graph representations and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), our models capture lane-level traffic flow dynamics at entry and exit points while remaining agnostic to intersection topology and lane configurations. Trained on over 40,000 hours of realistic traffic simulations with affordable GPU parallelization, our framework produces fine-grained traffic flow time series. This output supports critical applications such as estimating Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), scaling to urban freeway corridors, and integrating with signal optimization frameworks for improved traffic management.},

The traffic scene is an open environment that is constantly changing, and the segmentation model needs to have the ability of domain incremental learning to maintain stable performance in the changing environment. The main challenges include the diversity of the traffic scene and the accumulation of forgetting about the previous traffic scenes. In this work, an adapter-based network model is proposed to solve the domain-incremental traffic scene segmentation task. Specifically, the domain-aware adapter (DAA) module is proposed, which divides the model parameters into domain-shared and domain-specific, so that the model can handle the information of all learned domains by dynamically expanding parameters. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, the inter-class correlation enhancement (ICE) module is proposed, which utilizes inter-class correlation to improve segmentation accuracy for single domain and knowledge transfer between domains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve promising results for retaining the competitive performance for both new and old domains.},

Therefore, in such a terminal, meticulous scheduling and coordination between quay cranes (QCs) and AGVs are core for efficient and orderly operations. However, managing the operation of QCs and AGVs is complex as numerous factors affect the operational performance, such as QC interference, vehicle congestion, and limited capacity of handover points. To address the problem, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model that explicitly considers the above realistic factors. As the model is computationally inefficient even for small-scale instances, we develop a tailored two-stage algorithm, where the first stage is branch-and-bound for QC operations and the second is column generation for AGV operations. To validate the solution quality, we compare the proposed algorithm with some benchmark methods, and the numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

These algorithms take into account several data from different sources, such as terrain databases, weather forecasts and aircraft performance models. We outline a new concept of operations aiming to integrate SafeNcy into the current aircraft operations and air traffic management paradigms. Several scenarios, focusing on total engine flame-out situations, are described and used to validate the framework, as well as to show its main features. The scenarios were designed in cooperation with a group of expert pilots and engineers.

  abstract     = {Driving an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) in dynamic traffic is a critical task, as the overtaking maneuver being considered one of the most complex due to involvement of several sub-maneuvers. Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have resulted in AVs exhibiting exceptional performance in addressing overtaking-related challenges. However, the intricate nature of the overtaking presents difficulties for a RL agent to proficiently handle all its sub-maneuvers that include left lane change, right lane change and straight drive. Furthermore, the dynamic traffic restricts the RL agents to execute the sub-maneuvers at critical checkpoints involved in overtaking. To address this, we propose an approach inspired by semi-Markov options, called Dynamic Option Policy enabled Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DOP-HDRL). This innovative approach allows the selection of sub-maneuver agents using a single dynamic option policy, while employing individual DRL agents specifically trained for each sub-maneuver to perform tasks during overtaking in dynamic environments. By breaking down overtaking maneuvers into several sub-maneuvers and controlling them using a single policy, the DOP-HDRL approach reduces training time and computational load compared to classical DRL agents. Moreover, DOP-HDRL easily integrates basic traffic safety rules into overtaking maneuvers to offer more robust solutions. The DOP-HDRL approach is rigorously evaluated through multiple overtaking and non-overtaking scenarios inspired by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pre-crash scenarios in the CARLA simulator. On an average, the DOP-HDRL approach shows 100% completion rate, 14% least collision rate, 25% optimal clearance distance, and 7% more average speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

This article considers both factors and proposes GISEIA-EMM: a high-accuracy GPS-inertial state estimator for in-motion alignment based on extended magnitude matching (EMM) method. First, we use the full integral method and non-interpolation procedure to construct the vector observation, which reduces the number of outliers and improves the accuracy of outlier detection. Second, we use an error-state extended Kalman filter (ESEKF), based on an augmented state-space model where the reference vector is regarded as a state, to suppress cumulative IMU bias errors, which improves the alignment accuracy. Third, we propose an EMM method, with the non-drifted expected normalized magnitude error, to detect and eliminate outliers in GPS measurements, which makes the alignment process stable. Simulation and field test results demonstrate that GISEIA-EMM can effectively address the negative impact of the two factors.},

However, with the growing intelligence and connectivity of modern vehicles, the in-vehicle network (IVN) faces significant security challenges due to the lack of inherent security mechanisms in the CAN protocol. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a monitoring and protection scheme for IVN. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge graph-based intrusion detection methodology, referred to as KG-ID. The proposed KG-ID methodology leverages a knowledge graph to analyze CAN frame and signal features for detecting several types of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of knowledge graph technology for intrusion detection in the IVN. Subsequently, the selection of CAN signal feature, construction of in-vehicle ontology model, knowledge extraction, and robustness against various attacks are explained in detail. In addition, a series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology can accurately detect fabrication, masquerade, and fuzzy attacks. In particular, the time overhead of intrusion detection in a real vehicle supported by XPeng is only 0.031 ms for KG-ID.

  abstract     = {Semantic perception in driving scenarios plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, existing Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods often do not fully exploit their potential in understanding driving scene dynamically. These methods typically lack spatial reasoning, failing to effectively correlate image pixels with their spatial positions, leading to attention drift. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Spatial Perception Transformer (HSPFormer), which integrates monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation into a unified framework for the first time. We introduce the Spatial Depth Perception Auxiliary Network (SDPNet), a framework for multiscale feature extraction and multilayer depth map prediction to establish hierarchical spatial coherence. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Pyramid Transformer Network (HPTNet), which uses depth estimation as learnable position embeddings to form spatially correlated semantic representations and generate global contextual information. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as KITTI-360, Cityscapes, and NYU Depth V2, demonstrate that HSPFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art networks, and achieves promising performance with 66.82% top-1 mIoU on KITTI-360, 83.8% mIoU on Cityscapes, and 57.7% mIoU on NYU Depth V2, respectively.

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become popular in the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems for their ability to mitigate increasing environmental concerns by reducing carbon footprints and conserving fossil fuels. Due to the scarcity of static charging stations, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charge sharing can facilitate the on-demand charging requirement of EVs. However, most of the V2V charge-sharing solutions are either centralized or semi-centralized, causing long waiting times, huge message overhead, and high infrastructural costs. For a large network, assigning a suitable donor EV for an acceptor EV as well as maximizing the matching cardinality in a distributed environment is a challenging problem. In this paper, the problem of V2V matching for charge sharing is mapped to the classical stable matching problem in bipartite graphs. The problem is formulated using integer linear programming that considers flexible decision making for EVs based on multiple charging criteria and constraints. However, as EVs have limited communication ranges, an EV can’t possess knowledge about the entire vehicular network. So we propose two sets of distributed heuristics under the name of Vehicle to Vehicle Distributed Charge Sharing (V2VDisCS), which yield a sub-optimal solution with lower computational and message complexities compared to existing distributed solutions. We analyze the average case matching probabilities and prove the sub-optimality of our approach. Simulation studies show that our heuristics outperform the existing distributed approaches in terms of message overhead and matching percentage. They show a comparable result for matching preference with respect to the standard centralized stable matching algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a safe learning-based eco-driving framework tailored for mixed traffic flows, which aims to optimize energy efficiency while guaranteeing system constraints during real-system operations. Even though reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of optimizing energy efficiency in intricate environments, it is challenged by safety requirements during both the training and deployment stages. The lack of safety guarantees impedes the application of RL to real-world problems. Compared with RL, model predicted control (MPC) can handle constrained dynamics systems, ensuring safe driving. However, the major challenges lie in complicated eco-driving tasks and the presence of disturbances, which pose difficulties for MPC design and constraint satisfaction. To address these limitations, the proposed framework incorporates the tube-based enhanced MPC (RMPC) to ensure the safe execution of the RL policy under disturbances, thereby improving the control robustness. RL not only optimizes the energy efficiency of the connected and automated vehicle in mixed traffic but also handles more uncertain scenarios, in which the energy consumption of the human-driven vehicle and its diverse and stochastic driving behaviors are considered in the optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an average improvement of 10.88% in holistic energy efficiency compared to the RMPC technique, while effectively preventing inter-vehicle collisions when compared to the RL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Blended traffic, comprising autonomous buses (ABs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), is becoming increasingly common, yet the lane change decision-making for ABs remains challenging due to complex interactions with heterogeneous HDVs. To address the challenge above, this paper proposes a game theory-based harmonious decision-making (GTHD) algorithm considering nuance of driving styles of HDVs, achieving human-like performance in interactions with HDVs. Technically, a game theoretic model of the GTHD uses predictions of the opposing vehicle’s motion and the information from preplanned trajectories. Besides, a prior estimation for driving styles is obtained utilizing clustering of historical data, and refined in real time through Bayesian estimation. Then, the driving style estimation is utilized to modify the game theoretic model. The modified model provides a closer depiction of the opponent’s preferences, meanwhile adjusts self-preferences to adapt to the opponent. The efficacy of GTHD is validated using a hardware and human in loop simulator and datasets in MLC scenarios. It is shown that the GTHD achieves human-like performance with 91.50%-98.50% accuracy compared with human bus driver under different conditions, better than several lane change models based on data driven methods.

This paper introduces a novel Cost-aware Adaptive Bike Repositioning Agent (CABRA), which harnesses advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques in dock-based BSS. By analyzing demand patterns, CABRA learns adaptive repositioning strategies aimed at reducing shortages and enhancing truck route planning efficiency, significantly lowering operational costs. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of CABRA utilizing real-world data from Dublin, London, Paris, and New York. The reported results show that CABRA achieves operational efficiency that outperforms or matches very challenging baselines, obtaining a significant cost reduction. Its performance on the largest city comprising 1765 docking stations highlights the efficiency and scalability of the proposed solution even when applied to BSS with a great number of docking stations.},

  abstract     = {With electric vehicles (EVs) and charging facilities as a bridge, the coupling of transportation network (TN) and distribution network (DN) is getting closer, and EV charging navigation considering TN-DN convergence is a current research hotspot. In order to reduce the total cost of EV charging navigation and the impact of charging load on the grid, this paper proposes a novel bi-layer coordinated charging navigation model (Bi-CCNM). The upper layer model is to minimize the total cost of EV charging navigation. To precisely estimate travel costs, a dynamic spatio-temporal energy consumption estimation model is established, which considers the impact of dynamic traffic flow on EV travel resistance. The lower layer model aims to reduce energy exchange between the charging station (CS) and the main grid, and maximize the utilization of local renewable energy sources. To cope with the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, this paper utilizes Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology to effectively mitigate the impact of EV charging loads on the grid. To efficiently tackle the Bi-CCNM, the Joint Optimization algorithm combining Generalized Benders Decomposition and Logarithmic Barrier Function Method (JO-GBLB) is developed. Ultimately, an optimal solution can be obtained through the interaction of information between the two layers. Real-world case validates the effectiveness of the proposed the Bi-CCNM, energy consumption estimation model, and JO-GBLB algorithm. The results indicate which it provides a low-cost charging navigation solution while significantly reducing the power exchange between the CS and the main grid, effectively preventing safety issues caused by load fluctuations. Besides, the accuracy of energy consumption estimation of EVs increases by 5.1% - 6.7%.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of transportation systems is significantly influenced by the field of view (FOV) of cameras, with larger FOVs yielding more reliable performance. Conventional cameras with restricted FOV face difficulties in scenarios characterized by field-of-view shake or low-texture imaging areas, complicating feature extraction and matching tracking. Conversely, 360° panoramic cameras, which provide an expansive field of view and high pixel density, are emerging as promising alternatives. While many studies have explored motion calculation based on panoramic vision, most resort to conventional image processing methods for panoramic images, leading to inefficiencies and reduced accuracy. This article proposes a novel approach to panoramic vision motion estimation and reconstruction. The method involves projecting the panoramic image onto a fitting sphere and establishing a mapping relationship between a uniform spherical grid and the pixels of the panoramic image. This enables distortion-free mapping imaging for the entire panorama, addressing issues with matching consecutive frame images caused by distortion in the polar regions. Going beyond conventional epipolar constraints, this paper introduces a geometric constraint of epipolarity within a three-dimensional sphere and derives pose-solving equations tailored for panoramic vision, enabling motion estimation between frames. Additionally, it derives the polar arc equation of panoramic images, accelerating three-dimensional reconstruction of dense point clouds. The sliding window estimation method is used for iterative algorithm optimization, along with an optimization mechanism aligned with the panoramic camera model. Validation on public datasets and hardware experimental platforms demonstrates the proposed method’s significantly improved accuracy compared to existing optimal algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the efficiency of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems. However, existing MARL approaches primarily focus on optimizing overall traffic flow, often overlooking the issue of fairness in vehicle waiting times. Considering that there is no need to strive for the ultimate fairness, this paper models the ATSC problem as a Constrained Partially Observable Markov Game (CPOMG), where fairness is modeled as a constraint on the maximum waiting time of vehicles on lanes of intersections instead of a reward term that pursues maximization. CPOMG aims to find a cooperative control policy with optimal traffic efficiency within the constrained solution space by multiple agents. On this basis, this paper proposes a new centralized training and decentralized execution cooperative MARL method, i.e., vehicle-level fairness multi-agent proximity policy optimization (VF-MAPPO). VF-MAPPO leverages a centralized trained global Critic Network to estimate the average vehicle traffic efficiency and vehicle maximum waiting time, and an Actor Network shared by all intersections for decentralized execution, which converts the optimization problem with constraints to an unconstrained optimization objective through the Lagrange multiplier method and adopts proximity policy optimization during training. Additionally, VF-MAPPO incorporates spatial-temporal graph attention in the Critic network to efficiently extract state representations in multi-intersection environments. We qualitatively analyzed the monotonic improvement guarantee of VF-MAPPO. Extensive experimental validation across two real-world and one synthetic scenarios substantiates that VF-MAPPO enhances vehicle-level fairness and maintains average traffic efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles have become a trend as a replacement to gasoline-powered vehicles, and been promoted by worldwide policy makers as a solution to combat environmental problems and stimulate economy, whereas the lack of extreme fast charging infrastructure has become one main obstacle to broad adoption of electric vehicles. To promote the commercial success of electric vehicles, effective placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations is pivotal. While numerous studies address EV charging station placement, the integration of transportation network traffic, specifically equilibrium traffic assignment, where flows stabilize as drivers seek routes to minimize travel time, has been relatively limited. This research investigates equilibrium traffic assignment with the inclusion of extreme fast charging (XFC) stations and introduces an algorithmic solution. We assess diverse charging station placement strategies, including node-based and network-based approaches, weighing their respective advantages and drawbacks. Extensive experiments on real transportation networks of varying scales validate our algorithm and evaluate different charging station placement strategies. Many interesting findings are drawn from the study. For instance, increasing the number of XFC charging stations may not always result in reduced traffic time; the added value of extra stations beyond a certain threshold can be quite limited. The findings offer valuable insights for strategically deploying EV charging infrastructure, thus promoting electric vehicle adoption.},

This advancement has led to a widespread adoption of vehicular networks, driven by the enhanced capabilities of automobiles. However, managing mobility-aware computations, ensuring network security amidst instability, and overcoming resource constraints pose significant challenges in heterogeneous vehicular network applications within Fog computing. Moreover, the latency overhead remains a critical issue for tasks sensitive to latency and deadlines. The objective of this research is to develop a Mobility-aware Secured offloading and Scheduling (M-SOS) technique for a Dew-enabled vehicular Fog-Cloud computing system. This technique aims to address the issues outlined above by moving the computations closer to the edge of the network. Initially, a Dew-facilitated vehicular Fog network is proposed, leveraging heterogeneous computing nodes to handle diverse vehicular requests efficiently and ensuring uninterrupted services within the vehicular network. Further, task management is optimized using a Fuzzy logic that categorizes tasks based on their specific requirements and identifies the target layers for offloading. Besides, a cryptographic algorithm known as SHA-256 RSA enhances security. Moreover, a novel Linear Weight-based JAYA scheduling algorithm is introduced to assign tasks to appropriate computing nodes. The proposed algorithm surpasses the comparable algorithms by 23% in terms of AWT, 18% in terms of latency rate, 14% and 23% in terms of meeting the hard-deadline ( $H\_d$ ) and soft-deadline ( $S\_d$ ), and 35% in terms of average system cost, respectively.},

This model is based on the Generative Adversarial Networks self-supervised learning framework, which can allow to learn high-accuracy estimation without using observed passenger alighting data. To show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, a case study is conducted on the real-world datasets in Tianjin, China, Brisbane, Australia, and Panjin, China. Using the entry-only data in the Tianjin case, results show the effectiveness to estimate accurate OD flow without alighting data. The sensitivity analysis on the proportion of data loss shows that when the loss rate is less than 40%, the proposed method is still capable to provide accurate outputs. Using the ground-truth OD flow data in the Brisbane case, results show the ability to obtain the realistic estimation from flawed OD flow. The robustness analysis results also show the sufficient accuracy for bus planning and operation under various data flaw levels. Using the onboard survey data in Panjin case, the proposed method’s capability of repairing the rule-based estimation is further verified.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have garnered extensive interest for their potential in enhancing navigation safety and efficiency. To further improve their intelligence, we propose a collaborative collision avoidance decision-making approach for USVs based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Firstly, a collision risk assessment model is established using Closest Point of Approach and Quaternion Ship Domain to guide USVs to take timely and effective collision avoidance actions. Secondly, we adopt Deep Recurrent Q-Network algorithm to overcome the challenges posed by multi-ship scenarios, and the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework is employed in it to accurately establish multi-ship collaborative collision avoidance model. Moreover, to introduce a novel collaborative collision avoidance mechanism for multiple ships, we improved the network update mechanism of DRQN: by synergistically integrating the local Q value of each agent to acquire the multi-agent joint action Q value and the network parameters are subsequently updated based on the calculated global loss. Finally, we designed various experiments in a real water to validate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that this approach has the capacity to enable the ships to make effective collision avoidance actions in accordance with navigation practices and good seamanship. Comparative analysis with Deep Q-Network (DQN), DDQN, Dueling DQN, and Artificial Potential Field underscores the superior safety and rationality of the proposed approach in collision avoidance. This research offers a new perspective for the cooperative collision avoidance decision-making and has theoretical reference significance.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In recent, graph neural networks (GNNs) have successfully captured spatial-temporal dependencies to forecast traffic conditions by transforming traffic data in the graph domain. Nevertheless, the existing methods focus only on learning informative graph representations and fail to model informative graph structures, which hinders the capture of dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies caused by dynamic factors such as weather, accidents, and special events. In this paper, we propose a novel task-oriented Spatial Graph Structure Learning (SGSL) method, which aims to capture dynamic dependencies by jointly learning graph structures and graph representations. Compared to methods that use spectral graph representations, we exploit a learnable spatial graph to effectively model dynamic dependencies in traffic data. Moreover, we directly define graph convolutions on spatial relations to specify different edge weights when aggregating the information of spatial neighbours. Thus, the graph structure alterations, i.e., the relation changes, and the time-varying weights of relations can be encapsulated, thereby effectively representing dynamic dependencies. The gradient descent strategy is introduced to periodically learn a spatial graph through joint optimization with a newly designed deep graph learning model named GAT-nLSTM. In this manner, the intrinsic behaviours of nodes are learned to capture correlations across periods. Notably, the optimization process is performed under the traffic forecasting constraint to ensure that the learned spatial graph is specific to this task. Compared with those of state-of-the-art baselines, the experimental results obtained on real-world traffic datasets show significant improvement, which verifies the superiority of the proposed SGSL.},

To this end, we first construct a continuous time ACC system with unknown system dynamics (e.g., target vehicle acceleration, sensor and actuator attacks, etc). To estimate the unknown system dynamics, an unknown system dynamic estimator (USDE) is designed, where the unknown system dynamic can be accurately estimated by using the input-output information, this is helpful for controller design. Then, a RL based optimal control method is developed, where the prescribed performance function (PPF) is applied, the system states can be effectively defined within a certain range. To realize the online solution for optimal control, we design a new adaptive law based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework to online learn the critic neural network (NN) weights, because of the strong convergence, the proposed learning algorithm can be effectively applied in practical industrial systems.

  abstract     = {In real-world scenes, vehicles and pedestrians on the road often exhibit consistency in their overall motion, forming the traffic flow we observe. Exploring this global collective motion consistency to aid in 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks is an under-investigated issue in existing research. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been introduced to model interactions between targets in 3D tracking problems, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing GNN based methods usually employ neighborhood-based approaches to construct graphs which are unable to fully exploit collective relations in traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a GNN based 3D MOT method which effectively utilizes the collective motion consistency in traffic flow. Collective motion is modeled with a densely connected intra-flow graph within the collective group, allowing information to flow quickly. To build the intra-flow graph, we propose an effective collinearity condition to distinguish potential collective groups from the detected objects. For reasoning on the graph, we propose a progressive serial message-passing solver which enables the network to learn complex group movement relationships based on a thorough understanding of simple neighborhood relations. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets: NuScenes and KITTI tracking benchmark. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the comprehensive performance of our proposed method which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the longitudinal control problem of an on-ramp vehicle merging into a platoon on the main road. To tackle this challenge, a finite-time model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with a specialized feedback control law is proposed. A constraint set of the state error is designed and based on this, a decision-making scheme is established to allow the on-ramp vehicle to assess the feasibility of the merging operation at the beginning under the designed MPC strategy. If the merging is feasible, the proposed MPC strategy will be applied to drive the on-ramp vehicle towards a small neighborhood around the desired state on the basis of platoon’s velocity and position within a finite time step before joining the platoon. Furthermore, asymptotic convergence towards the desired state is achieved by a co-designed feedback control law. Otherwise, the MPC strategy will not be triggered, instead an alternative method such as slowing down the on-ramp vehicle to create space and allow the vehicles on the main road to proceed ahead. Under the proposed method, the recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem is achieved at all time steps and the finite time convergence to the small neighborhood of the desired state can be proved under the MPC algorithm. An upper bound on the convergence time step is also derived, which is used to prove the effectiveness of the decision-making mechanism. In addition, the closed-loop constraints satisfaction and asymptotic stability of the on-ramp vehicle are also guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC method is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Traffic accidents remain a significant concern due to their potential severity and impact on society. The rapid and accurate detection of car damage is increasingly crucial. Manual assessment of car damage usually relies on multi-view car images taken at the scene, which can provide richer information for damage assessment. However, most car damage algorithms are based on single-view datasets, and it is hard to fully leverage the complementary information and alignment information between distant view and close-up images. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Car Damage Detection model (MVA-CDD), comprising three key modules: Feature Split (FS), Feature Fusion (FF), and Image Alignment (IA). The FS module extracts global and detailed information from distant-view and close-up images separately, which are then combined by the FF module. The IA module effectively aligns car damage information in distant-view and close-up images to correct errors and biases. Meanwhile, we created the new Car Damage Detection Multi-view dataset (CDDM), which has a significant advantage in both image quantity and diversity across categories, addressing the shortcomings of existing multi-view datasets. Our proposed MVA-CDD outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view models with the dataset. Results from ablation studies further confirm the efficiency of MVA-CDD. This study contributes to optimizing the car damage detection and claims adjudication process, leading to significant labor and material cost savings. CDDM dataset is available at https://github.com/SCUT-CCNL/CDDM.},

Our approach integrates a Multi-Relational Graph Convolution Network (MR-GCN) and a Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) to evaluate driver stress using field data from Nanjing, China. Results show that our model significantly improves driver stress classification, particularly for critical stress levels, with a 65.3% increase in balanced accuracy and a 38% rise in F-score compared to the baseline. The addition of GCAA enhances accuracy further, with an average improvement of 51.7%. This demonstrates our model’s superior ability to understand the contextual relationships within driving scenarios, making it highly effective for AVs to assess driver status in complex situations and interact more efficiently with human drivers. Furthermore, our model achieves a balance between accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for real-time assessment tasks.},

In complex driving conditions, accurate and fast lane recognition is a challenging issue. In this paper, a vision-based geometric model (VBGM) is proposed for accurate and fast lane recognition in complex conditions. The framework of the VBGM includes an image preprocessing stage and a lane recognition stage. In the image preprocessing stage, the region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the original image, and the original image is transformed into an undistorted greyscale image. In the lane recognition stage, the lane contour is first extracted using the Roberts operator. Then, to accurately and quickly recognize the lane marking, a lane recognition coordinate system (LRCS) and a rotational LRCS (R-LRCS) are constructed. The distracting contours in abnormal regions are padded based on the LRCS using a contextual frames correlation (CFC) strategy, and the midpoints of the lane contour are identified based on the R-LRCS. Finally, an adaptive-order polynomial fitting model is built to fit the lane marking according to the midpoints in the LRCS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two state-of-the-art methods are selected for comparison. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method possesses a higher recognition rate and speed for lane recognition in complex conditions.},

  abstract     = {The platoon technology is gradually applied in the intelligent transportation systems to improve the safety, efficiency, energy saving, and emission reduction of vehicles during driving. However, in contrast to the traditional ramp merging scenario that consists of individual vehicles, the existing platoons from the upstream bring new challenges to the merging problem on ramps. Without an effective coordination strategy, the unnecessary congestion and disintegration of the existing platoons will lead to an increase in driving costs and safety risk. Therefore, this paper optimizes the merging strategy of vehicle sequences involving platoons on highway ramps. A merging strategy, based on an adaptive headway threshold, is first proposed, where the comprehensive economic benefit is considered as its optimization objective while taking into account the decrements of the time, fuel, and carbon emission costs. The vehicle sequence merging is then modeled as a Markov decision process to derive the optimal threshold, where the action set includes three actions: accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining the constant cruising speed. Afterwards, the constraints are brought to the decision-making to ensure the safety of the merging process. The calculation of the action value, combining the derived optimal threshold and constraint, is then detailed. Finally, the results of the simulation are evaluated, and a comparison between the proposed strategy and other existing methods is conducted, which demonstrates that the proposed approach improves the comprehensive economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {The widespread deployment of wireless communication networks has catalyzed significant advancements in utilizing signal channs to address real-world challenges, such as vehicle trajectory reconstruction (VTR), drone trajectory planning, and network optimization. Existing methods primarily utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements for vehicle localization. However, these methods require specialized decoding receivers capable of deciphering communication protocols, leading to increased application costs. received signal strength (RSS), a measure of wireless signal strength, can be recorded by any standard communication device, thus allowing RSS-based VTR to benefit from cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the inherently noisy and sporadic nature of RSS poses significant challenges for accurately reconstructing vehicle trajectories. This paper aims to utilize RSS measurements to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network. We constrain the trajectories to comply with signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints, thereby mitigating the impact of the noisy and sporadic nature of RSS data on the accuracy of trajectory reconstruction. The primary challenge involves exploiting latent spatial-temporal correlations within the noisy and sporadic RSS data while navigating the complex road network. To overcome these challenges, we develop an hidden Markov model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that utilizes alternating optimization to search for the vehicle trajectory based on RSS measurements. This model effectively captures the spatial-temporal relationships among RSS measurements, while a road graph model ensures compliance with network pathways. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to effectively guide the proposed alternating optimization procedure, ensuring that the proposed HRE method rapidly converges to a favorable local solution. The proposed method is validated using real RSS measurements from 5G NR networks in Chengdu and Shenzhen, China. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even with limited RSS data.},

The main challenge lies in detecting anomalies during map matching, identifying the root causes, and devising appropriate solutions. Firstly, we propose a matching quality assessment (MQA) method that assesses abnormal variance in matching probability. Secondly, we introduce a multiple noise discrimination (MND) mechanism to effectively differentiate between measurement noise and map errors. Thirdly, we present a missing segment generation (MSG) scheme that dynamically fills in map gaps to prevent significant detours. To validate the effectiveness of MPF, we conduct experiments using real-world taxi trajectories from four cities, covering a total distance of 79,670.6 km. MPF is compare with seven online map matching algorithms and is used to optimize their performance. The experiments show that MPF outperforms the top baselines by 15.6%-26.9% and enhances their performance by 18.7%-38.2%.},

  abstract     = {Accurate environmental perception is essential for the effective operation of autonomous vehicles. However, visual images captured in dynamic environments or adverse weather conditions often suffer from various degradations. Image restoration focuses on reconstructing clear and sharp images by eliminating undesired degradations from corrupted inputs. These degradations typically vary in size and severity, making it crucial to employ robust multi-scale representation learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Modulation (MSFM), a novel deep convolutional architecture for image restoration. MSFM modulates multi-scale features in both frequency and spatial domains to make features sharper and closer to that of clean images. Specifically, our multi-scale frequency attention module transforms features into multiple scales and then modulates each scale in the implicit frequency domain using pooling and attention. Moreover, we develop a multi-scale spatial modulation module to refine pixels with the guidance of local features. The proposed frequency and spatial modules enable MSFM to better handle degradations of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that MSFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 datasets for a range of image restoration tasks, i.e., image dehazing, image defocus/motion deblurring, and image desnowing. Furthermore, the restored images significantly improve the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles.},

To reduce the operational energy consumption of a metro line, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization model for energy-efficient train operations based on three aspects: train operation strategies at inter-stations, running time allocation within an operating cycle, and utilization of regenerative braking energy of multiple collaborative trains in the same power supply area. The first stage is based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm, which optimizes the position-speed curves at each inter-station to obtain a series of energy-saving running curves and the corresponding Pareto fronts. In the second stage, a single-objective optimization algorithm and parallel computing method are used to solve the integrated optimization model for train operations with the minimum net energy consumption as the objective function, to reduce the net energy consumption in an operating cycle. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out with data on the Beijing Yizhuang line.

In this study, three different anti-slip controller models, comprising the traditional re-adhesion anti-slip controller and PID-based anti-slip controller with fixed threshold and with optimal threshold, are established. The wheel/rail rolling-slipping performances subjected to different anti-slip control algorithms under changing wheel/rail friction conditions are compared based on train-track interaction simulations. The results demonstrate that the PID-based anti-slip controller with an optimal threshold achieves the maximum utilization of wheel/rail adhesion in the presence of low-friction conditions, outperforming the other two types of anti-slip controllers. Additionally, the adoption of an anti-slip controller with a lower control threshold can effectively reduce the tread wear of locomotive wheels.

Second, the shuffle manipulation module is designed which includes slicing and shuffling to manipulate the spatial and channel features so that the information loss problem caused by conventional convolutional downsampling is overcome. Third, the adaptive connection of features at different scales using learnable parameters is proposed, and then the target features are reinforced by location and channel calibration branches.

The design uses multiple computing servers and a secret sharing scheme to encrypt traffic data into several shares, each corresponding to a server. The servers then securely compute the green time plans, working directly on the encrypted data. The proposed method protects traffic data from curious computing servers and external eavesdroppers, preventing the adversaries from gaining the required information to launch a complex attack. Additionally, a detection and recovery procedure from false data injection attacks on green time signals is presented using secret reconstruction from different server combinations. Simulation results for various scenarios demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in maintaining data confidentiality while achieving the same performance as an unprotected control strategy, with a reasonable addition to computation time. It also depicts a significant reduction in vulnerability against falsified green time signal attacks in terms of total travel time in the network.},

  abstract     = {3D scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the point cloud, which is a base 3D perception task for autonomous driving, like optical flow for 2D images. As non-learning methods are often inefficient or struggled to learn accurate correspondence in complex 3D real world, recent works turn to supervised learning methods, which require ground truth labels. However, acquiring the ground truth of 3D scene flow is challenging mainly due to the lack of sensors capable of capturing point-level motion and the complexity of accurately tracking each point in real-world environments. Therefore, it is important to resort to self-supervised methods, which do not require ground truth labels. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning method of scene flow with LiDAR odometry is proposed, which enables the scene flow network can be trained directly on real-world LiDAR data without scene flow labels. In this structure, supervised odometry provides a more accurate shared cost volume for the interframe association of 3D scene flow. In addition, because static and occluded points are more suitable for using the pose transform while dynamic and non-occluded points are more suitable for using the scene flow transform, a static mask and an occlusion mask are designed to classify the states of points and a mask-weighted warp layer is proposed to transform source points in a divide-and-conquer manner. The experiments demonstrate that the divide-and-conquer strategy makes the predicted scene flow more accurate. The experiment results compared to other methods also show the application ability of our proposed method to real-world data. Our source codes are released at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/PSFNet.},

  abstract     = {In mixed-autonomy traffic environments, accurately predicting the lane change behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle decision-making. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: 1) they tend to represent the relationships between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles using parameters like relative position and speed. This approach either requires a fixed number of surrounding vehicles or introduces significant noise by relying on virtual vehicles; and 2) they often fail to fully exploit the vast amount of available vehicle trajectory data, leaving the complexities of vehicular interactions underexplored. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lane change prediction framework using Transformer-based transfer learning. Our design aims to leverage inter-vehicle interactions learned from trajectory data to improve lane-change prediction accuracy. Specifically, pre-trained trajectory prediction models are used to adapt dynamically to the varying number of surrounding vehicles and to capture interaction context from large sets of trajectory data. We then refine the Transformer model to integrate this context and predict the target vehicle’s lane change intentions. The Transformer encoder transforms trajectory interaction context into a lane-change-oriented context using aggregated multi-head attention. The Transformer decoder, in turn, utilizes this context alongside the target vehicle’s states through relation-aware multi-head attention to forecast lane change behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness.},

To meet the ever-increasing charging demands of EVs, an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs) is necessary. With newly allocated CSs, additional distributed generators (DGs) are required to compensate for the load increase. Given a budget to be allocated over a certain time horizon, we formulate the joint spatio-temporal CSs and DGs planning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. During each planning period, the allocation strategy aims at minimizing the total power generation costs and CSs/DGs installation costs while satisfying budgetary and power constraints and ensuring a minimum level for the charging requests satisfaction rate. In this regard, we first predict the future power demand of EVs using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Then, using the power demand forecast, we obtain the optimal number and locations of CSs and DGs at each time stage using reinforcement learning. A case study of the proposed allocation strategy over 6 time stages for the 2000-bus power grid of Texas coupled with 720 initially existing CSs is presented to illustrate the performance of the planning strategy.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the position and attitude of vehicles is essential for intelligent transportation systems. The GNSS/INS integrated system offers precise navigation information. However, the system’s positioning errors may accumulate rapidly in challenging GNSS signal conditions. Odometer (ODO) and nonholonomic constraints (NHC) are commonly employed to mitigate the rapid accumulation of INS errors. Compensating for the mounting angles of INS and the scale factor of the odometer is necessary to fully exploit the potential of ODO/NHC. However, many studies employ Kalman filters with small mounting angle assumption, which limits their applicability for large mounting angles in practice. To accurately estimate the mounting angle of INS with any installation attitude, we propose a new algorithm called Fast Estimation of Mounting Angle and Scale Factor (FEMASF). FEMASF employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain a closed-form solution for the parameters. It also incorporates an enhanced Sage-Husa scheme, enhancing overall estimation accuracy by reducing the weight of outlier data through a forgetting factor. Extensive simulation experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FEMASF algorithm outperforms filter-based methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for large mounting angles. Specifically, for the −90° mounting angle, FEMASF achieves 0.45° angle error, while the velocity-based Kalman filter (VKF) fails to converge and the position-based Kalman filter (PKF) yields about 4° error. Furthermore, neither VKF nor PKF converges for the 120° mounting angle, whereas FEMASF exhibits only about 3.2° estimation error.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection at night is a crucial task in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Due to the complex lighting environment, vehicle detection at night remains a challenging task. Headlights and taillights are essential cues to identify vehicles at night. However, existing methods struggle to effectively utilize the light information of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel highlight-guided framework to identify vehicles, named HighlightNet, by utilizing both the illumination data from the vehicle lights and the reflective properties of vehicles. The framework combines vehicle detection and highlight area recognition via dual-branch joint learning. To ensure that both branches focus on the highlighted regions, Feature Similarity Awareness Attention (FSAA) is introduced to capture the common attention regions of different branches. Highlight Region Perception (HRP) is proposed to exclude streetlights and other reflective illuminations from the FSAA output, which generates a mask map capable of differentiating the foreground from the background of highlighted areas. It improves the allocation of feature weights and adaptively modifies the distribution within the dual-branch configuration. Furthermore, to address the severe pixel imbalance between the highlighted area and the background, Adaptive Spatial Balance (ASB) loss is introduced to allocate the attention towards prospective vehicle regions while diminishing the emphasis on background regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the BDD100K-Night dataset and a newly acquired dataset specifically designed for nighttime surveillance, called the NightVehicle dataset, demonstrate that HighlightNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for nighttime vehicle detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenges faced by 6G-enabled vehicular networks (V-Nets), including increasing road traffic, ultra-reliable and low latency communication, high data rates, and energy efficiency. The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is proposed as a solution to configure the propagation channel in a smart radio environment by adjusting phase shifts. However, designing IRS-assisted V-Nets that achieve ultra-reliability in dynamic and noisy communication is challenging due to the passive nature of the IRS and the limitations of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision (CV) enabled IRS framework for V-Nets, which combines a convolutional neural network and CV techniques. The framework utilizes real-time visual information to estimate and configure optimal beamforming for IRS-assisted V-Nets. Adapting to real-time network dynamics and intelligently guiding signals, the CV-IRS framework improves prediction accuracy to 95%, an achievable maximum rate of 11.2 bps/Hz with 100 IRS elements, and resource allocation efficiency of 88% with 10 vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the CV-IRS framework over benchmark schemes, making it a promising approach for the efficient configuration of IRS-assisted 6G V-Nets.},

However, with the introduction of AAVs, new challenges such as trajectory design and AAV-user association occur. In this paper, we consider a caching AAV-assisted wireless network and formulate a user fairness problem by jointly optimizing AAV-user association, trajectory design, and bandwidth allocation of the AAVs, which is mixed-integer and non-convex. In order to find solutions, we decompose the original problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm based on block alternating descent and successive convex approximation methods. In addition, computational complexity is analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, compared to benchmark algorithms.},

This paper proposes an image-guided depth completion algorithm to address this issue. The method uses the edges of the color image as prior constraints to construct an image topography map as an intermediate representation and performs nonlinear adaptive reconstruction based on the image content to adjust the position and scale of the pixel-weighted neighborhood. This approach avoids incorporating depth information with different distributions when estimating missing values, resulting in a full-resolution dense depth map with sharp edges. We conducted a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art models on the KITTI and MidAir datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm has better performance and robustness in terms of completion accuracy. We also analyzed the impact of sparsity on the algorithm’s performance and its ability to recover fine structures in dense depth results and demonstrated the reconstruction results for sparse data in real-world scenarios.},

The past research on driving style classification mostly focused on identifying the driving patterns using the kinematic feature magnitudes. The variation in the instantaneous driving decisions termed as “driving volatility” is not explored in the context of performance assessment. In this regard, the present study proposes a methodology to explore the driving styles of Indian drivers, using both the magnitude and variation exhibited in the short-term driving decisions. The real-time driving profiles of 47 professional car drivers were collected and segmented into maneuvers based on the respective driving regimes. The performance features representative of each maneuver are extracted, defining 12 measures of driving volatility. The K-means clustering was performed on the event dataset at two-levels, which resulted in four patterns of driving styles under acceleration and braking regimes. The results showed that, a driver can exhibit speedy and aggressive maneuvers in a stable as well as in a highly volatile pattern. The generated driving style profiles at individual-level highlight the behavioral changes in drivers pertained to external influencing factors, and helps to identify the aberrations performed in each trip.},

While this approach protects personal privacy, it makes it difficult for researchers and planners to identify the same traveler from different databases and to construct complete multi-modal trips, which greatly reduces the value of data. To address this challenge, this paper develops TBLink, a method to match individual travelers between different modes. The underlying idea is that if a traveler makes a transfer, the spatiotemporal signatures of the previous and next trips will be similar and must satisfy certain conditions. When this pattern occurs for two travelers in the two datasets repeatedly, we can infer that the two travelers are actually the same person. The matching of travelers is regarded as a stable matching problem, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to solve the problem. TBLink is demonstrated using metro and bus trip data from Chengdu City between January and March 2021. The results show that the precision, recall, and recovery rate of user matching are 80.83%, 92.82%, and 10.56% respectively, and the matching is more reliable as the dataset increases. Sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of several model parameters on the matching performance.},

Traditional traffic flow prediction models often face limitations in quality and structure, leading to increased training costs and inefficiencies, due to data scarcity and centralized training modes that compromise data privacy. To address these issues, we propose a model called 2MGTCN, which combines Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for Cross-city Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP). Our 2MGTCN model utilizes federated transfer learning (FTL) to transfer the model from the source to the target domain, mitigating data scarcity. It also incorporates GCN and TCN to capture both spatial and temporal information, enhancing cross-city adaptability. Additionally, Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods are applied to capture road relationships, and a Federated Parameter Aggregation based on Spatial Similarity (FPASS) algorithm is proposed for ensuring effective parameter aggregation by considering spatial similarity. Simulation results show that our 2MGTCN algorithm outperforms traditional TFP models in both centralized and distributed training modes, ensuring higher accuracy and better privacy protection.},

Furthermore, the study applied Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to analyze the electroencephalogram (EEG) features of tower crane operators. Evaluation and comparison using the traditional wet electrode and the new semi-dry electrode to extract the EEG features show that the performance of the novel semi-dry electrode closely approximates that of the traditional wet electrode, effectively tracking alterations in the cognitive fatigue indicators among tower crane drivers during prefabricated building construction.

  abstract     = {Transportation systems often exhibit uncertainty, dynamics, and nonlinearity, making them highly susceptible to perturbations. Overhead crane systems, being a crucial mode of transportation, find wide application in engineering practice. This paper proposes a compound control strategy for underactuated overhead crane systems, combining a deep reinforcement learning controller with a novel observer-based disturbance compensation algorithm. The aim is to suppress model uncertainties and external disturbances. Initially, an equivalent state variable is constructed to stabilize the overhead crane system, simplifying controller design. Subsequently, the model uncertainties and external disturbances are treated as generalized disturbances and incorporated as a new state. This state is estimated and compensated through a super-twisting extended state observer (STESO) with finite-time convergence. Lyapunov-based analysis demonstrates that the established state observer can reduce the residual estimate error to zero. Moreover, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a form of deep reinforcement learning, is employed to effectively eliminate tracking errors. The proposed scheme enables the underactuated system to achieve satisfactory performance, with adaptive control effort suited to different control states and disturbances. Simulation and hardware experiments are conducted, comparing the proposed control strategy with traditional methods, to illustrate its effectiveness and robustness.},

This is especially true when considering accident scenarios, in which the dynamics can be affected by both high-frequency events, such as in high-sides, marked by rapid variations of the characteristics signals, and low-frequency events, such as in side slips, which exhibit slower and monotonic change in the same quantities. Therefore, designing an effective automatic eCall system for this type of vehicle is particularly challenging, while at the same time, it can significantly increase safety in dangerous situations. This paper proposed a novel approach for detecting falls of two-wheeled vehicles that avoids missed detections while minimizing the number of false alarms, which would heavily undermine its usability. We show, based on extensive analysis of a wide range of experimental data, why and how the proposed approach allows us to overcome the limitations of the existing proposal, ensuring a consistent detection of the wide range of falls that can happen on two-wheelers, also providing a detailed comparison with the scientific literature.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, enormous investments in Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) have distinctly advanced ADS technologies. Despite promises made by several high profile auto-makers, it has however become clear that the challenges involved for deploying ADS have been drastically underestimated. Contrary to previous generations of automotive systems, common design, development, verification and validation methods for safety critical systems do not suffice to cope with the increased complexity and operational uncertainties of an ADS. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide an understanding of existing methods for providing safety evidence and, most importantly, identifying the associated challenges and gaps pertaining to the use of each method. To this end, we have performed a literature review, articulated around four categories of methods: design techniques, verification and validation methods, run-time risk assessment, and run-time (self-)adaptation. We have identified and present eight challenges, collectively distinguishing ADSs from safety critical systems in general, and discuss the reviewed methods in the light of these eight challenges. For all reviewed methods, the uncertainties of the operational environment and the allocation of responsibility for the driving task on the ADS stand-out as the most difficult challenges to address. Finally, a set of research gaps is identified, and grouped into five major themes: 1) completeness of provided safety evidence, 2) improvements and analysis needs, 3) safe collection of closed loop data and accounting for tactical responsibility on the part of the ADS, 4) integration of AI/ML-based components, and 5) scalability of the approaches with respect to the complexity of the ADS.},

At the same time, these technological advances raise notable concerns about the effects that uncertainty in critical TCS parameters (such as train position and speed) may have on dependability-related attributes. Recently, various approaches have been proposed to characterize such effects through quantitative measures, leveraging formal stochastic modeling and evaluation of the TCS behavior. In this paper, we illustrate the results of a systematic review of the literature on quantitative evaluation of dependability-related attributes of TCSs under uncertainty on vital parameters. Specifically, we have finally selected 42 relevant papers, published between 2011 and 2023, that succeed in giving, through an empirical perspective and classification, a comprehensive view of current research and practice in quantitative dependability assessment of TCSs.},

  abstract     = {Flight delay is a fundamental problem present in the global aviation system. Delay-inducing disruptions are caused by various reasons, including increased global connectivity / dependency, weather phenomena, and limited infrastructure resources. Given the excessive amount of time and money lost due to delays in aircraft operations, the prediction of flight delays has become an active research topic in recent years. Particularly, the existence of code repositories for standardized machine learning applications as well as the available data on this subject, has led to an increasing number of papers, usually comparing the performance of different new and existing delay prediction techniques. In this study, we review the contributions of papers to delay prediction in recent years. Based on a six-step comparison framework, covering many aspects, starting with data collection / processing, including, e.g., model and feature selection, and ending with evaluation, integration of various technologies, and reproducibility considerations, we find that although the current studies have put forward effective concerns, there are still some challenges in the field of delay prediction. We elaborate on how to overcome this stage by discussing a set of research directions, which hopefully help other researchers to perform better future studies and help to reduce the impact of delays on air transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are essential components of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Vehicular Social Networks (VSN). As the number of connected vehicles continues to grow, the importance of ensuring security and privacy within VANETs becomes paramount. Robust authentication protocols are essential to safeguard vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, given the vulnerability of the open wireless communication medium in VANETs to interception and manipulation. While researchers are actively developing authentication and privacy schemes to secure message exchanges, existing solutions have not fully satisfied all the security and privacy requirements, thereby fueling ongoing research in this field. A significant challenge in this context is balancing the conflicting goals of privacy—protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access—and traceability—ensuring accountability by identifying malicious actors. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of VANETs, covering their key components, prevalent attack types, and the security and privacy prerequisites essential for effective authentication and privacy mechanisms. Specifically, the paper delves into the realm of identity-based authentication schemes within VANETs, subjecting them to rigorous evaluation based on security, privacy, and scalability. The primary objective is to empower the research community to design and implement efficient and secure authentication schemes, minimizing communication and computational overhead while ensuring resilience against a multitude of potential attacks.},

The automotive and aviation industries have been pioneers in adopting DTs for enhanced efficiency, predictive maintenance, and real-time decision-making. However, the maritime industry, crucial to global trade and logistics, has lagged in DT implementation. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically surveying DT applications in the automotive and aviation industries and exploring how this knowledge can be transferred to the maritime industry. By analyzing existing literature, identifying key trends, and summarizing best practices, a comprehensive roadmap is provided for maritime industry adoption of DT technology. The surveyed papers are selected systematically following the PRISMA statement and categorized based on characteristics such as single vs. multiple systems, modeling methods (model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid), and life-cycle phases. We introduce DT models using a five-dimensional framework and analyze their characteristics in terms of research object, subsystem application, and modeling method. Additionally, DT applications from a product life-cycle perspective, covering design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases are examined. Knowledge transfer from the automotive and aviation industries to the maritime industry is summarized. In the automotive industry, DTs enhance vehicle efficiency and safety, particularly for autonomous and electric vehicles. Aviation DT research focuses on predictive maintenance, pilot training, and real-time monitoring to improve operational efficiency and safety. The maritime industry faces data challenges and operational complexity but has significant potential for DTs to enhance ship performance, safety, and predictive maintenance.},

Some studies have integrated differential privacy techniques into traditional truth discovery algorithms to protect data privacy. However, due to the neglect of outliers and limitations in budget allocation, these schemes still need improvement in the accuracy of discovery results. To solve these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme called PriPTD to achieve secure and accurate truth discovery services over crowdsourced data streams. Instead of assuming that worker weights are always stable between two neighboring timestamps, we delve deeper to consider outliers where worker weights change rapidly. Accordingly, we develop an outlier-aware weight estimation method with a time series model to capture and handle these outliers. Furthermore, to ensure data utility under a limited budget, we devise a weight-aware budget allocation algorithm. Its core idea is that timestamps with higher importance consume a larger proportion of the remaining budget. Additionally, we design a noise-aware error adjustment approach to mitigate the adverse effects of introduced noise on accuracy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validate our scheme. Final comparative experiments against existing works confirm that our scheme achieves more accurate truth discovery while preserving privacy.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing and comprehending check-in sequences is crucial for various applications in smart cities. However, publicly available check-in datasets are often limited in scale due to privacy concerns. This poses a significant obstacle to academic research and downstream applications. Thus, it is urgent to generate realistic check-in datasets. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) as one of the most capable generation methods is a good choice to achieve this goal. However, generating check-in sequences using DDPM is not an easy feat. The difficulties lie in handling check-in sequences of variable lengths and capturing the correlation from check-in sequences’ distinct characteristics. This paper addresses the challenges by proposing a Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Diffusion Model (STCDM). This model introduces a novel spatio-temporal lossless encoding method that effectively encodes check-in sequences into a suitable format with equal length. Furthermore, we capture the spatio-temporal correlations with two disentangled diffusion modules to reduce the impact of the difference between spatial and temporal characteristics. Finally, we incorporate contrastive learning to enhance the relationship between diffusion modules. We generate four realistic datasets in different scenarios using STCDM and design four metrics for comparison. Experiments demonstrate that our generated datasets are more realistic and free of privacy leakage.},

  abstract     = {The widespread deployment of wireless and mobile devices results in a proliferation of decentralized spatio-temporal data. Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction assume that all data is available at a central location and suffers from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may face data privacy concerns and may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in decentralized settings where data streams into the system. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified federated continuous learning framework, which uses a horizontal federated learning mechanism for protecting data privacy and includes a global replay buffer with synthetic spatio-temporal data generated by the previously learned global model. For each client, we fuse the current training data with synthetic spatio-temporal data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the local models at clients each integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a spatio-temporal simple siamese network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Privacy-preserving collaborative data analysis is a popular research direction in recent years. Among all such analysis tasks, privacy-preserving SQL queries on multi-party databases are of particular industrial interest. Although the privacy concern can be addressed by many cryptographic tools, such as secure multi-party computation (MPC), the efficiency of executing such SQL queries is far from satisfactory, especially for high-volume databases. In particular, existing MPC-based solutions treat each SQL query as an isolated task and launch it from scratch, in spite of the nature that many SQL queries are done regularly and somewhat overlap in their functionalities. In this work, we are motivated to exploit this nature to improve the efficiency of MPC-based, privacy-preserving SQL queries. We introduce a cache-like optimization mechanism. To ensure a higher cache hit rate and reduce redundant MPC operators, we present a cache structure different from that of plain databases and design a set of cache strategies. Our optimization mechanism, SMPCache, can be built upon secret-sharing-based MPC frameworks, which attract much attention from the industry. To demonstrate the utility of SMPCache, we implement it on Rosetta, an open-source MPC library, and use real-world datasets to launch extensive experiments on some basic SQL operators (e.g., Filter, Order-by, Aggregation, and Inner-Join) and some representative composite SQL queries. To give a data point, we note that SMPCache can achieve most up to 3536× efficiency improvement on the TPC-DS dataset and 562× on the TPC-H dataset at a moderate storage cost. We also apply SMPCache to the basic SQL operators (Filter, Order-by, Group-by, Aggregation, and Inner-join) of the Secrecy framework, achieving up to 127.3× efficiency improvement.},

However, most existing methods are either not applicable or require additional steps for incomplete MVC.

Besides, noise or outliers might significantly degrade the overall clustering performance, which are not handled well by most existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework for incomplete and complete MVC named self-learning symmetric multi-view probabilistic clustering (SLS-MPC). SLS-MPC proposes a novel symmetric multi-view probability estimation and equivalently transforms multi-view pairwise posterior matching probability into composition of each view&#39;s individual distribution, which tolerates data missing and might extend to any number of views. Then, SLS-MPC proposes a novel self-learning probability function without any prior knowledge and hyper-parameters to learn each view&#39;s individual distribution. Next, graph-context-aware refinement with path propagation and co-neighbor propagation is used to refine pairwise probability, which alleviates the impact of noise and outliers. Finally, SLS-MPC proposes a probabilistic clustering algorithm to adjust clustering assignments by maximizing the joint probability iteratively without category information. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that SLS-MPC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.},

Many existing prediction approaches focus on single-point predictions, lacking the depth needed for effective decision-making and often overlooking market risk. To bridge this gap, we propose RAGIC, a novel risk-aware framework for stock interval prediction to quantify uncertainty. Our approach leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce future price sequences infused with randomness inherent in financial markets. RAGIC’s generator detects the risk perception of informed investors and captures historical price trends globally and locally. Then the risk-sensitive intervals is built upon the simulated future prices from sequence generation through statistical inference, incorporating horizon-wise insights. The interval’s width is adaptively adjusted to reflect market volatility. Importantly, our approach relies solely on publicly available data and incurs only low computational overhead. RAGIC’s evaluation across globally recognized broad-based indices demonstrates its balanced performance, offering both accuracy and informativeness. Achieving a consistent 95% coverage, RAGIC maintains a narrow interval width. This promising outcome suggests that our approach effectively addresses the challenges of stock market prediction while incorporating vital risk considerations.},

In this paper, we find that due to the lack of restrictions on projectors, the process of transferring user preferences will likely be interfered with. We refer to this phenomenon as preference inconsistency. It greatly wastes the power of feature-based knowledge distillation. To mitigate preference inconsistency, we propose PCKD, which consists of two regularization terms for projectors. We also propose a hybrid method that combines the two regularization terms. We focus on items with high preference scores and significantly mitigate preference inconsistency, improving the performance of feature-based knowledge distillation.

  abstract     = {Spatial databases play a vital role in a number of applications ranging from geographic information systems to location-based services. Application tasks typically access underlying spatial data to answer queries. However, non-experts lack the expertise necessary for formulating spatial queries. To fill in this gap, we propose an effective framework that translates natural language queries over spatial data into executable database queries, called NALSpatial. The framework consists of two core phases: (i) natural language understanding and (ii) natural language translation. Phase (i) extracts key entity information, comprehends the query intent and determines the query type by employing natural language processing techniques and deep learning algorithms. The key entities and query type are passed to phase (ii), which makes use of entity mapping rules and structured language models to construct executable database queries. NALSpatial supports dealing with five types of queries including (i) basic queries (e.g. distance and area), (ii) range queries, (iii) nearest neighbor queries, (iv) spatial join queries and (v) aggregation queries. We develop NALSpatial in an open-source extensible database system SECONDO. Extensive experiments show that NALSpatial on average achieves response time of about 2.5 seconds, translatability of 95% and translation precision of 92%, outperforming three state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Fraud detection, a classical data mining problem in finance applications, has risen in significance amid the intensifying confrontation between fraudsters and anti-fraud forces. Recently, an increasing number of criminals are constantly expanding the scope of fraud activities to covet the property of innocent victims. However, most existing approaches require abundant historical records to mine fraud patterns from financial transaction behaviors, thereby leading to significant challenges to protect minority groups, who are less involved in the modern financial market but also under the threat of fraudsters nowadays. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel community-enhanced multi-relation graph neural network-based model, named CMR-GNN, to address the important defects of existing fraud detection models in the tail effect situation. In particular, we first construct multiple types of relation graphs from historical transactions and then devise a clustering-based neural network module to capture diverse patterns from transaction communities. To mitigate information lacking tailed nodes, we proposed tailed-groups learning modules to aggregate features from similarly clustered subgraphs by graph convolution networks. Extensive experiments on both the real-world and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines but also could effectively harness information within transaction communities while mitigating the impact of tail effects.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the internet has led to an alarming increase in the dissemination of fake news, which has had many negative effects on society. Various methods have been proposed for detecting fake news. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations. First, most existing works only consider news as separate entities and do not consider the correlations between fake news and real news. Moreover, these works are usually conducted in the Euclidean space, which is unable to capture complex relationships between news, in particular the hierarchical relationships. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel Multi-modal Hyperbolic Representation framework (MHR) for fake news detection. Specifically, we capture the correlations between news for graph construction to arrange and analyze different news. To fully utilize the multi-modal characteristics, we first extract the textual and visual information, and then design a Lorentzian multi-modal fusion module to fuse them as the node information in the graph. By utilizing the fully hyperbolic graph neural networks, we learn the graph’s representation in hyperbolic space, followed by a detector for detecting fake news. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MHR model achieves state-of-the-art performance, indicating the benefits of hyperbolic representation.},

  abstract     = {Cold-start recommendation is a long-standing challenge when presenting potential preferred items to new users. Most empirical studies leverage side information to promote cold-start recommendation. In this work, we focus on cross-domain cold-start recommendation, which aims to provide suggestions to those non-overlapping users who have only interacted in the source domain and are viewed as new users in the target domain. Pre-training and then mapping is the common solution for the cross-domain cold-start recommendation. The former learns domain-specific user preference, and the latter transfers preference knowledge from the source to the target domain. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that current mapping-based methods still have the following limitations. First, current mapping functions fail to fully consider the similarity of user behavioral patterns, either common transfer or personalized transfer mappings. Second, sparse supervision signals from the limited overlapping users, lead to insufficient mapping function learning for recommendation. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel MACDR model for cross-domain cold-start recommendation. Specifically, MACDR consists of two elaborate modules: a Prototype enhanced Mixture-Of-Experts (PMOE) based mapping function and a Preference Distribution Alignment (PDA) enhanced optimization. PMOE is designed to balance the transfer patterns of common and personalized preferences, following the basis that similar users share similar preference transfer. Furthermore, to alleviate the sparse supervision issue, PDA is designed to explore the utilization of non-overlapping users in an unsupervised manner based on the prototype distribution alignment technique. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In recent literature, various types of auxiliary data have been integrated alongside stock prices to improve prediction accuracy, such as textual news and correlational information. However, they typically rely on directly related documents or symmetric price correlations to make predictions for a particular stock (we refer to as “self-influence”). In this paper, we propose a Memory-Aware Graph Interactive Causal Network (MagicNet) that considers both temporal and spatial dependencies in financial documents and introduces causality-based correlations between multivariate stocks in a hierarchical fashion. MagicNet involves a text memory slot for each stock to retain the most influential texts over time and contains a dynamic interaction graph based on causal relationships to aggregate interactive influences asymmetrically. We believe that MagicNet leverages influential texts across stocks and explores their interrelationships through a logical structure, improving predictions on multiple stocks (we refer to as “interactive-influence”). The effectiveness of MagicNet is demonstrated through experiments on three real-world datasets, where MagicNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering an intuitive framework for understanding how texts and correlations affect future stock prices.},

Weight perturbation-based unlearning is common but typically modifies parameters globally. We propose fine-grained Top-K and Random-k parameters perturbed inexact machine unlearning that address the privacy needs while keeping the computational costs tractable. However, commonly used training data are independent and identically distributed, for inexact machine unlearning, current metrics are inadequate in quantifying unlearning degree that occurs after unlearning. To address this quantification issue, we introduce SPD-GAN, which subtly perturbs data distribution targeted for unlearning. Then, we evaluate unlearning degree by measuring the performance difference of the models on the perturbed unlearning data before and after unlearning. Furthermore, to demonstrate efficacy, we tackle the challenge of evaluating machine unlearning by assessing model generalization across unlearning and remaining data. To better assess the unlearning effect and model generalization, we propose novel metrics, namely, the forgetting rate and memory retention rate. By implementing these innovative techniques and metrics, we achieve computationally efficacious privacy protection in machine learning applications without significant sacrifice of model performance. A by-product of our work is a novel method for evaluating and quantifying unlearning degree.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) enables clients to perform searches and updates on an encrypted database outsourced to an untrusted server while preserving the privacy of data and queries. For restricting information leakage, it is very important to limit what the server can learn about the deleted data during searches after the deletion, i.e., to satisfy backward privacy. However, previous backward privacy definitions only considered the logical deletion of keywords in documents while ignoring security risks caused by the actual deletion of documents. Moreover, existing SSE schemes often depend on heavy cryptographic primitives for achieving high-level backward privacy, which greatly degrades the end-to-end performance. To this end, we define a new backward privacy notion named BP-DEL, which restricts the information leakage of the actual deletion. Moreover, we design a hybrid index structure that provides BP-DEL for SSE schemes such that they support deletions securely. Based on the hybrid index, we propose a BP-DEL construction named LUNA and design its protocols with a trusted execution environment (TEE) to maintain the index efficiently. Finally, we implement LUNA in the MySQL database by encapsulating it in UDFs. The experimental results show that LUNA has a performance much better than previous works satisfying BP-DEL.},

Recent studies have shown promise in using the Large Language Model (LLM) as causal experts to construct autonomous expert-guided causal discovery systems through causal reasoning between pairwise variables. However, their performance is hampered by inaccuracies in aligning LLM-derived causal knowledge with the actual causal structure. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel LLM-driven causal discovery framework that limits LLM’s prior within a reliable range. Instead of pairwise causal reasoning that requires both precise and comprehensive output results, the LLM is directed to focus on each single aspect separately. By combining these distinct causal insights, a unified set of structural constraints is created, termed a harmonized prior, which draws on their respective strengths to ensure prior accuracy. On this basis, we introduce plug-and-play integrations of the harmonized prior into mainstream categories of structure learning methods, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios. Evaluations on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The success of most existing works is built on the critical assumption that the dynamic is fixed, which is unrealistic in many open-world scenarios, such as drone delivery and online chatting, where agents may need to deal with environments with unpredictable changing dynamics (hereafter, real non-stationary environment). Therefore, learning changing dynamics in a real non-stationary environment offers both significant benefits and challenges. This paper proposes a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that proactively and dynamically detects possible changes and Learns these Latent and Changing Dynamics (LLCD) in a latent Markovian space for real non-stationary environments. To ensure the Markovian property of the RL model and improve computational efficiency, we employ a latent space model to learn the environment’s transition dynamics. Furthermore, we perform online change detection in the latent space to promptly identify change points in non-stationary environments. Then, we utilize the detected information to help the agent adapt to new conditions. Experiments indicate that the rewards of the proposed algorithm accumulate for the most rapid adaptions to environmental change, among other benefits.

The exploration of these underlying intents, particularly through the lens of meta-paths in HGs, presents us with two principal challenges: i) How to integrate CL with intents; ii) How to mitigate noise from meta-path-driven intents. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework termed Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (IHGCL), which designed to enhance CL-based recommendation by capturing the intents contained within meta-paths. Specifically, the IHGCL framework includes: i) a meta-path-based Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) approach to effectively integrate intents into the recommendation, constructing intent-intent contrast and intent-interaction contrast; ii) a Bottlenecked AutoEncoder (BAE) that combines mask propagation with the information bottleneck principle to significantly reduce noise perturbations introduced by meta-paths.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end efficient knowledge hypergraph embedding model, HyCubE, which designs a novel 3D circular convolutional neural network and the alternate mask stack strategy to enhance the interaction and extraction of feature information comprehensively. Furthermore, our proposed model achieves a better trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency by adaptively adjusting the 3D circular convolutional layer structure to handle $n$-ary knowledge tuples of different arities with fewer parameters. In addition, we use a knowledge hypergraph 1-N multilinear scoring way to accelerate the model training efficiency further. Finally, extensive experimental results on all datasets demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with an average improvement of 8.22% and a maximum improvement of 33.82% across all metrics.

In the WDI e-commerce, one of the most important problems is to estimate the full-link delivery time for decision-making. Traditional methods designed for separate warehouse-distribution models struggle to address challenges in integrated systems. The difficulties stem from two main factors: (i) the contextual influence exerted by neighboring units within heterogeneous delivery networks, and (ii) the uncertainty in delivery times caused by dynamic and periodic temporal factors such as fluctuations in online sales volumes and the varying characteristics of different delivery units (e.g., warehouses and sorting centers). To address these challenges, we propose a novel full-link delivery time estimation framework called Heterogeneous Periodic Spatial-Temporal Graph Transformer (HPST-GT). First, we develop heterogeneous graph transformers to capture the hierarchical and diverse information of the warehouse-distribution network. Next, we design spatial-temporal transformers based on heterogeneous features to analyze the correlation between spatial and temporal information. Finally, we create a heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph prediction module to estimate full-link delivery time.

  abstract     = {Few-shot classification is increasingly relevant in emerging applications, such as university course classification in intelligent education systems. University course classification helps students acquire specific skills, comprehend course purposes, and assists departments in defining training goals. However, classifying frontier courses presents challenges due to the absence of labels and descriptions. Few-shot learning addresses this by acquiring meta-knowledge. Heterogeneous graphs (HGs), rich in semantic information, introduce complexities that make few-shot particularly challenging. Addressing this problem, we propose a subgraph-aware convolutional few-shot classification method on HGs (HG-SCC). We first formalize the subgraph sampling strategy for HGs and different views under meta-paths. Then, the layer number adaptive spectral-based graph convolution is designed for personalized node embedding. Furthermore, a high-order convolution operation with classes as nodes is designed to increase the class representation coverage. Modeling subgraph centrality, combined with node features, captures structural information, improving awareness of each sampled subgraph, thus alleviating sparsity in new class labels and enhancing classification accuracy. Euclidean distance-based and task-affected cosine similarity-based classifiers under different meta-paths are proposed, with stacking introduced to blend multiple classifiers based on subgraph features. Experimental results show that our method has high performance in course classification and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a weighted and unconstrained variant of the well-known minimum $k$ union problem: Given a bipartite graph $\mathcal {G}(U,V,E)$ with weights for all nodes in $V$, find a set $S\subseteq V$ such that the ratio between the total weight of the nodes in $S$ and the number of their distinct adjacent nodes in $U$ is maximized. Our problem, which we term Heavy Nodes in a Small Neighborhood (HNSN), finds applications in marketing, team formation, and money laundering detection. For example, in the latter application, $S$ represents bank account holders who obtain illicit money from some peers of a criminal and route it through their accounts to a target account belonging to the criminal. We prove that HNSN can be solved exactly in polynomial time via linear programming. We also develop several algorithms offering different effectiveness/efficiency trade-offs: an exact algorithm, based on node contraction, graph decomposition, and linear programming, as well as three peeling algorithms. The first peeling algorithm is a near-linear time approximation algorithm with a tight approximation ratio, the second is an iterative algorithm that converges to an optimal solution in a very small number of iterations in practice, and the third is a near-linear time greedy heuristic. In addition, we formalize a money laundering scenario involving multiple target accounts and show how our algorithms can be extended to deal with it. Our experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that our algorithms find (near-)optimal solutions, outperforming a natural baseline, and that they can detect money laundering more effectively and efficiently than two state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data are frequently encountered in diverse real-world applications involving complex interactions among numerous nodes. Approaches based on latent feature analysis (LFA) have proven effective in performing representation learning in HDI data. Nevertheless, they cannot handle the high-order connectivity among nodes in HDI data well, resulting in severe accuracy loss. To address the previously mentioned issue, we present a novel model in this paper, namely Graph Linear Convolution Pooling Network (GLCPN). The proposed GLCPN adopts the three-fold ideas. First, it leverages simplified graph convolutions to efficiently capture high-order connectivity among nodes for learning representations of matrix factorization. Second, a simple yet effective priori convolution operator is adopted by each graph neural layer to capture node-node collaboration for aggregation. Third, a locality-enhanced pooling scheme is designed to holistically utilize multi-layer representations of the neighborhood. Therefore, GLCPN can effectively acquire the hidden information in HDI data with high efficiency. In addition, we have conducted a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the proposed GLCPN is more expressive compared with existing graph neural networks for HDI data. Extensive experiments have been further conducted on ten well-established HDI datasets from various applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GLCPN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models for learning representations in HDI data evaluated by accuracy and efficiency metrics.},

The notable efficacy of GC and its broad prospects have garnered significant attention and spurred extensive research. This survey paper provides an up-to-date and systematic overview of GC, organizing existing research into five categories aligned with critical GC evaluation criteria: effectiveness, generalization, efficiency, fairness, and robustness. To facilitate an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of GC, this paper examines various methods under each category and thoroughly discusses two essential components within GC: optimization strategies and condensed graph generation. We also empirically compare and analyze representative GC methods with diverse optimization strategies based on the five proposed GC evaluation criteria.

  abstract     = {To address the issue of label sparsity in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), heterogeneous graph few-shot learning (HGFL) has recently emerged. HGFL aims to extract meta-knowledge from source HGs with rich-labeled data and transfers it to a target HG, facilitating learning new classes with few-labeled training data and improving predictions on unlabeled testing data. Existing methods typically assume the same distribution across the source HG, training data, and testing data. However, in practice, distribution shifts in HGFL are inevitable due to (1) the scarcity of source HGs that match the target HG&#39;s distribution, and (2) the unpredictable data generation mechanism of the target HG. Such distribution shifts can degrade the performance of existing methods, leading to a novel problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in HGFL. To address this challenging problem, we propose COHF, a Causal OOD Heterogeneous graph Few-shot learning model. In COHF, we first adopt a bottom-up data generative perspective to identify the invariance principle for OOD generalization. Then, based on this principle, we design a novel variational autoencoder-based heterogeneous graph neural network (VAE-HGNN) to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts. Finally, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that incorporates VAE-HGNN to effectively transfer meta-knowledge in OOD environments. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of COHF over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Considering that in many practical applications, data owners are reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns, we study an unexplored problem involving collaboratively building the dictionary-based model over the data owners without disclosing their private data (i.e., in the federated scenario). We propose FedDict, a novel dictionary-based TSC approach customized for the federated setting to benefit from the advantages of the centralized algorithms. To further improve the performance and practicality, we propose a novel federated optimization algorithm for training logistic regression classifiers using dictionary features. The algorithm does not rely on any secure broker and is more accurate and efficient than existing solutions without hyper-parameter tuning. We also propose two contract algorithms for federated dictionary building, such that the user can flexibly balance the running time and the TSC performance through a pre-defined time limit. Extensive experiments on a total of 117 highly heterogeneous datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods and the superiority over existing solutions.},

Hyperedge prediction is to predict future or unobserved hyperedges, which is a fundamental task in many real-world applications (e.g., group recommendation). Despite the recent breakthrough of hyperedge prediction methods, the following challenges have been rarely studied: (C1) How to aggregate the nodes in each hyperedge candidate for accurate hyperedge prediction? and (C2) How to mitigate the inherent data sparsity problem in hyperedge prediction? To tackle both challenges together, in this paper, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction framework ($\mathsf{CASH}$&lt;mml:math xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mml:mi mathvariant=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;CASH&lt;/mml:mi&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;) that employs (1) context-aware node aggregation to precisely capture complex relations among nodes in each hyperedge for (C1) and (2) self-supervised contrastive learning in the context of hyperedge prediction to enhance hypergraph representations for (C2). Furthermore, as for (C2), we propose a hyperedge-aware augmentation method to fully exploit the latent semantics behind the original hypergraph and consider both node-level and group-level contrasts (i.e., dual contrasts) for better node and hyperedge representations. Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that $\mathsf{CASH}$ consistently outperforms all competing methods in terms of the accuracy in hyperedge prediction and each of the proposed strategies is effective in improving the model accuracy of $\mathsf{CASH}$.},

  abstract     = {Big time series are increasingly available from an ever wider range of IoT-enabled sensors deployed in various environments. Significant insights can be gained by mining temporal patterns from these time series. Temporal pattern mining (TPM) extends traditional pattern mining by adding event time intervals into extracted patterns, making them more expressive at the expense of increased time and space complexities. Besides frequent temporal patterns (FTPs), which occur frequently in the entire dataset, another useful type of temporal patterns are so-called rare temporal patterns (RTPs), which appear rarely but with high confidence. Mining rare temporal patterns yields additional challenges. For FTP mining, the temporal information and complex relations between events already create an exponential search space. For RTP mining, the support measure is set very low, leading to a further combinatorial explosion and potentially producing too many uninteresting patterns. Thus, there is a need for a better approach to mine frequent and rare temporal patterns. This paper presents our Generalized Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (GTPMfTS) approach that can mine both types of patterns, with the following specific contributions: (1) The end-to-end GTPMfTS process taking time series as input and producing frequent/rare temporal patterns as output. (2) The efficient Generalized Temporal Pattern Mining (GTPM) algorithm mines frequent and rare temporal patterns using efficient data structures for fast retrieval of events and patterns during the mining process, and employs effective pruning techniques for significantly faster mining. (3) An approximate version of GTPM that uses mutual information, a measure of data correlation, to prune unpromising time series from the search space. (4) An extensive experimental evaluation of GTPM for rare temporal pattern mining (RTPM) and frequent temporal pattern mining (FTPM), showing that RTPM and FTPM significantly outperform the baselines on runtime and memory consumption, and can scale to big datasets. The approximate RTPM is up to one order of magnitude, and the approximate FTPM is up to two orders of magnitude, faster than the baselines, while retaining high accuracy.},

A path-aware graph learning module is designed to capture crucial semantic relationships among entities over evidence. Extensive experiments support our model&#39;s superior performance, surpassing SOTA methodologies with a difference of 2-3% in F1-score and accuracy for Politifact and Gossipcop datasets.

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems typically rely on users’ historical behavior to infer their preferences. However, when new entries emerge, the system cannot make accurate prediction due to the lack of historical data. This is known as the “cold-start” problem, which not only limits the exposure of new items but also impacts the first experience of new users severely. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue, but existing methods have limitations in dealing with the differences in user preferences and sparse monitoring data. To overcome these limitations, Dual enhanced Meta-learning with Adaptive Task Sampling is proposed. First, we propose an embedding enhancement strategy for cold nodes. Specifically, we map the cold-start embeddings into the warm space based on the common features shared across all nodes, and then add uniform noise to create the contrastive views. This strategy injects warm co-occurrence signals into the content of cold nodes, effectively enriching the feature space of cold nodes. Second, we introduce an adaptive task scheduler to measure the effectiveness of different meta-tasks and filter out the noise from invalid tasks. We assign different sampling probabilities to the tasks based on the learning process (gradient similarity) and the learning result (loss) of the meta-tasks. Finally, we consider the above two modules as auxiliary tasks for the main meta-model. Then, joint optimization is carried out through a multi-task learning framework. Experiments in three cold-start scenarios show that our approach outperforms the most advanced baselines, including traditional methods, HIN-based methods, and meta-learning-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) predicts future performance by modeling students’ historical interactions, and understanding students’ affective states can enhance the effectiveness of KT, thereby improving the quality of education. Although traditional KT values students’ cognition and learning behaviors, efficient evaluation of students’ affective states and their application in KT still require further exploration due to the non-affect-oriented nature of the data and budget constraints. To address this issue, we propose a computation-driven approach, Dynamic Affect Simulation Knowledge Tracing (DASKT), to explore the impact of various student affective states (such as frustration, concentration, boredom, and confusion) on their knowledge states. In this model, we first extract affective factors from students’ non-affect-oriented behavioral data, then use clustering and spatiotemporal sequence modeling to accurately simulate students’ dynamic affect changes when dealing with different problems. Subsequently, we incorporate affect with time-series analysis to improve the model&#39;s ability to infer knowledge states over time and space. Extensive experimental results on two public real-world educational datasets show that DASKT can achieve more reasonable knowledge states under the effect of students’ affective states. Moreover, DASKT outperforms the most advanced KT methods in predicting student performance. Our research highlights a promising avenue for future KT studies, focusing on achieving high interpretability and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Unlike the traditional recommender systems that rely on historical data such as clicks or purchases, a conversational recommender system (CRS) aims to provide a personalized recommendation through a natural conversation. The conversational interaction facilitates capturing not only explicit preference from mentioned items but also implicit states, such as a user’s current situation and emotional states from a dialogue context. Nevertheless, existing CRSs fall short of fully exploiting a dialogue context since they primarily derive explicit user preferences from the items and item-attributes mentioned in a conversation. To address this limitation and attain a comprehensive understanding of a dialogue context, we propose CoreSense, a conversational recommender system enhanced with social commonsense knowledge. In other words, CoreSense exploits the social commonsense knowledge graph ATOMIC to capture the user’s implicit states, such as a user’s current situation and emotional states, from a dialogue context. Thus, the social commonsense knowledge-augmented CRS can provide a more appropriate recommendation from a given dialogue context. Furthermore, we enhance the collaborative filtering effect by utilizing the user’s states inferred from commonsense knowledge as an improved criterion for retrieving other dialogues of similar interests. Extensive experiments on CRS benchmark datasets show that CoreSense provides human-like recommendations and responses based on inferred user states, achieving significant performance improvements.},

With the shining of cloud computing, it is desirable to transfer the computing burden to the server with abundant computing resources to reduce the cost of local machines. Nonetheless, under the honest-but-curious cloud assumption, the server may peek at the data, raising privacy concerns. To eliminate the risk of data privacy leakage, we propose CloudRGK to securely perform Random walk Graph Kernel(RGK), one of the most well-known graph kernels, on the cloud. We first prove that the edge- and vertex-labeled graphs could be transformed into an equivalent matrix representation. Afterward, we prove that the cloud could perform the core operations in RGK on the encrypted graphs without feature information loss. Evaluations of the real-world graph data demonstrate that our strategy significantly reduces the overhead of the local party to perform RGK without performance degradation. Meanwhile, it introduces only a small amount of extra computation cost. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work towards private graph kernel computation on the cloud.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving field of urban development, precise traffic prediction is essential for optimizing traffic and mitigating congestion. While traditional graph learning-based models effectively exploit complex spatial-temporal correlations, their reliance on trivially generated graph structures or deeply intertwined adjacency learning without supervised loss significantly impedes their efficiency. This paper presents Contrastive Learning of spatial-tEmporal trAffic data Representations (CLEAR) framework, a comprehensive approach to spatial-temporal traffic data representation learning aimed at enhancing the accuracy of traffic predictions. Employing self-supervised contrastive learning, CLEAR strategically extracts discriminative embeddings from both traffic time-series and graph-structured data. The framework applies weak and strong data augmentations to facilitate subsequent exploitations of intrinsic spatial-temporal correlations that are critical for accurate prediction. Additionally, CLEAR incorporates advanced representation learning models that transmute these dynamics into compact, semantic-rich embeddings, thereby elevating downstream models’ prediction accuracy. By integrating with existing traffic predictors, CLEAR boosts predicting performance and accelerates the training process by effectively decoupling adjacency learning from correlation learning. Comprehensive experiments validate that CLEAR can robustly enhance the capabilities of existing graph learning-based traffic predictors and provide superior traffic predictions with a straightforward representation decoder. This investigation highlights the potential of contrastive representation learning in developing robust traffic data representations for traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {Link prediction, which aims to predict the existence of a link between two nodes in a network, has various applications ranging from friend recommendation to protein interaction prediction. Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based link prediction has demonstrated its advantages and achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Typically, GNN-based link prediction can be formulated as a binary classification problem. However, in link prediction, we only have positive data (observed links) and unlabeled data (unobserved links), but no negative data. Therefore, Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning naturally fits the link prediction scenario. Unfortunately, the unknown class prior and data imbalance of networks impede the use of PU learning in link prediction. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a novel model-agnostic PU learning algorithm for GNN-based link prediction by means of Positive-Unlabeled Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (PU-AUC) optimization. The proposed method is free of class prior estimation and able to handle the data imbalance. Moreover, we propose an accelerated method to reduce the operational complexity of PU-AUC optimization from quadratic to approximately linear. Extensive experiments back up our theoretical analysis and validate that the proposed method is capable of boosting the performance of the state-of-the-art GNN-based link prediction models.},

  abstract     = {Logical reasoning consistently plays a fundamental and significant role in the domains of knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a noteworthy innovation in natural language processing (NLP). However, the question of whether LLMs can effectively address the task of logical reasoning, which requires gradual cognitive inference similar to human intelligence, remains unanswered. To this end, we aim to bridge this gap and provide comprehensive evaluations in this paper. First, to offer systematic evaluations, we select fifteen typical logical reasoning datasets and organize them into deductive, inductive, abductive and mixed-form reasoning settings. Considering the comprehensiveness of evaluations, we include 3 early-era representative LLMs and 4 trending LLMs. Second, different from previous evaluations relying only on simple metrics (e.g., accuracy), we propose fine-level evaluations in objective and subjective manners, covering both answers and explanations, including answer correctness, explain correctness, explain completeness and explain redundancy. Additionally, to uncover the logical flaws of LLMs, problematic cases will be attributed to five error types from two dimensions, i.e., evidence selection process and reasoning process. Third, to avoid the influences of knowledge bias and concentrate purely on benchmarking the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a new dataset with neutral content. Based on the in-depth evaluations, this paper finally forms a general evaluation scheme of logical reasoning capability from six dimensions (i.e., Correct, Rigorous, Self-aware, Active, Oriented and No hallucination). It reflects the pros and cons of LLMs and gives guiding directions for future works.},

Thanks to the strong expressivity of deep neural networks, they are emerging as a promising choice for capturing the patterns in asynchronous sequences, in the context of temporal point process. In this paper, we first review recent research emphasis and difficulties in modeling asynchronous event sequences with deep temporal point process, which can be concluded into four fields: encoding of history sequence, formulation of conditional intensity function, relational discovery of events, and learning approaches for optimization. We introduce most of the recently proposed models by dismantling them into four parts and conduct experiments by re-modularizing the first three parts with the same learning strategy for a fair empirical evaluation. Besides, we extend the history encoders and conditional intensity function family and propose a Granger causality discovery framework for exploiting the relations among multi-types of events. Because the Granger causality can be represented by the Granger causality graph, discrete graph structure learning in the framework of Variational Inference is employed to reveal latent structures of the graph. Further experiments show that the proposed framework with latent graph discovery can both capture the relations and achieve an improved fitting and predicting performance.},

However, many existing approaches inadequately incorporate personalized information across users and scenarios. Moreover, the conversion rate (CVR) task in multi-task learning often encounters challenges like sample selection bias, resulting from systematic differences between the training and inference sample spaces, and data sparsity due to infrequent clicks. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Entire-space Multi-scenario Multi-task Transfer Learning model (AEM$^{2}$TL) with four key modules: 1) Scenario-CGC (Scenario-Customized Gate Control), 2) Task-CGC (Task-Customized Gate Control), 3) Personalized Gating Network, and 4) Entire-space Supervised Multi-Task Module. AEM$^{2}$TL employs a multi-gate mechanism to effectively integrate shared and specific information across scenarios and tasks, enhancing prediction adaptability. To further improve task-specific personalization, it incorporates personalized prior features and applies a gating mechanism that dynamically scales the top-layer neural units. A novel post-impression behavior decomposition technique is designed to leverage all impression samples across the entire space, mitigating sample selection bias and data sparsity. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism dynamically allocates attention to tasks based on their relative importance, ensuring optimal task prioritization. Extensive experiments on one industrial and two real-world public datasets indicate the superiority of AEM$^{2}$TL over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Maritime transportation, vital for nearly 90% of global trade, necessitates precise vessel trajectory prediction for safety and efficiency. Although the Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides a comprehensive data source, how to model these multi-modal and heterogeneous time-varying sequences (such as vessels’ kinetic information and ocean weather factors) poses a formidable challenge. Moreover, most existing approaches are limited by the confined scope of vessel trajectory modeling, making it impossible to consider the unique characteristics of maritime transportation system. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework called AISFuser to i) encode unique maritime traffic network into graphical representations, and ii) introduce the heterogeneity into multi-modal temporal embeddings through Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Specifically, our AISFuser is constructed by combining an attention-based graph block with a transformer network to encode information across space and time, respectively. In terms of temporal dimension, one SSL auxiliary task is also designed to enhance the heterogeneity of temporal representations and supplement the main vessel prediction task. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed AISFuser on a real-world AIS dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can forecast multiple attributes of vessel trajectory for over 10 hours into the future, outperforming competitive baselines.},

  abstract     = {In multisource information fusion (MSIF), Dempster–Shafer evidence (DSE) theory offers a useful framework for reasoning under uncertainty. However, measuring the divergence between belief functions within this theory remains an unresolved challenge, particularly in managing conflicts in MSIF, which is crucial for enhancing decision-making level. In this paper, several divergence and distance functions are proposed to quantitatively measure discrimination between belief functions in DSE theory, including the reverse evidential KullbackLeibler (REKL) divergence, evidential Jeffrey’s (EJ) divergence, evidential JensenShannon (EJS) divergence, evidential $\chi ^{2}$ (E$\chi ^{2}$) divergence, evidential symmetric $\chi ^{2}$ (ES$\chi ^{2}$) divergence, evidential triangular (ET) discrimination, evidential Hellinger (EH) distance, and evidential total variation (ETV) distance. On this basis, a generalized $f$-divergence, also called the evidential $f$-divergence (Ef divergence), is proposed. Depending on different kernel functions, the Ef divergence degrades into several specific classes: EKL, REKL, EJ, EJS, E$\chi ^{2}$ and ES$\chi ^{2}$ divergences, ET discrimination, and EH and ETV distances. Notably, when basic belief assignments (BBAs) are transformed into probability distributions, these classes of Ef divergence revert to their classical counterparts in statistics and information theory. In addition, several Ef-MSIF algorithms are proposed for pattern classification based on the classes of Ef divergence. These Ef-MSIF algorithms are evaluated on real-world datasets to demonstrate their practical effectiveness in solving classification problems. In summary, this work represents the first attempt to extend classical $f$-divergence within the DSE framework, capitalizing on the distinct properties of BBA functions. Experimental results show that the proposed Ef-MSIF algorithms improve classification accuracy, with the best-performing Ef-MSIF algorithm achieving an overall performance difference approximately 1.22 times smaller than the suboptimal method and 14.12 times smaller than the worst-performing method.},

  abstract     = {Debt collection is utilized for risk control after credit card delinquency. The existing rule-based method tends to be myopic and non-adaptive due to the delayed feedback. Reinforcement learning (RL) has an inherent advantage in dealing with such task and can learn policies end-to-end. However, employing RL here remains difficult because of different interaction processes from standard RL and the notorious problem of optimistic estimations in the offline setting. To tackle these challenges, we first propose an Alternating Q-Learning (AQL) framework to adapt debt collection processes to comparable procedures in RL. Based on AQL, we further develop an Adversarial Conservative Alternating Q-Learning (ACAQL) to address the issue of overoptimistic estimations. Specifically, adversarial conservative value regularization is proposed to balance optimism and conservatism on Q-values of out-of-distribution actions. Furthermore, ACAQL utilizes the counterfactual action stitching to mitigate the overestimation by enhancing behavior data. Finally, we evaluate ACAQL on a real-world dataset created from Bank of Shanghai. Offline experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates the optimistic estimation issue. Moreover, we conduct online A/B tests on the bank, and ACAQL achieves at least a 6% improvement of the debt recovery rate, which yields tangible economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {Learning from data streams collected sequentially over time are widely spread in real-world applications. Previous methods typically assume that the data stream has a feature space with a fixed or clearly defined evolution pattern, as well as a balanced class distribution. However, in many practical scenarios, such as environmental monitoring systems, the frequency of anomalous events is significantly imbalanced compared to normal ones and the feature space dynamically changes due to ecological evolution and sensor lifespan. To alleviate this important but rarely studied problem, we propose the Adaptive Learning in Imbalace data streams with Unpredictable feature evolution (ALIU) algorithm. As data streams with imbalanced class distribution arrive, ALIU first mitigates the model&#39;s bias for the majority class by reweighting the adaptive gradient descent magnitudes between different classes. Then, a new loss function is proposed that simultaneously focuses on misclassifications and maintains model robustness. Further, when imbalanced data streams arrive with feature evolutions, we reuse the previously learned model and update the incomplete and augmented features by adopting the adaptive gradient strategy and ensemble method, respectively. Finally, we utilize the projected technique to build a sparse yet efficient model. Based on a few common and mild assumptions, we theoretically analyze that the ALIU satisfies a sub-linear regret bound under both convex and strong convex loss functions and the performance of model can be improved with the assistance of old features. Besides, extensive experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Finding top-$K$ frequent items has been a hot topic in data stream processing with wide-ranging applications. However, most existing sketch algorithms focus on finding local top-$K$ in a single data stream. In this paper, we tackle finding global top-$K$ across multiple data streams. We find that using prior sketch algorithms directly is often unfair in global scenarios, degrading global top-$K$ accuracy. We define top-$K$-fairness and show its importance for finding global top-$K$. To achieve this, we propose the Double-Anonymous (DA) sketch, where double-anonymity ensures fairness. We also propose two techniques, hot-filtering and early-freezing, to improve accuracy further. We theoretically prove that the DA sketch achieves top-$K$-fairness while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments verify top-$K$-fairness in disjoint data streams, showing that the DA sketch&#39;s error is up to 129 times (60 times on average) smaller than the state-of-the-art. To enhance the applicability and technical depth, we also investigate how to extend the DA sketch to general distributed data stream scenarios and how to provide a fairer and more accurate global ranking for top-$K$ items. The experimental results show that the extended version of the DA sketch can indeed compute better rankings and still has significant advantages in general data streams.},

  abstract     = {Cultural differences can impact how learning is delivered in higher education. Past studies have overlooked the impacts of specific cultures on learning and technology integration, and therefore, this article explores aspects of culture and resource implications for technology-enabled learning. The study collected data from students, lecturers, and university administrators at the University of Papua New Guinea via questionnaire (n = 58), focus group (n = 15), and interview (n = 2). Descriptive statistics of questionnaire responses supplemented by conventional content analysis of interview and focus group responses revealed perceptions of higher education and teaching in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Often, learning technologies are adopted without careful consideration of the users’ requirements, especially their cultural influences, which sometimes hinder the effective implementation of chosen technologies for learning. This article discusses the key findings related to technology limitations, cultural influences, communication issues, and other challenges unique to PNG. It highlights that students and lecturers are keen to embrace technology in teaching and learning; however, institutional constraints hinder the successful implementation of technology that would allow them to advance learning. This, coupled with cultural influences such as traditional customs, practices, and belief systems, also affects how Western education is delivered. The article concludes with recommendations for implementing culturally sensitive learning management systems that can accommodate infrastructure and social challenges.},

  abstract     = {In an online learning environment, both instruction and assessments take place virtually where students are primarily responsible for managing their own learning. This requires a high level of self-regulation from students. Many online students, however, lack self-regulation skills and are ill-prepared for autonomous learning, which can cause students to feel disengaged from online activities. In addition, students tend to feel isolated during online activities due to limited social interaction. To address these challenges, this study explores the use of chatbots to facilitate students’ self-regulated learning strategies and promote social presence to alleviate their feelings of isolation. Using a two-phase mixed-methods design, this study evaluates students’ behavioral engagement, perceived self-regulated learning strategies, and social presence in chatbot-supported online learning. In the first phase (Stage I Study), 39 students engaged in a goal-setting chatbot activity that employed the SMART framework and social presence indicators. The findings served as the basis for improving the chatbot design in the second phase (Stage II Study), in which 25 students interacted with the revised chatbot, focusing on goal-setting, help-seeking, self-evaluation, and social interaction with instructor&#39;s presence. The results show that the students in both studies had positive online learning experiences with the chatbots. Follow-up interviews with students and instructors provide valuable insights and suggestions for refining the chatbot design, such as chatbots for ongoing monitoring of self-regulation habits and personalized social interaction. Drawing from the evidence, we discuss a set of chatbot design principles that support students’ self-regulated learning and social presence in online settings.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict students&#39; future performances based on their former exercises and additional information in educational settings. KT has received significant attention since it facilitates personalized experiences in educational situations. Simultaneously, the autoregressive (AR) modeling on the sequence of former exercises has been proven effective for this task. One of the primary challenges in AR modeling for KT is effectively representing the anterior (preresponse) and posterior (postresponse) states of learners across exercises. Existing methods often employ complex model architectures to update learner states using question and response records. In this study, we propose a novel perspective on KT task by treating it as a generative process, consistent with the principles of AR models. We demonstrate that knowledge states can be directly represented through AR encodings on a question–response alternate sequence, where model generate the most probable representation in hidden state space by analyzing history interactions. This approach underpins our framework, termed alternate autoregressive KT (AAKT). In addition, we incorporate supplementary educational information, such as question-related skills, into our framework through an auxiliary task, and include extra exercise details, such as response time, as additional inputs. Our proposed framework is implemented using advanced AR technologies from Natural Language Generation for both training and prediction. Empirical evaluations on four real-world KT datasets indicate that AAKT consistently outperforms all baseline models in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, and root mean square error. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies and visualized analysis validate the effectiveness of key components in AAKT.},

However, the limited processing power and battery capacity of user devices make it challenging to balance Quality of Experience (QoE) and terminal energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) regarding power control and rendering capacity allocation by formulating it as a multi-objective optimization problem. This problem aims to minimize energy consumption while maximizing Meta-Immersion (MI), a metric that integrates objective network performance with subjective user perception. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with User-Object-Attention (M2ERL-UOA) algorithm. The algorithm employs a prediction-driven evolutionary learning mechanism for multi-agents, coupled with optimized rendering capacity decisions for virtual objects. The algorithm can yield a superior Pareto front that attains the Nash equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can generate Pareto fronts, effectively adapts to dynamic user preferences, and significantly reduces decision-making time compared to several benchmarks.},

However, this inevitably exposes the user&#39;s location privacy information when suffering from the side-channel attacks based on offloading decision behaviors and Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI). Existing works only consider the scenario with one untrusted edge server or defend only against one of the attacks. In this paper, we first study the edge task offloading problem with comprehensive privacy protection against these side-channel attacks from multiple edge servers. To address this problem while ensuring satisfactory offloading utility, we develop a Location Imitation-based Edge Task Offloading approach LITO. Specifically, we first determine a suitable perturbation region centered at the user&#39;s real location for a balance between offloading utility and privacy protection, and then propose a modified Laplace mechanism to generate a fake location meeting geo-indistinguishability within the region. Subsequently, to mislead the side-channel attacks to the fake location, we design an approximate algorithm and a transmit power control strategy to imitate the offloading decisions and RSSIs at the fake location, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate the performance of LITO in improving privacy protection and guaranteeing offloading utility.},

  abstract     = {The integration of time-sensitive networking (TSN) and fifth-generation (5G) offers a promising solution for real-time and reliable data transmission in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, current research focuses on traffic scheduling in TSN-5G networks to support low latency. New challenges arise when TSN-5G networks leverage time-aware shaper (TAS) and frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) to achieve low latency and high reliability. Simply combining TAS and FRER (SCTF) requires scheduling all time-triggered (TT) flows and their replica flows, which substantially increases the computational complexity of gate control lists (GCLs) and severely weakens scheduling capabilities. Moreover, the packet elimination function (PEF) in FRER may induce packet misordering. In this paper, we propose an efficient and fault-tolerant time-aware shaper (EF-TAS) mechanism for TSN-5G networks. EF-TAS only allocates timeslots for TT flows, while replica TT (RT) flows are delivered using a best-effort strategy. Due to the potential violation of deadlines in RT flows, we design an adaptive cyclic GCL window (ACGW)-based hybrid scheduling (AHS) algorithm to schedule TT and RT flows differentially. The AHS algorithm utilizes network calculus to ensure the timely arrival of RT flows without affecting the deterministic transmission of TT flows. In particular, we provide upper bounds on the amount of reordering to quantify the disorder caused by PEF and analyze the impact of introducing the packet ordering function (POF) on EF-TAS performance. The evaluation results show that EF-TAS not only meets the reliability and deadline requirements but also significantly reduces the total number of GCL entries and the computation time of GCLs compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

To address this challenge, tile-based streaming has been proposed to deliver only the focused part of the video instead of the entire one. However, the impact of cybersickness, akin to motion sickness, on tile selection in VR has not been explored. In this paper, we investigate Multi-user Tile Streaming with Cybersickness Control (MTSCC) in an adaptive 360$^\circ$ video streaming system with multicast and cybersickness alleviation. We propose a novel $m^{2}$-competitive online algorithm that utilizes Individual Sickness Indicator (ISI) and Bitrate Restriction Indicator (BRI) to evaluate user cybersickness tendency and network bandwidth efficiency. Moreover, we introduce the Video Loss Indicator (VLI) and Quality Variance Indicator (QVI) to assess video quality loss and quality difference between tiles. We also propose a multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm with confidence bound-based reward (video quality) and cost (cybersickness) estimation. The algorithm learns the weighting factor of each user&#39;s cost to slow down cybersickness accumulation for users with high cybersickness tendencies. We prove that the algorithm converges to an optimal solution over time. According to simulation with real network settings, our proposed algorithms outperform baselines in terms of video quality and cybersickness accumulation.},

In this paper, we propose a brand new RFID-based virtual boundary scheme together with its detection algorithm called RF-Boundary, which has the competitive advantages of being battery-free and easy-to-maintain. We develop two technologies of phase gradient and dual-antenna AoA to address the key challenges posed by RF-boundary, in terms of lack of calibration information and multi-edge interference. Besides, we consider the presence of multipath in the real world applications, model the effect on signals in the dynamic scenarios, and demonstrate the robustness of our phase gradient-based scheme under multipath. We implement a prototype of RF-Boundary with commercial RFID systems and a mobile robot. Extensive experiments verify the feasibility as well as the good performance of RF-Boundary, with a mean detection error of only 8.6 cm.},

  abstract     = {Compared with synchronous federated learning (FL), asynchronous FL (AFL) has attracted more and more attention in edge computing (EC) fields because of its strong adaptability to heterogeneous application scenarios. However, the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across devices and the staleness-aware estimation of unreliable wireless connections and limited edge resources make it much more difficult to achieve better AFL-related applications. To handle this problem, we propose an Adaptive Staleness-aware Momentum Accelerated AFL (ASMAFL) algorithm to reduce the resources consumption of heterogeneous wireless communication EC (WCEC) scenarios, as well as decrease the negative impact of Non-IID data for model training. Specifically, we first introduce the staleness-aware parameter and a unified momentum gradient descent (GD) framework to reformulate AFL. Then, we establish global convergence properties of AFL, derive an upper bound on AFL convergence rate, and find that the bound is related to the staleness-aware parameter and Non-IIDness. Next, we formulate the bound into a minimization problem of resource consumption under given model accuracy, and the corresponding staleness-aware parameter of devices will be recomputed after each asynchronous aggregation to eliminate the differences of local models’ contribution to global model aggregation. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to validate the superiority of ASMAFL in model accuracy, convergence rate, resources consumption, Non-IID issue, etc.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), vehicles will generate massive data and computation demands, necessitating computation offloading at the edge. However, existing research faces challenges in efficiency and trust. In this paper, we explore the IoV computation offloading from both user and edge facility provider perspectives, working to optimize the quality of experience (QoE), load balancing, and success rate based on challenges to efficiency and trust. First, two vehicle interconnection models are constructed to extend the linkable range of intra-road and inter-road vehicles while considering the maximum link time constraint. Then, a dynamic planning method is proposed, combining the reputation and feedback mechanisms, which can schedule edge resources online based on the cumulative computation latency of each service side, reliability value, and historical behavior. These two phases further improve the efficiency of edge services. Subsequently, blockchain is combined to optimize the trust problem of edge collaboration, and an edge-limited Byzantine fault tolerance local consensus mechanism is proposed to optimize consensus efficiency and ensure the reliability of edge services. Finally, this paper conducts dynamic experiments on real-world datasets, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and models in multiple vehicle density datasets and experimental scenarios.},

For cell-free systems, in this paper, we propose a hybrid downlink transmission method that combines non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multiuser diversity (MUD). To evaluate the communication performance of the system, we derive closed-form expressions for both instantaneous and average sum rates of UEs using the NOMA and MUD transmission methods. Furthermore, we comprehensively investigate the spectrum efficiency of the NOMA and MUD transmission methods to provide a basis for selecting the hybrid transmission strategy. On the basis of the proposed hybrid transmission strategy, we can derive an optimal hybrid transmission strategy for the scenarios with two access points (APs) and two UEs. Particularly, we extend the aforementioned strategy to the scenarios with multiple UEs, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system spectrum efficiency subject to the transmission strategy and power allocation. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity user selection strategy and power allocation algorithm to solve the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the hybrid transmission method and power allocation strategy can achieve higher system spectrum efficiency. Our results reveal the influence of key parameters on the downlink spectrum efficiency, analytically and numerically.},

The task involves nearby cooperative vehicles sending their camera data to an edge server, which then merges the local views to create a global traffic view. While multi-camera perception has been actively researched, existing solutions often rely on deep learning models, resulting in excessive processing latency. In contrast, we propose leveraging the state estimation technique from the robotics field for this task. We explicitly model and solve for the system state, addressing additional challenges brought by object mobility and vision obstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive state estimation pipeline to further accelerate system state notifications, supported by a motion prediction method that optimizes position accuracy and perception smoothness.

First, it is observed that, relying solely on a single pipeline for encoding and enhancement of mobile videos proves insufficient, because of the fluctuations in end-edge bandwidth and computing resources. Therefore, two distinct pipelines are introduced in the JEE system, namely, the encode-decode-enhance pipeline and the enhance-encode-decode pipeline. We then characterize the relationship of accuracy, transmission overhead, and computing overhead of these two pipelines through extensive experiments. Considering the significant demands of transmission and computing for low-light videos, we formulate an optimization problem to strike a balance between accuracy and delay, where the available end-edge bandwidth and computing resources are unknown in advance. To solve this mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we propose an algorithm based on online gradient descent, enabling adaptive pipeline selection and joint encoding and enhancement configuration. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear dynamic regret, highlighting its capability to the accuracy improvement and delay reduction in online environments. Experimental comparison against baselines demonstrates that, JEE can achieve up to a 27.32% increase in accuracy and a 26.18% reduction in delay.},

Although some IoT devices can process data locally, most devices may have limited power and computational capability. Since mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new paradigm to provide strong computing capability at the edge of networks close to users, these devices can offload their tasks to MEC servers. Therefore, designing an efficient computation offloading strategy to decide whether the tasks to be offloaded to MEC servers becomes crucial. In this paper, we study the computation offloading for IoT devices based on a non-cooperative game with one-shot random access, where users’ offloading decisions can be made independently to realize distributed offloading. In particular, we discuss the offloading game with and without sharing information among devices and find the Nash equilibrium (NE). Besides, we analyze the effective bandwidth as a performance metric from a device perspective, which considering the Quality of Service (QoS) of network layer while analyzing users’ offloading strategies.

Due to data isolation, these multi-scenario events need to be jointly trained to achieve better prediction results. However, traditional federated learning methods face significant challenges when handling distributed event sequences. And the effectiveness of existing modeling approaches for event sequences in federated contexts has not been thoroughly explored. To this end, we propose Federated Multivariate Temporal Point Processes (FedMTPP), which enables learning from distributed event sequences within a novel federated learning framework and leverages efficient event modeling technology, MTPP, to forecast future events. Specifically, FedMTPP restores the temporal structure of the original event sequence by rearranging event embeddings and redesigns the autoregressive-based hidden representation computation in traditional MTPP, making it more suitable for federated prediction tasks. Additionally, FedMTPP incorporates advanced encryption techniques to effectively safeguard user privacy and security. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that FedMTPP substantially improves the performance of local models and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art centralized MTPP methods.},

The benefits of FD on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput in IEEE 802.11 WLANs are well-documented. However, cross-layer interactions between the FD MAC protocol and transport layer protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are less explored. We consider a WLAN with uplink and downlink TCP flows as well as UDP flows between stations (STAs) and a server via an FD access point (AP). We study an STA-initiated FD MAC protocol in which the AP can transmit on the downlink while receiving on the uplink. Using a novel FD-specific STA saturation approximation, Markov renewal theory, and fixed-point analysis, we derive novel expressions for the uplink and downlink TCP and UDP saturation throughputs. Our analysis shows that the AP is no longer a bottleneck and may be unsaturated unlike in conventional half-duplex (HD) WLANs. Despite greater contention and cross-link interference between STAs, FD achieves a higher TCP throughput than HD. FD causes a significant degradation in the UDP throughput. In the unsaturated regime, FD achieves a lower average downlink TCP packet delay than HD.},

On the other hand, to provide ubiquitous services, heterogeneous static and mobile access and backbone networks will be integrated in the sixth-generation (6G) systems, so mobile users can take advantage of multiple access options for better services. Multi-path transport-layer protocols like Multi-Path QUIC (MPQUIC) show promise in utilizing multiple access links to address the impact of mobility. However, the optimal link selection that aims to provide statistical QoS guarantee for video streaming in a mobile environment with both user mobility and network mobility remains an open issue. In this paper, based on a lightweight Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) technique, we develop a QoS-driven Contextual MAB (QC-MAB) framework for MPQUIC, which makes an intelligent access network selection and adaptively enables FEC coding to trade off delay, reliability and goodput. Extensive simulation results with ns-3 show that the proposed QC-MAB framework can outperform the state-of-the-art solutions. It achieves up to ten times lower video interruption ratio and three times higher goodput in highly dynamic mobile environments.},

However, the scarce device memory severely hinders the scalability of these models. We present EdgeLLM, an efficient on-device LLM inference system for models whose sizes exceed the device&#39;s memory capacity. EdgeLLM is built atop speculative decoding, which delegates most tokens to a smaller, memory-resident (draft) LLM. EdgeLLM integrates three novel techniques: (1) Instead of generating a fixed width and depth token tree, EdgeLLM proposes compute-efficient branch navigation and verification to pace the progress of different branches according to their accepted probability to prevent the wasteful allocation of computing resources to the wrong branch and to verify them all at once efficiently. (2) It uses a self-adaptive fallback strategy that promptly initiates the verification process when the smaller LLM generates an incorrect token. (3) To not block the generation, EdgeLLM proposes speculatively generating tokens during large LLM verification with the compute-IO pipeline. Through extensive experiments, EdgeLLM exhibits impressive token generation speed which is up to 9.3× faster than existing engines.},

  abstract     = {The highly heterogeneous ecosystem of Next Generation (NextG) wireless communication systems calls for novel networking paradigms where functionalities and operations can be dynamically and optimally reconfigured in real time to adapt to changing traffic conditions and satisfy stringent and diverse Quality of Service (QoS) demands. Open Radio Access Network (RAN) technologies, and specifically those being standardized by the O-RAN Alliance, make it possible to integrate network intelligence into the once monolithic RAN via intelligent applications, namely, xApps and rApps. These applications enable flexible control of the network resources and functionalities, network management, and orchestration through data-driven intelligent control loops. Recent work has showed how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is effective in dynamically controlling O-RAN systems. However, how to design these solutions in a way that manages heterogeneous optimization goals and prevents unfair resource allocation is still an open challenge, with the logic within DRL agents often considered as a opaque system. In this paper, we introduce PandORA, a framework to automatically design and train DRL agents for Open RAN applications, package them as xApps and evaluate them in the Colosseum wireless network emulator. We benchmark 23 xApps that embed DRL agents trained using different architectures, reward design, action spaces, and decision-making timescales, and with the ability to hierarchically control different network parameters. We test these agents on the Colosseum testbed under diverse traffic and channel conditions, in static and mobile setups. Our experimental results indicate how suitable fine-tuning of the RAN control timers, as well as proper selection of reward designs and DRL architectures can boost network performance according to the network conditions and demand. Notably, finer decision-making granularities can improve Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)’s performance by $\sim\! 56\%$ and even increase Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) Throughput by $\sim\! 99\%$.},

In this work, we focus on cross-silo FL, where clients become the model owners after training and are only concerned about the model&#39;s generalization performance on their local data. Due to the data heterogeneity issue, asking all the clients to join a single FL training process may result in model performance degradation. To investigate the effectiveness of collaboration, we first derive a generalization bound for each client when collaborating with others or when training independently. We show that the generalization performance of a client can be improved by collaborating with other clients that have more training data and similar data distributions. Our analysis allows us to formulate a client utility maximization problem by partitioning clients into multiple collaborating groups. A hierarchical clustering-based collaborative training (HCCT) scheme is then proposed, which does not need to fix in advance the number of groups. We further analyze the convergence of HCCT for general non-convex loss functions which unveils the effect of data similarity among clients. Extensive simulations show that HCCT achieves better generalization performance than baseline schemes, whereas it degenerates to independent training and conventional FL in specific scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing is conducive to reducing service response time and improving service quality by pushing cloud functions to a network&#39;s edges. Most existing works in edge computing focus on utility maximization of task offloading on static edges with a single antenna. Besides, trajectory planning of mobile edges, e.g., autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) is also rarely discussed. In this paper, we are the first to jointly discuss the deadline-ware task offloading and AAV trajectory planning problem in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) AAV-aided mobile edge computing system. Due to discrete variables and highly coupling nonconvex constraints, we equivalently convert the original problem into a more solvable form by introducing auxiliary variables. Next, a penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed to achieve a global optimal solution to the problem. Besides, we proposed a profit-based fireworks algorithm in a relatively lower time to reduce the execution time for large-scale networks. Extensive evaluation results reveal that our proposed optimal algorithms could significantly outperform static offloading algorithms and other algorithms by 25% on average.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of eavesdropping on audio via radio frequency signals or videos, which capture physical surface vibrations from surrounding objects. However, these methods are inadequate for intercepting internally transmitted audio through wired media. In this work, we introduce radio-frequency retroreflector attack (RFRA) and bridge this gap by proposing an RFRA-based eavesdropping system, RF-Parrot${}^{\mathbf {2}}$, capable of wirelessly capturing audio signals transmitted through earphone wires. Our system entails embedding a tiny field-effect transistor within the wire to establish a battery-free retroreflector, whose reflective efficiency is correlated with the amplitude of the audio signal. To preserve the details of audio signals, we designed a unique retroreflector using a depletion-mode MOSFET (D-MOSFET). This MOSFET can be triggered by any voltage level present in the audio signals, thus guaranteeing no information loss during activation. However, the D-MOSFET introduces a nonlinear convolution operation on the original audio, resulting in distorted audio eavesdropping. Thus, we devised an engineering solution which utilized a novel convolutional neural network in conjunction with an efficient Parallel WaveGAN vocoder to reconstruct the original audio. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate a strong similarity between the reconstructed audio and the original, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy in speech command recognition.},

  abstract     = {Indoor Sound Source Localization (ISSL) is under growing focus with the rapid development of smart IOT intelligence. The predominant approaches typically involve constructing large microphone (Mic) array systems or extracting multiple angles of arrival (AOAs). However, the performance of these solutions is often constrained by the physical size of the array. Besides, there has been limited focus on 3D localization with a single small-sized Mic array. In this paper, we propose HearLoc, an ISSL system that can directly locate 3D sources with a ten-$cm$ Mic array. We demonstrate that the localization ability and dimensional capability can be significantly enhanced by incorporating the time differences of arrival (TDOAs) between the line-of-sight (LOS) and ECHO signals from nearby reflective surfaces. Our approach involves a localization method that selectively sums the correlation powers at useful TDOAs induced by each location. We also design a data processing pipeline with interpolation, normalization and pruning techniques to improve system accuracy and efficiency. To further enhance scalability, we design an iterative algorithm for the ISSL problem with multiple sources and an array location calibration scheme. Experiments demonstrate that the HearLoc can effectively locate sound sources, exhibiting $2\times$/$3.7\times$ improvements in accuracy for 2D and 3D localization, respectively, and a $4\times$ increase in efficiency compared to the existing AOA-based ISSL solutions.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide aerial-terrestrial computing services in close proximity to mobile devices (MDs). However, meeting the demands of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks for MDs poses several challenges, including the demand-supply contradiction between MDs and MEC servers, the demand-supply discrepancy between MDs and MEC servers, the trajectory control requirements on energy efficiency and timeliness, and the different time-scale dynamics of the network. To address these issues, we first present a hierarchical architecture by incorporating terrestrial-aerial computing capabilities and leveraging UAV flexibility. Furthermore, we formulate a joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control problem to maximize the system utility. Since the problem is a non-convex and NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose a two-timescale joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control (TJCCT) approach for solving the problem. In the short timescale, we propose a price-incentive model for on-demand computing resource allocation and a matching mechanism-based method for computation offloading. In the long timescale, we propose a convex optimization-based method for UAV trajectory control. Besides, we theoretically prove the stability and polynomial complexity of TJCCT. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TJCCT is able to achieve superior performances in terms of the system utility, average processing rate, average completion delay, average completion ratio, and average cost, while meeting the energy constraints despite the trade-off of the increased energy consumption.},

However, implementing FL in dynamic wireless networks poses substantial communication challenges. Central to these challenges is the need for efficient communication strategies that can adapt to fluctuating network conditions and the growing number of participating devices, which can lead to unacceptable communication delays. In this article, we propose Stochastic Client Selection for Tree All-Reduce Federated Learning (CSTAR-FL), a novel approach that combines a probabilistic User Device (UD) selection strategy with a tree-based communication architecture to enhance communication efficiency in FL within densely populated wireless networks. By optimizing UD selection for effective model aggregation and employing an efficient data transmission structure, CSTAR-FL significantly reduces communication time and improves FL efficiency. Additionally, our approach ensures high global model accuracy under scenarios where data distribution is heterogeneous from User Device (UD)s. Extensive simulations in dynamic wireless network scenarios demonstrate that CSTAR-FL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing model convergence time by up to 40% without losing the global model accuracy. This makes CSTAR-FL a robust solution for efficient and scalable FL deployments in high-density environments.},

The distinct propagation characteristics of mmWaves, microwaves, as well as the vastly different hardware configurations of heterogeneous base stations, make traditional access strategies no longer effective. Therefore, to narrowing the gap between theory, practice, we investigate the access strategy in multi-band 5G heterogeneous networks, taking into account the characteristics of mobile users, asynchronous switching between uplink, downlink of pico base stations, asymmetric service requirements, user communication continuity. We formulate the problem as integer nonlinear programming, prove its intractability. Thereby, we decouple it into three subproblems: user association, switch point selection, subchannel allocation, design an algorithm based on optimal matching, spectral clustering to solve it efficiently.

To address the aforementioned issues simultaneously, we develop a Sparsified Random Partial Update framework for personalized Federated Learning (SRP-pFed), which builds upon the foundation of dynamic partial model updates. Specifically, we decouple the local model into personal and shared parts to achieve personalization. For each client, the ratio of its personal part associated with the local model, referred to as the update rate, is regularly renewed over the training procedure via a random walk process endowed with reinforced memory. In each global iteration, clients are clustered into different groups where the ones in the same group share a common update rate. Benefiting from such design, SRP-pFed realizes model personalization while substantially reducing communication costs in the uplink transmissions. We conduct extensive experiments on various training tasks with diverse heterogeneous data settings. The results demonstrate that the SRP-pFed consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in test accuracy and communication efficiency.},

Different from existing work, in this paper, we jointly integrate the power allocation, channel assignment, user selection, and allocation of computation frequency into the design of incentive mechanism, where each mobile user plays a dual role as both a buyer and a seller. Because of complex resource allocation, truthfulness guarantee in a dual role scenario, and unavailable prior information, the considered mechanism design problem is challenging. To tackle such combinatorial problem, we propose a Reinforcement Auction Mechanism (RAM), comprising two layers. The upper layer features a Hybrid Action Reinforcement Learning scheme to learn the outcomes of user selection and payments. In the lower layer, each selected mobile user optimizes its resources to maximize its utility. Theoretical analyses affirm that our proposed RAM ensures individual rationality and truthfulness.

However, incorporating UAVs into next-generation wireless communication systems poses significant challenges, particularly in sustaining high-rate and long-range secure communications against eavesdropping attacks. In this work, we consider a UAV swarm-enabled secure surveillance network system, where a UAV swarm forms a virtual antenna array to transmit sensitive surveillance data to a remote base station (RBS) via collaborative beamforming (CB) so as to resist mobile eavesdroppers. Specifically, we formulate an aerial secure communication and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (ASCEE-MOP) to maximize the secrecy rate of the system and to minimize the flight energy consumption of the UAV swarm. To address the non-convex, NP-hard and dynamic ASCEE-MOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-enabled twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) method. Specifically, GDMTD3 leverages an innovative application of diffusion models to determine optimal excitation current weights and position decisions of UAVs. The diffusion models can better capture the complex dynamics and the trade-off of the ASCEE-MOP, thereby yielding promising solutions. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with traditional deployment strategies and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Distributed optimization is a fundamental framework for collaborative inference over networks. The operation is modeled as the joint minimization of a shared objective which typically depends on local observations. Distributed optimization algorithms, such as the distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (D-ADMM), iteratively combine local computations and message exchanges. A main challenge associated with distributed optimization, and particularly with D-ADMM, is that it requires a large number of communications to reach consensus. In this work we propose unfolded D-ADMM, which follows the emerging deep unfolding methodology to enable D-ADMM to operate reliably with a predefined and small number of messages exchanged by each agent. Unfolded D-ADMM fully preserves the operation of D-ADMM, while leveraging data to tune the hyperparameters of each iteration. These hyperparameters can either be agent-specific, aiming at achieving the best performance within a fixed number of iterations over a given network, or shared among the agents, allowing to learn to distributedly optimize over different networks. We specialize unfolded D-ADMM for two representative settings: a distributed sparse recovery setup, and a distributed machine learning learning scenario. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach dramatically reduces the number of communications utilized by D-ADMM, without compromising on its performance.},

  abstract     = {The spotlight on autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) is to enhance wireless communications while ignoring the potential risk of AAVs acting as adversaries. Due to their mobility and flexibility, AAV eavesdroppers pose an immeasurable threat to legitimate wireless transmissions. However, the existing fixed jamming scheme without cooperation cannot counter the flexible and dynamic AAV eavesdropping. In this article, a cooperative intelligent jamming scheme is proposed, authorizing ground jammers (GJs) to interfere with AAV eavesdroppers, generating specific jamming shields between AAV eavesdroppers and legitimate users. Toward this end, we formulate a secrecy capacity maximization problem and model the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To address the challenge of the huge state space and action space with network dynamics, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a dueling network and double-Q learning (i.e., dueling double deep Q-network) to train policy networks. Then, we propose a multi-agent mixing network framework (QMIX)-based collaborative jamming algorithm to enable GJs to independently make decisions without sharing local information. Additionally, we perform extensive simulations to validate the superiority of our proposed scheme and present useful insights into practical implementation by elucidating the relationship between the deployment settings of GJs and the instantaneous secrecy capacity.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative edge computing (CEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling edge nodes to collaborate and execute tasks from end devices. Task offloading is a fundamental problem in CEC that decides when and where tasks are executed upon the arrival of tasks. However, the mobility of users often results in unstable connections, leading to network failures and resource underutilization. Existing works have not adequately addressed joint mobility-aware dependent task offloading and network flow scheduling, resulting in network congestion and suboptimal performance. To address this, we formulate an online joint mobility-aware dependent task offloading and bandwidth allocation problem, to improve the quality of service by reducing task completion time and energy consumption. We introduce a Mobility-aware Digital Twin-assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning (MDT-DRL) algorithm. Our digital twin model equips the reinforcement learning process by providing future states of mobile users, enabling efficient offloading plans for adapting to the mobile CEC system. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that MDT-DRL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on average task completion time and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {The increasingly popular federated learning still faces the practical challenge of non-independent and identically distributed data. Most efforts to address this issue focus on limiting local updates or enhancing model aggregation. However, these methods either restrict the learning capacity of local models or overlook the negative knowledge transfer caused by local objective divergences. In contrast, we observe that the global update can be re-expressed as a weighted sum of the gradients of samples from different classes. Therefore, we hypothesize that the competition among local updates may arise from the conflict between the gradients of samples belonging to different classes. Inspired by this insight, we introduce the novel perspective of orthogonal class gradients, aimed at eliminating interference between updates from different classes without the aforementioned drawbacks. To this end, this paper presents FedOCF, which implements orthogonal class gradient constraints by encouraging orthogonality among features of different classes. Specifically, FedOCF maintains a generator to learn features that are orthogonal for different classes and utilizes it to regularize features learned in local learning. Theoretically, we also demonstrate that FedOCF can improve generalization performance through feature conditional distribution alignment during local learning. Extensive experiments validate the excellent performance of FedOCF in various heterogeneous scenarios.},

However, traditional gesture-based HCI systems often require the design of new operation modes rather than conforming to user habits, thus increasing system learning costs. In this paper, we present TapWristband, a novel wearable sensor-based vibration sensing system that detects finger tapping by measuring wrist vibrations. We first perform real-world experiments to collect measurements for modeling the effects of the tapping motion on wearable wristband sensors including piezoelectric transducer (PZT) and inertial measurement unit (IMU). We find that a damped vibration model can be used to represent the relaxing phase of a vibration response due to tapping motion. Thus, we propose a mutual cross-correlation-based event segmentation algorithm to extract the vibration signal during the relaxing phase. After that, we develop feature extraction and classification algorithms to recognize the tapping patterns of five fingers across twelve key locations of a keypad system. Finally, we performed extensive experiments with thirteen participants to evaluate our system. Experimental results show that our low-cost vibration sensing system can achieve an average accuracy of over 93% with a tapping speed of over 100 taps per minute in real-world tapping scenarios.},

However, the lack of rich and fine-grained radar datasets hinders progress in developing generalized deep learning models for gesture recognition across various user postures (e.g., standing, sitting), positions, and scenes. To remedy this, we resort to designing a software pipeline that exploits wealthy 2D videos to generate realistic radar data, but it needs to address the challenge of simulating diversified and fine-grained reflection properties of user gestures. To this end, we design G3R with three key components: i) a gesture reflection point generator expands the arm&#39;s skeleton points to form human reflection points; ii) a signal simulation model simulates the multipath reflection and attenuation of radar signals to output the human intensity map; iii) an encoder-decoder model combines a sampling module and a fitting module to address the differences in number and distribution of points between generated and real-world radar data for generating realistic radar data. We implement and evaluate G3R using 2D videos from public data sources and self-collected real-world radar data, demonstrating its superiority over other state-of-the-art approaches for gesture recognition.},

To recognize IoT devices using the extracted geometries, Insight operates in two phases. At deployment time, it learns pairwise mappings from the visual geometries to the corresponding device identities. After that, it leverages the geometries scanned at run time to look for a partial assignment to the recorded geometries, allowing it to automatically recognize the IoT devices in AR view. As such, our system turns the IoT device recognition task into a geometry matching problem, which is further formalized as to perform Subset, Incomplete, and Duplicated Point Cloud Registration (SID-PCR) in this work. We design a deep neural network paying specific edge- and spectral-wise graph attention to solve SID-PCR, and implement a prototype that adaptively requests visual geometry scan and registration operations for accurate recognition.

  abstract     = {Today navigation applications (e.g., Waze and Google Maps) enable human users to learn and share the latest traffic observations, yet such information sharing simply aids selfish users to predict and choose the shortest paths to jam each other. Prior routing game studies focus on myopic users in oversimplified one-shot scenarios to regulate selfish routing via information hiding or pricing mechanisms. For practical human-in-the-loop learning (HILL) in repeated routing games, we face non-myopic users of differential past observations and need new mechanisms (preferably non-monetary) to persuade users to adhere to the optimal path recommendations. We model the repeated routing game in a typical parallel transportation network, which generally contains one deterministic path and $N$ stochastic paths. We first prove that no matter under the information sharing mechanism in use or the latest routing literature’s hiding mechanism, the resultant price of anarchy (PoA) for measuring the efficiency loss from social optimum can approach infinity, telling arbitrarily poor exploration-exploitation tradeoff over time. Then we propose a novel user-differential probabilistic recommendation (UPR) mechanism to differentiate and randomize path recommendations for users with differential learning histories. We prove that our UPR mechanism ensures interim individual rationality for all users and significantly reduces $\text{PoA}=\infty$ to close-to-optimal $\text{PoA}=1+\frac{1}{4N+3}$, which cannot be further reduced by any other non-monetary mechanism. In addition to theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets to generalize our routing graphs and validate the close-to-optimal performance of UPR mechanism.},

Detecting activities across different domains is an important and challenging problem. To reduce model complexity and improve recognition accuracy, we propose a novel approach to realize activity recognition across domains, named WiSDA. The proposed WiSDA contains two parts: data augmentation and a deep learning model. The recursive plots method is employed as the data augmentation to transform Wi-Fi channel state information into images, which can take advantage of the image recognition ability of the latter deep learning model. The proposed learning model utilizes weighted cosine similarity to align feature distributions among sub-domains activated by a deep network layer across different domains, thereby a domain-independent feature representation is generated. Based on this representation, WiSDA can make the recognition decision independent of domains, then the cross-domain recognition accuracy is increased. The numerical results illustrate that WiSDA achieves higher recognition accuracy and has lower complexity. The cross-domain recognition accuracy ranges from 89% to 93% with offline pre-training. Enhancing the pre-trained WiSDA with limited samples boosts cross-domain recognition accuracy to 97%.},

With the increasing adoption of edge platforms by web services, it is critical to balance both accuracy and efficiency in workload forecasting. In this paper, we propose XELASTIC, which offers three key improvements over the conference version. First, we redesigned the aggregation and disaggregation layers using GCNs to capture more complex relationships among workload series. Second, we introduced a supervised contrastive loss to enhance robustness against outliers, particularly for handling missing or abnormal data in real-world scenarios. Finally, we expanded the evaluation with additional baselines and larger datasets.

However, these methods often overlook the possibility that drivers may not follow these recommendations due to their personal preferences, leading to recommendation-decision inconsistency and further disrupting the supply-demand balance. To address this issue, we propose a preference-aware vehicle repositioning recommendation strategy for MoD systems, named FREE, which is based on a Coulomb Force directed approach. The core idea is to strike a balance between vehicle coordination and consistency between recommendations and driver decisions. First, we introduce a Coulomb force-based representation (CFR) to model coordination among vehicles. In this model, the interactions between vehicles and orders are represented as forces that drive the repositioning of vehicles. Next, we develop a driver preference learning model that accurately captures drivers’ preferences using triplet and consistency loss. We then integrate these preferences with the CFR into a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based repositioning algorithm to generate optimal recommendations. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of FREE through simulations using real-world data, demonstrating its superiority over existing benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {We focus on the transportation-aware trajectory recovery problem, which is distinct from the conventional vehicle-based trajectory recovery, facing three major challenges: heterogeneity, personalization and efficiency. For the heterogeneity, the velocity of the mobile object is intrinsically correlated with the specific transportation mode, containing inherent heterogeneity. For the personalization, the trajectory data is complicated by substantial variations in users, which are different in personalized behaviors. For the efficiency, previous works mostly employ sequence-to-sequence framework which limits their efficiency due to the auto-regressive inference pattern. To address these challenges, we design a novel efficient and effective multi-modal deep model, coined as PTrajRec, for transportation-aware trajectory recovery. Specifically, we initially embed location, behavior, and transportation mode modalities in distinct channels, which not only reflect spatio-temporal information encapsulated in location sequences but also introduce the heterogeneity and personalization characteristics associated with mode and behavior sequences. For further modeling these modalities, we employ the auto-correlation mechanism to learn periodic dependencies on the temporal dimension and the graph attention mechanism to learn road network dependencies on the spatial dimension. At last, we propose a dual-view constraint mechanism to assist the efficient trajectory recovery framework and design three auxiliary tasks to address the inherent heterogeneity and efficiency design. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines with reduced computation cost and excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous rolling-out of edge computing, Federated Learning (FL) has become a promising solution for intelligent Internet-of-things (IoT). In addition to resource constraints, deploying FL schemes in IoT networks is greatly challenged by heterogeneity in multiple dimensions. While heterogeneity in data distribution and computation capability has been extensively studied, the impact of distinct, even hybrid training paradigms on FL performances remains largely unknown. To answer this open question in the IoT context, we propose a Hybrid-Training Federated Learning (HT-FL) algorithm for the power-constrained IoT networks, incorporating both sequential and parallel training that naturally adapts to various sub-network topologies, while greatly reducing the energy consumption during the training stage. We demonstrate through analysis that the convergence of HT-FL is theoretically guaranteed, achieving $O (\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$ for carefully chosen learning rates. Experiments on multiple datasets show that, the proposed HT-FL outperforms existing FL schemes on multiple training tasks under various data distribution settings, while reducing an average of 20% energy consumption. In a more practical sense, a self-adaptive parameter-tuning strategy is also designed for HT-FL deployment, which can be easily extended to other multi-layer FL schemes in complex application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The exponential growth of data in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has created opportunities to improve traffic safety and efficiency through data trading. However, establishing trust among highly mobile and resource-constrained vehicles poses significant challenges for effective data trading in IoV. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based data trading scheme (LBDT), which ensures secure and efficient data trading in IoV. We introduce a proof-of-reputation (PoR) consensus mechanism to establish trustworthiness for data trading. Specifically, we use a progressive reputation mechainism to support the PoR consensus. LBDT utilizes a parallel-chain structure for the PoR consensus to minimize communication and storage costs while reducing transaction confirmation latency. Additionally, we adopt a double auction mechanism as an incentivizing strategy to encourage vehicle participation in data trading. We evaluate the performance of LBDT through extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that LBDT is highly effective and secure, achieving a transaction latency of approximately 4 seconds. Moreover, LBDT successfully mitigates communication and storage overheads by over 90%, thus establishing its superiority over state-of-the-art solutions under comparable conditions.},

  abstract     = {Radio sensing has emerged as a promising solution for monitoring vital signs in a contactless manner. However, most of the existing designs focus on stationary target and struggle with body motion interference. While some efforts have been made to address this issue, the lack of a physical explanation for the motion elimination principle makes them work as a blind signal separation way and thus leaves the body motion elimination problem still as an open challenge. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the existence of “dark pixels”–specific points on the same rigid body parts that share the same body movement but exhibit varying physiological motions, with these variations still preserving the physiological rhythm. By exploiting the inherent relationship between the dark pixels, we propose a cooperative sensing framework, Co-Sense, that can achieve robust radio sensing for non-stationary targets in an explainable way. Through extensive experiments, Co-Sense demonstrates its superiority over existing methods, achieving effective motion cancellation and breath sensing with a median absolute respiratory rate (RR) error of 0.36 respiration per minute (RPM) and breath wave correlation of 0.61 under non-stationary scenarios. The results indicate the great potential of Co-Sense in enhancing the accuracy of vital sign sensing with radio signals, especially in real-world environments where targets are rarely stationary.},

  abstract     = {Unlike traditional edge caching paradigms, similarity edge caching enables the retrieval of similar content from local caches to fulfill user requests, reducing reliance on remote data centers and improving system performance. Although several pioneering works have contributed to similarity edge caching, most focus on single-edge nodes and/or static environment settings, which are impractical for real-world applications. To address this gap, we investigate the similarity caching problem in dynamic cooperative edge networks, where a set of edge nodes cooperatively serve requests generated from arbitrary distributions with similar content over fluctuating transmission links. This presents a significant challenge, as it requires balancing content similarity with delivery latency over the transmission network and learning the environment in real-time to optimize caching policies. We frame this problem within an adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit framework to accommodate the continuously changing operational environment. To solve this, we propose an online learning-based approach named MABSCP, which dynamically updates caching policies based on real-time feedback to minimize the service cost of edge caching networks. To enhance implementation efficiency, we devise both an offline compact strategy construction method and an online Gibbs sampling method. Finally, trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms several existing methods in terms of system performance.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) in mobile environments faces significant communication bottlenecks. Gradient compression has proven as an effective solution to this issue, offering substantial benefits in environments with limited bandwidth and metered data. Yet, it encounters severe performance drops in non-IID environments due to a one-size-fits-all compression approach, which does not account for the varying data volumes across workers. Assigning varying compression ratios to workers with distinct data distributions and volumes is therefore a promising solution. This work derives the convergence rate of distributed SGD with non-uniform compression, which reveals the intricate relationship between model convergence and the compression ratios applied to individual workers. Accordingly, we frame the relative compression ratio assignment as an $n$-variable chi-squared nonlinear optimization problem, constrained by a limited communication budget. We propose DAGC-R, which assigns conservative compression to workers handling larger data volumes. Recognizing the computational limitations of mobile devices, we propose the DAGC-A, which is computationally less demanding and enhances the robustness of compression in non-IID scenarios. Our experiments confirm that the DAGC-R and DAGC-A can speed up the training speed by up to 25.43% and 16.65% compared to the uniform compression respectively, when dealing with highly imbalanced data volume distribution and restricted communication.},

Beyond considering bandwidth and computational resource limitations in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, it is crucial to address the issue of IoT devices often collecting data that lacks timely annotations, which can lead to latency and label deficiency issues. In most Federated Edge Learning mechanisms, clients’ weights are selected for offloading to the server. In this paper, we propose a solution for dynamic edge selection and wireless network allocation under semi-supervised and privacy protection settings, termed Semi-supervised Scheduling and Allocation Optimization for Federated Edge Learning (SSAFL). SSAFL is designed to adapt to various scenarios, including channel state variations, device heterogeneity, resource incentives, deadline control, label deficiencies, and Non-IID data distributions. This adaptability is achieved through the utilization of an Incentive Optimization framework that encompasses bandwidth allocation and device scheduling policies. Within SSAFL, we introduce the concept of a weighted bipartite graph network to tackle the Incentive Optimization problem and achieve a balance in large-scale optimization of device selection. Additionally, to address the label deficiency issue, we devise a Dynamic Timer for deadline control for each client. Comprehensive and confidential results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other Federated Edge Learning baselines.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, adaptive task assignment has been explored in spatial crowdsourcing. The challenge lies in how to adaptively partition the task stream to achieve the best utility for task assignment. A number of existing works have attempted to solve this challenge and achieve better performance by utilizing learning-based methods. Specifically, they mainly employ reinforcement learning to divide the task stream into a series of suitable batches and then perform task assignment in a batch fashion. Drawing inspiration from the effectiveness of human-machine collaborative decision-making, we aim to investigate human-in-the-loop methods to further enhance the performance of adaptive task assignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Human-in-the-Loop Adaptive Partition (HLAP), which consists of two primary modules: Reinforcement Learning Partition Decision (RL-PD) and Human Supervision and Guidance (HSG). In the RL-PD module, we develop an RL agent, referred to as the decision-maker, by integrating the dual attention network into the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to capture cross-dimensional contextual information and long-range dependencies for a better understanding of the environment. In the HSG module, we design a human-in-the-loop mechanism to optimize the performance of the decision-maker, focusing on addressing two key issues: when and how humans interact with the decision-maker. Furthermore, to alleviate the heavy workload on humans, we construct a supervisor based on RL to oversee the decision-maker&#39;s partition process and adaptively determine when human intervention is necessary. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the HLAP framework.},

Streaming over mobile networks is inherently challenging due to the latter&#39;s bandwidth fluctuations, motivating researchers to develop many sophisticated adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms to compensate. While ABR, together with prefetching, has been proposed for playlist streaming, its application to non-playlist streaming has received little attention. This work fills this gap by first exploring the efficacy of directly applying ABR to non-playlist streaming. Observing their limitations motivates the development of a new class of inter-stream bitrate adaptation (ISA) algorithms. Unlike ABR, ISA adapts bitrate on a per-video basis, which is not only simpler to implement and deploy but can even outperform ABR algorithms by up to 66.71% across a wide range of networks. Moreover, ISA and ABR are complementary such that they can be combined into Integrated Bitrate Adaptation (IBA) algorithms to raise performance gains further by up to 77.03%. In addition, this work develops a novel adaptive rebuffering duration (ARD) algorithm specifically designed for frame-based playback common in short-video services to further improve their performance under challenging network conditions. Together, ISA and ARD offer a new set of tools with progressive complexity-performance tradeoffs for enhancing the performance of short-video services.},

It is particularly challenging to deploy multiple FMs on edge devices, which not only have limited computational resources, but also encounter unseen input data from evolving domains or learning tasks. When new data arrives, existing prior art of FM mainly focuses on retraining compressed models of predetermined network architectures, limiting the feasibility of edge devices to efficiently achieve high accuracy for FMs. In this paper, we propose EdgeTA, a neuron-grained FM scaling system to maximize the overall accuracy of FMs promptly in response to their data dynamics. EdgeTA&#39;s key design features in scaling are (i) proxy mechanism, which adaptively transforms a FM into a compact architecture retaining the most important neurons to the input data, and (ii) neuron-grained scheduler, which jointly optimizes model sizes and resource allocation for all FMs on edge devices. Under tight retraining window and limited device resources, the design of EdgeTA can achieve most of the original FM&#39;s accuracy with much smaller retraining costs. We implement EdgeTA on FMs of natural language processing, computer vision and multimodal applications. Comparison results against state-of-the-art techniques show that our approach improves accuracy by 21.88% and reduces memory footprint and energy consumptions by 27.14% and 65.65%, while further achieving 15.96% overall accuracy improvement via neuron-grained scheduling.},

Conventional research has highlighted the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which train their model based on optimization theory, to enhance the performance of wireless communications. However, there are practical issues that makes SVM difficult to apply to a wireless communication system. SVM generally entails a heavy training process with high computational complexity, and the model requires a significant amount of time for training. Also, the entire dataset needs to be trained at once, requiring a substantial amount of memory for data storage. To enable SVM in wireless communications, we propose Real-Time Channel Vector Classifier (RTCVC), which employs a light-weight SVM model capable of training and processing incoming data in real-time. A novel input data pre-processing technique is implemented to reduce the computational overhead associated with calculating non-linear functions. The rearranged formulation of the original problem also allows each SVM sub-model to be trained distributively over time based on incremental parameters. For performance evaluation, we implement the RTCVC inter-operating with 5G beam index detection, whose detection probability has been theoretically proven to be significantly enhanced by SVM. The software modules of the RTCVC are based on LibSVM, a well-known open-source library for implementing SVM sub-models. The experimental results confirm that RTCVC significantly reduces training time while maintaining suitable performance for 5G beam index detection.},

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel dual-cloud edge collaborative task offloading architecture in the satellite network-assisted edge computing environment, namely, Satellite-Ground Task Offloading (SGTO). The architecture employs a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite and a ground cloud computing center as satellite cloud and ground cloud, respectively, and LEO satellites as edge nodes. We formally define the task offloading problem in the SGTO with the aim of minimizing the average latency and average energy consumption. We then propose an adaptive approach named SGTO-A from the perspective of satellites to adaptively solve the problem leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we transform the task offloading problem into a Markov decision process and adopt the generalized proximal policy optimization (GePPO) algorithm to solve the problem.

  abstract     = {Dynamic ridesharing has gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing ridesharing studies often focus on optimizing order dispatching and vehicle repositioning separately, leading to short-sighted decisions and underutilization of the ridesharing potential. In this paper, we propose a novel joint optimization framework called $\mathtt {JODR}$. By coordinating order dispatching and vehicle repositioning, $\mathtt {JODR}$ enhances ridesharing efficiency while ensuring high-quality service. The core idea of $\mathtt {JODR}$ is to dispatch ride orders with high demand in specific mobility directions to vehicles with sufficient available capacity, effectively balancing future supply and demand in those directions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel mobility value function that can predict the long-term mobility value of matching an order with its travel direction. By considering orders’ directional mobility values, service quality assessments, and available vehicle capacities, $\mathtt {JODR}$ formulates the order dispatching as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem to derive the optimal order-vehicle assignments. Furthermore, the value function helps the intelligent repositioning of idle vehicles. Extensive experiments conducted on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of $\mathtt {JODR}$ over state-of-the-art methods across various performance metrics. These experimental results validate the effectiveness of $\mathtt {JODR}$ in improving the ridesharing efficiency and experience.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful approach that learns general semantic representations from large-scale unlabeled data to make downstream tasks solve easier, offering significant potential in enhancing downstream performance and alleviating the appetite for large-scale annotated data. However, existing SSL techniques, predominantly designed for natural images, may be prone to shortcuts when applied to RF signals. This study presents surprising empirical findings showing that SSL can indeed learn meaningful RF representations by employing simple group shuffle (GS) and asymmetry augmentation techniques. The GS augmentation is inspired by blind calibration tasks in Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters (TIADC). By treating the original RF signal as a composite output from sub-ADCs, GS augmentation enriches RF signals while preserving their global semantics. We also provide a theoretical validation of the GS augmentation’s singular value consistency. Notably, we observe that the shortcut is essentially a domain gap between the pre-trained and the downstream task models. This issue can be mitigated by an asymmetry augmentation technique, which maximizes the similarity between an original RF signal and its augmented version, rather than between two augmentations of the same RF signal. By integrating group shuffle and asymmetry augmentation (GSAA) into an existing contrastive learning framework, we develop an effective contrastive learning approach for RF signals. Our evaluations, spanning seven downstream RF sensing tasks across two general RF devices (WiFi and radar), strongly demonstrate that GSAA plays a significant role in advancing SSL-based solutions in RF sensing.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology plays a pivotal role in enabling real-time traffic coordination and safety, warning, and decision support. Within V2X, the Basic Safety Message (BSM) serves as the core to transmit critical vehicle status, location, and intention information to provide a foundation for ensuring reliable traffic safety and coordination mechanisms. Data accuracy stands as a key to the effectiveness and reliability of the V2X system, in which the transmission of error data can potentially result in severe traffic accidents. During vehicular operation, sensors may generate error data owing to looseness or external conditions. However, immediate sensor replacement is often impractical or infeasible. Therefore, this paper introduces a collaborative scheme involving vehicles, Road Side Units (RSUs), and Data Center (DC) to jointly enhance the accuracy of vehicle-transmitted BSMs. Our scheme involves analyzing statistical features of vehicle driving information to detect error BSMs. Subsequently, these detected errors are corrected by leveraging historical data from the vehicle and its relative relationship with surrounding vehicles. In addition, we propose a time optimization method to reduce the average processing time of each data by RSUs. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can accurately detect error BSMs and effectively correct error BSMs. The entire scheme also meets the requisite computational latency requirements.},

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown promise in optimizing resource allocation and task offloading problems. However, they often face challenges such as high computational complexity and the need for extensive training data. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) emerges as a promising solution to overcome these limitations by leveraging quantum computing principles to enhance efficiency and scalability.

  abstract     = {Executing 5G core network functions on satellites has become crucial to enhance satellite network management and service capabilities. The User Plane Function (UPF) is responsible for efficient data traffic forwarding and is envisioned as a key and pioneering core network function that will be deployed on satellites. However, managing and providing services with satellite UPFs face dual challenges. Limited satellite resources constrain the user scale that a satellite UPF can service, resulting in an unguaranteed service delay. Moreover, the extremely rapid mobility of satellites renders it difficult for satellite UPFs to provide seamless services. To address the above challenges, this paper presents the first-of-its-kind service optimization scheme for satellite UPFs in terms of switch control, state migration, and traffic routing. To provide guaranteed service delay, we provide a theoretical analysis based on the M/G/1 queue model, demonstrating the service delay-resource consumption trade-off. A satellite UPF switch control scheme is integrated into the service optimization process, which can decrease satellite UPF service delay while saving satellite resources by adjusting the switch control parameters. To provide seamless services, we propose a satellite UPF-oriented state-aware service migration and traffic routing (UPF service optimization) algorithm. A policy network-based reinforcement learning approach is employed to dynamically perceive the satellite network’s state as well as the satellite UPF switch state. Building upon the optimization of service delay through satellite UPF switch control, the processes of state-aware state migration and traffic routing are further employed to reduce delay, ensuring seamless service effectively. Experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms under different metrics. The service delay is reduced by an average of 23.2% compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving systems are fundamentally composed of sequential modular tasks, i.e., perception, prediction, and planning. For connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), cooperative perception offers a promising solution to surpass their perception limitations, such as occlusion, by sharing sensing data with each other through wireless communication. Existing works typically prioritize sharing data from potential object-containing areas to maximize object detection accuracy under constrained communication resources. However, such detection-oriented approaches ignore a crucial fact that more accurate detection does not equal safer planning. Sharing large amounts of sensing data for detection accuracy can lead to communication resource wastage and performance degradation of subsequent driving tasks. To address this, we introduce Plan2comm, a communication-efficient cooperative perception framework via planning-oriented feature sharing, which shares only sensing data around planned trajectories to enable safer planning rather than mere detection accuracy. Specifically, a planning-oriented communication mechanism is designed to select and transmit the most valuable features from the perspective of the planning task. Moreover, an uncertainty-aware spatial-temporal feature fusion strategy is proposed to enhance high-quality information aggregation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Plan2comm outperforms all other cooperative perception methods on motion prediction performance, and is more communication-efficient.},

Focusing on this problem, this research formulates a novel task offloading and resource allocation model with two offloading modes and on-demand virtual resource units (VRUs). This model is decomposed into two sub-problems to solve: a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem and a matching problem with externalities and dynamics. First, for a given terminal node (TN) and fog node (FN), this research theoretically derives the optimal offloading ratio and resource allocation strategy to minimize the payment of TNs for two offloading modes, i.e., immediate and queued offloading. Second, in the multi-TNs and multi-FNs scenario, the problem of making the task offloading decision is transformed into a many-to-one matching game by considering externalities and dynamics. Finally, a Deferred acceptance-based Loss ratio and Payment Minimized task Offloading and resource Allocation optimization (DLPMOA) algorithm is proposed to derive a stable and Pareto-optimal match. The simulation results show that the proposed DLPMOA has better performance in terms of task failure rate, task average payment, fog computing resource utilization, and fairness than the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, existing PIN authentication systems have several constraints regarding security, usability, and robustness. To go beyond their limitations, this paper presents TaPIN, a reliable system that authenticates smartphone users with the collaborative use of PINs and tap biometrics. A user is first instructed to enter her PIN by tapping a smartphone screen for authentication. During the PIN entry, the user&#39;s fingertip collides with the screen, producing user-specific vibration and sound signals. TaPIN then senses the tap-induced signals and the collision properties, e.g., pressures and sizes, using the smartphone&#39;s built-in sensors and leverages them as biometric features. That is, it authenticates the user by verifying not only the entered PIN but also the collected features. Our experiments with 20 real-world users demonstrate that this two-factor authentication system is easy to use, more secure than existing methods, and deployable without dedicated hardware. For example, it accurately authenticates users with an average EER of 1.9% in stationary environments and maintains a reasonable level of security regardless of devices, tap styles, and noise.},

The deterministic guarantee is penetrated into various types of networks, such as 5G, WiFi, satellite, and edge computing networks. From the user’s perspective, the real-time applications require end-to-end deterministic guarantee across the converged network. In this paper, we investigate the end-to-end deterministic guarantee problem across the whole converged network, aiming to provide a scalable method for different kinds of converged networks to meet the bounded end-to-end latency, jitter, and high reliability demands of each flow, while improving the network scheduling QoS. Particularly, we set up the global end-to-end control plane to abstract the deterministic-related resources from converged network, and model the deterministic flow transmission by using the abstracted resources. With the resource abstraction, our model can work well for different underlying technologies. Given large amounts of abstracted resources in our model, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to fully utilize the resources. Thus, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based end-to-end deterministic-related resource scheduling (E2eDRS) algorithm to schedule the network resources from end to end. By setting the action groups, the E2eDRS can support varying network dimensions both in horizontal and vertical end-to-end deterministic-related network architectures. Experimental results show that E2eDRS can averagely increase 1.33x and 6.01x schedulable flow number for horizontal scheduling compared with MultiDRS and MultiNaive algorithms, respectively. The E2eDRS can also optimize 2.65x and 3.87x server load balance than MultiDRS and MultiNaive algorithms, respectively. For vertical scheduling, the E2eDRS can still perform better on schedulable flow number and server load balance.},

To combat the data drift, mobile ends rely on edge servers to continuously evolve and re-compress the DNN with freshly collected data. We design a framework, ${\sf AdaEvo}$, that efficiently supports the resource-limited edge server handling mobile DNN evolution tasks from multiple mobile ends. The key goal of ${\sf AdaEvo}$ is to maximize the average quality of experience (QoE), i.e., the proportion of high-quality DNN service time to the entire life cycle, for all mobile ends. Specifically, it estimates the DNN accuracy drops at the mobile end without labels and performs a dedicated video frame sampling strategy to control the size of retraining data. In addition, it balances the limited computing and memory resources on the edge server and the competition between asynchronous tasks initiated by different mobile users. With an extensive evaluation of real-world videos from mobile scenarios and across four diverse mobile tasks, experimental results show that ${\sf AdaEvo}$ enables up to 34% accuracy improvement and 32% average QoE improvement.},

This paper introduces a Dual Transformer Fusion (DTF) algorithm, a novel approach to obtain a holistic 3D pose estimation, even in the presence of severe occlusions. Confronting the issue of occlusion-induced missing joint data, we propose a temporal interpolation-based occlusion guidance mechanism. To enable precise 3D Human Pose Estimation, our approach leverages the innovative DTF architecture, which first generates a pair of intermediate views. Each intermediate-view undergoes spatial refinement through a self-refinement schema. Subsequently, these intermediate-views are fused to yield the final 3D human pose estimation. The entire system is end-to-end trainable. Through extensive experiments conducted on the Human3.6 M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, our method&#39;s performance is rigorously evaluated.

With the strong assumption of data centralization, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) reduces vulnerability under OD scenario. Whereas, enlarged domain gap and growing privacy concern heavily challenge conventional UDA. Motivated by gap decomposition and data decentralization, we establish a decentralized domain adaptation (DDA) framework called Translate thEn Adapt (abbr. TEA) for privacy preservation. Our highlights lie in. (1) Regarding federated hallucination translation, a Disentanglement and Contrastive-learning based Generative Adversarial Network (abbr.

To yield domain hallucination, client minimizes cross-entropy of local classifier but maximizes entropy of global model to train translator.

Soft adversarial learning relaxes binary label to rectify inter-domain discrepancy and inner-domain divergence. Structure clustering and entropy minimization drive intra-class features closer and inter-class features apart.

  abstract     = {Networked 360$^\circ$ video has become increasingly popular. Despite the immersive experience for users, its sheer data volume, even with the latest H.266 coding and viewport adaptation, remains a significant challenge to today&#39;s networks. Recent studies have shown that integrating deep learning into video coding can significantly enhance compression efficiency, providing new opportunities for high-quality video streaming. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the potential and issues in applying neural codecs to 360$^\circ$ video streaming. We accordingly present $\mathsf {NETA}$, a synergistic streaming scheme that merges neural compression with traditional coding techniques, seamlessly implemented within an edge intelligence framework. To address the non-trivial challenges in the short viewport prediction window and time-varying viewing directions, we propose implicit-explicit buffer-based prefetching grounded in content visual saliency and bitrate adaptation with smart model switching around viewports. A novel Lyapunov-guided deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to maximize user experience and ensure long-term system stability. We further discuss the concerns towards practical development and deployment and have built a working prototype that verifies $\mathsf {NETA}$’s excellent performance. For instance, it achieves a 27% increment in viewing quality, a 90% reduction in rebuffering time, and a 64% decrease in quality variation on average, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {As densely-sampled Light Field (LF) images are beneficial to many applications, LF reconstruction becomes an important technology in related fields. Recently, neural rendering shows great potential in reconstruction tasks. However, volume rendering in existing methods needs to sample many points on the whole camera ray or epipolar line, which is time-consuming. In this paper, specifically for LF images with regular angular sampling, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Pre-Selected neural rendering framework for LF reconstruction. Instead of sampling on the whole epipolar line, we propose to sample on several specific positions, which are estimated using the color and inherent scene structure information explored in the regular angular sampled LF images. Sampling only a few points that closely match the target pixel, the feature of the target pixel is quickly rendered with high-quality. Finally, we fuse the features and decode them in the view dimension to obtain the final target view. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art LF reconstruction methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons across various tasks. Our method also surpasses the most existing methods in terms of speed. Moreover, without any retraining or fine-tuning, the performance of our method with no-per-scene optimization is even better than the methods with per-scene optimization.},

Based on researches on image imaging process and artists&#39; retouching processes, we propose three improvements to existing automatic retouching methods. Firstly, in the past retouching methods, all the imaging conditions in EXIF were ignored. According to this, we design a simple module to introduce these imaging conditions into a network called ECM (EXIF Condition Module). This module can improve the performance of several existing auto-retouching methods with only a small parameter cost. Additionally, artists&#39; operations also were ignored. By investigating artists&#39; operations in retouching, we propose a two-stage network that brightens images first and then enriches them in the chrominance plane to mimic artists. Finally, we find that there is a color imbalance in the existing retouching dataset, thus, hue palette loss is designed to resolve the imbalance and make the image more vibrant. Experimental results show that our method is effective on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset and PPR10 K dataset, and achieves SOTA performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Image-text retrieval has made remarkable achievements through the development of feature extraction networks and model architectures. However, almost all region feature-based methods face two serious problems when modeling modality interactions. First, region features are prone to feature entanglement in the feature extraction stage, making it difficult to accurately reason complex intra-model relations between visual objects. Second, region features lack rich contextual information, background, and object details, making it difficult to achieve precise inter-modal alignment with textual information. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Stream Relation Learning Network (DSRLN) to jointly solve these issues with two key components: a Geometry-sensitive Interactive Self-Attention (GISA) module and a Dual Information Fusion (DIF) module. Specifically, GISA extends the vanilla self-attention network from two aspects to better model the intrinsic relationships between different regions, thereby improving high-level visual-semantic reasoning ability. DIF uses grid features as an additional visual information source, and achieves deeper and complex fusion between the two types of features through a masked cross-attention module and an adaptive gate fusion module, which can capture comprehensive visual information to learn more precise inter-modal alignment. Besides, our method also learns a more comprehensive hierarchical correspondence between images and sentences through local and global alignment. Experimental results on two public datasets, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, fully demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our model.},

With the information loss in incomplete situations, the core of IMvC needs to consider effectively overcoming the challenge of missing views, that is, exploring the underlying correlations from available data and recovering the missing information. However, most existing IMvC methods overemphasize the recovery-first principle with integrating the existing data from different views while neglecting the influence of view consistency in IMvC task together with valuable within view information. In this paper, a novel Between/Within View Information Completing for Tensorial Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (BWIC-TIMC) has been proposed, in which between/within view information is jointly exploited for effectively completing the missing views. Specifically, the proposed method designs a dual tensor constraint module, which focuses on simultaneously exploring the view-specific correlations of incomplete views and enforcing the between view consistency across different views. With the dual tensor constraint, between/within view information can be effectively integrated for completing missing views for IMvC task. Furthermore, in order to balance different contributions of multiple views and alleviate the problem of feature degeneration, BWIC-TIMC implements an adaptive fusion graph learning strategy for consensus representation learning. Extensive comparative experiments with the-state-of-art baselines can demonstrate the effectiveness of BWIC-TIMC.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the problem of Online Action Detection (OAD), where the task is to detect ongoing actions from streaming videos without access to video frames in the future. Existing methods achieve good detection performance by capturing long-range temporal structures. However, a major challenge of this task is to detect actions at a specific time that arrive with insufficient observations. In this work, we utilize the additional future frames available at the training phase and propose a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework for OAD, where a teacher network looks at more frames from the future and the student network distills the knowledge from the teacher for detecting ongoing actions from the observation up to the current frames. Usually, the conventional KD regards a high-level teacher network (i.e., the network after the last training iteration) to guide the student network throughout all training iterations, which may result in poor distillation due to the large knowledge gap between the high-level teacher and the student network at early training iterations. To remedy this, we propose a novel progressive knowledge distillation from different levels of teachers (PKD-DLT) for OAD, where in addition to a high-level teacher, we also generate several low- and middle-level teachers, and progressively transfer the knowledge (in the order of low- to high-level) to the student network throughout training iterations, for effective distillation. Evaluated on two challenging datasets THUMOS14 and TVSeries, we validate that our PKD-DLT is an effective teacher-student learning paradigm, which can be a plug-in to improve the performance of the existing OAD models and achieve a state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a highly challenging task due to the complexity of underwater environment and the diversity of underwater image degradation. Due to the application of deep learning, current UIE methods have made significant progress. Most of the existing deep learning-based UIE methods follow a single-stage network which cannot effectively address the diverse degradations simultaneously. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by designing a two-stage deep learning framework and taking advantage of cascaded contrastive learning to guide the network training of each stage. The proposed method is called CCL-Net in short. Specifically, the proposed CCL-Net involves two cascaded stages, i.e., a color correction stage tailored to the color deviation issue and a haze removal stage tailored to improve the visibility and contrast of underwater images. To guarantee the underwater image can be progressively enhanced, we also apply contrastive loss as an additional constraint to guide the training of each stage. In the first stage, the raw underwater images are used as negative samples for building the first contrastive loss, ensuring the enhanced results of the first color correction stage are better than the original inputs. While in the second stage, the enhanced results rather than the raw underwater images of the first color correction stage are used as the negative samples for building the second contrastive loss, thus ensuring the final enhanced results of the second haze removal stage are better than the intermediate color corrected results. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CCL-Net can achieve superior performance compared to many state-of-the-art methods. In addition, a series of ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of each key component involved in the proposed CCL-Net.},

Specifically, within each cluster, the positions and quantities of cross-view anchors may not align, or even anchor absence in some clusters, leading to severe anchor misalignment and imbalance issues. These issues result in inaccurate graph fusion and a reduction in clustering performance. Besides, in practical applications, missing information caused by sensor malfunctions or data losses could further exacerbate anchor misalignment and imbalance. To overcome such challenges, a novel Incomplete Multi-view Clustering with Paired and Balanced Dynamic Anchor Learning (PBDAL) is proposed to ensure the alignment and fairness of anchors. Unlike existing unsupervised anchor learning, we first design a paired and balanced dynamic anchor learning scheme to supervise dynamic anchors to be aligned and fair in each cluster.

The key challenge in CC-ReID is to extract cloth-irrelated features, such as face, hairstyle, body shape, and gait. Current research mainly focuses on modeling body shape using multi-modal biological features (such as silhouettes and sketches). However, it does not fully leverage the personal description information hidden in the original RGB image. Considering that there are certain attribute descriptions that remain unchanged after the changing of cloth, we propose a Masked Attribute Description Embedding (MADE) method that unifies personal visual appearance and attribute description for CC-ReID. Specifically, handling variable cloth-sensitive information, such as color and type, is challenging for effective modeling. To address this, we mask the clothes type and color information (upper body type, upper body color, lower body type, and lower body color) in the personal attribute description extracted through an attribute detection model. The masked attribute description is then connected and embedded into Transformer blocks at various levels, fusing it with the low-level to high-level features of the image. This approach compels the model to discard cloth information. Experiments are conducted on several CC-ReID benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, Celeb-reID-light, and LaST. Results demonstrate that MADE effectively utilizes attribute description, enhancing cloth-changing person re-identification performance, and compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper provides a novel solution from semantic data augmentation, which facilitates offline training of trackers for better generalization. We utilize existing samples to obtain knowledge to augment another in terms of diversity and hardness. First, we propose that the similarity matching space in Siamese-like models has class-agnostic transferability. Based on this, we design the Latent Augmentation (LaAug) to transfer relevant variations and suppress irrelevant ones between training similarity embeddings of different classes. Thus the model can generalize across a more diverse semantic distribution. Then, we propose the Semantic Interaction Mix (SIMix), which interacts moments between different feature samples to contaminate structure and texture attributes and retain other semantic attributes. SIMix simulates the occlusion and complements the training distribution with hard cases. The mixed features with adversarial perturbations can empirically enable the model against external environmental disturbances. Experiments on six challenging benchmarks demonstrate that three representative tracking models, i.e., SiamBAN, TransT and OSTrack, can be consistently improved by incorporating the proposed methods without extra parameters and inference cost.},

However, the neglect of part-level relationships causes few-shot methods to struggle to distinguish between closely similar subcategories, which makes it difficult for them to solve the fine-grained image classification problem. To tackle this challenging task, this paper proposes a fine-grained few-shot image classification method that exploits both intra-part and inter-part relationships among different samples. To establish comprehensive relationships, we first extract multiple discriminative descriptors from the input image, representing its different parts. Then, we propose to define the metric spaces by interpolating intra-part relationships, which can help the model adaptively find clear boundaries for these confusing classes. Finally, since the unlabeled image has high similarities to all classes, we project these similarities into a high-dimension space according to the inter-part relationship and interpolate a parameterized classifier to discover the subtle differences among these similar classes. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various fine-grained datasets. Without any pre-train/fine-tuning process, our approach clearly outperforms previous few-shot learning methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {The reuse of 3D CAD models is crucial for industrial manufacturing because it shortens development cycles and reduces costs. Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based 3D model retrievals. There are many representations for 3D models, among which the multi-view representation has demonstrated a superior retrieval performance. However, directly applying these 3D model retrieval approaches to 3D CAD model retrievals may result in issues such as the loss of the engineering semantic and structural information. In this paper, we find that multiple views and B-rep can complement each other. Therefore, we propose the view graph neural network (VGNet), which effectively combines multiple views and B-rep to accomplish 3D CAD model retrieval. More specifically, based on the characteristics of the regular shape of 3D CAD models, and the richness of the attribute information in the B-rep attribute graph, we separately design two feature extraction networks for each modality. Moreover, to explore the latent relationships between the multiple views and B-rep attribute graphs, a multi-head attention enhancement module is designed. Furthermore, the multimodal fusion module is adopted to make the joint representation of the 3D CAD models more discriminative by using a correlation loss function. Experiments are carried out on a real manufacturing 3D CAD dataset and a public dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based local feature extraction algorithms have advanced considerably in terms of robustness. While excelling at enhancing feature robustness, some outstanding algorithms tend to neglect discriminability—a crucial aspect in vision tasks. With the increase of deep learning convolutional layers, we observe an amplification of semantic information within images, accompanied by a diminishing presence of spatial structural information. This imbalance primarily contributes to the subpar feature discriminability. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel network framework aimed at imbuing feature descriptors with robustness and discriminative power by reinforcing spatial structural information. Our approach incorporates a spatial structure enhancement module into the network architecture, spanning from shallow to deep layers, ensuring the retention of rich structural information in deeper layers, thereby enhancing discriminability. Finally, we evaluate our method, demonstrating superior performance in visual localization and feature-matching tasks.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a surge of interest in anomaly detection. However, existing unsupervised anomaly detectors, particularly those for the vision modality, face significant challenges due to redundant information and sparse latent space. In contrast, anomaly detectors demonstrate superior performance in the language modality due to the unimodal nature of the data. This paper tackles the aforementioned challenges for vision modality from a multimodal point of view. Specifically, we propose Cross-modal Guidance (CMG), comprising of Cross-modal Entropy Reduction (CMER) and Cross-modal Linear Embedding (CMLE), to address the issues of redundant information and sparse latent space, respectively. CMER involves masking portions of the raw image and computing the matching score with the corresponding text. Essentially, CMER eliminates irrelevant pixels to direct the detector&#39;s focus towards critical content. To learn a more compact latent space for the vision anomaly detection, CMLE learns a correlation structure matrix from the language modality. Then, the acquired matrix compels the distribution of images to resemble that of texts in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Particularly, compared to the baseline that only utilizes images, the performance of CMG has been improved by 16.81%. Ablation experiments further confirm the synergy among the proposed CMER and CMLE, as each component depends on the other to achieve optimal performance.},

This technique has gained widespread attention in recent years as a valuable tool for various fields, e.g., fraud prevention and cultural heritage protection. However, it still remains a challenging task in reality due to three reasons: (i) severe damage, (ii) complex high-dimensional features, and (iii) lack of supervision. To address these issues, we propose SherlockNet, an energy-oriented two-branch contrastive self-supervised learning framework for robust and fast freeform handwriting authentication. It consists of four stages: (i) pre-processing: converting manuscripts into energy distributions using a novel plug-and-play energy-oriented operator to eliminate the influence of noise; (ii) generalized pre-training: learning general representation through two-branch momentum-based adaptive contrastive learning with the energy distributions, which handles the high-dimensional features and spatial dependencies of handwriting; (iii) personalized fine-tuning: calibrating the learned knowledge using a small amount of labeled data from downstream tasks; and (iv) practical application: identifying individual handwriting from scrambled, missing, or forged data efficiently and conveniently. Considering the practicality, we construct EN-HA, a novel dataset that simulates data forgery and severe damage in real applications. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets including our EN-HA, and the results prove the robustness and efficiency of SherlockNet.},

For solving the relatively high computational cost for the existing approaches, works based on anchor have been presented recently. Even with acceptable clustering performance, these methods tend to map the original representation from multiple views into a fixed shared graph based on the original dataset. However, most studies ignore the discriminative property of the learned anchors, which ruin the representation capability of the built model. Moreover, the complementary information among anchors across views is neglected to be ensured by simply learning the shared anchor graph without considering the quality of view-specific anchors. In this paper, we propose discriminative anchor learning for multi-view clustering (DALMC) for handling the above issues. We learn discriminative view-specific feature representations according to the original dataset and build anchors from different views based on these representations, which increase the quality of the shared anchor graph. The discriminative feature learning and consensus anchor graph construction are integrated into a unified framework to improve each other for realizing the refinement. The optimal anchors from multiple views and the consensus anchor graph are learned with the orthogonal constraints. We give an iterative algorithm to deal with the formulated problem.

Through extensive and rigorous benchmarking, we demonstrate that simple architectural designs such as overlapping patch embedding and convolutional feed-forward networks can promote the robustness of ViTs. Moreover, since the de facto training of ViTs relies heavily on data augmentation, exactly which augmentation strategies make ViTs more robust is worth investigating. We survey the efficacy of previous methods and verify that adversarial noise training is powerful.

Despite exhibiting promising performance, the target views rendered by previous methods usually contain corrupted parts of the human body. Two primary challenges hinder high-quality human neural rendering. These challenges involve non-correspondences between 2D pixels and 3D SMPL vertices induced by self-occlusion of the human body and erroneous appearance predictions caused by occlusion between the source and target views. To solve these two challenges, we propose an advancing generalizable occlusion modeling method for the neural human radiance field, in which the hurdles from the self-occlusion of the human body and the occlusion between source and target views are explored and solved. Specifically, to alleviate the non-correspondence problem induced by self-occlusion, a geometry perception module is designed to obtain 3D geometric representations of SMPL vertices, enabling the prediction of accurate density values. Furthermore, a visibility aggregation module is designed to estimate the visibility maps with respect to different source views by utilizing the predicted density. Then, the complementary information among multiple source views is integrated with the support of the visibility maps in the visibility aggregation module, thus effectively addressing the occlusion between views. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and THUman datasets show that the proposed method achieves promising performance compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we for the first time leverage an event camera to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that could efficiently record high-speed sign language movements under low-illumination scenarios and capture human information while eliminating redundant background interference. To fully exploit the benefits of the event camera for CSLR, we propose a novel event-guided multi-modal CSLR framework, which could achieve significant performance under complex scenarios. Specifically, a time redundancy correction (TRCorr) module is proposed to rectify redundant information in the temporal sequences, directing the model to focus on distinctive features. A multi-modal cross-attention interaction (MCAI) module is proposed to facilitate information fusion between events and frame domains. Furthermore, we construct the first event-based CSLR dataset, named EvCSLR, which will be released as the first event-based CSLR benchmark.

  abstract     = {The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the foundational component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets, and it offers a favorable balance between model performance and efficiency, yielding higher-quality LFSR results with substantially lower demand for memory and computation. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.},

Furthermore, a multimodal cross-frame level set evolution method is proposed to iteratively refine the object boundaries considering both temporal consistency and cross-modal interactions. Extensive experiments are conducted on four publicly available RVOS datasets, including A2D Sentences, J-HMDB Sentences, Ref-DAVIS, and Ref-YoutubeVOS.

  abstract     = {Multimedia file fragment classification (MFFC) aims to identify file fragment types, e.g., image/video, audio, and text without system metadata. It is of vital importance in multimedia storage and communication. Existing MFFC methods typically treat fragments as 1D byte sequences and emphasize the relations between separate bytes (interbytes) for classification. However, the more informative relations inside bytes (intrabytes) are overlooked and seldom investigated. By looking inside bytes, the bit-level details of file fragments can be accessed, enabling a more accurate classification. Motivated by this, we first propose Byte2Image, a novel visual representation model that incorporates previously overlooked intrabyte information into file fragments and reinterprets these fragments as 2D grayscale images. This model involves a sliding byte window to reveal the intrabyte information and a rowwise stacking of intrabyte n-grams for embedding fragments into a 2D space. Thus, complex interbyte and intrabyte correlations can be mined simultaneously using powerful vision networks. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end dual-branch network ByteNet to enhance robust correlation mining and feature representation. ByteNet makes full use of the raw 1D byte sequence and the converted 2D image through a shallow byte branch feature extraction (BBFE) and a deep image branch feature extraction (IBFE) network. In particular, the BBFE, composed of a single fully-connected layer, adaptively recognizes the co-occurrence of several some specific bytes within the raw byte sequence, while the IBFE, built on a vision Transformer, effectively mines the complex interbyte and intrabyte correlations from the converted image. Experiments on the two representative benchmarks, including 14 cases, validate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on different cases by up to 12.2%.},

Thus, integrating active learning into object detection will raise pretty positive significance. In this paper, we propose a classification committee for the active deep object detection method by introducing a discrepancy mechanism of multiple classifiers for samples&#39; selection when training object detectors. The model contains a main detector and a classification committee. The main detector denotes the target object detector trained from a labeled pool composed of the selected informative images. The role of the classification committee is to select the most informative images according to their uncertainty values from the view of classification, which is expected to focus more on the discrepancy and representative of instances. Specifically, they compute the uncertainty for a specified instance within the image by measuring its discrepancy output by the committee pre-trained via the proposed Maximum Classifiers Discrepancy Group Loss (MCDGL). The most informative images are finally determined by selecting the ones with many high-uncertainty instances. Besides, to mitigate the impact of interference instances, we design a Focusing on Positive Instances Loss (FPIL) to provide the committee the ability to automatically focus on the representative instances as well as precisely encode their discrepancies for the same instance. Experiments are conducted on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets versus some popular object detectors.

  abstract     = {Recently, sentiment analysis research has made significant improvements in addressing sentiment and subjectivity within textual content. The advent of multimodal deep learning techniques has further broadened this scope, enabling the integration of diverse modalities such as voice and image features alongside text. However, despite these advancements, the analysis of the Korean language remains challenging due to its inherently agglutinative nature and linguistic ambiguity, primarily examined at the sentence level. To effectively address this challenge, we propose a novel Multimodal Sentimental Deep Learning Framework for Korean (MSDLF-K), which can examine not only Korean text but also its associated speech. Our framework, MSDLF-K, integrates spectrograms and waveforms from Korean voice data with embedding vectors derived from script sentences, creating a unified multimodal representation. This approach facilitates the identification of both shared and unique features within the latent space, thereby offering valuable insights into their respective impacts on sentiment analysis performance. To validate the efficacy of MSDLF-K, we conducted a set of experiments using the emotion speech synthesis dataset. Our findings demonstrate that MSDLF-K achieves a remarkable accuracy of 79.0% in valence and 81.7% in arousal for emotion classification, metrics previously unexplored in the literature. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals the significant influence of multimodal representations, encompassing both text and voice, on enhancing emotion analysis performance. In summary, our study not only presents a pioneering solution for sentiment analysis in the Korean language but also underscores the importance of incorporating multimodal approaches for more comprehensive and accurate sentiment analysis across diverse linguistic contexts.},

  abstract     = {Tensor-based multi-view clustering has recently received significant attention due to its exceptional ability to explore cross-view high-order correlations. However, most existing methods still encounter some limitations. (1) Most of them explore the correlations among different affinity matrices, making them unscalable to large-scale data. (2) Although some methods address it by introducing bipartite graphs, they may result in sub-optimal solutions caused by an unstable anchor selection process. (3) They generally ignore the negative impact of latent semantic-unrelated information in each view. To tackle these issues, we propose a new approach termed fast Disentangled Slim Tensor Learning (DSTL) for multi-view clustering. Instead of focusing on the multi-view graph structures, DSTL directly explores the high-order correlations among multi-view latent semantic representations based on matrix factorization. To alleviate the negative influence of feature redundancy, inspired by robust PCA, DSTL disentangles the latent low-dimensional representation into a semantic-unrelated part and a semantic-related part for each view. Subsequently, two slim tensors are constructed with tensor-based regularization. To further enhance the quality of feature disentanglement, the semantic-related representations are aligned across views through a consensus alignment indicator. Our proposed model is computationally efficient and can be solved effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of DSTL over state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the remarkably expressive power for depicting structural data, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been extensively adopted for skeleton-based action recognition in recent years. However, GCN is designed to operate on irregular graphs of skeletons, making it difficult to deal with other modalities represented on regular grids directly. Thus, although existing works have demonstrated the necessity of multi-modality fusion, few methods in the literature explore the fusion of skeleton and other modalities within a GCN architecture. In this paper, we present a novel GCN-based framework, termed GCN-based Multi-modality Fusion Network (GMFNet), to efficiently utilize complementary information in RGB and skeleton data. GMFNet is constructed by connecting a main stream with a GCN-based multi-modality fusion module (GMFM), whose goal is to gradually combine finer and coarse action-related information extracted from skeletons and RGB videos, respectively. Specifically, a cross-modality data mapping method is designed to transform an RGB video into a $\mathit{skeleton-like}$ (SL) sequence, which is then integrated with the skeleton sequence under a gradual fusion scheme in GMFM. The fusion results are fed into the following main stream to extract more discriminative features and produce the final prediction. In addition, a spatio-temporal joint attention mechanism is introduced for more accurate action recognition. Compared to the multi-stream approaches, GMFNet can be implemented within an end-to-end training pipeline and thereby reduces the training complexity. Experimental results show the proposed GMFNet achieves impressive performance on two large-scale data sets of NTU RGB+D 60 and 120.},

Most existing methods overlook the low information content and diversity of skeleton features, failing to exploit useful information in rare samples during meta-training. This leads to poor feature discriminability and recognition accuracy. To address both issues, we propose a novel Enriched Skeleton Representation and Multi-relational Metrics (ESR-MM) method for skeleton-based few-shot action recognition. First, a Frobenius Norm Diversity Loss is introduced to enrich skeleton representation by maximizing the Frobenius norm of the skeleton feature matrix. This mitigates over-smoothing and boosts information content and diversity. Leveraging these enriched features, we propose a multi-relational metrics strategy exploiting cross-sample task-specific information, intra-sample temporal order, and inter-sample distance. Specifically, Support-Adaptive Attention leverages task-specific cues between samples to generate attention-enhanced features. Then, the Bidirectional Temporal Coherent Mean Hausdorff Metric integrates Temporal Coherence Measure into the Bidirectional Mean Hausdorff Metric for class separation by accounting for temporal order. Finally, Prototype-discriminative Contrastive Loss exploits distances from class prototypes to query samples. ESR-MM demonstrates superior performance on two benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in the image field. In recent years, research has shown that video recognition models are also vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, most studies about adversarial attacks for video models have focused on perturbation-based methods, while patch-based black-box attacks have received less attention. Despite the excellent performance of perturbation-based attacks, these attacks are impractical for real-world implementation. Most existing patch-based black-box attacks require occluding larger areas and performing more queries to the target model. In this paper, we propose a hard-sample style guided patch attack with reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced motion patterns for video recognition (HSPA). Specifically, we utilize the style features of video hard samples and transfer their multi-dimensional style features to images to obtain a texture patch set. Then we use reinforcement learning to locate the patch coordinates and obtain a specific adversarial motion pattern of the patch to successfully perform an effective attack on a video recognition model in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Our experiments on three widely-used video action recognition models (C3D, LRCN, and TDN) and two mainstream datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to learn visual concepts (i.e., attributes and objects) from seen compositions and combine them to predict unseen compositions. Existing visual encoders in CZSL typically use traditional visual encoders (i.e., CNN and Transformer) or image encoders from Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to encode image features. However, traditional visual encoders need more multi-modal textual information, and image encoders of VLMs exhibit dependence on pre-training data, making them less effective when used independently for predicting unseen compositions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach based on the joint modeling of traditional visual encoders and VLMs visual encoders to enhance the prediction ability for uncommon and unseen compositions. Specifically, we design an adaptive fusion module that automatically adjusts the weighted parameters of similarity scores between traditional and VLMs methods during training, and these weighted parameters are inherited during the inference process. Given the significance of disentangling attributes and objects, we design a Multi-Attribute Object Module that, during the training phase, incorporates multiple pairs of attributes and objects as prior knowledge, leveraging this rich prior knowledge to facilitate the disentanglement of attributes and objects. Building upon this, we select the text encoder from VLMs to construct the Adaptive Fusion Network. We conduct extensive experiments on the Clothing16 K, UT-Zappos50 K, and C-GQA datasets, achieving excellent performance on the Clothing16 K and UT-Zappos50 K datasets.},

  abstract     = {View synthesis of aerial scenes has gained attention in the recent development of applications such as urban planning, navigation, and disaster assessment. This development is closely connected to the recent advancement of the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). However, when autonomousaerial vehicles(AAVs) encounter constraints such as limited perspectives or energy limitations, NeRF degrades with sparsely sampled views in complex aerial scenes. On this basis, we aim to solve this problem in a few-shot manner. In this paper, we propose Uncertainty Guided Perception NeRF (UPNeRF), an uncertainty-guided perceptual learning framework that focuses on applying and improving NeRF in few-shot aerial view synthesis (FSAVS). First, simply optimizing NeRF in complex aerial scenes with sparse input can lead to overfitting in training views, resulting in a collapsed model. To address this, we propose a progressive learning strategy that utilizes the uncertainty present in sparsely sampled views, enabling a gradual transition from easy to hard learning. Second, to take advantage of the inherent inductive bias in the data, we introduce an uncertainty-aware discriminator. This discriminator leverages convolutional capabilities to capture intricate patterns in the rendered patches associated with uncertainty. Third, direct optimization of NeRF lacks prior knowledge of the scene. This, coupled with a reduction in training views, can result in unrealistic rendering. To overcome this, we present a perceptual regularizer that incorporates prior knowledge through prompt tuning of a self-supervised pre-trained vision transformer. In addition, we adopt a sampled scene annealing strategy to enhance training stability. Finally, we conducted experiments with two public datasets, and the positive results indicate our method is effective.},

Unlike existing methods training via a similarity loss between fused and source images, we propose a dual-path learning framework comprising two networks: an image fuser and a mask predictor. The mask predictor is modeled as a self-supervised denoising network on imperfect fusion masks, trained with a masking-based unsupervised learning scheme. The image fuser, crafted with deep unrolling, leverages the output from the mask predictor to supervise its mask generation at each unrolled step. Moreover, we introduce a fusion consistency loss to ensure the alignment between the image fuser and the mask predictor.

With the proposal of TextZoom, which is the first dataset aiming at text super-resolution in real scenes, more and more scene text super-resolution models have been presented on the basis of it. Although these methods have achieved excellent performance, they do not consider how to make full and efficient use of semantic information. Out of this consideration, a Semantic-aware Trident Network (STNet) for Scene Text Image Super-Resolution is proposed. Specifically, pre-trained text recognition model ASTER (Attentional Scene Text Recognizer) is utilized to assist this process in two ways. Firstly, a novel basic block named Semantic-aware Trident Block (STB) is designed to build the STNet, which incorporates an added branch for semantic distillation to learn semantic information of pre-trained recognition model. Secondly, we expand our model in an adversarial training manner and propose new text perceptual loss based on ASTER to further enhance semantic information in SR images. Extensive experiments on TextZoom dataset show that compared with directly recognizing bicubic images, the proposed STNet boosts the recognition accuracy of ASTER, MORAN (Multi-Object Rectified Attention Network), and CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) by 17.4%, 18.2%, and 24.3%, respectively, which is higher than the performance of several existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR network models. Besides, experiments in real scenes (on ICDAR 2015 dataset) and in restricted scenarios (defense against adversarial attacks) validate that addition of semantic information enables the proposed method to achieve promising cross-dataset performance. Since the proposed method is trained on cropped images, when applied to real-world scenarios, locations of text in natural images are firstly localized through scene text detection methods, and then cropped text images are obtained based on detected text positions.},

  abstract     = {Domain Generalization (DG) endeavors to create machine learning models that excel in unseen scenarios by learning invariant features. In DG, the prevalent practice of constraining models to a fixed structure or uniform parameterization to encapsulate invariant features can inadvertently blend specific aspects. Such an approach struggles with nuanced differentiation of inter-domain variations and may exhibit bias towards certain domains, hindering the precise learning of domain-invariant features. Recognizing this, we introduce a novel method designed to supplement the model with domain-level and task-specific characteristics. This approach aims to guide the model in more effectively separating invariant features from specific characteristics, thereby boosting the generalization. Building on the emerging trend of visual prompts in the DG paradigm, our work introduces the novel Hierarchical Contrastive Visual Prompt (HCVP) methodology. This represents a significant advancement in the field, setting itself apart with a unique generative approach to prompts, alongside an explicit model structure and specialized loss functions. Differing from traditional visual prompts that are often shared across entire datasets, HCVP utilizes a hierarchical prompt generation network enhanced by prompt contrastive learning. These generative prompts are instance-dependent, catering to the unique characteristics inherent to different domains and tasks. Additionally, we devise a prompt modulation network that serves as a bridge, effectively incorporating the generated visual prompts into the vision transformer backbone. Experiments conducted on five DG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HCVP, outperforming both established DG algorithms and adaptation protocols.},

Conventional methods utilize cepstral coefficients for spectral shape description but overlook its variation details. Deep-learning approaches capture some dynamics but demand substantial training or fine-tuning resources. The Learning in the Model Space (LMS) framework precisely captures the dynamic information of temporal data by utilizing model fitting, even when computational resources and data are limited. However, applying LMS to audio faces challenges: 1) The high sampling rate of audio hinders efficient data fitting and capturing of dynamic information. 2) The Dynamic Information of Partial Spectral Shapes (DIPSS) may enhance classification, as only specific spectral shapes are relevant for AC. This paper extends an AC framework called Effective Dynamic Information Capture (EDIC) to tackle the above issues. EDIC constructs Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) sequences within different dimensional intervals as the fitted data, which not only reduces the number of sequence sampling points but can also describe the change of the spectral shape in different parts over time. EDIC enables us to implement a topology-based selection algorithm in the model space, selecting effective DIPSS for the current AC task. The performance on three tasks confirms the effectiveness of EDIC.},

  abstract     = {This paper targets a novel trade-off problem in generalizable prompt learning for vision-language models (VLM), i.e., improving the performance on unseen classes while maintaining the performance on seen classes. Comparing with existing generalizable methods that neglect the seen classes degradation, the setting of this problem is stricter and fits more closely with practical applications. To solve this problem, we start from the optimization perspective, and leverage the relationship between loss landscape geometry and model generalization ability. By analyzing the loss landscapes of the state-of-the-art method and vanilla Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) based method, we conclude that the trade-off performance correlates to both loss value and loss sharpness, while each of them is indispensable. However, we find the optimizing gradient of existing methods cannot maintain high relevance to both loss value and loss sharpness during optimization, which severely affects their trade-off performance. To this end, we propose a novel SAM-based method for prompt learning, denoted as Gradient Constrained Sharpness-aware Context Optimization (GCSCoOp), to dynamically constrain the optimizing gradient, thus achieving above two-fold optimization objective simultaneously. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of GCSCoOp in the trade-off problem.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view learning is a machine learning paradigm that utilizes multiple feature sets or data sources to improve learning performance and generalization. However, existing multi-view learning methods often do not capture and utilize information from different views very well, especially when the relationships between views are complex and of varying quality. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning framework for the multi-view classification task, called Gated Cross-Correlation Network (GCCNet), which addresses these challenges by integrating the three key operational levels in multi-view learning: representation, fusion, and decision. Specifically, GCCNet contains a novel component called the Multi-View Gated Information Distributor (MVGID) to enhance noise filtering and optimize the retention of critical information. In addition, GCCNet uses cross-correlation analysis to reveal dependencies and interactions between different views, as well as integrates an adaptive weighted joint decision strategy to mitigate the interference of low-quality views. Thus, GCCNet can not only comprehensively capture and utilize information from different views, but also facilitate information exchange and synergy between views, ultimately improving the overall performance of the model. Extensive experimental results on ten benchmark datasets show GCCNet&#39;s outperforms state-of-the-art methods on eight out of ten datasets, validating its effectiveness and superiority in multi-view learning.},

We propose a novel 9D state estimation network to estimate the 6-DoF pose and 3D size of each instance in the scene. It uses our devised multi-scale global attention and object-level local attention modules to obtain representative latent features to estimate the 9D state of each object in the current observation. We then integrate our network estimation into a Kalman filter to combine previous states with the current estimates and achieve multi-object 9D state tracking. Experiment results on two public datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both category-level multi-object state estimation and pose tracking tasks.

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation in complex scenes relies not only on object appearance but also on object location and the surrounding environment. Nonetheless, it is difficult to model long-range context in the format of pairwise point correlations due to the huge computational cost for large-scale point clouds. In this article, we propose using regions as the intermediate representation of point clouds instead of fine-grained points or voxels to reduce the computational burden. We introduce a novel Region-Enhanced Feature Learning Network (REFL-Net) that leverages region correlations to enhance point feature learning. We design a region-based feature enhancement (RFE) module, which consists of a Semantic-Spatial Region Extraction stage and a Region Dependency Modeling stage. In the first stage, the input points are grouped into a set of regions based on their semantic and spatial proximity. In the second stage, we explore inter-region semantic and spatial relationships by employing a self-attention block on region features and then fuse point features with the region features to obtain more discriminative representations. Our proposed RFE module is plug-and-play and can be integrated with common semantic segmentation backbones. We conduct extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets and evaluate our RFE module with different segmentation backbones. Our REFL-Net achieves 1.8% mIoU gain on ScanNetV2 and 1.7% mIoU gain on S3DIS with negligible computational cost compared with backbone models. Both quantitative and qualitative results show the powerful long-range context modeling ability and strong generalization ability of our REFL-Net.},

  abstract     = {Point clouds captured by scanning devices are often incomplete due to occlusion. To overcome this limitation, point cloud completion methods have been developed to predict the complete shape of an object based on its partial input. These methods can be broadly classified as supervised or unsupervised. However, both categories require a large number of 3D complete point clouds, which may be difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose Cross-PCC, an unsupervised point cloud completion method without requiring any 3D complete point clouds. We only utilize 2D images of the complete objects, which are easier to capture than 3D complete and clean point clouds. Specifically, to take advantage of the complementary information from 2D images, we use a single-view RGB image to extract 2D features and design a fusion module to fuse the 2D and 3D features extracted from the partial point cloud. To guide the shape of predicted point clouds, we project the predicted points of the object to the 2D plane and use the foreground pixels of its silhouette maps to constrain the position of the projected points. To reduce the outliers of the predicted point clouds, we propose a view calibrator to move the points projected to the background into the foreground by the single-view silhouette image. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first point cloud completion method that does not require any 3D supervision. The experimental results of our method are superior to those of the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin. Moreover, our method even achieves comparable performance to some supervised methods.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud is one of the most widely used digital representation formats for three-dimensional (3D) contents, the visual quality of which may suffer from noise and geometric shift distortions during the production procedure as well as compression and downsampling distortions during the transmission process. To tackle the challenge of point cloud quality assessment (PCQA), many PCQA methods have been proposed to evaluate the visual quality levels of point clouds by assessing the rendered static 2D projections. Although such projection-based PCQA methods achieve competitive performance with the assistance of mature image quality assessment (IQA) methods, they neglect that the 3D model is also perceived in a dynamic viewing manner, where the viewpoint is continually changed according to the feedback of the rendering device. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the point clouds from moving camera videos and explore the way of dealing with PCQA tasks via using video quality assessment (VQA) methods. First, we generate the captured videos by rotating the camera around the point clouds through several circular pathways. Then we extract both spatial and temporal quality-aware features from the selected key frames and the video clips through using trainable 2D-CNN and pre-trained 3D-CNN models respectively. Finally, the visual quality of point clouds is represented by the video quality values. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is effective for predicting the visual quality levels of the point clouds and even competitive with full-reference (FR) PCQA methods. The ablation studies further verify the rationality of the proposed framework and confirm the contributions made by the quality-aware features extracted via the dynamic viewing manner.},

Free road space detection for collision avoidance and path planning is a vital part of autonomous driving vehicles. Despite many researchers focusing on free road space detection, it remains an open and challenging problem for real-world applications. Many studies have attempted to fuse depth and LiDAR features with visual features to improve the overall performance of free road space detection. However, there is no guideline on how such features should be fused to complement the visual features. Additionally, most of the previously proposed methods are computationally expensive and not suitable for real-life applications. The main motivation of this study is to realize a lightweight model that addresses these problems without compromising performance. As the LiDAR and visual features exist in different spaces, the proposed method attempts to learn various transformation and fusion operations from LiDAR features to complement the visual features. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on prominent benchmark datasets. The results of the experiments reveal the superior performance of the proposed model while being lightweight. LRDNet ranks third overall (with a minor difference) and second among LiDAR-based methods on the KITTI road benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the proposed model is the least computationally expensive among state-of-the-art methods and can be considered an optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy.},

This task involves addressing two main challenges. The first is the domain gap between the labeled source data and the unlabeled target data, which leads to weak generalization performance. The second is the inconsistency between the source and target category spaces at each time step, which causes catastrophic forgetting during the testing stage. Previous methods focus solely on the alignment of similar samples from different domains, which overlooks the underlying causes of the domain gap/class distribution difference. To tackle the issue, we rethink this task from a causal perspective for the first time. We first build a structural causal graph to describe the CI-UDA problem. Based on the causal graph, we present Memory-Enhanced Confidence Calibration (MECC), which aims to improve confidence in the predicted results. In particular, we argue that the domain discrepancy caused by the different styles is prone to make the model produce less confident predictions and thus weakens the generalization and continual learning abilities. To this end, we first explore using the gram matrix to generate source-style target data, which is combined with the original data to jointly train the model and thereby reduce the domain-shift impact. Second, we utilize the model of the previous time step to select corresponding samples that are used to build a memory bank, which is instrumental in alleviating catastrophic forgetting.

In real-world training scenarios, the successful generalization performance of DNNs is severely challenged by noisy samples with incorrect labels. To combat noisy samples in image classification, numerous methods based on sample selection and semi-supervised learning (SSL) have been developed, where sample selection is used to provide the supervision signal for SSL, achieving great success in resisting noisy samples. Due to the necessary warm-up training on noisy datasets and the basic sample selection mechanism, DNNs are still confronted with the challenge of memorizing noisy samples. However, existing methods do not address the memorization of noisy samples by DNNs explicitly, which hinders the generalization performance of DNNs. To alleviate this issue, we present a new approach to combat noisy samples. First, we propose a memorized noise detection method to detect noisy samples that DNNs have already memorized during the training process. Next, we design a noise-excluded sample selection method and a noise-alleviated MixMatch to alleviate the memorization of DNNs to noisy samples. Finally, we integrate our approach with the established method DivideMix, proposing Modified-DivideMix.

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) seeks to identify and match individuals across visible and infrared ranges within intelligent monitoring environments. Most current approaches predominantly explore a two-stream network structure that extract global or rigidly split part features and introduce an extra modality for image compensation to guide networks reducing the huge differences between the two modalities. However, these methods are sensitive to misalignment caused by pose/viewpoint variations and additional noises produced by extra modality generating. Within the confines of this articles, we clearly consider addresses above issues and propose a Cross-modality Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) network to excavate the semantic consistent features in different modalities by utilizing human semantic information. Specifically, a Parsing-aligned Attention Module (PAM) is introduced to filter out the irrelevant noises with channel-wise attention and dynamically highlight the semantic-aware representations across modalities in different stages of the network. Then, a Semantic-guided Part Alignment Module (SPAM) is introduced, aimed at efficiently producing a collection of semantic-aligned fine-grained features. This is achieved by incorporating parsing loss and division loss constraints, ultimately enhancing the overall person representation. Finally, an Identity-aware Center Mining (ICM) loss is presented to reduce the distribution between modality centers within classes, thereby further alleviating intra-class modality discrepancies. Extensive experiments indicate that CSCL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets. Notably, the Rank-1/mAP accuracy on the SYSU-MM01 dataset can achieve 75.72%/72.08%.},

  abstract     = {The task of chest X-ray report generation, which aims to simulate the diagnosis process of doctors, has received widespread attention. Compared with the image caption task, chest X-ray report generation is more challenging since it needs to generate a longer and more accurate description of each diagnostic part in chest X-ray images. Most of existing works focus on how to extract better visual features or more accurate text expression based on existing reports. However, they ignore the interactions between visual and text modalities and are thus obviously not in line with human thinking. A small part of works explore the interactions of visual and text modalities, but data-driven learning of cross-modal information mapping can not break the semantic gap between different modalities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Knowledge-guided Cross-modal Alignment and Progressive fusion (KCAP), which takes the knowledge words from a created medical knowledge dictionary as the bridge to guide the cross-modal feature alignment and fusion, for accurate chest X-ray report generation. In particular, we create the medical knowledge dictionary by extracting medical phrases from the training set and then selecting some phrases with substantive meanings as knowledge words based on their frequency of occurrence. Based on the knowledge words from the medical knowledge dictionary, the visual and text modalities are interacted by a mapping layer for the enhancement of the features of two modalities, and then the alignment fusion module is introduced to mitigate the semantic gap between visual and text modalities. To retain the important details of the original information, we design a progressive fusion scheme to integrate the advantages of both salient fused and original features to generate better medical reports. The experimental results on IU-Xray and MIMIC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KCAP.},

  abstract     = {Deep multi-view subspace clustering aims to reveal a common subspace structure by exploiting rich multi-view information. Despite promising progress, current methods focus only on multi-view consistency and complementarity, often overlooking the adverse influence of entangled superfluous information in features. Moreover, most existing works lack scalability and are inefficient for large-scale scenarios. To this end, we innovatively propose a deep subspace clustering method via Multi-view Feature Decoupling (MvFD). First, MvFD incorporates well-designed multi-type auto-encoders with self-supervised learning, explicitly decoupling consistent, complementary, and superfluous features for every view. The disentangled and interpretable feature space can then better serve unified representation learning. By integrating these three types of information within a unified framework, we employ information theory to obtain a minimal and sufficient representation with high discriminability. Besides, we introduce a deep metric network to model self-expression correlation more efficiently, where network parameters remain unaffected by changes in sample numbers. Extensive experiments show that MvFD yields State-of-the-Art performance in various types of multi-view datasets.},

To address such a gap, we propose a progressive pseudo labeling (PPL) approach to detect objects across different datasets, over a unified label space. Specifically, we employ the widely used architecture of teacher-student model pair to jointly refine pseudo labels and train the unified object detector. The student model learns from both annotated labels and pseudo labels from the teacher model, which is updated by the exponential moving average (EMA) of the student. Three modules, i.e. Entropy-guided Adaptive Threshold (EAT), Global Classification Module (GCM) and Scene-Aware Fusion (SAF) strategy, are proposed to handle the noise of pseudo labels and fit the overall distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on different multi-dataset benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the State-of-the-Art and is even comparable with supervised methods trained using annotations of all labels.},

Multilayer perceptron (MLP) has a wide application in two-view correspondence learning for which is good at learning disordered sparse correspondences, but it is susceptible to the dominant outliers and requires additional functional blocks to capture context information. CNN can naturally extract local context information, but it cannot handle disordered data and extract global context and channel information. In order to overcome the shortcomings of MLP and CNN, we design a correspondence learning network based on Transformer, named Vector Rectifier Transformer (VRTNet). Transformer is an encoder-decoder structure which can handle disordered sparse correspondences and output sequences of arbitrary length. Therefore, we design two sub-Transformers in VRTNet to achieve the mutual conversion between disordered and ordered correspondences. The self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms in them allow VRTNet to focus on the global context relations of all correspondences. To capture local context and channel information, we propose rectifier network (including CNN and channel attention block) as the backbone of VRTNet, which avoids the complex design of additional blocks. Rectifier network can correct the errors of ordered correspondences to obtain rectified correspondences. Finally, outliers are removed by comparing original and rectified correspondences. VRTNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in the tasks of relative pose estimation, outlier removal and image registration.},

Therefore, DCM-Net, an object detection network dominated by diffusion model that incorporates the characteristics of copy-move forgery, is proposed in this paper for obviously enhancing CMFD performance. DCM-Net, as the first diffusion model-based CMFD network, has the following three improvements. Firstly, the high-similarity box padding strategy pads high-similarity boxes, rather than random boxes used in diffusion model, to ground truth boxes, better guiding subsequent dual-attention detection heads (DDHs) to focus more on high-similarity regions. Secondly, different from previous deep learning based CMFD networks that utilize self-correlation calculation to indiscriminately transform all classification features extracted from feature extraction into high-similarly features, an adaptive feature combination strategy is proposed to obtain the optimal feature transformation capable of achieving the best detection performance, enabling DDHs to more effectively distinguish source and target regions. Finally, to make detection heads have more accurate source/target localization and distinguishment, DDHs equipped with efficient multi-scale attention and contextual transformer, are proposed to generate tampered features fusing the entire precise spatial position information and rich contextual global information. The experimental results carried out on three publicly available datasets including USC-ISI, CoMoFoD, and COVERAGE, demonstrate that DCM-Net outperforms several advanced algorithms in terms of similarity detection ability and source/target differentiation ability.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic faces have been extensively researched and applied in various fields, such as face parsing and recognition. Compared to real face images, synthetic faces engender more controllable and consistent experimental stimuli due to the ability to precisely merge expression animations onto the facial skeleton. Accordingly, we establish an eye-tracking database with 780 synthetic face images and fixation data collected from 22 participants. The use of synthetic images with consistent expressions ensures reliable data support for exploring the database and determining the following findings: (1) A correlation study between saliency intensity and facial movement reveals that the variation of attention distribution within facial regions is mainly attributed to the movement of the mouth. (2) A categorized analysis of different demographic factors demonstrates that the bias towards salient regions aligns with differences in some demographic categories of synthetic characters. In practice, inference of facial saliency distribution is commonly used to predict the regions of interest for facial video-related applications. Therefore, we propose a benchmark model that accurately predicts saliency maps, closely matching the ground truth annotations. This achievement is made possible by utilizing channel alignment and progressive summation for feature fusion, along with the incorporation of Sinusoidal Position Encoding. The ablation experiment also demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model. We hope that this paper will contribute to advancing the photorealism of generative digital humans.},

In order to fully leverage the categorical information in static crowd images, we propose a two-tier salient feature propagation module designed to sequentially extract semantic information from both the crowd and its surrounding environment. Additionally, we introduce a category difference loss to refine the feature representation by highlighting the differences between various crowd categories. Moreover, our proposed framework can adapt to a novel problem setup called few-example fine-grained crowd counting. This setup, unlike the original fine-grained crowd counting, requires only a few exemplar point annotations instead of dense annotations from predefined categories, making it applicable in a wider range of scenarios. The baseline model for this task can be established by substituting the loss function in our proposed model with a novel hybrid loss function that integrates point-oriented cross-entropy loss and category contrastive loss. Through comprehensive experiments, we present results in both the formulation and application of fine-grained crowd counting.},

With large-scale vision-language pre-training, diffusion models are able to generate high-quality images with rich textures and reasonable structures under different text prompts. However, adapting pre-trained diffusion models for visual perception is an open problem. In this paper, we propose an implicit and explicit language guidance framework for diffusion-based visual perception, named IEDP. Our IEDP comprises an implicit language guidance branch and an explicit language guidance branch. The implicit branch employs a frozen CLIP image encoder to directly generate implicit text embeddings that are fed to the diffusion model without explicit text prompts. The explicit branch uses the ground-truth labels of corresponding images as text prompts to condition feature extraction in diffusion model. During training, we jointly train the diffusion model by sharing the model weights of these two branches. As a result, the implicit and explicit branches can jointly guide feature learning. During inference, we employ only implicit branch for final prediction, which does not require any ground-truth labels. Experiments are performed on two typical perception tasks, including semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Our IEDP achieves promising performance on both tasks. For semantic segmentation, our IEDP has the mIoU$^\text{ss}$ score of 55.9% on ADE20K validation set, which outperforms the baseline method VPD by 2.2%. For depth estimation, our IEDP outperforms the baseline method VPD with a relative gain of 11.0%.},

PADE comprises three main strategies: 1) parameter customization strategy for multi-experts skilled at different categories; 2) normalized target knowledge distillation for mutual guidance among experts while maintaining diversity; 3) re-balanced compactness learning with momentum prototypes, promoting instance alignment with the corresponding class centroid.

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples, similar to self-supervised learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.},

To remedy this issue, a novel Wavelet-based Hybrid Asymmetric Network (WHANet) is proposed to establish a RGB-to-HSI translation in wavelet domain, thus reserving and emphasizing the HF features in hyperspectral space. Basically, the backbone is designed in a hybrid asymmetric structure that learns the exact representations of decomposed wavelet coefficients in hyperspectral domain in a parallel way. Innovatively, a CNN-based HF reconstruction module (HFRM) and a transformer-based low frequency (LF) reconstruction module (LFRM) are delicately devised to perform the SSR process individually, which are able to process the discriminative wavelet coefficients contrapuntally. Furthermore, a hybrid loss function incorporated with the Fast Fourier loss (FFL) is proposed to directly regularize and emphasis the missing HF components. Eventually, experimental results over three benchmark datasets and one remote sensing dataset demonstrate that our WHANet is able to reach the state-of-the-art performance quantitatively and qualitatively.},

This advancement paves the way for notable performance in some egocentric tasks, Zero-Shot Egocentric Action Recognition (ZS-EAR), entailing VLMs zero-shot to recognize actions from first-person videos enriched in more realistic human-environment interactions. Typically, VLMs handle ZS-EAR as a global video-text matching task, which often leads to suboptimal alignment of vision and linguistic knowledge. We propose a refined approach for ZS-EAR using VLMs, emphasizing fine-grained concept-description alignment that capitalizes on the rich semantic and contextual details in egocentric videos. In this work, we introduce a straightforward yet remarkably potent VLM framework, aka GPT4Ego, designed to enhance the fine-grained alignment of concept and description between vision and language. Specifically, we first propose a new Ego-oriented Text Prompting (EgoTP$\spadesuit$) scheme, which effectively prompts action-related text-contextual semantics by evolving word-level class names to sentence-level contextual descriptions by ChatGPT with well-designed chain-of-thought textual prompts. Moreover, we design a new Ego-oriented Visual Parsing (EgoVP$\clubsuit$) strategy that learns action-related vision-contextual semantics by refining global-level images to part-level contextual concepts with the help of SAM. Extensive experiments demonstrate GPT4Ego significantly outperforms existing VLMs on three large-scale egocentric video benchmarks, i.e., EPIC-KITCHENS-100 (33.2%$\uparrow$$_{\bm {+9.4}}$), EGTEA (39.6%$\uparrow$$_{\bm {+5.5}}$), and CharadesEgo (31.5%$\uparrow$$_{\bm {+2.6}}$). In addition, benefiting from the novel mechanism of fine-grained concept and description alignment, GPT4Ego can sustainably evolve with the advancement of ever-growing pre-trained foundational models. We hope this work can encourage the egocentric community to build more investigation into pre-trained vision-language models.},

  abstract     = {Moving object segmentation is critical to interpret scene dynamics for robotic navigation systems in challenging environments. Neuromorphic vision sensors are tailored for motion perception due to their asynchronous nature, high temporal resolution, and reduced power consumption. However, their unconventional output requires novel perception paradigms to leverage their spatially sparse and temporally dense nature. In this work, we propose a novel event-based motion segmentation algorithm using a Graph Transformer Neural Network, dubbed GTNN. Our proposed algorithm processes event streams as 3D graphs by a series of nonlinear transformations to unveil local and global spatiotemporal correlations between events. Based on these correlations, events belonging to moving objects are segmented from the background without prior knowledge of the dynamic scene geometry. The algorithm is trained on publicly available datasets including MOD, EV-IMO, and EV-IMO2 using the proposed training scheme to facilitate efficient training on extensive datasets. Moreover, we introduce the Dynamic Object Mask-aware Event Labeling (DOMEL) approach for generating approximate ground-truth labels for event-based motion segmentation datasets. We use DOMEL to label our own recorded Event dataset for Motion Segmentation (EMS-DOMEL), which we release to the public for further research and benchmarking. Rigorous experiments are conducted on several unseen publicly-available datasets where the results revealed that GTNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the presence of dynamic background variations, motion patterns, and multiple dynamic objects with varying sizes and velocities. GTNN achieves significant performance gains with an average increase of 9.4% and 4.5% in terms of motion segmentation accuracy (IoU%) and detection rate (DR%), respectively.},

  abstract     = {Image inpainting aims to restore visually realistic contents from a corrupted image, while inpainting forensic methods focus on locating the inpainted regions to fight against inpainting manipulations. Motivated by these two mutually interdependent tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel image inpainting network called Adversarial Collaborative Network (AdvColabNet), which leverages the contradictory and collaborative information from the two tasks of image inpainting and inpainting forensics to enhance the progress of the inpainting model through adversarial collaborative training. Specifically, the proposed AdvColabNet is a coarse-to-fine two-stage framework. In the coarse training stage, a simple generative adversarial model-based U-Net-style network generates initial coarse inpainting results. In the fine stage, the authenticity of inpainting results is assessed using the estimated forensic mask. A forensics-driven adaptive weighting refinement strategy is developed to emphasize learning from pixels with higher probabilities of being inpainted, which helps the network to focus on the challenging regions, resulting in more plausible inpainting results. Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA-HQ and Places2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness performance in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MAE, FID, and LPIPS metrics. We also show that our method effectively deceives the proposed inpainting forensic method compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods, further demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification aims to retrieve images of specific identities across modalities. To relieve the large cross-modality discrepancy, researchers introduce the auxiliary modality within the image space to assist modality-invariant representation learning. However, the challenge persists in constraining the inherent quality of generated auxiliary images, further leading to a bottleneck in retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Auxiliary Representation Guided Network (ARGN) to explore the potential of auxiliary representations, which are directly generated within the modality-shared embedding space. In contrast to the original visible and infrared representations, which contain information solely from their respective modalities, these auxiliary representations integrate cross-modality information by fusing both modalities. In our framework, we utilize these auxiliary representations as modality guidance to reduce the cross-modality discrepancy. First, we propose a High-quality Auxiliary Representation Learning (HARL) framework to generate identity-consistent auxiliary representations. The primary objective of our HARL is to ensure that auxiliary representations capture diverse modality information from both modalities while concurrently preserving identity-related discrimination. Second, guided by these auxiliary representations, we design an Auxiliary Representation Guided Constraint (ARGC) to optimize the modality-shared embedding space. By incorporating this constraint, the modality-shared embedding space is optimized to achieve enhanced intra-identity compactness and inter-identity separability, further improving the retrieval performance. In addition, to improve the robustness of our framework against the modality variation, we introduce a Part-based Adaptive Gaussian Module (PAGM) to adaptively extract discriminative information across modalities. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches on three VI-ReID datasets.},

Although hash-based cross-modal retrieval methods have demonstrated considerable efficacy, the vulnerability of deep networks to adversarial examples represents a significant challenge for the hash retrieval. In the absence of target semantics, previous non-targeted attack methods attempt to attack depth models by adding disturbance to the input data, yielding some positive outcomes. Nevertheless, they still lack specific instance-level hash codes and fail to consider the diversity and semantic association of different modalities, which is insufficient to meet the attacker&#39;s expectations. In response, we present a novel Primary code Guided Targeted Attack (PGTA) against cross-modal hashing retrieval. Specifically, we integrate cross-modal instances and labels to obtain well-fused target semantics, thereby enhancing cross-modal interaction. Secondly, the primary code is designed to generate discriminable information with fine-grained semantics for target labels. Benign samples and target semantics collectively generate adversarial examples under the guidance of primary codes, thereby enhancing the efficacy of targeted attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PGTA outperforms the most advanced methods on three datasets, achieving State-of-the-Art targeted attack performance.},

First, we present a multi-perspective pseudo-label generation strategy that considers both global and local semantic perspectives. This strategy prioritizes pixels in all images by the global and local predictions, and subsequently generates pseudo-labels for different pixels in stages according to the ranking results. Our pseudo-label generation method shows superior suitability for semi-supervised semantic segmentation compared to other approaches. Second, we propose a confidence-weighted training method to alleviate performance degradation caused by unstable pixels. Our training method assigns confident weights to unstable pixels, which reduces the interference of unstable pixels during training and facilitates the efficient training of the model. Finally, we validate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, and the results indicate that we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on both datasets in all settings.},

  abstract     = {Due to the diversity of scene text in aspects such as font, color, shape, and size, accurately and efficiently detecting text is still a formidable challenge. Among the various detection approaches, segmentation-based approaches have emerged as prominent contenders owing to their flexible pixel-level predictions. However, these methods typically model text instances in a bottom-up manner, which is highly susceptible to noise. In addition, the prediction of pixels is isolated without introducing pixel-feature interaction, which also influences the detection performance. To alleviate these problems, we propose a multi-information level arbitrary-shaped text detector consisting of a focus entirety module (FEM) and a perceive environment module (PEM). The former extracts instance-level features and adopts a top-down scheme to model texts to reduce the influence of noises. Specifically, it assigns consistent entirety information to pixels within the same instance to improve their cohesion. In addition, it emphasizes the scale information, enabling the model to distinguish varying scale texts effectively. The latter extracts region-level information and encourages the model to focus on the distribution of positive samples in the vicinity of a pixel, which perceives environment information. It treats the kernel pixels as positive samples and helps the model differentiate text and kernel features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the FEM&#39;s ability to efficiently support the model in handling different scale texts and confirm the PEM can assist in perceiving pixels more accurately by focusing on pixel vicinities. Comparisons show the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four public datasets.},

However, these methods ignore feature discriminability and perform poorly in indoor scenes. Indoor scenes have too many weak-textured and even repeatedly textured regions, so it is necessary for the extracted features to possess sufficient discriminability. Therefore, we propose a semantic-guided method (called SDE2D) enhancing feature discriminability to improve the performance of descriptors for indoor scenes. We develop a kind of semantic-guided discriminability enhancement (SDE) loss function that uses semantic information from indoor scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep research that applies semantic segmentation to enhance discriminability. In addition, we design a novel framework that allows semantic segmentation network to be well embedded as a module in the overall framework and provides guidance information for training. Besides, we explore the impact of different semantic segmentation models on our method. The experimental results on indoor scenes datasets demonstrate that the proposed SDE2D performs well compared with the state-of-the-art models.},

This paper proposes a Progressive Region-to-Boundary Exploration Network (PRBE-Net) to accurately detect camouflaged objects. PRBE-Net follows an encoder-decoder framework and includes three key modules. Specifically, firstly, both high-level and low-level features of the encoder are integrated by a region and boundary exploration module to explore their complementary information for extracting the object&#39;s coarse region and fine boundary cues simultaneously. Secondly, taking the region cues as the guidance information, a Region Enhancement (RE) module is used to adaptively localize and enhance the region information at each layer of the encoder. Subsequently, considering that camouflaged objects usually have blurry boundaries, a Boundary Refinement (BR) decoder is used after the RE module to better detect the boundary areas with the assistance of boundary cues. Through top-down deep supervision, PRBE-Net can progressively refine the prediction. Extensive experiments on four datasets indicate that our PRBE-Net achieves superior results over 21 state-of-the-art COD methods.

  abstract     = {Video instance segmentation (VIS) is a challenging vision problem in which the task is to simultaneously detect, segment, and track all the object instances in a video. Most existing VIS approaches rely on pixel-level mask supervision within a frame as well as instance-level identity annotation across frames. However, obtaining these ‘mask and identity’ annotations is time-consuming and expensive. We propose the first mask-identity-free VIS framework that neither utilizes mask annotations nor requires identity supervision. Accordingly, we introduce a query contrast and exchange network (QCEN) comprising instance query contrast and query-exchanged mask learning. The instance query contrast first performs cross-frame instance matching and then conducts query feature contrastive learning. The query-exchanged mask learning exploits both intra-video and inter-video query exchange properties: exchanging queries of an identical instance from different frames within a video results in consistent instance masks, whereas exchanging queries across videos results in all-zero background masks. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, and OVIS) reveal the merits of the proposed approach, which significantly reduces the performance gap between the identify-free baseline and our mask-identify-free VIS method. On the YouTube-VIS 2019 validation set, our mask-identity-free approach achieves 91.4% of the stronger-supervision-based baseline performance when utilizing the same ImageNet pre-trained model.},

  abstract     = {Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to extract the sounding object from a video frame, which is represented by a pixel-wise segmentation mask for application scenarios such as multi-modal video editing, augmented reality, and intelligent robot systems. The pioneering work conducts this task through dense feature-level audio-visual interaction, which ignores the dimension gap between different modalities. More specifically, the audio clip could only provide a Global semantic label in each sequence, but the video frame covers multiple semantic objects across different Local regions, which leads to mislocalization of the representationally similar but semantically different object. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Network (C3N) to align the audio-visual semantics from the global dimension and progressively inject them into the local regions via an attention mechanism. Firstly, a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus Inference Module (C3IM) is developed to extract a unified-modal label by integrating audio/visual classification confidence and similarities of modality-agnostic label embeddings. Then, we feed the unified-modal label back to the visual backbone as the explicit semantic-level guidance via a Cognitive Consensus guided Attention Module (CCAM), which highlights the local features corresponding to the interested object. Extensive experiments on the Single Sound Source Segmentation (S4) setting and Multiple Sound Source Segmentation (MS3) setting of the AVSBench dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

However, existing methods typically adopt features directly extracted from the backbone or utilize a single structure (e.g., transformer) to explore the relations, leading to inefficient and incomplete relation mining. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a comprehensive relationship framework called Vision Transformer with Relation Exploration (ViT-RE) for pedestrian attribute recognition, which includes two novel modules, namely Attribute and Contextual Feature Projection (ACFP) and Relation Exploration Module (REM). In ACFP, attribute-specific features and contextual-aware features are learned individually to capture discriminative information tailored for attributes and image regions, respectively. Then, REM employs Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) Blocks and Transformer Blocks to concurrently explore attribute, contextual, and attribute-contextual relations. To enable fine-grained relation mining, a Dynamic Adjacency Module (DAM) is further proposed to construct instance-wise adjacency matrix for the GCN Block. Equipped with comprehensive relation information, ViT-RE achieves promising performance on three popular benchmarks, including PETA, RAP, and PA-100 K datasets. Moreover, ViT-RE achieves the first place in the WACV 2023 UPAR Challenge.},

  abstract     = {Rotation invariant point cloud analysis is essential for many real-world applications where objects can appear in arbitrary orientations. Traditional local rotation-invariant methods rely on lossy region descriptors, limiting the global comprehension of 3D objects. Conversely, global features derived from pose alignment can capture complementary information. To leverage both local and global consistency for enhanced accuracy, we propose the Global-Local-Consistent Hypergraph Cross-Attention Network (GLC-HCAN). This framework includes the Global Consistent Feature (GCF) representation branch, the Local Consistent Feature (LCF) representation branch, and the Hypergraph Cross-Attention (HyperCA) network to model complex correlations through the global-local-consistent hypergraph representation learning. Specifically, the GCF branch employs a multi-pose grouping and aggregation strategy based on PCA for improved global comprehension. Simultaneously, the LCF branch uses local farthest reference point features to enhance local region descriptions. To capture high-order and complex global-local correlations, we construct hypergraphs that integrate both features, mutually enhancing and fusing the representations. The inductive HyperCA module leverages attention techniques to better utilize these high-order relations for comprehensive understanding. Consequently, GLC-HCAN offers an effective and robust rotation-invariant point cloud analysis network, suitable for object classification and shape retrieval tasks in SO(3). Experimental results on both synthetic and scanned point cloud datasets demonstrate that GLC-HCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

However, most learning-based image enhancement methods just learn a mapping from one distribution to another based on one dataset, lacking the ability to adjust images continuously and controllably. It is important to enable the learning-based enhancement models to adjust an image continuously, since in many cases we may want to get a slighter or stronger enhancement effect rather than one fixed adjusted result. In this paper, we propose a quality-guided image enhancement paradigm that enables image enhancement models to learn the distribution of images with various quality ratings. By learning this distribution, image enhancement models can associate image features with their corresponding perceptual qualities, which can be used to adjust images continuously according to different quality scores. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, a subjective quality assessment experiment is first conducted, focusing on skin tone adjustment in portrait photography. Guided by the subjective quality ratings obtained from this experiment, our method can adjust the skin tone corresponding to different quality requirements. Furthermore, an experiment conducted on 10 natural raw images corroborates the effectiveness of our model in situations with fewer subjects and fewer shots, and also demonstrates its general applicability to natural images.},

  abstract     = {Person search is a challenging task in computer vision and multimedia understanding, which aims at localizing and identifying target individuals in realistic scenes. State-of-the-art models achieve remarkable success but suffer from overloaded computation and inefficient inference, making them impractical in most real-world applications. A promising approach to tackle this dilemma is to compress person search models with knowledge distillation (KD). Previous KD-based person search methods typically distill the knowledge from the re-identification (re-id) branch, completely overlooking the useful knowledge from the detection branch. In addition, we elucidate that the imbalance between person and background regions in feature maps has a negative impact on the distillation process. To this end, we propose a novel KD-based approach, namely Disaggregation Distillation for Person Search (DDPS), which disaggregates the distillation process and feature maps, respectively. Firstly, the distillation process is disaggregated into two task-oriented sub-processes, i.e., detection distillation and re-id distillation, to help the student learn both accurate localization capability and discriminative person embeddings. Secondly, we disaggregate each feature map into person and background regions, and distill these two regions independently to alleviate the imbalance problem. More concretely, three types of distillation modules, i.e., logit distillation (LD), correlation distillation (CD), and disaggregation feature distillation (DFD), are particularly designed to transfer comprehensive information from the teacher to the student. Note that such a simple yet effective distillation scheme can be readily applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher-student combinations. We conduct extensive experiments on two person search benchmarks, where the results demonstrate that, surprisingly, our DDPS enables the student model to surpass the performance of the corresponding teacher model, even achieving comparable results with general person search models.},

  abstract     = {Oriented object detection typically adds an additional rotation angle to the regressed horizontal bounding box (HBB) for representing the oriented bounding box (OBB). However, existing oriented object detectors based on regression angles face inconsistency between metric and loss, boundary discontinuity or square-like problems. To solve the above problems, we propose an anchor-free oriented object detector named PRA-Det, which assigns the center region of the object to regress OBBs represented by the polar radius vectors. Specifically, the proposed PRA-Det introduces a diamond-shaped positive region of category-wise attention factor to assign positive sample points to regress polar radius vectors. PRA-Det regresses the polar radius vector of the edges from the assigned sample points as the regression target and suppresses the predicted low-quality polar radius vectors through the category-wise attention factor. The OBBs defined for different protocols are uniformly encoded by the polar radius encoding module into regression targets represented by polar radius vectors. Therefore, the regression target represented by the polar radius vector does not have angle parameters during training, thus solving the angle-sensitive boundary discontinuity and square-like problems. To optimize the predicted polar radius vector, we design a spatial geometry loss to improve the detection accuracy. Furthermore, in the inference stage, the center offset score of the polar radius vector is combined with the classification score as the confidence to alleviate the inconsistency between classification and regression. The extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the PRA-Det is highly competitive with state-of-the-art oriented object detectors and outperforms other comparison methods.},

This oversight poses a significant obstacle, impeding the model&#39;s ability to derive pertinent strategy information and, consequently, hindering its capacity to generate emotionally supportive responses. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel dynamic strategy prompt reasoning model (DSR), which leverages sparse context relation deduction to acquire adaptive representation of reply strategies as prompts for guiding the response generation process. Specifically, we first perform turn-level commonsense reasoning with different approaches to extract auxiliary knowledge, which enhances the comprehension of user intention. Then we design a context relation deduction module to dynamically integrate interdependent dialogue information, capturing granular user intentions and generating effective strategy prompts. Finally, we utilize the strategy prompts to guide the generation of more relevant and supportive responses. DSR model is validated through extensive experiments conducted on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating its superior performance compared to the latest competitive methods in the field.},

In fact, the semantic information of snippets is crucial for detecting complete actions, meaning that snippets with similar representations should be considered as the same action category. To address this issue, we propose a novel representation refinement framework with a semantic query mechanism to enhance the discriminability of snippet-level features. Concretely, we set a group of learnable queries, each representing a specific action category, and dynamically update them based on the video context. With the assistance of these queries, we expect to search for the optimal action sequence that agrees with their semantics. Besides, we leverage some reliable proposals as pseudo labels and design a refinement and completeness module to refine temporal boundaries further, so that the completeness of action instances is captured. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet13 benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable performance in skeleton-based action recognition by exploiting the adjacency topology of body representation. However, the adaptive strategy adopted by the previous methods to construct the adjacency matrix is not balanced between the performance and the computational cost. We assume this concept of Adaptive Trap, which can be replaced by multiple autonomous submodules, thereby simultaneously enhancing the dynamic joint representation and effectively reducing network resources. To effectuate the substitution of the adaptive model, we unveil two distinct strategies, both yielding comparable effects. (1) Optimization. Individuality and Commonality GCNs (IC-GCNs) is proposed to specifically optimize the construction method of the associativity adjacency matrix for adaptive processing. The uniqueness and co-occurrence between different joint points and frames in the skeleton topology are effectively captured through methodologies like preferential fusion of physical information, extreme compression of multi-dimensional channels, and simplification of self-attention mechanism. (2) Replacement. Auto-Learning GCNs (AL-GCNs) is proposed to boldly remove popular adaptive modules and cleverly utilize human key points as motion compensation to provide dynamic correlation support. AL-GCNs construct a fully learnable group adjacency matrix in both spatial and temporal dimensions, resulting in an elegant and efficient GCN-based model. In addition, three effective tricks for skeleton-based action recognition (Skip-Block, Bayesian Weight Selection Algorithm, and Simplified Dimensional Attention) are exposed and analyzed in this paper. Finally, we employ the variable channel and grouping method to explore the hardware resource bound of the two proposed models. IC-GCN and AL-GCN exhibit impressive performance across NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA, and UAV-Human datasets, with an exceptional parameter-cost ratio.},

To tackle this problem, we present a content-aware tunable selective encryption (CATSE) scheme for HEVC. First, a deep hashing network is adopted to retrieve groups of pictures (GOPs) containing sensitive objects. Then, the retrieved sensitive GOPs and the remaining insensitive ones are encrypted with different encryption strengths. For the former, multiple syntax elements are encrypted to ensure security, whereas for the latter, only a few bypass-coded syntax elements are encrypted to improve the encryption efficiency and reduce the bit rate overhead. The keystream sequence used is extracted from the time series of a new improved logistic map with complex dynamic behavior, which is generated by our proposed sine-modular chaotification model. Finally, a reversible steganography is applied to embed the flag bits of the GOP type into the encrypted bitstream, so that the decoder can distinguish the encrypted syntax elements that need to be decrypted in different GOPs. Experimental results indicate that the proposed HEVC CATSE scheme not only provides high encryption speed and low bit rate overhead, but also has superior encryption strength than other state-of-the-art HEVC selective encryption algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Explanatory Visual Question Answering (EVQA) is a recently proposed multimodal reasoning task consisting of answering the visual question and generating multimodal explanations for the reasoning processes. Unlike traditional Visual Question Answering (VQA) task that only aims at predicting answers for visual questions, EVQA also aims to generate user-friendly explanations to improve the explainability and credibility of reasoning models. To date, existing methods for VQA and EVQA ignore the prompt in the question and enforce the model to predict the probabilities of all answers. Moreover, existing EVQA methods ignore the complex relationships among question words, visual regions, and explanation tokens. Therefore, in this work, we propose a Logic Integrated Neural Inference Network (LININ) to restrict the range of candidate answers based on first-order-logic (FOL) and capture cross-modal relationships to generate rational explanations. Firstly, we design a FOL-based question analysis program to fetch a small number of candidate answers. Secondly, we utilize a multimodal transformer encoder to extract visual and question features, and conduct the prediction on candidate answers. Finally, we design a multimodal explanation transformer to construct cross-modal relationships and generate rational explanations. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of LININ compared with the state-of-the-art methods for EVQA.},

Traditional bronchoscopy faces challenges such as limited dexterity, operator fatigue, and difficulty in maintaining steady manipulation. Existing robot-assisted methods have deficiencies, such as tool instability due to the dynamic respiratory environment. This paper presents a teleoperated robotic bronchoscopy system, featuring a controllable variable-stiffness catheter that enhances stability and flexibility during transbronchial biopsies. The 7 DoF robotic system allows for translation, rotation, and bending of the bronchoscope; delivery and bending of the catheter; delivery and control of biopsy tools; as well as stiffness adjustment of the catheter, which adapts to the dynamic pulmonary environment to provide stable support during tissue sampling. Key contributions include the robotic platform integrated with the variable-stiffness catheter and the implementation of a novel three-stage procedure for tissue sampling. The robotic system has been thoroughly evaluated through a series of tests, including the system accuracy, characterization of the variable-stiffness catheter’s flexibility, force exertion, safety during operation, temperature control, and in-vivo experiment. The results demonstrated the system’s feasibility and effectiveness, with metrics such as safe force limits, system flexibility, and positioning accuracy, showing its potential to improve the accuracy and safety of traditional bronchoscopy procedures.},

  abstract     = {Laryngectomy, a surgical intervention for laryngeal cancer, effectively treats the condition but results in the loss of natural speech. Voice restoration post-laryngectomy typically involves manual control, limiting patients’ ability to multitask while speaking. Surface electromyography (sEMG) offers a hands-free alternative for controlling artificial voice systems. However, challenges arise from daily, orofacial activities like chewing or coughing, activating the same muscles used for sEMG control, potentially causing false triggers. To address this, we perform a detailed analysis of facial and neck muscles during speech and non-speech activities to identify potential false triggers for sEMG-controlled artificial voice systems. We propose a five-step algorithm to prepare noisy sEMG data for analysis and to detect accurate speech onset and termination times within the muscle activity. A two-stage classification approach is suggested to effectively distinguish speech from non-speech activities. The classifier in the first stage detects the presence of any activity versus non-activity with an F1-score of 95.8%, while the classifier in the second stage recognizes speech among other activities with an F1-score of 96.3%. This research marks a significant advancement in differentiating speech from other daily activities, thereby minimizing false triggers in sEMG-controlled artificial voice systems.},

  abstract     = {Prior models of continuously flexible robots typically assume uniform stiffness, and in this paper we relax this assumption. Geometrically varying stiffness profiles provide additional design freedom to influence the motions and workspaces of continuum robots. These results are timely, because with recent rapid advancements in multimaterial additive manufacturing techniques, it is now straightforward to create more complex stiffness profiles in robots. The key insight of this paper is to project forces and moments applied to the robot onto its center of stiffness (i.e., the Young’s modulus-weighted center of each cross section). We show how the center of stiffness can be thought of as analogous to a “precurved backbone” in a robot with uniform stiffness. This analogy enables a large body of prior work in Cosserat Rod modeling of such robots to be applied directly to those with stiffness variations. We experimentally validate this approach using multimaterial, soft, tendon-actuated robots. Lastly, to illustrate how these results can be used in practice, we investigate how stiffness variation can improve performance in a neurosurgical task.},

  abstract     = {Multiple pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) connected through antagonistic joints are more in line with the motion characteristics of human muscles, which better imitate/replace humans to complete a series of actual tasks, such as transportation and assembly. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive solutions to handle hysteresis, creep, input delay, and other inherent characteristics of PAMs, as well as synchronous control and obstacle avoidance that are important to multiple muscles working together. To this end, this paper proposes a new neuroadaptive synchronization controller for 3-D antagonistic PAM-actuated robot hands, which also elaborately designs auxiliary terms to realize obstacle avoidance in Cartesian space and motion constraints in joint space together. Here, dynamic obstacles are regarded as external independent objects, whose nonlinear dynamics are introduced into the proposed controller to restrict end-effectors. Meanwhile, the constraint terms of joint angles and angle velocities are designed as time-varying proportional-differential gains, instead of common barrier functions that may induce overlarge inputs. Particularly, this paper proposes an accelerated gradient-based learning term to relax the linear parameterization condition of uncertain/unmodeled dynamics and obtain accurate weight estimates, based on which, it is proven that both tracking errors and synchronous errors rapidly converge to zero. In addition to complete theoretical analysis, some hardware experiments also verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Myoelectric control models enabling accurate hand gesture recognition via electromyography (EMG) have attracted increasing attentions in rehabilitation robotics. Adapting pre-trained models to new users is a main challenge in real world applications due to the inter-user different EMG characteristics. Most previous transfer learning approaches employed a rigid model calibration process, usually in a supervised manner with ground truth labels, or in an unsupervised manner but still requiring users to perform pre-defined hand gestures to update model parameters. We argue that such a rigid model calibration process lacks flexibility and limit the translation of myoelectric control into real world practice. In this work, we gradually “flexibilize” the standard model calibration process toward a highly flexible version, which does not require the labels of calibration data, and can be performed on only a subset of pre-defined hand gestures or even unknown user-defined hand gestures. We identify those key components contributing to the performance difference along the way. Compared with the supervised method, the unsupervised model calibration even contributed to a 10% improvement ( ${p}\lt 0.05$ ) in case where only a subset of gesture categories were available for model calibration. Moreover, the unsupervised model calibration achieved a highest recognition accuracy of 86.57% using unknown user-defined gestures, with no significant difference compared to the accuracy with pre-defined gestures ( ${p}\gt 0.05$ ).},

Structurally, the design incorporates a multi-link coupling mechanism driven by a single motor equipped with a series elastic actuator (SEA). The SEA enables bidirectional compliant drive and fore feedback without the need for a force sensor. The connecting rod is optimized to facilitate the natural flexion and extension of the fingers. For control, an admittance control strategy based on real-time fusion of electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is proposed. EMG signals are used to estimate muscle strength and control the movement of the exoskeleton. EEG signals reflect the active intention of the subjects, and admittance control adjusts the rehabilitation strategy in real-time. For the first time, the degree of concentration is used as a parameter for subject adjustment of rehabilitation training. Finally, experiments on stiffness calibration, muscle force estimation, and admittance control based on EEG-EMG fusion were conducted. The results indicate that the normalized root-mean-square-error (NRMSE) of stiffness calibration is 8.32%. The average inconsistence of concentration and joint torque (ICJT) is 73.18%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the subjective participation of the subjects in the rehabilitation process, thereby improving the overall rehabilitation outcomes.},

This study proposed a novel muscle synergy-based musculoskeletal model (MM) for prediction of hand and wrist movements, including wrist flexion/extension, wrist adduction/abduction, wrist pronation/supination, and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) flexion/extension. Ten limb-intact subjects were recruited for the offline experiment, and 15-channel EMG signals from the subject’s forearm were recorded. Using the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm, four pairs of excitation signals were extracted from the multi-channel EMG signals. Then the MM driven by the extracted muscle excitations was adopted to predict hand and wrist movements. The proposed method was compared with the NMF algorithm and artificial neural network (ANN), and the prediction performance of the three was evaluated with Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The total average r of the proposed MM was 0.8475 across all subjects and all movement types, approximately 0.123 higher than NMF algorithm and 0.106 higher than ANN. In addition, the total average NRMSE of the proposed MM was 0.16125 across all subjects and all movement types, approximately 0.074 lower than NMF algorithm and 0.037 lower than ANN. In brief, the proposed MM showed significantly improved prediction accuracy over the NMF algorithm and ANN.

The primary challenge in KMG technology lies in the required number and placement of magnetic sensors to balance accuracy, sustainability, and cost-efficiency for practical hand gesture interpretation. To tackle this issue, we propose a Stochastic Sequential Strategy for Magnetic Sensory Selection (S3MSS). We apply this strategy to a configuration of 16 magnetic sensors surrounding surgically implanted magnets in a patient’s forearm. The method uses an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) framework with Multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis (MCLDA) and Multiclass Support Vector Machines (MCSVM). Our approach emphasizes robust sensory selection and consistent performance through time-based seeding and K-fold cross-validation. Clinical results indicate consistency in sensory selection across two independent trials, underlining this factor as crucial for reliability. Statistical significance test confirms the superiority of the MCLDA over the MCSVM approach, achieving a 93% accuracy in the classification of Fingers, Wrist, and Thumb gestures using only five sensors near the magnets’ motion range. This underscores our strategy’s effectiveness in accurately detecting hand movements, highlighting its potential for clinical application and improving amputees’ quality of life.},

We characterized the actuator (approximately $8 Nm$ at 90° at $70 kPa$ ) and demonstrated its good transparency, both from a kinematic and a muscular standpoint. Then, on 11 healthy individuals, we showed reductions in shoulder muscle activity (both at the anterior and middle deltoid) while performing a lift and hold task, ranging from 16% to almost 60% of the maximum voluntary contraction. More importantly, we confirmed these effects on two SCI individuals SCI, at two different stages of recovery.

The influence of the gravity compensation device on motor driving torque and energy consumption is also analyzed. Finally, experimental results show that compared with sliding mode control under power reaching law (PRL-SMC) and PID control, CRL-SMC has better control performance in single joint trajectory tracking and end trajectory tracking, improving control performance by at least 60%. In the best case, the gravity compensation device can reduce the energy consumption by 81.90% and the maximum motor current by 69.25% of the driving element.},

  abstract     = {Robotic exoskeletons are being increasingly used in clinics for the treatment of medicable disabilities. These exoskeletons, which closely couple with patients’ limbs, need to move in harmony with the endoskeleton motions. To achieve coordination, exoskeletons should be transparent; in other words, they should not interfere with natural human motion or their underlying coordination strategies. Transparency can be achieved through a bio-inspired exoskeleton design and also by implementing appropriate force control methods to maneuver exoskeleton motions. A new hybrid active-passive Gait Exoskeleton-Assisted Rehabilitation (GEAR) robot is presented here for the rehabilitation of lower limb disabilities. The GEAR robot is designed to enhance transparency incorporating a flexible hip joint and a biomimetic knee joint. The proposed GEAR robot also integrates a Remote Centered Motion (RCM) based passive mechanism to support torso and pelvic motions in two planes and features actuated exoskeleton legs in the sagittal plane for treadmill-assisted walking. The exoskeleton legs are actuated at their hip and knee joints using backdrivable actuators. To provide a natural walking experience, the hip joints of the exoskeleton legs offer two passive degrees of freedom in the frontal and transverse planes in addition to the actuated sagittal plane motion. The biomimetic design of the exoskeleton knee joint ensures alignment with the human anatomical knee joint by closely tracking the latter’s instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). To evaluate GEAR robot’s transparency, a comparative study was conducted, involving three healthy subjects. The participants walked freely on a treadmill and then with the GEAR robot operated first in a completely backdrivable (i.e., passive) mode and subsequently in an active mode. The sEMG data collected during these experiments were analyzed to assess robot’s transparency.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in rescue robots due to their vital role in addressing emergency scenarios and providing crucial assistance in challenging or hazardous situations where human intervention is problematic. However, very few of these robots are capable of actively engaging with humans and undertaking physical manipulation tasks. This limitation is largely attributed to the absence of tools that can realistically simulate physical interactions, especially the contact mechanisms between a robotic gripper and a human body. In this study, we aim to address key limitations in current developments towards robotic casualty manipulation. Firstly, we present an integrative simulation framework for casualty manipulation. We adapt a finite element method (FEM) tool into the grasping and manipulation scenario, and the developed framework can provide accurate biomechanical reactions resulting from manipulation. Secondly, we conduct a detailed assessment of grasping stability during casualty grasping and manipulation simulations. To validate the necessity and superior performance of the proposed high-fidelity simulation framework, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative comparison of grasping stability analyses between the proposed framework and the state-of-the-art multi-body physics simulations. Through these efforts, we have taken the first step towards a feasible solution for robotic casualty manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Surgical workflow anticipation is the task of predicting the timing of relevant surgical events from live video data, which is critical in Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS). Accurate predictions require the use of spatial information to model surgical interactions. However, current methods focus solely on surgical instruments, assume static interactions between instruments, and only anticipate surgical events within a fixed time horizon. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive graph learning framework for surgical workflow anticipation based on a novel spatial representation, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce a new representation of spatial information based on bounding boxes of surgical instruments and targets, including their detection confidence levels. These are trained on additional annotations we provide for two benchmark datasets. Second, we design an adaptive graph learning method to capture dynamic interactions. Third, we develop a multi-horizon objective that balances learning objectives for different time horizons, allowing for unconstrained predictions. Evaluations on two benchmarks reveal superior performance in short-to-mid-term anticipation, with an error reduction of approximately 3% for surgical phase anticipation and 9% for remaining surgical duration anticipation. These performance improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight its potential for enhancing preparation and coordination within the RAS team. This can improve surgical safety and the efficiency of operating room usage.},

  abstract     = {In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS), the smoke generated by energy-based surgical instruments blurs and obstructs the endoscopic surgical field, which increases the difficulty and risk of robotic surgery. However, current desmoking research primarily focuses on natural weather conditions, with limited studies addressing desmoking techniques for endoscopic images. Furthermore, surgical smoke presents a notably intricate morphology, and research efforts aimed at uniform, non-uniform, thin, and dense smoke remain relatively limited. This work proposes a Local-Global U-Shaped Transformer Model (LGUformer) based on the U-Net and Transformer architectures to remove complex smoke from endoscopic images. By introducing a local-global multi-head self-attention mechanism and multi-scale depthwise convolution, the proposed model enhances the inference capability. An enhanced feature map fusion method improves the quality of reconstructed images. The improved modules enable efficient handling of variable smoke while generating superior-quality images. Through desmoking experiments on synthetic and real smoke images, the LGUformer model demonstrated superior performance compared with seven other desmoking models in terms of accuracy, clarity, absence of distortion, and robustness. A task-based surgical instrument segmentation experiment indicated the potential of this model as a pre-processing step in visual tasks. Finally, an ablation study was conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed modules.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing textured colon surface maps using a sequence of monocular colonoscopic images together with a 3D colon mesh model that has been segmented in CT colonography. The problem is formulated as a direct bundle adjustment (BA) problem which simultaneously optimizes all camera poses and the intensity of vertices on the pre-operative mesh model. This optimization is achieved by maximizing photometric consistency among multiple views of 2D images and the pre-operative 3D mesh model. The key properties of our proposed direct BA formulation involve eliminating the need for reference image specification, data association (feature extraction and matching), and image depth information. Thus, the proposed method is particularly suitable for scenarios where distinct features and image depth are not available, such as 2D colonoscopic images. Furthermore, we have proven that solving the proposed direct BA using the Gauss-Newton (GN) algorithm has the merit of optimizing camera poses only, which is equivalent to optimizing camera poses and the intensities of 3D vertices on the mesh together. Thus, a direct camera-only BA algorithm is proposed and used for 3D textured colon reconstruction from textureless 2D colonoscopic images. Validations using simulation, phantom, and in-vivo datasets are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases, driven by pollution and unhealthy lifestyle factors, are commonly treated with cardiac catheterization. However, this exposes medical staff to harmful X-ray radiation, leading to the development of robot-assisted catheterization systems for safer procedures. Despite their advantages, existing robotic systems are frequently complex and struggle with catheter maneuverability without a guidewire. This paper introduces a novel two-degree-of-freedom robot-assisted cardiac catheterization system, detailing its development, evaluation, and mathematical modeling. The system is designed for precise control of catheter motion through both translational and rotational movements, enhancing procedural efficiency and safety. We provide an in-depth analysis of deformation forces, stress, and strain characteristics based on catheter materials, supported by comprehensive mathematical modeling of applied forces and torques. Simulation results show that the system requires a torque of 1.870 Nm, a displacement of 0.089 m, and a velocity of 1.450 m/s for translational motion. For rotational motion, the system demands 0.915 Nm of torque, an angle of 5.102 rad, and an angular velocity of 88.735 rad/s. These results are validated against pre-existing models to confirm the system’s performance. The study concludes by presenting a three-dimensional (3D) model of the system, demonstrating its ability to improve the safety and precision of cardiac catheterization.},

This concern is particularly significant in jobs involving awkward postures, e.g., aircraft and vehicle assembly and maintenance. To help address this challenge, we present a comprehensive scoping review examining robots capable of supporting physical balance in healthy individuals. Our analysis involved evaluating their capabilities, observing their functionality, and assessing their practicality. The majority of our findings (81%) were lower body exoskeletons, which, though highly mobile, can be constrained by slow control systems. Conversely, supernumerary robotic limbs and wearable gyroscopes allow unrestricted movement with less constrained control systems. Many experiments lack baseline comparisons without the robot, and some have limited participant recruitment, affecting representation. We recommend universally available testing procedures to effectively demonstrate and compare the capabilities of balance-supporting robots.},

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art steerable needle studies to identify research gaps and aims to deepen understanding the mechanics of active needles in soft tissue, which is critical for design optimization, precise control, and preoperative planning but currently remains unclear. To simplify the analysis, this review suggests separating the mechanics of an active needle into two parts: one for each of the tip and the shaft, where the shaft can be understood similarly to the passive needle whose mechanics has been thoroughly studied compared to the active one. Therefore, investigating the tip mechanics, including tissue properties, tip loadings, and tip kinematics, can lead to the complete understanding of active needle mechanics, the next challenges.},

These innovations not only propel dentistry into the digital age, but also introduce novel, non-invasive, and immersive treatment methodologies. This review collates and summarizes the latest developments and applications of AR and MR in digital dentistry. In contemporary practice, digital information, such as CT scans, is predominantly used for presurgical verification. However, integrating patients digital 3D information into real-world environments through AR and MR allows dental professionals to visualize diagnostic and therapeutic data using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). This integration enhances not only efficiency and safety, but also elevates surgical training. Despite these benefits, further enhancements are required for these technologies to achieve broader acceptance in clinical dentistry. In this review, we have dedicated a separate section discussing the prospective applications and future directions of AR and MR, including optimizing HMD technology, developing intraoperative feedback navigation technology, advancing human-machine interaction (HMI) technology, and improving soft-tissue visualization technology. The literature suggests that AR and MR applications are particularly advantageous in dentistry, despite some limitations.

To investigate how sensor locations affect the ability to automatically detect compensatory movements of the upper limb, sixteen surface electromyography sensors were placed on key muscles involved in these movements. Thirty-one healthy participants performed a door-opening task in three conditions: without elbow restrictions (healthy pattern), and two conditions with limited elbow range of motion (60° of flexion-full flexion and 30°–80° of flexion to simulate injury). Statistical analyses identified sensor locations with significant differences between the conditions. Support vector machine classifiers demonstrated notably higher performance using data from six sensors on the middle deltoid, the upper trapezius, the latissimus dorsi, the external obliques, and the erector abdominis. This study highlights the importance of thoughtful muscle selection for effective automatic detection and correction of upper-limb compensatory movements, which is crucial for a wearable mechatronic device to be effective in improving the movement quality of patients.},

This Variance-Accounted-For Complexity Index (VAF-CI) reliably distinguished between different manipulation tasks. Moreover, an unsupervised learning method (k-means clustering) was able to use the index to accurately identify the 3 distinct manipulation tasks.

  abstract     = {Individuals with hand paralysis resulting from a C6-C7 spinal cord injury (SCI) frequently rely on tenodesis for grasping. However, tenodesis generates limited grasping force and demands constant exertion to maintain a grasp, leading to fatigue and sometimes pain. We introduce the MyHand-SCI, a wearable robot that provides grasping assistance through motorized exotendons. Our user-driven device enables independent, ipsilateral operation via a novel control method, Throttle-based Wrist Angle (TWA), that allows users to maintain grasps without requiring continued wrist extension. A pilot case study with a person with C6 SCI shows an improvement in functional grasping and grasping force, as well as a preserved ability to modulate grasping force while using our device, thus improving their ability to manipulate everyday objects. This research is a step towards developing effective and intuitive assistive devices for individuals with hand impairments after SCI.},

Researchers have attempted to elicit sensation through direct stimulation of peripheral nerves or through stimulation of reinnervated skin or muscle. Previous research found that electrical stimulation of Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNIs) elicited sensations that were referred to the phantom hand. The purpose of this study was to determine if this sensation could be used to improve performance of a functional task. Two participants with upper limb loss completed the Box and Blocks Test in a virtual environment under four feedback conditions on a single day of testing. These conditions included no feedback, vibration triggered by object contact, and two conditions where RPNIs were electrically stimulated upon object contact. For the RPNI conditions, one was somatotopic, meaning the referred sensation and virtual sensor were collocated and the other was non-somatotopic, where the referred sensation and virtual sensor locations differed. Participants moved the most blocks when somatotopic feedback was provided. Both participants expressed a preference for the somatotopic sensation, noting that it made their movements feel more natural. Overall, this study demonstrates that RPNI-elicited sensation has the potential to improve functional performance.},

  abstract     = {In ankle-foot orthosis development, it is challenging to both specify the appropriate ankle mechanics and design systems that can physically render them. Recently, a new ankle-foot orthosis-the Variable Stiffness Orthosis (VSO)–was introduced to allow customization of the shape of the joint’s torque-angle relationship via a cam-based transmission. A module in the VSO permits switching between two coupled torque-angle relationships at desired kinematic transitions. This module decouples energy storage and return (DESR), enabling new functionality, including varying the ankle’s equilibrium position and exchanging energy between gait phases. However, the torque-angle relationships are defined by many parameters and subject to substantial constraints. We developed an optimization framework to design two versions of the DESR module to address foot drop. The angle module was designed to maximize swing ankle angle, and the energy module was designed to maximize energy recycled from early stance phase to augment push off. We validated the results of the optimization with brute-force searching and empirically tested the DESR mechanics in a rotary dynamometer. The angle module facilitated swing angles of up to 0.63° dorsiflexion, while simultaneously permitting a plantarflexed standing angle, and the energy module recycled up to 1.84 J.},

Here, we fabricate ultra-deformable magnetic microrobots, consisting of ferrofluid-loaded lipid vesicles, and we magnetically pull them through chambers that exert upon them a gradually more forceful confinement. We thus analyze their capability to face interstices comparable to or smaller than their characteristic size and their consequent behavior in terms of stability, velocity, and deformation. The results show that the inherent compliance of these vesicle-based magnetic microrobots allows them to infiltrate successfully in interstices slightly smaller than their size. Further enhancement of their compliance and the development of specific control strategies may lead to microrobots able to move through interstices and traverse complex biological environments.},

This study explores the impact of kinematic constraints imposed by exoskeletons on user gait, stability, and perceived discomfort. Specifically, it examines how the varying degrees of freedom (DoF) in an ankle exoskeleton influence these factors. The exoskeleton utilized in this study can be configured to allow one, two, or three DoF, thereby simulating different levels of mechanical complexity and kinematic compatibility. A pilot study was conducted with six participants walking on a straight path to evaluate these effects. The findings indicate that increasing DoF of the exoskeleton improves several criteria, including kinematics and stability. In particular, the transition from 1 DoF to 2 DoF yielded a larger improvement than the transition from 2 DoF to 3 DoF, although the 3 DoF configuration produced the best overall results. Higher DoF configurations also resulted in stability values that resemble more closely those of walking without the exoskeleton, despite the added weight. Subjective feedback from participants corroborated these results, indicating the lowest discomfort with the 3 DoF ankle exoskeleton.},

  abstract     = {In telemanipulation, supplementary feedback can enhance operator perception and control precision. This study introduces a haptic interface designed to convey temporally discrete tactile cues when remotely controlling a robot. Low-profile piezoelectric sensors were integrated in the thumb of a robotic hand to capture the key events of the manipulation task (i.e., object contact and release). Synchronously with such events, pressure bursts were delivered to the operator’s fingertip through a soft textile thimble equipped with inflatable pockets. Both this haptic display and the sensing module were individually evaluated. The pneumatic system responsible for pockets inflation was characterized in terms of reaction time, proving suitable for the application with a latency of less than 70 ms. Regarding the sensing module, the behavior of the sensorized thumb was first evaluated under static conditions, identifying contact and release events when grasping with the robotic hand differently shaped objects fixed on a table. Then, the accuracy of the touch event detection was assessed while performing a more complex manipulation task (i.e., a pick and lift task). This evaluation was conducted first with the robot programmed to grasp and lift an object following pre-defined trajectories, where we measured accuracy of 100% for contact and 90% for release event detection. Then, we performed a telemanipulation pilot study involving eight participants, where the system proved capable of correctly detecting object contact and release events with an accuracy of 100% and 86.4%. Despite preliminary, these results confirmed proper functioning of the system and paved the way for the exploration of a new haptic feedback policy in telemanipulation based on temporally discrete tactile events.},

  abstract     = {Gait phase (GP) estimation is a critical component in control of exoskeletons and prostheses, enabling seamless user interaction in various controllers. In recent years, methods based on machine learning and sensor fusion have offered advances in GP estimation, but their high computational costs and reliance on training and numerous sensors present practical challenges. Estimation methods using phase variables, such as phase-portrait-based methods, can circumvent these drawbacks. However, their lower accuracy has limited their application. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization approach for improving the accuracy of GP estimation in phase-portrait-based methods. The approach is based on geometric manipulation of the phase portraits with linear transformations, which are adapted online by employing Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The performance of this adaptive method (termed AM) is compared against using a fixed transformation (FM) at different walking speeds on level and inclined treadmill. The results demonstrate the superior performance of AM in all tested conditions in terms of accuracy and linearity, with an average RMS error of $1.97 \pm 0.20\%$ . Convergence times for one round of optimization on a low-end single-board computer were less than 11 s on average. This study confirms the potential of leveraging HIL optimization for enhancing the performance of phase-portrait-based methods to reach accuracy levels comparable to more complex state-of-the-art methods.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to measure brain activation with high spatial resolution, but devices used within a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine must be designed within several constraints.

To demonstrate its use as an MRI compatible platform, we conducted MRI conditionality testing. Additionally, we collected brain activation data from two healthy control subject’s using fMRI to show that the exoskeleton can be comfortably worn in the MRI scanner and that appropriate brain activation data can be collected during use.

In this paper, a large deploy/fold ratio variable stiffness hyper-redundant robot based on the origami principle is proposed, which has a large deploy/fold ratio, and realizes large stiffness change based on the bionic muscle-driven variable stiffness principle. Based on the analysis of origami theory, the robot uses rigid origami mechanisms as the skeleton support, flexible gasbags as the backbones, and the hybrid actuation is used to realize the extension, contraction, variable stiffness, and omnidirectional bending motion. Based on the motion/stiffness model of the hyper-redundant robot, the characteristics of the single-joint and the 6-joint hyper-redundant robot are verified by experiments. These experiments confirm that the hyper-redundant robot has a large deploy/fold and variable stiffness range, obtains a large bending deformation and working range, can overcome the gravity generated by itself and the load, and has a high load capacity.},

  abstract     = {Tracking permanent magnets represents a low-footprint and passive approach to monitoring objects or human motion by attaching or embedding magnets therein. Recent tracking techniques achieved high-bandwidth detection considering a simplified model for the magnetic sources, i.e., the dipole model. Nonetheless, such a model can lead to inaccurate results any time a non-spherical magnet approaches the sensor array. Here, we present a novel tracking algorithm based on an analytical model for permanent magnet cylinders with uniform arbitrary magnetization. By means of a physical system mounting 20 magnetometers, we compared the tracking accuracy obtained with our algorithm vs. results obtained by using the dipole model and with respect to a ground-truth reference. With a single magnetic target, our algorithm can significantly lower position (up to 0.68 mm) and orientation errors (up to 2.5°) while enabling online tracking (computation time below 19 ms). We also accurately tracked two magnets, by obtaining a reduction in position error (up to 0.92 mm) vs. the dipole-based algorithm. These findings broaden the applicability of accurate magnetic tracking to real-time applications, facilitating the tracking of multiple magnetic targets in proximity of the magnetic sensors. This advancement opens avenues for applications in wearable devices, advancing the field of motion detection beyond traditional inertial measurement units.},

  abstract     = {Hemiparetic gait is often characterized by ankle weakness, resulting in decreased propulsion and clearance, as well as knee hyperextension. These gait deviations reduce speed and efficiency while increasing the risk of falls and osteoarthritis. Powered ankle exoskeletons have the potential to address these issues. However, only a handful of studies have investigated their effects on hemiparetic gait. The results are often inconsistent, and the biomechanical analysis rarely includes the knee or hip joint or a direct clearance measure. In this case study, we assess the ankle, knee, and hip biomechanics with and without a new autonomous powered ankle exoskeleton across different speeds and inclines. Exoskeleton assistance resulted in more normative kinematics at the subject’s self-selected walking speed. The paretic ankle angle at heel strike increased from 10° plantarflexed without the exoskeleton to 0.5° dorsiflexed with the exoskeleton, and the peak plantarflexion angle during swing decreased from 28° without the exoskeleton to 12° with the exoskeleton. Furthermore, stance knee flexion increased from 7° without the exoskeleton to 20° with the exoskeleton. Finally, foot clearance increased with the exoskeleton for all conditions between 3.1 cm and 5.4 cm. This case study highlights new mechanisms for powered ankle exoskeletons to improve hemiparetic gait.},

The deployed FIC architecture is robust to delay between the master and the replica robots and can switch online between an admittance and impedance behavior. Our experiments analyze three scenarios: teleoperated surgery, rehabilitation, and remote ultrasound scan. The experiments did not require any adjustment of the robot tuning, which is essential in medical applications where the operators do not have an engineering background. Our results show that it is possible to teleoperate the robot to perform remote occupational therapy, operate a scalpel, and use an ultrasound scan.

In our study, we developed a portable active exosuit to support hip extension during endurance running. The exosuit, featuring custom linear actuators and a control system synchronous with the wearer’s kinematics, initially underwent bench testing and, finally, a field evaluation with users running at their self-selected pace on an athletics track. Results from seven participants showed a significant reduction in the metabolic cost of transport when the exosuit was active. Specifically, we observed a 9.6% decrease with respect to the unpowered condition, with a 4.3% net saving compared to not wearing the device. Additionally, kinematic assessments revealed no alteration of the participants’ motion after toe-off, indicating transparency to physiological movement pattern during hip flexion. These findings highlight the potential of the exosuit to enhance athletic performance, opening new possibilities for running assistance in real-world scenarios.},

Characterized by discreet, flexible designs, exosuits seamlessly integrate into daily routines, offering unobtrusive support and enhancing functional independence for those with mobility impairments. This research proposes a novel exoglove controlled via force-myography to restore grasping motor ability in individuals with partial loss of hand-motor function but retaining residual wrist movement. The exosuit aims to provide a tailored solution, offering cost-effective advantages over traditional exoskeletons. The proposed exoglove uses force myography to translate the user’s wrist movements into a motor command to assist grasping. Such an approach could ensure reliable and consistent control for people with partial or total loss of finger motion. With more than 89% accuracy in wrist movement classification, it can operate with minimal effort, moreover, the exoglove preserves natural finger motion, demonstrated by negligible muscle activity variations.},

  abstract     = {In the control of lower-limb exoskeletons with feet, the phase in the gait cycle can be identified by monitoring the weight distribution at the feet. This phase information can be used in the exoskeleton’s controller to compensate the dynamics of the exoskeleton and to assign impedance parameters. Typically the weight distribution is calculated using data from sensors such as treadmill force plates or insole force sensors. However, these solutions increase both the setup complexity and cost. For this reason, we propose a deep-learning approach that uses a short time window of joint kinematics to predict the weight distribution of an exoskeleton in real time. The model was trained on treadmill walking data from six users wearing a four-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton and tested in real time on three different users wearing the same device. This test set includes two users not present in the training set to demonstrate the model’s ability to generalize across individuals. Results show that the proposed method is able to fit the actual weight distribution with $R^{2}=0.9$ and is suitable for real-time control with prediction times less than 1 ms. Experiments in closed-loop exoskeleton control show that deep-learning-based weight distribution estimation can be used to replace force sensors in overground and treadmill walking.},

These models provide personalized estimates of the parameters using information from many sensors. However, to advance technology from labs to workplaces, there is a need for sensor reduction to improve wearability and applicability. Therefore we introduce an EMG sensor reduction approach based on inverse synergy extrapolation, to reconstruct unmeasured EMG signals for different box-lifting techniques. 12 participants performed an array of tasks (squat, stoop, unilateral twist and bilateral twist) with different weights (0 kg, 7.5 kg and 15 kg). We found that two synergies were sufficient to explain the different lifting tasks (median variance accounted for of 0.91). Building upon this, we used two sensors at optimal subject-specific muscle locations to reconstruct the EMG of four unmeasured channels. Evaluation of the reconstructed and reference EMG showed median coefficients of determination $(R^{2})$ between 0.70 and 0.86, with median root mean squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.02 to 0.04 relative to maximal voluntary contraction. This indicates that our proposed method shows promise for sensor reduction for driving a trunk EMS for ambulatory biomechanical risk assessment in occupational settings and exoskeleton control.},

Instabilities generate complex interaction forces that render the system unpredictable. And yet, humans interact with these objects with ease. Nonlinear dynamic analysis shows that the initial conditions and frequencies of input forces determine the system’s stability. Taking inspiration from carrying a cup of coffee, participants rhythmically moved a cup with a ball rolling inside which was modeled as a cart-pendulum system. They were encouraged to prepare the cup-and-ball system by ‘jiggling’ the cup before moving it back and forth on a horizontal line. We tested the hypothesis that humans initialize the system and choose interaction frequencies that stabilize their interactions. To create uncertainty about the specific cup-and-ball system, the pendulum length was varied without providing cues to the participant. Stability was quantified by variability of relative phase between cup and ball. Results showed that participants nonlinearly co-varied the initial ball angle at the end of preparation and the cup frequency during the rhythmic phase. Mapping participants’ choices onto the highly nonlinear manifold of stable solutions generated by forward-simulations verified that they indeed achieved stable solutions.},

In this brief, we establish a fast learning rate for the empirical risk minimization (ERM) on DNN regression with dependent samples, and the dependence is expressed in terms of geometrically strongly mixing sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result of DNN methods based on mixing sequences. This result is a natural generalization of the independent sample case.},

  abstract     = {The generator in the generative adversarial network (GAN) learns image generation in a coarse-to-fine manner in which earlier layers learn the overall structure of the image and the latter ones refine the details. To propagate the coarse information well, recent works usually build their generators by stacking up multiple residual blocks. Although the residual block can produce a high-quality image as well as be trained stably, it often impedes the information flow in the network. To alleviate this problem, this brief introduces a novel generator architecture that produces the image by combining features obtained through two different branches: the main and auxiliary branches. The goal of the main branch is to produce the image by passing through the multiple residual blocks, whereas the auxiliary branch is to convey the coarse information in the earlier layer to the later one. To combine the features in the main and auxiliary branches successfully, we also propose a gated feature fusion module (GFFM) that controls the information flow in those branches. To prove the superiority of the proposed method, this brief provides extensive experiments using various standard datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, LSUN, CelebA-HQ, AFHQ, and tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, we conducted various ablation studies to demonstrate the generalization ability of the proposed method. Quantitative evaluations prove that the proposed method exhibits impressive GAN performance in terms of Inception score (IS) and Frechet inception distance (FID). For instance, the proposed method boosts the FID and IS scores on the tiny-ImageNet dataset from 35.13 to 25.00 and 20.23 to 25.57, respectively.},

  abstract     = {High-efficiency deep learning (DL) models are necessary not only to facilitate their use in devices with limited resources but also to improve resources required for training. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) typically exert severe demands on local device resources and this conventionally limits their adoption within mobile and embedded platforms. This brief presents work toward utilizing static convolutional filters generated from the space of local binary patterns (LBPs) and Haar features to design efficient ConvNet architectures. These are referred to as Structured Ternary Patterns (STePs) and can be generated during network initialization in a systematic way instead of having learnable weight parameters thus reducing the total weight updates. The ternary values require significantly less storage and with the appropriate low-level implementation, can also lead to inference improvements. The proposed approach is validated using four image classification datasets, demonstrating that common network backbones can be made more efficient and provide competitive results. It is also demonstrated that it is possible to generate completely custom STeP-based networks that provide good trade-offs for on-device applications such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial vehicle detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high detection accuracy while reducing the trainable parameters by 40%–80%. This work motivates further research toward good priors for nonlearnable weights that can make DL architectures more efficient without having to alter the network during or after training.},

Because the projected samples can be classified effectively, LDA has been successfully applied in many applications. Among the variants of LDA, trace ratio LDA (TR-LDA) is a classic form due to its explicit meaning. Unfortunately, when the sample size is much smaller than the data dimension, the algorithm for solving TR-LDA does not converge. The so-called small sample size (SSS) problem severely limits the application of TR-LDA. To solve this problem, we propose a revised formation of TR-LDA, which can be applied to datasets with different sizes in a unified form. Then, we present an optimization algorithm to solve the proposed method, explain why it can avoid the SSS problem, and analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the optimization algorithm. Next, based on the introduced theorems, we quantitatively elaborate on when the SSS problem will occur in TR-LDA. Finally, the experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In addition, an innovative robot control law is designed, incorporating speed feedback and nonlinear activation functions to achieve finite-time error convergence. Unlike previous approaches, our distributed task allocation method yields finite-time error convergence, does not rely on consensus filters, and eliminates the need for a central computing unit to get the k-WTA result during the control process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis and simulations.

  abstract     = {Most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node embeddings using the framework of message passing and aggregation. Such GNNs are incapable of learning relative positions between graph nodes within a graph. To empower GNNs with the awareness of node positions, some nodes are set as anchors. Then, using the distances from a node to the anchors, GNNs can infer relative positions between nodes. However, position-aware GNNs (P-GNNs) arbitrarily select anchors, leading to compromising position awareness and feature extraction. To eliminate this compromise, we demonstrate that selecting evenly distributed and asymmetric anchors is essential. On the other hand, we show that choosing anchors that can aggregate embeddings of all the nodes within a graph is NP-complete. Therefore, devising efficient optimal algorithms in a deterministic approach is practically not feasible. To ensure position awareness and bypass NP-completeness, we propose position-sensing GNNs (PSGNNs), learning how to choose anchors in a backpropagatable fashion. Experiments verify the effectiveness of PSGNNs against state-of-the-art GNNs, substantially improving performance on various synthetic and real-world graph datasets while enjoying stable scalability. Specifically, PSGNNs on average boost area under the curve (AUC) more than 14% for pairwise node classification and 18% for link prediction over the existing state-of-the-art position-aware methods.

  abstract     = {Multi-View clustering has attracted broad attention due to its capacity to utilize consistent and complementary information among views. Although tremendous progress has been made recently, most existing methods undergo high complexity, preventing them from being applied to large-scale tasks. Multi-View clustering via matrix factorization is a representative to address this issue. However, most of them map the data matrices into a fixed dimension, limiting the model’s expressiveness. Moreover, a range of methods suffers from a two-step process, i.e., multimodal learning and the subsequent k-means, inevitably causing a suboptimal clustering result. In light of this, we propose a one-step multi-view clustering with diverse representation (OMVCDR) method, which incorporates multi-view learning and k-means into a unified framework. Specifically, we first project original data matrices into various latent spaces to attain comprehensive information and auto-weight them in a self-supervised manner. Then, we directly use the information matrices under diverse dimensions to obtain consensus discrete clustering labels. The unified work of representation learning and clustering boosts the quality of the final results. Furthermore, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm with proven convergence to solve the resultant problem. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the promising clustering performance of our proposed method. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wanxinhang/OMVCDR.},

  abstract     = {Interactive image segmentation (IIS) has emerged as a promising technique for decreasing annotation time. Substantial progress has been made in pre- and post-processing for IIS, but the critical issue of interaction ambiguity, notably hindering segmentation quality, has been under-researched. To address this, we introduce ADAPTIVE CLICK — a click-aware transformer incorporating an adaptive focal loss (AFL) that tackles annotation inconsistencies with tools for mask- and pixel-level ambiguity resolution. To the best of our knowledge, AdaptiveClick is the first transformer-based, mask-adaptive segmentation framework for IIS. The key ingredient of our method is the click-aware mask-adaptive transformer decoder (CAMD), which enhances the interaction between click and image features. Additionally, AdaptiveClick enables pixel-adaptive differentiation of hard and easy samples in the decision space, independent of their varying distributions. This is primarily achieved by optimizing a generalized AFL with a theoretical guarantee, where two adaptive coefficients control the ratio of gradient values for hard and easy pixels. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used Focal and BCE losses can be considered special cases of the proposed AFL. With a plain ViT backbone, extensive experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdaptiveClick compared to state-of-the-art methods.

It aims to embed vertices of temporal networks into a low-dimensional vector space while preserving network structures and temporal properties. However, most existing methods have limitations in capturing dynamics over long distances, which makes it difficult to explore multihop topological associations among vertices. To tackle this challenge, we propose LongTNE, which learns the long-range dynamics of vertices to endow TNE with the ability to capture high-order proximity (HP) of networks. In LongTNE, we employ graph self-supervised learning (Graph SSL) to optimize the establishment probability of deep links in each network snapshot. We also present an accumulated forward update (AFU) module to fathom global temporal evolution among multiple network snapshots. The empirical results on six temporal networks demonstrate that, in addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on network mining tasks, LongTNE can be handily extended to existing TNE methods.},

We propose a two-layer network consisting of informed and uninformed boundary observers where novel adaptation laws are developed for the identification of uncertainties. Particularly, all observer agents in the network transmit their information with each other across the entire network. The proposed adaptation laws include a penalty term of the mismatch between the parameter estimates generated by the other observer agents. Moreover, for the nonparametric uncertainties, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are employed for the universal approximation of unknown nonlinear functions. Given the persistently exciting condition, it is shown that the proposed network of adaptive observers can achieve exponential joint state-uncertainty estimation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and ultimate bounded estimation in the presence of nonparametric uncertainties based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The effects of the proposed consensus method are demonstrated through a typical reaction–diffusion system example, which implies convincing numerical findings.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging yet promising technique that aims to discriminate objects based on a few labeled examples. Learning a high-quality feature representation is key with few-shot data, and many existing models attempt to extract general information from the sample or task levels. However, the common sample-level means of feature representation limits the models generalizability to different tasks, while task-level representation may lose class characteristics due to excessive information aggregation. In this article, we synchronize the class-specific and task-shared information from the class and task levels to obtain a better representation. Structure-based contrastive learning is introduced to obtain class-specific representations by increasing the interclass distance. A hierarchical class structure is constructed by clustering semantically similar classes using the idea of granular computing. When guided by a class structure, it is more difficult to distinguish samples in different classes that have similar characteristics than those with large interclass differences. To this end, structure-guided contrastive learning is introduced to study class-specific information. A hierarchical graph neural network is established to transfer task-shared information from coarse to fine. It hierarchically infers the target sample based on all samples in the task and yields a more general representation for FSL classification. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our model over several state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot relation extraction (ZSRE) is shown to become more significant in the current information extraction system, which aims at predicting relation classes that lack annotations or have just never appeared during training. Previous works focus on projecting sentences with their corresponding relation descriptions to an intermediate semantic space and searching the nearest semantic for predicting unseen classes. Though these methods can achieve sound performance, they only obtain inferior semantic information via a trivial distance metric and neglect the interaction in the instance representations. We are thus motivated to tackle these issues and propose a hierarchical contrastive learning (HCL) framework for ZSRE including projection-level and instance-level modules. Specifically, the projection-level component replaces the distance score function by contrastive loss to connect the input sentence with the relation semantic space. And the instance-level component integrates the external knowledge from sentence entities to establish new contrastive pairs for efficiently learning representations from mutual information. The experimental results on three well-known datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the existing SOTA by at most 18.97% improvement on the F1 score when unseen classes are 15. Moreover, our model can achieve more competitive performance alone with the increasing number of unseen classes.},

Classification-based streaming algorithms require pre-training on labeled data. Manually labeling a large number of samples in the data stream is impractical and cost-prohibitive. Stream clustering algorithms rely on unsupervised learning. They have been widely studied for their ability to effectively analyze high-speed data streams without prior knowledge. Stream clustering plays a key role in data stream mining. Currently, most data stream clustering algorithms adopt the online–offline framework. In the online stage, micro-clusters are maintained, and in the offline stage, they are clustered using an algorithm similar to density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). When data streams have clusters with varying densities and ambiguous boundaries, traditional data stream clustering algorithms may be less effective. To overcome the above limitations, this article proposes a fully online stream clustering algorithm called fast boundary peeling stream clustering (FBPStream). First, FBPStream defines a decay-based kernel density estimation (KDE). It can discover clusters with varying densities and identify the evolving trend of streams well. Then, FBPStream implements an efficient boundary micro-cluster peeling technique to identify the potential core micro-clusters. Finally, FBPStream employs a parallel clustering strategy to effectively cluster core and boundary micro-clusters. The proposed algorithm is compared with ten popular algorithms on 15 data streams. Experimental results show that FBPStream is competitive with the other ten popular algorithms.},

Yet, existing ultrasound beamforming and related methods face a big challenge to improve both the quality and speed of imaging for the required clinical applications. The most notable characteristic of ultrasound signal data is its spatial and temporal features. Because most signals are complex-valued, directly processing them by using real-valued networks leads to phase distortion and inaccurate output. In this study, for the first time, we propose a complex-valued convolutional gated recurrent (CCGR) neural network to handle ultrasound analytic signals with the aforementioned properties. The complex-valued network operations proposed in this study improve the beamforming accuracy of complex-valued ultrasound signals over traditional real-valued methods. Further, the proposed deep integration of convolution and recurrent neural networks makes a great contribution to extracting rich and informative ultrasound signal features. Our experimental results reveal its outstanding imaging quality over existing state-of-the-art methods. More significantly, its ultrafast processing speed of only 0.07 s per image promises considerable clinical application potential. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzm0128/CCGR.},

Although a few methods consider multiple attributes, they either require additional constraints or prediction heads, incurring high computational overhead or jeopardizing the stability of the training process. More critically, they consider per-attribute protection approaches, raising concerns about fairness gerrymandering where certain attribute combinations remain unfair. This work aims to construct a neutral domain containing fused information across all subgroups and attributes. It delivers fair predictions as the fused input contains neutralized information for all considered attributes. Specifically, we adopt mixup operations to generate samples with fused information. However, our experiments reveal that directly adopting the operations leads to degraded prediction results. The excessive mixup operations result in unrecognizable training data. To this end, we design three distinct mixup schemes that balance information fusion across attributes while retaining distinct visual features critical for training valid models. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and up to eight sensitive attributes demonstrate that the proposed MultiFair method can deliver fairness protections for multiple attributes while maintaining valid prediction results.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benefits from the representation power of deep neural networks (NNs), to approximate the value function and policy in the learning process. Batch reinforcement learning (BRL) benefits from stable training and data efficiency with fixed representation and enjoys solid theoretical analysis. This work proposes least-squares deep policy gradient (LSDPG), a hybrid approach that combines least-squares reinforcement learning (RL) with online DRL to achieve the best of both worlds. LSDPG leverages a shared network to share useful features between policy (actor) and value function (critic). LSDPG learns policy, value function, and representation separately. First, LSDPG views deep NNs of the critic as a linear combination of representation weighted by the weights of the last layer and performs policy evaluation with regularized least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) methods. Second, arbitrary policy gradient algorithms can be applied to improve the policy. Third, an auxiliary task is used to periodically distill the features from the critic into the representation. Unlike most DRL methods, where the critic algorithms are often used in a nonstationary situation, i.e., the policy to be evaluated is changing, the critic in LSDPG is working on a stationary case in each iteration of the critic update. We prove that, under some conditions, the critic converges to the regularized TD fixpoint of current policy, and the actor converges to the local optimal policy. The experimental results on challenging Procgen benchmark illustrate the improvement of sample efficiency of LSDPG over proximal policy optimization and phasic policy gradient (PPG).},

  abstract     = {The adversarial robustness is critical to deep neural networks (DNNs) in deployment. However, the improvement of adversarial robustness often requires compromising with the network size. Existing approaches to addressing this problem mainly focus on the combination of model compression and adversarial training. However, their performance heavily relies on neural architectures, which are typically manual designs with extensive expertise. In this article, we propose a lightweight and robust neural architecture search (LRNAS) method to automatically search for adversarially robust lightweight neural architectures. Specifically, we propose a novel search strategy to quantify contributions of the components in the search space, based on which the beneficial components can be determined. In addition, we further propose an architecture selection method based on a greedy strategy, which can keep the model size while deriving sufficient beneficial components. Owing to these designs in LRNAS, the lightness, the natural accuracy, and the adversarial robustness can be collectively guaranteed to the searched architectures. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets against the state of the arts. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LRNAS method is superior at finding lightweight neural architectures that are both accurate and adversarially robust under popular adversarial attacks. Moreover, ablation studies are also performed, which reveals the validity of the individual components designed in LRNAS and the component effects in positively deciding the overall performance.},

  abstract     = {Electronic healthcare (e-health) allows smart devices and medical institutions to collaboratively collect patients’ data, which is trained by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help doctors make diagnosis. By allowing multiple devices to train models collaboratively, federated learning is a promising solution to address the communication and privacy issues in e-health. However, applying federated learning in e-health faces many challenges. First, medical data are both horizontally and vertically partitioned. Since single horizontal federated learning (HFL) or vertical federated learning (VFL) techniques cannot deal with both types of data partitioning, directly applying them may consume excessive communication cost due to transmitting a part of raw data when requiring high modeling accuracy. Second, a naive combination of HFL and VFL has limitations including low training efficiency, unsound convergence analysis, and lack of parameter tuning strategies. In this article, we provide a thorough study on an effective integration of HFL and VFL, to achieve communication efficiency and overcome the above limitations when data are both horizontally and vertically partitioned. Specifically, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework with one intermediate result exchange and two aggregation phases. Based on this framework, we develop a hybrid stochastic gradient descent (HSGD) algorithm to train models. Then, we theoretically analyze the convergence upper bound of the proposed algorithm. Using the convergence results, we design adaptive strategies to adjust the training parameters and shrink the size of transmitted data. The experimental results validate that the proposed HSGD algorithm can achieve the desired accuracy while reducing communication cost, and they also verify the effectiveness of the adaptive strategies.},

  abstract     = {Narratives is an account of the unfolding of events, along with explanations of how and why these processes and events came to be. To understand narratives, causality has been proven to be especially useful. Causality manifests itself primarily at both the event and sentence levels, offering essential insights into understanding narratives. However, previous works utilize either sentence-level or event-level causalities. In this article, we devise a two-stage approach to fully exploit both levels of causal relationships. In the first stage, by devising posttraining tasks, we inject sentence-level causalities into pretrained language models (PLMs). The causal-enhanced PLMs, which carry sentence-level causalities, can be transferred to downstream tasks. In the second stage, we utilize event causalities to further refine narrative commonsense reasoning. But, the event sparsity problem brings about the difficulty to learn event representations and capture useful causal semantics. To alleviate this problem, we break down events into multiple word components, enabling the retrieval of word–word relations between these components. And it is possible to alleviate the event sparsity problem since word–word relations capture the interplays between event components. Based on the event-level causalities and the word-level relations, we construct the hierarchical knowledge graph (KG) as knowledge ground. A KG-based reasoning process is then employed for narrative commonsense reasoning. Experimental results affirm the effectiveness of our framework.},

Moreover, an adequate level of interpretability of the networks is missing as well. In this work, we propose a class of new network architecture, built with reusable neural modules (functional blocks), to supply differentiable and interpretable approximators for convex and continuous target functions. Specifically, first, we introduce a concrete model construction mechanism with particular blocks based on differentiable programming and the composition essence of the max operator, extending the scope of existing activation functions. Moreover, explicit block diagrams are provided for a clear understanding of the external architecture and the internal processing mechanism. Subsequently, the approximation behavior of the proposed network to convex functions and continuous functions is rigorously proved as well, by virtue of mathematical induction. Finally, plenty of numerical experiments are conducted on a wide variety of problems, which exhibit the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed model over some existing ones.},

To fill this gap, this article aims to develop a novel model-free policy optimization (PO) algorithm to achieve the OLOTC for unknown linear discrete-time (DT) systems. The iterative control policy is parameterized to directly improve the discounted value function of the augmented system via the gradient-based method. To implement this algorithm in a model-free manner, a model-free two-point policy gradient (PG) algorithm is designed to approximate the gradient of discounted value function by virtue of the sampled states and the reference trajectories. The global convergence of model-free PO algorithm to the optimal value function is demonstrated with the sufficient quantity of samples and proper conditions.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the great advances of deep neural networks (DNNs) in light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR). However, existing DNN-based LF image SR methods are developed on a single fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling), and thus cannot be applied to super-resolve real LF images with diverse degradation. In this article, we propose a simple yet effective method for real-world LF image SR. In our method, a practical LF degradation model is developed to formulate the degradation process of real LF images. Then, a convolutional neural network is designed to incorporate the degradation prior into the SR process. By training on LF images using our formulated degradation, our network can learn to modulate different degradation while incorporating both spatial and angular information in LF images. Extensive experiments on both synthetically degraded and real-world LF images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with existing state-of-the-art single and LF image SR methods, our method achieves superior SR performance under a wide range of degradation, and generalizes better to real LF images.

Moreover, the proposed scheme allows agents to communicate in a fully decentralized manner with minimal information exchange.

  abstract     = {Few-shot single-view 3D reconstruction learns to reconstruct the novel category objects based on a query image and a few support shapes. However, since the query image and the support shapes are of different modalities, there is an inherent feature misalignment problem damaging the reconstruction. Previous works in the literature do not consider this problem. To this end, we propose the cross-modal feature alignment network (CMFAN) with two novel techniques. One is a strategy for model pretraining, namely, cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL), here the 2D images and 3D shapes of the same objects compose the positives, and those from different objects form the negatives. With CMCL, the model learns to embed the 2D and 3D modalities of the same object into a tight area in the feature space and push away those from different objects, thus effectively aligning the global cross-modal features. The other is cross-modal feature fusion (CMFF), which further aligns and fuses the local features. Specifically, it first re-represents the local features with the cross-attention operation, making the local features share more information. Then, CMFF generates a descriptor for the support features and attaches it to each local feature vector of the query image with dense concatenation. Moreover, CMFF can be applied to multilevel local features and brings further advantages. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our designs, and CMFAN sets new state-of-the-art performance in all of the 1-/10-/25-shot tasks of ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets.},

  abstract     = {Despite its significant progress, cross-modal retrieval still suffers from one-to-many matching cases, where the multiplicity of semantic instances in another modality could be acquired by a given query. However, existing approaches usually map heterogeneous data into the learned space as deterministic point vectors. In spite of their remarkable performance in matching the most similar instance, such deterministic point embedding suffers from the insufficient representation of rich semantics in one-to-many correspondence. To address the limitations, we intuitively extend a deterministic point into a closed geometry and develop geometric representation learning methods for cross-modal retrieval. Thus, a set of points inside such a geometry could be semantically related to many candidates, and we could effectively capture the semantic uncertainty. We then introduce two types of geometric matching for one-to-many correspondence, i.e., point-to-rectangle matching (dubbed P2RM) and rectangle-to-rectangle matching (termed R2RM). The former treats all retrieved candidates as rectangles with zero volume (equivalent to points) and the query as a box, while the latter encodes all heterogeneous data into rectangles. Therefore, we could evaluate semantic similarity among heterogeneous data by the Euclidean distance from a point to a rectangle or the volume of intersection between two rectangles. Additionally, both strategies could be easily employed for off-the-self approaches and further improve the retrieval performance of baselines. Under various evaluation metrics, extensive experiments and ablation studies on several commonly used datasets, two for image-text matching and two for video-text retrieval, demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract     = {Striving to match the person identities between visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images, VIS-NIR reidentification (Re-ID) has attracted increasing attention due to its wide applications in low-light scenes. However, owing to the modality and pose discrepancies exhibited in heterogeneous images, the extracted representations inevitably comprise various modality and posture factors, impacting the matching of cross-modality person identity. To solve the problem, we propose a disentangling modality and posture factors (DMPFs) model to disentangle modality and posture factors by fusing the information of features memory and pedestrian skeleton. Specifically, the DMPF comprises three modules: three-stream features extraction network (TFENet), modality factor disentanglement (MFD), and posture factor disentanglement (PFD). First, aiming to provide memory and skeleton information for modality and posture factors disentanglement, the TFENet is designed as a three-stream network to extract VIS-NIR image features and skeleton features. Second, to eliminate modality discrepancy across different batches, we maintain memory queues of previous batch features through the momentum updating mechanism and propose MFD to integrate features in the whole training set by memory-attention layers. These layers explore intramodality and intermodality relationships between features from the current batch and memory queues under the optimization of the optimal transport (OT) method, which encourages the heterogeneous features with the same identity to present higher similarity. Third, to decouple the posture factors from representations, we introduce the PFD module to learn posture-unrelated features with the assistance of the skeleton features. Besides, we perform subspace orthogonal decomposition on both image and skeleton features to separate the posture-related and identity-related information. The posture-related features are adopted to disentangle the posture factors from representations by a designed posture-features consistency (PfC) loss, while the identity-related features are concatenated to obtain more discriminative identity representations. The effectiveness of DMPF is validated through comprehensive experiments on two VIS-NIR pedestrian Re-ID datasets.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot image classification (FSIC) is beneficial for a variety of real-world scenarios, aiming to construct a recognition system with limited training data. In this article, we extend the original FSIC task by incorporating defense against malicious adversarial examples. This can be an arduous challenge because numerous deep learning-based approaches remain susceptible to adversarial examples, even when trained with ample amounts of data. Previous studies on this problem have predominantly concentrated on the meta-learning framework, which involves sampling numerous few-shot tasks during the training stage. In contrast, we propose a straightforward but effective baseline via learning robust and discriminative representations without tedious meta-task sampling, which can further be generalized to unforeseen adversarial FSIC tasks. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial-aware (AA) mechanism that exploits feature-level distinctions between the legitimate and the adversarial domains to provide supplementary supervision. Moreover, we design a novel adversarial reweighting training strategy to ameliorate the imbalance among adversarial examples. To further enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising discriminative features, we propose the cyclic feature purifier during the postprocessing projection, which can reduce the interference of unforeseen adversarial examples. Furthermore, our method can obtain robust feature embeddings that maintain superior transferability, even when facing cross-domain adversarial examples. Extensive experiments and systematic analyses demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness as well as natural performance among adversarially robust FSIC algorithms on three standard benchmarks by a substantial margin.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is the task of matching the same individuals across the visible and infrared modalities. Its main challenge lies in the modality gap caused by the cameras operating on different spectra. Existing VI-ReID methods mainly focus on learning general features across modalities, often at the expense of feature discriminability. To address this issue, we present a novel cycle-construction-based network for neutral yet discriminative feature learning, termed CycleTrans. Specifically, CycleTrans uses a lightweight knowledge capturing module (KCM) to capture rich semantics from the modality-relevant feature maps according to pseudo anchors. Afterward, a discrepancy modeling module (DMM) is deployed to transform these features into neutral ones according to the modality-irrelevant prototypes. To ensure feature discriminability, another two KCMs are further deployed for feature cycle constructions. With cycle construction, our method can learn effective neutral features for visible and infrared images while preserving their salient semantics. Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets validate the merits of CycleTrans against a flurry of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, $+1.88\%$ on rank-1 in SYSU-MM01 and $+1.1\%$ on rank-1 in RegDB.

  abstract     = {Multiobject tracking (MOT) is a fundamental problem in computer vision with numerous applications, such as intelligent surveillance and automated driving. Despite the significant progress made in MOT, pedestrian attributes, such as gender, hairstyle, body shape, and clothing features, which contain rich and high-level information, have been less explored. To address this gap, we propose a simple, effective, and generic method to predict pedestrian attributes to support general reidentification (Re-ID) embedding. We first introduce attribute multi-object tracking (AttMOT), a large, highly enriched synthetic dataset for pedestrian tracking, containing over 80k frames and six million pedestrian identity switches (IDs) with different times, weather conditions, and scenarios. To the best of authors’ knowledge, AttMOT is the first MOT dataset with semantic attributes. Subsequently, we explore different approaches to fuse Re-ID embedding and pedestrian attributes, including attention mechanisms, which we hope will stimulate the development of attribute-assisted MOT. The proposed method attribute-assisted method (AAM) demonstrates its effectiveness and generality on several representative pedestrian MOT benchmarks, including MOT17 and MOT20, through experiments on the AttMOT dataset. When applied to the state-of-the-art trackers, AAM achieves consistent improvements in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA), higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA), association accuracy (AssA), IDs, and IDF1 scores. For instance, on MOT17, the proposed method yields a +1.1 MOTA, +1.7 HOTA, and +1.8 IDF1 improvement when used with FairMOT. To further encourage related research, we release the data and code at https://github.com/HengLan/AttMOT.},

However, optimal performance will be reduced by this multistep procedure since it cannot unify graph learning with partition generation closely. In this article, we propose a one-step multiview clustering method through adaptive graph learning and spectral rotation (AGLSR). For every view, AGLSR adaptively learns affinity graphs to capture similar relationships of samples. Then, a spectral embedding is designed to take advantage of the potential feature space shared by different views. In addition, AGLSR utilizes a spectral rotation strategy to obtain the discrete clustering labels from the learned spectral embeddings directly. An effective updating algorithm with proven convergence is derived to optimize the optimization problem. Sufficient experiments on benchmark datasets have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in six metrics.

In this article, we propose a method called local–global geometric information and view complementarity introduced multiview metric learning (GIVCMML). Our method effectively exploits the geometric information of multiview samples. The learned metric space retains the geometric relations of samples and makes them more separable. First, we propose the global geometrical constraint in the maximum margin criterion framework. By maximizing the distance between class centers in the metric space, we ensure that samples from different classes are well separated. Second, to maintain the manifold structure of the original space, we build an adjacency matrix that contains the sample label information. This helps explore the local geometric information of sample pairs. Finally, to better mine the complementary information of multiview samples, GIVCMML maximizes the correlation between each view in the metric space. This enables each view to adaptively learn from the others and explore the complementary information between views. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our method on real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that GIVCMML achieves competitive performance compared with multiview metric learning (MvML) methods.},

Existing approaches to this problem typically require a complex controller structure due to adopting an identifier-actor–critic framework and prescribed performance cannot be guaranteed. In this work, an adaptive critic learning (ACL)-based optimal bipartite consensus scheme is developed to bridge the gap. A newly designed error scaling function, which defines the user-predefined settling time and steady accuracy without relying on the initial conditions, is then integrated into a cost function. The backstepping framework combines the ACL and integral reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm to develop the adaptive optimal bipartite consensus scheme, which contributes a critic-only controller structure by removing the identifier and actor networks in the existing methods. The adaptive law of the critic network is derived by the gradient descent algorithm and experience replay to minimize the IRL-based residual error. It is shown that a compute-saving learning mechanism can achieve the optimal consensus, and the error variables of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Besides, in any bounded initial condition, the evolution of bipartite consensus is limited to a user-prescribed boundary under bounded initial conditions. The illustrative simulation results validate the efficacy of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Unknown domain shift caused by the unavailability of target domain during training phase degrades the performance of intelligent fault diagnosis models in practical applications. Domain generalization (DG)-based methods have recently emerged to alleviate the influence of domain shift and improve the generalization ability of models toward invisible working conditions. However, most existing studies are conducted on multiple fully labeled source domains. Meanwhile, domain-specific information related to the variations of working conditions is often neglected during model training. Therefore, in order to realize reliable generalization fault diagnosis based on partially labeled source domains, this article proposes a contrast-assisted domain-specificity-removal network (CDSRN) to extract transferable features from domain-specificity-removal perspective. Concretely, a domain-specific feature removal branch is designed to disentangle domain-invariant features and domain-specific features, thus excavating generalized information only in domain-invariance dimension. Simultaneously, proxy-contrastive representation enhancement module is embedded to facilitate the fault class-discriminative and domain-discriminative feature learning, thereby assisting the model in further improvement of generalization capability. Experimental studies confirm the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed CDSRN in semi-supervised generalization fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made great breakthroughs and seen applications in many domains. However, the incomparable accuracy of DNNs is achieved with the cost of considerable memory consumption and high computational complexity, which restricts their deployment on conventional desktops and portable devices. To address this issue, low-rank factorization, which decomposes the neural network parameters into smaller sized matrices or tensors, has emerged as a promising technique for network compression. In this article, we propose leveraging the emerging tensor ring (TR) factorization to compress the neural network. We investigate the impact of both parameter tensor reshaping and TR decomposition (TRD) on the total number of compressed parameters. To achieve the maximal parameter compression, we propose an algorithm based on prime factorization that simultaneously identifies the optimal tensor reshaping and TRD. In addition, we discover that different execution orders of the core tensors result in varying computational complexities. To identify the optimal execution order, we construct a novel tree structure. Based on this structure, we propose a top-to-bottom splitting algorithm to schedule the execution of core tensors, thereby minimizing computational complexity. We have performed extensive experiments using three kinds of neural networks with three different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the three state-of-the-art algorithms for low-rank factorization, our algorithm can achieve better performance with much lower memory consumption and lower computational complexity.},

Given the vehicle’s dynamical model, a critical (and open) question is how to judiciously merge the model-based optimality conditions into the model-free RL framework for improved efficiency and generalization, for which this work provides some positive results. Specifically, we discretize the continuous action space by leveraging analytic optimality conditions for the minimum-time optimization problem via Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP). This allows us to develop a novel discrete PMP-based RL trajectory planning algorithm, which learns a planning policy faster than those based on a continuous action space. Simulation results: 1) validate the effectiveness of the PMP-based RL algorithm and 2) demonstrate its advantages, in terms of both learning efficiency and the vehicle’s exploration time, over two baseline methods for continuous control inputs.},

However, this approach requires substantial computational resources to perform numerous fitness function evaluations, which poses challenges for high-dimensional optimization in particular. This study introduces a novel nonconvex optimization algorithm, the niching-based gradient-directed evolution (NGDE) algorithm, designed specifically for high-dimensional nonconvex optimization. The NGDE algorithm generates potential solutions and divides them into multiple niches to explore distinct areas within the feasible region. Subsequently, each individual creates candidate offspring using the gradient-directed mutation operator we designed. The convergence properties of the NGDE algorithm are investigated in two scenarios: accessing the full gradient and approximating the gradient with mini-batch samples. The experimental studies demonstrate the superior performance of the NGDE algorithm in minimizing multimodal optimization functions.

  abstract     = {Many research works have shown that the traditional alternating direction multiplier methods (ADMMs) can be better understood by continuous-time differential equations (DEs). On the other hand, many unfolded algorithms directly inherit the traditional iterations to build deep networks. Although they achieve superior practical performance and a faster convergence rate than traditional counterparts, there is a lack of clear insight into unfolded network structures. Thus, we attempt to explore the unfolded linearized ADMM (LADMM) from the perspective of DEs, and design more efficient unfolded networks. First, by proposing an unfolded Euler LADMM scheme and inspired by the trapezoid discretization, we design a new more accurate Trapezoid LADMM scheme. For the convenience of implementation, we provide its explicit version via a prediction–correction strategy. Then, to expand the representation space of unfolded networks, we design an accelerated variant of our Euler LADMM scheme, which can be interpreted as second-order DEs with stronger representation capabilities. To fully explore this representation space, we designed an accelerated Trapezoid LADMM scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore a comprehensive connection with theoretical guarantees between unfolded ADMMs and first- (second-) order DEs. Finally, we instantiate our schemes as (A-)ELADMM and (A-)TLADMM with the proximal operators, and (A-)ELADMM-Net and (A-)TLADMM-Net with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Extensive inverse problem experiments show that our Trapezoid LADMM schemes perform better than well-known methods.},

  abstract     = {Opponent modeling has proven effective in enhancing the decision-making of the controlled agent by constructing models of opponent agents. However, existing methods often rely on access to the observations and actions of opponents, a requirement that is infeasible when such information is either unobservable or challenging to obtain. To address this issue, we introduce distributional opponent-aided multiagent actor–critic (DOMAC), the first speculative opponent modeling algorithm that relies solely on local information (i.e., the controlled agent’s observations, actions, and rewards). Specifically, the actor maintains a speculated belief about the opponents using the tailored speculative opponent models that predict the opponents’ actions using only local information. Moreover, DOMAC features distributional critic models that estimate the return distribution of the actor’s policy, yielding a more fine-grained assessment of the actor’s quality. This thus more effectively guides the training of the speculative opponent models that the actor depends upon. Furthermore, we formally derive a policy gradient theorem with the proposed opponent models. Extensive experiments under eight different challenging multiagent benchmark tasks within the MPE, Pommerman, and starcraft multiagent challenge (SMAC) demonstrate that our DOMAC successfully models opponents’ behaviors and delivers superior performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with a faster convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Multilabel feature selection solves the dimension distress of high-dimensional multilabel data by selecting the optimal subset of features. Noisy and incomplete labels of raw multilabel data hinder the acquisition of label-guided information. In existing approaches, mapping the label space to a low-dimensional latent space by semantic decomposition to mitigate label noise is considered an effective strategy. However, the decomposed latent label space contains redundant label information, which misleads the capture of potential label relevance. To eliminate the effect of redundant information on the extraction of latent label correlations, a novel method named SLOFS via shared latent sublabel structure and simultaneous orthogonal basis clustering for multilabel feature selection is proposed. First, a latent orthogonal base structure shared (LOBSS) term is engineered to guide the construction of a redundancy-free latent sublabel space via the separated latent clustering center structure. The LOBSS term simultaneously retains latent sublabel information and latent clustering center structure. Moreover, the structure and relevance information of nonredundant latent sublabels are fully explored. The introduction of graph regularization ensures structural consistency in the data space and latent sublabels, thus helping the feature selection process. SLOFS employs a dynamic sublabel graph to obtain a high-quality sublabel space and uses regularization to constrain label correlations on dynamic sublabel projections. Finally, an effective convergence provable optimization scheme is proposed to solve the SLOFS method. The experimental studies on the 18 datasets demonstrate that the presented method performs consistently better than previous feature selection methods.},

  abstract     = {As a building block of knowledge acquisition, knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims at inferring missing facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) automatically. Previous studies mainly focus on graph convolutional network (GCN)-based KG embedding (KGE) to determine the representations of entities and relations, accordingly predicting missing triplets. However, most existing KGE methods suffer from limitations in predicting tail entities that are far away or even unreachable in KGs. This limitation can be attributed to the related high-order information being largely ignored. In this work, we focus on learning the information from the related high-order neighbors in KGs to improve the performance of prediction. Specifically, we first introduce a set of new nodes called pedalnodes to augment the KGs for facilitating message passing between related high-order entities, effectively injecting the information of high-order neighbors into entity representation. Additionally, we propose strength-guided graph neural networks to aggregate neighboring entity representations. To address the issue of transmitting irrelevant higher order information to entities through pedal nodes, which can potentially hurt entity representation, we further propose to dynamically integrate the aggregated representation of each node with its corresponding self-representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to strong baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Real-world datasets are often imbalanced, posing frequent challenges to canonical machine learning algorithms that assume a balanced class distribution. Moreover, the imbalance problem becomes more complicated when the dataset is multiclass. Although many approaches have been presented for imbalanced learning (IL), research on the multiclass imbalanced problem is relatively limited and deficient. To alleviate these issues, we propose a forest of evolutionary hierarchical classifiers (FEHC) method for multiclass IL (MCIL). FEHC can be seen as a classifier fusion framework with a forest structure, and it aggregates several evolutionary hierarchical multiclassifiers (EHMCs) to reduce generalization error. Specifically, a multichromosome genetic algorithm (MCGA) is designed to simultaneously select (sub)optimal features, classifiers, and hierarchical structures when generating these EHMCs. The MCGA adopts a dynamic weighting module to learn difficult classes and promote the diversity of FEHC. We also present the “stratified underbagging” (SUB) strategy to address class imbalance and the “soft tree traversal” (STT) strategy to make FEHC converge faster and better. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed algorithm using 14 multiclass imbalanced datasets with various properties. Compared with popular and state-of-the-art approaches, FEHC obtains better performance under different evaluation metrics. Codes have been made publicly available on GitHub.1},

As a discrete time-variant problem, the existing solving schemes generally need the theoretical support under the continuous-time framework, and there is no independent solving scheme under the discrete-time framework. The theoretical deficiency of solving scheme greatly limits the theoretical research and practical application of discrete time-variant matrix inequalities. In this article, new discrete-time recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms are proposed, analyzed, and investigated for solving different time-variant matrix inequalities under the discrete-time framework, including discrete time-variant matrix vector inequality (discrete time-variant MVI), discrete time-variant generalized matrix inequality (discrete time-variant GMI), discrete time-variant generalized-Sylvester matrix inequality (discrete time-variant GSMI), and discrete time-variant complicated-Sylvester matrix inequality (discrete time-variant CSMI), and all solving processes are based on the direct discretization thought. Specifically, first of all, four discrete time-variant matrix inequalities are presented as the target problems of these researches. Second, for solving such problems, we propose corresponding discrete-time recurrent neural network (RNN) (DT-RNN) algorithms (termed DT-RNN-MVI algorithm, DT-RNN-GMI algorithm, DT-RNN-GSMI algorithm, and DT-RNN-CSMI algorithm), which are different from the traditional DT-RNN design thought because second-order Taylor expansion is applied to derive the DT-RNN algorithms. This creative process avoids the intervention of continuous-time framework. Then, theoretical analyses are presented, which show the convergence and precision of the DT-RNN algorithms. Abundant numerical experiments are further carried out, which further confirm the excellent properties of the DT-RNN algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Interactive semantic segmentation pursues high-quality segmentation results at the cost of a small number of user clicks. It is attracting more and more research attention for its convenience in labeling semantic pixel-level data. Existing interactive segmentation methods often pursue higher interaction efficiency by mining the latent information of user clicks or exploring efficient interaction manners. However, these works neglect to explicitly exploit the semantic correlations between user corrections and model mispredictions, thus suffering from two flaws. First, similar prediction errors frequently occur in actual use, causing users to repeatedly correct them. Second, the interaction difficulty of different semantic classes varies across images, but existing models use monotonic parameters for all images which lack semantic pertinence. Therefore, in this article, we explore the semantic correlations existing in corrections and mispredictions by proposing a simple yet effective online learning solution to the above problems, named correction-misprediction correlation mining (CM2). Specifically, we leverage the correction-misprediction similarities to design a confusion memory module (CMM) for automatic correction when similar prediction errors reappear. Furthermore, we measure the semantic interaction difficulty by counting the correction-misprediction pairs and design a challenge adaptive convolutional layer (CACL), which can adaptively switch different parameters according to interaction difficulties to better segment the challenging classes. Our method requires no extra training besides the online learning process and can effectively improve interaction efficiency. Our proposed CM2 achieves state-of-the-art results on three public semantic segmentation benchmarks.},

However, the inconsistent features for the localization and classification tasks in AOOD models may lead to ambiguity and low-quality object predictions, which constrains the detection performance. In this article, an AOOD method called task-wise sampling convolutions (TS-Conv) is proposed. TS-Conv adaptively samples task-wise features from respective sensitive regions and maps these features together in alignment to guide a dynamic label assignment for better predictions. Specifically, sampling positions of the localization convolution in TS-Conv are supervised by the oriented bounding box (OBB) prediction associated with spatial coordinates, while sampling positions and convolutional kernel of the classification convolution are designed to be adaptively adjusted according to different orientations for improving the orientation robustness of features. Furthermore, a dynamic task-consistent-aware label assignment (DTLA) strategy is developed to select optimal candidate positions and assign labels dynamically according to ranked task-aware scores obtained from TS-Conv. Extensive experiments on several public datasets covering multiple scenes, multimodal images, and multiple categories of objects demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and superior performance of the proposed TS-Conv.},

The first phase equips the agent with machining basics through upper-level policy learning, generating an imitation policy distribution with various decision-making principles.

By looking at RNN processing from a probability density function (pdf) perspective, we are able to show how each layer of the RNN transforms the input distributions to increase detection accuracy. At the same time we also discover a side effect acting to limit the improvement in accuracy.

Its characteristics lead to the ability to describe more complicated problems involving multiple constraints, and strong nonlinear and dynamic features, such as robot manipulator tracking control. Besides, noises are inevitable in practice and thus strong robustness of models solving H3DNES is also necessary. In this work, a multilayered noise-tolerant zeroing neural network (MNTZNN) model is proposed for solving H3DNES. MNTZNN model has strong robustness and it solves H3DNES successfully even when noises exist in both the two layers of H3DNES. In order to develop the MNTZNN model, a new zeroing neural network (ZNN) design formula is proposed. It not only enables equations with respect to solutions to become equations with respect to the second-order derivatives of solutions but also makes the corresponding model have strong robustness. The robustness of the MNTZNN model is proved when parameters in the model satisfy a loose constraint and the error bounds are programmable via setting appropriate parameter values. Finally, the MNTZNN model is applied to the tracking control of the six-link planar robot manipulator and PUMA560 robot manipulator with hybrid nonlinear constraints of joint angle and velocity.},

Among diverse plasticity rules, synaptic scaling presents indispensable effects on homeostasis maintenance and synaptic strength regulation. In the current modeling of brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN), backpropagation through time is widely adopted because it can achieve high performance using a small number of time steps. Nevertheless, the synaptic scaling mechanism has not yet been well touched. In this work, we propose an experience-dependent adaptive synaptic scaling mechanism (AS-SNN) for spiking neural networks. The learning process has two stages: First, in the forward path, adaptive short-term potentiation or depression is triggered for each synapse according to afferent stimuli intensity accumulated by presynaptic historical neural activities. Second, in the backward path, long-term consolidation is executed through gradient signals regulated by the corresponding scaling factor. This mechanism shapes the pattern selectivity of synapses and the information transfer they mediate. We theoretically prove that the proposed adaptive synaptic scaling function follows a contraction map and finally converges to an expected fixed point, in accordance with state-of-the-art results in three tasks on perturbation resistance, continual learning, and graph learning. Specifically, for the perturbation resistance and continual learning tasks, our approach improves the accuracy on the N-MNIST benchmark over the baseline by 44% and 25%, respectively. An expected firing rate callback and sparse coding can be observed in graph learning. Extensive experiments on ablation study and cost evaluation evidence the effectiveness and efficiency of our nonparametric adaptive scaling method, which demonstrates the great potential of SNN in continual learning and robust learning.},

  abstract     = {Spectral super-resolution has attracted the attention of more researchers for obtaining hyperspectral images (HSIs) in a simpler and cheaper way. Although many convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches have yielded impressive results, most of them ignore the low-rank prior of HSIs resulting in huge computational and storage costs. In addition, the ability of CNN-based methods to capture the correlation of global information is limited by the receptive field. To surmount the problem, we design a novel low-rank tensor reconstruction network (LTRN) for spectral super-resolution. Specifically, we treat the features of HSIs as 3-D tensors with low-rank properties due to their spectral similarity and spatial sparsity. Then, we combine canonical-polyadic (CP) decomposition with neural networks to design an adaptive low-rank prior learning (ALPL) module that enables feature learning in a 1-D space. In this module, there are two core modules: the adaptive vector learning (AVL) module and the multidimensionwise multihead self-attention (MMSA) module. The AVL module is designed to compress an HSI into a 1-D space by using a vector to represent its information. The MMSA module is introduced to improve the ability to capture the long-range dependencies in the row, column, and spectral dimensions, respectively. Finally, our LTRN, mainly cascaded by several ALPL modules and feedforward networks (FFNs), achieves high-quality spectral super-resolution with fewer parameters. To test the effect of our method, we conduct experiments on two datasets: the CAVE dataset and the Harvard dataset. Experimental results show that our LTRN not only is as effective as state-of-the-art methods but also has fewer parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/renweidian/LTRN.},

  abstract     = {Real-time safety assessment (RTSA) of dynamic systems holds substantial implications across diverse fields, including industrial and electronic applications. However, the complexity and rapid flow nature of data streams, coupled with the expensive label cost and pose significant challenges. To address these issues, a novel confusion-based learning framework, termed confusion-and-detection method plus (CADM+), is proposed in this article. When drift occurs, the model is updated with uncertain samples, which may cause confusion between existing and new concepts, resulting in performance differences. The cosine similarity is used to measure the degree of such conceptual confusion in the model. Furthermore, the change of standard deviation within a fixed-size cosine similarity window is introduced as an indicator for drift detection. Theoretical demonstrations show the asymptotic increase of cosine similarity. In addition, the approximate independence of the change in standard deviation with the number of trained samples is indicated. Finally, the extreme value theory (EVT) is applied to determine the threshold of judging drifts. Several experiments are conducted to verify its effectiveness. Experimental results prove that the proposed framework is more suitable for RTSA tasks compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are attracting widespread interest due to their biological plausibility, energy efficiency, and powerful spatiotemporal information representation ability. Given the critical role of attention mechanisms in enhancing neural network performance, the integration of SNNs and attention mechanisms exhibits tremendous potential to deliver energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. In this article, we present a novel temporal-channel joint attention mechanism for SNNs, referred to as TCJA-SNN. The proposed TCJA-SNN framework can effectively assess the significance of spike sequence from both spatial and temporal dimensions. More specifically, our essential technical contribution lies on: 1) we employ the squeeze operation to compress the spike stream into an average matrix. Then, we leverage two local attention mechanisms based on efficient 1-D convolutions to facilitate comprehensive feature extraction at the temporal and channel levels independently and 2) we introduce the cross-convolutional fusion (CCF) layer as a novel approach to model the interdependencies between the temporal and channel scopes. This layer effectively breaks the independence of these two dimensions and enables the interaction between features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TCJA-SNN outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on all standard static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech 101, and DVS128 Gesture. Furthermore, we effectively apply the TCJA-SNN framework to image generation tasks by leveraging a variation autoencoder. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first instance where the SNN-attention mechanism has been employed for high-level classification and low-level generation tasks.

To handle this problem, we propose a novel framework to Excavate All-round Information Beyond Color for the task of text-based person retrieval, which is therefore termed EAIBC. The EAIBC architecture includes four branches, namely an RGB branch, a grayscale (GRS) branch, a high-frequency (HFQ) branch, and a CLR branch. Furthermore, we introduce a mutual learning (ML) mechanism to facilitate communication and learning among the branches, enabling them to take full advantage of all-round information in an effective and balanced manner. We evaluate the proposed method on three benchmark datasets, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid. The experimental results demonstrate that EAIBC significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supervised, weakly supervised, and cross-domain settings.},

  abstract     = {Most existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM) to extract coarse class-specific localization maps using image-level labels. Prior works have commonly used an off-line heuristic thresholding process that combines the CAM maps with off-the-shelf saliency maps produced by a general pretrained saliency model to produce more accurate pseudo-segmentation labels. We propose AuxSegNet+, a weakly supervised auxiliary learning framework to explore the rich information from these saliency maps and the significant intertask correlation between saliency detection and semantic segmentation. In the proposed AuxSegNet+, saliency detection and multilabel image classification are used as auxiliary tasks to improve the primary task of semantic segmentation with only image-level ground-truth labels. We also propose a cross-task affinity learning mechanism to learn pixel-level affinities from the saliency and segmentation feature maps. In particular, we propose a cross-task dual-affinity learning module to learn both pairwise and unary affinities, which are used to enhance the task-specific features and predictions by aggregating both query-dependent and query-independent global context for both saliency detection and semantic segmentation. The learned cross-task pairwise affinity can also be used to refine and propagate CAM maps to provide better pseudo labels for both tasks. Iterative improvement of segmentation performance is enabled by cross-task affinity learning and pseudo-label updating. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with new state-of-the-art WSSS results on the challenging PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks.},

HyperGNNs follow either a spectral or a spatial approach, in which a convolution or message-passing operation is conducted based on a hypergraph algebraic descriptor. While many HyperGNNs have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance on broad applications, there have been limited attempts at exploring high-dimensional hypergraph descriptors (tensors) and joint node interactions carried by hyperedges. In this article, we depart from hypergraph matrix representations and present a new tensor-HyperGNN (T-HyperGNN) framework with cross-node interactions (CNIs). The T-HyperGNN framework consists of T-spectral convolution, T-spatial convolution, and T-message-passing HyperGNNs (T-MPHN). The T-spectral convolution HyperGNN is defined under the t-product algebra that closely connects to the spectral space. To improve computational efficiency for large hypergraphs, we localize the T-spectral convolution approach to formulate the T-spatial convolution and further devise a novel tensor-message-passing algorithm for practical implementation by studying a compressed adjacency tensor representation. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our T-HyperGNNs preserve intrinsic high-order network structures without any hypergraph reduction and model the joint effects of nodes through a CNI layer. These advantages of our T-HyperGNNs are demonstrated in a wide range of real-world hypergraph datasets. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/wangfuli/T-HyperGNNs.git.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of the 3-D texture is indispensable for various tasks, such as retrieval, segmentation, classification, and inspection of sculptures, knit fabrics, and biological tissues. A 3-D texture represents a locally repeated surface variation (SV) that is independent of the overall shape of the surface and can be determined using the local neighborhood and its characteristics. Existing methods mostly employ computer vision techniques that analyze a 3-D mesh globally, derive features, and then utilize them for classification or retrieval tasks. While several traditional and learning-based methods have been proposed in the literature, only a few have addressed 3-D texture analysis, and none have considered unsupervised schemes so far. This article proposes an original framework for the unsupervised segmentation of 3-D texture on the mesh manifold. The problem is approached as a binary surface segmentation task, where the mesh surface is partitioned into textured and nontextured regions without prior annotation. The proposed method comprises a mutual transformer-based system consisting of a label generator (LG) and a label cleaner (LC). Both models take geometric image representations of the surface mesh facets and label them as texture or nontexture using an iterative mutual learning scheme. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets with diverse texture patterns demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms standard and state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques and performs reasonably well compared to supervised methods.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) aims to address the transfer learning problems where the source domain and target domain are represented by heterogeneous features. The existing HDA methods based on matrix factorization have been proven to learn transferable features effectively. However, these methods only preserve the original neighbor structure of samples in each domain and do not use the label information to explore the similarity and separability between samples. This would not eliminate the cross-domain bias of samples and may mix cross-domain samples of different classes in the common subspace, misleading the discriminative feature learning of target samples. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel matrix factorization-based HDA method called HDA with generalized similarity and dissimilarity regularization (HGSDR). Specifically, we propose a similarity regularizer by establishing the cross-domain Laplacian graph with label information to explore the similarity between cross-domain samples from the identical class. And we propose a dissimilarity regularizer based on the inner product strategy to expand the separability of cross-domain labeled samples from different classes. For unlabeled target samples, we keep their neighbor relationship to preserve the similarity and separability between them in the original space. Hence, the generalized similarity and dissimilarity regularization is built by integrating the above regularizers to facilitate cross-domain samples to form discriminative class distributions. HGSDR can more efficiently match the distributions of the two domains both from the global and sample viewpoints, thereby learning discriminative features for target samples. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The quantization of synaptic weights using emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices has emerged as a promising solution to implement computationally efficient neural networks on resource constrained hardware. However, the practical implementation of such synaptic weights is hampered by the imperfect memory characteristics, specifically the availability of limited number of quantized states and the presence of large intrinsic device variation and stochasticity involved in writing the synaptic states. This article presents ON-chip training and inference of a neural network using quantized magnetic domain wall (DW)-based synaptic array and CMOS peripheral circuits. A rigorous model of the magnetic DW device considering stochasticity and process variations has been utilized for the synapse. To achieve stable quantized weights, DW pinning has been achieved by means of physical constrictions. Finally, VGG8 architecture for CIFAR-10 image classification has been simulated by using the extracted synaptic device characteristics. The performance in terms of accuracy, energy, latency, and area consumption has been evaluated while considering the process variations and nonidealities in the DW device as well as the peripheral circuits. The proposed quantized neural network (QNN) architecture achieves efficient ON-chip learning with 92.4% and 90.4% training and inference accuracy, respectively. In comparison to pure CMOS-based design, it demonstrates an overall improvement in area, energy, and latency by $13.8\times $ , $9.6\times $ , and $3.5\times $ , respectively.},

  abstract     = {The training process of a domain generalization (DG) model involves utilizing one or more interrelated source domains to attain optimal performance on an unseen target domain. Existing DG methods often use auxiliary networks or require high computational costs to improve the model’s generalization ability by incorporating a diverse set of source domains. In contrast, this work proposes a method called Smooth-Guided Implicit Data Augmentation (SGIDA) that operates in the feature space to capture the diversity of source domains. To amplify the model’s generalization capacity, a distance metric learning (DML) loss function is incorporated. Additionally, rather than depending on deep features, the suggested approach employs logits produced from cross entropy (CE) losses with infinite augmentations. A theoretical analysis shows that logits are effective in estimating distances defined on original features, and the proposed approach is thoroughly analyzed to provide a better understanding of why logits are beneficial for DG. Moreover, to increase the diversity of the source domain, a sampling-based method called smooth is introduced to obtain semantic directions from interclass relations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on widely used DG, object detection, and remote sensing datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods across various backbone networks.},

In this article, we elicit relational and factual knowledge from large pretrained language models (PLMs) for few-shot RE (FSRE) with prompting techniques. Concretely, we automatically generate a diverse set of natural language templates and modulate PLM’s behavior through these prompts for FSRE. To mitigate the template bias which leads to unstableness of few-shot learning, we propose a simple yet effective template regularization network (TRN) to prevent deep networks from over-fitting uncertain templates and thus stabilize the FSRE models. TRN alleviates the template bias with three mechanisms: 1) an attention mechanism over mini-batch to weight each template; 2) a ranking regularization mechanism to regularize the attention weights and constrain the importance of uncertain templates; and 3) a template calibration module with two calibrating techniques to modify the uncertain templates in the lowest-ranked group. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (i.e., FewRel and NYT) show that our model has robust superiority over strong competitors.

  abstract     = {Neural networks are developed to model the behavior of the brain. One crucial question in this field pertains to when and how a neural network can memorize a given set of patterns. There are two mechanisms to store information: associative memory and sequential pattern recognition. In the case of associative memory, the neural network operates with dynamical attractors that are point attractors, each corresponding to one of the patterns to be stored within the network. In contrast, sequential pattern recognition involves the network memorizing a set of patterns and subsequently retrieving them in a specific order over time. From a dynamical perspective, this corresponds to the presence of a continuous attractor or a cyclic attractor composed of the sequence of patterns stored within the network in a given order. Evidence suggests that the brain is capable of simultaneously performing both associative memory and sequential pattern recognition. Therefore, these types of attractors coexist within the neural network, signifying that some patterns are stored as point attractors, while others are stored as continuous or cyclic attractors. This article investigates the coexistence of cyclic attractors and continuous or point attractors in certain nonlinear neural networks, enabling the simultaneous emergence of various memory mechanisms. By selectively grouping neurons, conditions are established for the existence of cyclic attractors, continuous attractors, and point attractors, respectively. Furthermore, each attractor is explicitly represented, and a competitive dynamic emerges among these coexisting attractors, primarily regulated by adjustments to external inputs.},

To address this issue, many accelerated algorithms, especially anchor graph-based methods and indicator learning-based methods, have been developed and made a great success. Nevertheless, since the restrictions of the optimization strategy, these accelerated methods still need to approximate the discrete graph-cutting problem to a continuous spectral embedding problem and utilize different discretization strategies to obtain discrete sample categories. To avoid the loss of effectiveness and efficiency caused by the approximation and discretization, we establish a discrete fast multiview anchor graph clustering (FMAGC) model that first constructs an anchor graph of each view and then generates a discrete cluster indicator matrix by solving the discrete multiview graph-cutting problem directly. Since the gradient descent-based method makes it hard to solve this discrete model, we propose a fast coordinate descent-based optimization strategy with linear complexity to solve it without approximating it as a continuous one. Extensive experiments on widely used normal and large-scale multiview datasets show that FMAGC can improve clustering effectiveness and efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted significant attention for their energy-efficient and brain-inspired event-driven properties. Recent advancements, notably Spiking-YOLO, have enabled SNNs to undertake advanced object detection tasks. Nevertheless, these methods often suffer from increased latency and diminished detection accuracy, rendering them less suitable for latency-sensitive mobile platforms. Additionally, the conversion of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs frequently compromises the integrity of the ANNs’ structure, resulting in poor feature representation and heightened conversion errors. To address the issues of high latency and low detection accuracy, we introduce two solutions: timestep compression and spike-time-dependent integrated (STDI) coding. Timestep compression effectively reduces the number of timesteps required in the ANN-to-SNN conversion by condensing information. The STDI coding employs a time-varying threshold to augment information capacity. Furthermore, we have developed an SNN-based spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) structure, optimized to preserve the network’s structural efficacy during conversion. Utilizing these approaches, we present the ultralow latency and highly accurate object detection model, SUHD. SUHD exhibits exceptional performance on challenging datasets like PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, achieving a remarkable reduction of approximately 750 times in timesteps and a 30% enhancement in mean average precision (mAP) compared to Spiking-YOLO on MS COCO. To the best of our knowledge, SUHD is currently the deepest spike-based object detection model, achieving ultralow timesteps for lossless conversion.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of deep learning (DL), the task of multimodal dialog emotion recognition (MDER) has recently received extensive research attention, which is also an essential branch of DL. The MDER aims to identify the emotional information contained in different modalities, e.g., text, video, and audio, and in different dialog scenes. However, the existing research has focused on modeling contextual semantic information and dialog relations between speakers while ignoring the impact of event relations on emotion. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel dialog and event relation-aware graph convolutional neural network (DER-GCN) for multimodal emotion recognition method. It models dialog relations between speakers and captures latent event relations information. Specifically, we construct a weighted multirelationship graph to simultaneously capture the dependencies between speakers and event relations in a dialog. Moreover, we also introduce a self-supervised masked graph autoencoder (SMGAE) to improve the fusion representation ability of features and structures. Next, we design a new multiple information Transformer (MIT) to capture the correlation between different relations, which can provide a better fuse of the multivariate information between relations. Finally, we propose a loss optimization strategy based on contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning ability of minority class features. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets, Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) and Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD), which verify the effectiveness of the DER-GCN model. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves both the average accuracy and the $F1$ value of emotion recognition.

To this end, a novel multiview framework, called parameter-free multiview $k$ -means clustering with coordinate descent method (PFMVKM), is presented to address the above problems. Specifically, PFMVKM is completely parameter-free and learns the weights via a self-weighted scheme, which can avoid the intractable process of hyper-parameters tuning. Moreover, our model is capable of directly calculating the cluster indicator matrix, with no need to learn the cluster centroid matrix and the indicator matrix simultaneously as previous multiview methods have to do. What’s more, we propose an efficient optimization algorithm utilizing the idea of coordinate descent, which can not only reduce the computational complexity but also improve the clustering performance.

On the other hand, these models must be discrete in time, given their practical implementation in computer systems, requiring their versatile utilization across arbitrary time scales. Hence, the goal of this research is to model and investigate the architecture design of a delayed RNN using delayed differential equations on a time scale. Internal memory can be utilized to describe the calculation of the future states using discrete and distributed delays, which is a representation of the deep learning architecture for artificial RNNs. We focus on qualitative behavior and stability study of the system. Special attention is paid to taking into account the effect of the time-scale parameters on neural network dynamics. Here, we delve into the exploration of exponential stability in RNN models on a time scale that incorporates multiple discrete and distributed delays. Two approaches for constructing exponential estimates, including the Hilger and the usual exponential functions, are considered and compared. The Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L–K) functional method is employed to study stability on a time scale in both cases. The established stability criteria, resulting in an exponential-like estimate, utilizes a tuple of positive definite matrices, decay rate, and graininess of the time scale. The models of RNNs for the two-neuron network with four discrete and distributed delays, as well as the ring lattice delayed network of seven identical neurons, are numerically investigated. The results indicate how the time scale (graininess) and model characteristics (weights) influence the qualitative behavior, leading to a transition from stable focus to quasiperiodic limit cycles.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the pharmacological activity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties of molecules is a central task in drug discovery. Existing machine learning methods are transferred from one resource rich molecular property to another data scarce property in the same scaffold dataset. However, existing models may produce fragile and highly uncertain predictions for new scaffold molecules. And these models were tested on different benchmarks, which seriously affected the quality of their evaluation results. In this article, we introduce Meta-MolNet, a collection of data benchmark and algorithms, which is a standard benchmark platform for measuring model generalization and uncertainty quantification capabilities. Meta-MolNet manages a wide range of molecular datasets with high ratio of molecules/scaffolds, which often leads to more difficult data shift and generalization problems. Furthermore, we propose a graph attention network based on cross-domain meta-learning, Meta-GAT, which uses bilevel optimization to learn meta-knowledge from the scaffold family molecular dataset in the source domain. Meta-GAT benefits from meta-knowledge that reduces the requirement of sample complexity to enable reliable predictions of new scaffold molecules in the target domain through internal iteration of a few examples. We evaluate existing methods as baselines for the community, and the Meta-MolNet benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of measuring the proposed algorithm in domain generalization and uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Meta-GAT model has state-of-the-art domain generalization performance and robustly estimates uncertainty under few examples constraints. By publishing AI-ready data, evaluation frameworks, and baseline results, we hope to see the Meta-MolNet suite become a comprehensive resource for the AI-assisted drug discovery community.

  abstract     = {Options, the temporally extended courses of actions that can be taken at varying time scale, have provided a concrete, key framework for learning levels of temporal abstraction in hierarchical tasks. While methods of learning options end-to-end is well researched, how to explore good options and actions simultaneously is still challenging. We address this issue by maximizing reward augmented with entropies of both option and action selection policy in options learning. To this end, we reveal our novel optimization objective by reformulating options learning from perspective of probabilistic inference and propose a soft options iteration method to guarantee convergence to the optimum. In implementation, we propose an off-policy algorithm called the maximum-entropy options critic (MEOC) and evaluate it on series of continuous control benchmarks. Comparative results demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in efficiency and final result on most benchmarks, and the performance exhibits superiority and robustness especially on complex tasks. Ablated studies further explain that entropy maximization on hierarchical exploration promotes learning performance through efficient options specialization and multimodality in action level.},

  abstract     = {Six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) object pose estimation is a crucial task for virtual reality and accurate robotic manipulation. Category-level 6DoF pose estimation has recently become popular as it improves generalization to a complete category of objects. However, current methods focus on data-driven differential learning, which makes them highly dependent on the quality of the real-world labeled data and limits their ability to generalize to unseen objects. To address this problem, we propose multi-hypothesis (MH) consistency learning (MH6D) for category-level 6-D object pose estimation without using real-world training data. MH6D uses a parallel consistency learning structure, alleviating the uncertainty problem of single-shot feature extraction and promoting self-adaptation of domain to reduce the synthetic-to-real domain gap. Specifically, three randomly sampled pose transformations are first performed in parallel on the input point cloud. An attention-guided category-level 6-D pose estimation network with channel attention (CA) and global feature cross-attention (GFCA) modules is then proposed to estimate the three hypothesized 6-D object poses by extracting and fusing the global and local features effectively. Finally, we propose a novel loss function that considers both the process and the final result information allowing MH6D to perform robust consistency learning. We conduct experiments under two different training data settings (i.e., only synthetic data and synthetic and real-world data) to verify the generalization ability of MH6D. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MH6D achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming most data-driven methods even without using any real-world data.

  abstract     = {Dataset scaling, a.k.a. normalization, is an essential preprocessing step in a machine learning (ML) pipeline. It aims to adjust the scale of attributes in a way that they all vary within the same range. This transformation is known to improve the performance of classification models. Still, there are several scaling techniques (STs) to choose from, and no ST is guaranteed to be the best for a dataset regardless of the classifier chosen. It is thus a problem- and classifier-dependent decision. Furthermore, there can be a huge difference in performance when selecting the wrong technique; hence, it should not be neglected. That said, the trial-and-error process of finding the most suitable technique for a particular dataset can be unfeasible. As an alternative, we propose the Meta-scaler, which uses meta-learning (MtL) to build meta-models to automatically select the best ST for a given dataset and classification algorithm. The meta-models learn to represent the relationship between meta-features extracted from the datasets and the performance of specific classification algorithms on these datasets when scaled with different techniques. Our experiments using 12 base classifiers, 300 datasets, and five STs demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. When using the ST selected by the Meta-scaler for each dataset, 10 of 12 base models tested achieved statistically significantly better classification performance than any fixed choice of a single ST. The Meta-scaler also outperforms state-of-the-art MtL approaches for ST selection.

This study demonstrates that the FTB of neural networks with hybrid impulses can be maintained, even in the presence of impulsive perturbations. And for a system that is not FTB due to impulsive perturbations, achieving FTB is possible through the implementation of appropriate impulsive control and optimization of the average impulsive intervals. In addition, to validate the practicality of our results, three illustrative examples are provided. In the end, these theoretical findings are successfully applied to image encryption.},

In this article, we propose a neural heuristic based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the traditional and improved VRPB variants, with an encoder–decoder structured policy network trained to sequentially construct the routes for vehicles. Specifically, we first describe the VRPB based on a graph and cast the solution construction as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, to identify the relationship among the nodes (i.e., linehaul and backhaul customers, and the depot), we design a two-stage attention-based encoder, including a self-attention and a heterogeneous attention for each stage, which could yield more informative representations of the nodes so as to deliver high-quality solutions. The evaluation on the two VRPB variants reveals that, our neural heuristic performs favorably against both the conventional and neural heuristic baselines on randomly generated instances and benchmark instances. Moreover, the trained policy network exhibits a desirable capability of generalization to various problem sizes and distributions.},

To fill this gap, we propose the introduction of two novel ordinal–hierarchical DL methodologies, namely, the hierarchical cumulative link model (HCLM) and hierarchical–ordinal binary decomposition (HOBD), which are able to model the ordinal structure within different hierarchical levels of the labels. In particular, we decompose the hierarchical–ordinal problem into local and global graph paths that may encode an ordinal constraint for each hierarchical level. Thus, we frame this problem as simultaneously minimizing global and local losses. Furthermore, the ordinal constraints are set by two approaches [ordinal binary decomposition (OBD) and cumulative link model (CLM)] within each global and local function. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is measured on four real-use case datasets concerning industrial, biomedical, computer vision, and financial domains. The extracted results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement to state-of-the-art nominal, ordinal, and hierarchical approaches.},

  abstract     = {Generating virtual organ populations that capture sufficient variability while remaining plausible is essential to conduct in silico trials (ISTs) of medical devices. However, not all anatomical shapes of interest are always available for each individual in a population. The imaging examinations and modalities used can vary between subjects depending on their individualized clinical pathways. Different imaging modalities may have various fields of view and are sensitive to signals from other tissues/organs, or both. Hence, missing/partially overlapping anatomical information is often available across individuals. We introduce a generative shape model for multipart anatomical structures, learnable from sets of unpaired datasets, i.e., where each substructure in the shape assembly comes from datasets with missing or partially overlapping substructures from disjoint subjects of the same population. The proposed generative model can synthesize complete multipart shape assemblies coined virtual chimeras (VCs). We applied this framework to build VCs from databases of whole-heart shape assemblies that each contribute samples for heart substructures. Specifically, we propose a graph neural network-based generative shape compositional framework, which comprises two components, a part-aware generative shape model that captures the variability in shape observed for each structure of interest in the training population and a spatial composition network that assembles/composes the structures synthesized by the former into multipart shape assemblies (i.e., VCs). We also propose a novel self-supervised learning scheme that enables the spatial composition network to be trained with partially overlapping data and weak labels. We trained and validated our approach using shapes of cardiac structures derived from cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images in the UK Biobank (UKBB). When trained with complete and partially overlapping data, our approach significantly outperforms a principal component analysis (PCA)-based shape model (trained with complete data) in terms of generalizability and specificity. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method, as the synthesized cardiac virtual populations are more plausible and capture a greater degree of shape variability than those generated by the PCA-based shape model.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to alleviate the domain shift by transferring knowledge learned from a labeled source dataset to an unlabeled target domain. Although UDA has seen promising progress recently, it requires access to data from both domains, making it problematic in source data-absent scenarios. In this article, we investigate a practical task source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) that alleviates the limitations of the widely studied UDA in simultaneously acquiring source and target data. In addition, we further study the imbalanced SFDA (ISFDA) problem, which addresses the intra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift in SFDA. We observe two key issues in SFDA that: 1) target data form clusters in the representation space regardless of whether the target data points are aligned with the source classifier and 2) target samples with higher classification confidence are more reliable and have less variation in their classification confidence during adaptation. Motivated by these observations, we propose a unified method, named intrinsic consistency preservation with adaptively reliable samples (ICPR), to jointly cope with SFDA and ISFDA. Specifically, ICPR first encourages the intrinsic consistency in the predictions of neighbors for unlabeled samples with weak augmentation (standard flip-and-shift), regardless of their reliability. ICPR then generates strongly augmented views specifically for adaptively selected reliable samples and is trained to fix the intrinsic consistency between weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image concerning predictions of neighbors and their own. Additionally, we propose to use a prototype-like classifier to avoid the classification confusion caused by severe intra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift. We demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of ICPR on six benchmarks of both SFDA and ISFDA tasks. The reproducible code of our proposed ICPR method is available at https://github.com/CFM-MSG/Code_ICPR.},

However, existing works usually fix the transform orientation along the third mode and may fail to turn multidimensional low-tubal-rank structure into account. To alleviate these bottlenecks, we introduce two unfolding induced tensor nuclear norms (TNNs) for the tensor completion (TC) problem, which naturally extends tensor tubal rank to high-order data. Specifically, we show how multidimensional low-tubal-rank structure can be captured by utilizing a novel balanced unfolding strategy, upon which two TNNs, namely, overlapped TNN (OTNN) and latent TNN (LTNN), are developed. We also show the immediate relationship between the tubal rank of unfolding tensor and the existing tensor network (TN) rank, e.g., CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank, Tucker rank, and tensor ring (TR) rank, to demonstrate its efficiency and practicality. Two efficient TC models are then proposed with theoretical guarantees by analyzing a unified nonasymptotic upper bound. To solve optimization problems, we develop two alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithms. The proposed models have been demonstrated to exhibit superior performance based on experimental findings involving synthetic and real-world tensors, including facial images, light field images, and video sequences.},

Thus, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is solved to indirectly obtain the approximate optimal neuro-control input. In order to reduce the computation, the communication bandwidth, and the energy consumption, an appropriate self-triggering condition is designed as an alternative way to predict the updating time instants of the approximate optimal neuro-control policy. On the basis of Lyapunov’s direct method, the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system is analyzed and guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results of two practical systems illustrate the present ADP-based self-triggered approximate optimal neuro-control scheme to be reasonable and effective.},

Existing methods for the TVLE still have issues with long computation time and insufficient noise resistance. Zeroing neural network (ZNN) with parallel distribution and interference tolerance traits can mitigate these deficiencies and thus are good candidates for the TVLE. Therefore, a new predefined-time adaptive ZNN (PTAZNN) model is proposed for addressing the TVLE in this article. Unlike previous ZNN models with time-varying parameters, the PTAZNN model adopts a novel error-based adaptive parameter, which makes the convergence process more rapid and avoids unnecessary waste of computational resources caused by large parameters. Moreover, the stability, convergence, and robustness of the PTAZNN model are rigorously analyzed. Two numerical examples reflect that the PTAZNN model possesses shorter convergence time and better robustness compared with several variable-parameter ZNN models. In addition, the PTAZNN model is applied to solve the inverse kinematic solution of UR5 robot on the simulation platform CoppeliaSim, and the results further indicate the feasibility of this model intuitively.},

  abstract     = {The adversarial robustness of a neural network mainly relies on two factors: model capacity and antiperturbation ability. In this article, we study the antiperturbation ability of the network from the feature maps of convolutional layers. Our theoretical analysis discovers that larger convolutional feature maps before average pooling can contribute to better resistance to perturbations, but the conclusion is not true for max pooling. It brings new inspiration to the design of robust neural networks and urges us to apply these findings to improve existing architectures. The proposed modifications are very simple and only require upsampling the inputs or slightly modifying the stride configurations of downsampling operators. We verify our approaches on several benchmark neural network architectures, including AlexNet, VGG, RestNet18, and PreActResNet18. Nontrivial improvements in terms of both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness can be achieved under various attack and defense mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Existing neural heuristics for multiobjective vehicle routing problems (MOVRPs) are primarily conditioned on instance context, which failed to appropriately exploit preference and problem size, thus holding back the performance. To thoroughly unleash the potential, we propose a novel conditional neural heuristic (CNH) that fully leverages the instance context, preference, and size with an encoder–decoder structured policy network. Particularly, in our CNH, we design a dual-attention-based encoder to relate preferences and instance contexts, so as to better capture their joint effect on approximating the exact Pareto front (PF). We also design a size-aware decoder based on the sinusoidal encoding to explicitly incorporate the problem size into the embedding, so that a single trained model could better solve instances of various scales. Besides, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train the neural heuristic by leveraging stochastic preferences (SPs), which further enhances the training performance. Extensive experimental results on random and benchmark instances reveal that our CNH could achieve favorable approximation to the whole PF with higher hypervolume (HV) and lower optimality gap (Gap) than those of the existing neural and conventional heuristics. More importantly, a single trained model of our CNH can outperform other neural heuristics that are exclusively trained on each size. In addition, the effectiveness of the key designs is also verified through ablation studies.},

However, obtaining sufficiently annotated data is expensive and impractical in real settings. It is challenging to achieve accurate localization of target regions in an unsupervised manner. To address this problem, we propose a new unsupervised image retrieval method named unsupervised target region localization (UTRL) descriptors. It can precisely locate target regions without supervisory information or learning. Our method contains three highlights: 1) we propose a novel zero-label transfer learning method to address the problem of co-localization in target regions. This enhances the potential localization ability of pretrained CNN models through a zero-label data-driven approach; 2) we propose a multiscale attention accumulation method to accurately extract distinguishable target features. It distinguishes the importance of features by using local Gaussian weights; and 3) we propose a simple yet effective method to reduce vector dimensionality, named twice-PCA-whitening (TPW), which reduces the performance degradation caused by feature compression. Notably, TPW is a robust and general method that can be widely applied to image retrieval tasks to improve retrieval performance. This work also facilitates the development of image retrieval based on short vector features. Extensive experiments on six popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves about 7% greater mean average precision (mAP) compared to existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.},

  abstract     = {Image deblurring continues to achieve impressive performance with the development of generative models. Nonetheless, there still remains a displeasing problem if one wants to improve perceptual quality and quantitative scores of recovered image at the same time. In this study, drawing inspiration from the research of transformer properties, we introduce the pretrained transformers to address this problem. In particular, we leverage deep features extracted from a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) to encourage recovered images to be sharp without sacrificing the performance measured by the quantitative metrics. The pretrained transformer can capture the global topological relations (i.e., self-similarity) of image, and we observe that the captured topological relationships about the sharp image will change when blur occurs. By comparing the transformer features between recovered image and target one, the pretrained transformer provides high-resolution blur-sensitive semantic information, which is critical in measuring the sharpness of the deblurred image. On the basis of the advantages, we present two types of novel perceptual losses to guide image deblurring. One regards the features as vectors and computes the discrepancy between representations extracted from recovered image and target one in Euclidean space. The other type considers the features extracted from an image as a distribution and compares the distribution discrepancy between recovered image and target one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer properties in improving the perceptual quality while not sacrificing the quantitative scores peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over the most competitive models, such as Uformer, Restormer, and NAFNet, on defocus deblurring and motion deblurring tasks.

In the proposed algorithm, the approximate solutions of the UAV-PE game problem are derived from a hierarchical learning process, which relies on a zero-sum game process of kinematics and a corresponding optimal process of dynamics. In this case, deep neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the policy and value functions of UAV-PE game systems in kinematics and dynamics level. Furthermore, the ADU method is adopted to improve the training efficiency of deep NN by fixing one player of the UAV-PE game systems to form a stable environment. The goal of this article is to develop an HRL algorithm with an ADU method for obtaining approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) solutions of the considered UAV-PE game systems which are subjected to the coupling of kinematics and dynamics. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are provided for analyzing the convergence and optimality of the proposed HRL algorithm. Moreover, the inequalities of overload are obtained to guarantee that the state of dynamics tracks with the control input of kinematics in UAV-PE game systems. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed HRL algorithm and ADU method.},

Traditional recurrent neural networks have limited effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies between frames, and combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent networks has limitations in modeling complex dependencies. Generative adversarial networks have shown promising results, but they are computationally expensive and suffer from instability during training. In this article, we propose a novel approach for future frame prediction that combines the encoding capabilities of 3-D CNNs with the sequence modeling capabilities of Transformers. We also propose a spatial self-attention mechanism and a novel neighborhood pixel intensity loss to preserve structural information and local intensity, respectively. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of structural similarity (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) scores on five public datasets. More precisely, our model exhibited an average improvement of 4.64%, 18.5%, and 42% concerning SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS for the second most proficient method correspondingly, across all datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating high-quality predictions of future frames.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian deep learning is one of the key frameworks employed in handling predictive uncertainty. Variational inference (VI), an extensively used inference method, derives the predictive distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. The drawback of MC sampling is its extremely high computational cost compared to that of ordinary deep learning. In contrast, the moment propagation (MP)-based approach propagates the output moments of each layer to derive predictive distributions instead of MC sampling. Because of this computational property, it is expected to realize faster inference than MC-based approaches. However, the applicability of the MP-based method in deep models has not been explored sufficiently, even though some studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of MP only in small toy models. One of the reasons is that it is difficult to train deep models by MP because of the large variance in activations. To realize MP in deep models, some normalization layers are required but have not yet been studied. In addition, it is still difficult to design well-calibrated MP-based models, because the effectiveness of MP-based methods under various variational distributions has also not been investigated. In this study, we propose a fast and reliable MP-based Bayesian deep-learning method. First, to train deep-learning models using MP, we introduce a batch normalization layer extended to random variables to prevent increases in the variance of activations. Second, to identify the appropriate variational distribution in MP, we investigate the treatment of moments of several variational distributions and evaluate their uncertainty quality of predictions. Experiments with regression tasks demonstrate that the MP-based method provides qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent predictive performance to MC-based methods regardless of variational distributions. In the classification tasks, we show that we can train MP-based deep models by extended batch normalization. We also show that the MP-based approach realizes 2.0–2.8 times faster inference than the MC-based approach while maintaining the predictive performance. The results of this study can help realize a fast and well-calibrated uncertainty estimation method that can be deployed in a wider range of reliability-aware applications.},

  abstract     = {Graph-learning methods, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown remarkable effectiveness in handling non-Euclidean data and have achieved great success in various scenarios. Existing GNNs are primarily based on message-passing schemes, that is, aggregating information from neighboring nodes. However, the diversity and complexity of complex systems from real-world circumstances are not sufficiently taken into account. In these cases, the individual should be treated as an agent, with the ability to perceive their surroundings and interact with other individuals, rather than just be viewed as nodes in existing graph approaches. Additionally, the pairwise interactions used in existing methods also lack the expressiveness for the higher-order complex relations among multiple agents, thus limiting the performance in various tasks. In this work, we propose a Multiagent Hypergraph Force-learning method dubbed MHGForce. First, we formalize the multiagent system (MAS) and illustrate its connection to graph learning. Then, we propose a generalized multiagent hypergraph-learning framework. In this framework, we integrate message-passing and force-based interactions to devise a pluggable method. The method empowers graph approaches to excel in downstream tasks while effectively maintaining structural information in the representations. Experimental results on the Cora, Citeseer, Cora-CA, Zoo, and NTU2012 datasets in node classification demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed method. We also discuss the characteristics of the MHGForce and explore its role through parametric analysis and visualization. Finally, we give a discussion, conclude our work, and propose future directions.},

  abstract     = {Conditional independence (CI) testing is an important problem, especially in causal discovery. Most testing methods assume that all variables are fully observable and then test the CI among the observed data. Such an assumption is often untenable beyond applications dealing with, e.g., psychological analysis about the mental health status and medical diagnosing (researchers need to consider the existence of latent variables in these scenarios); and typically adopted latent CI test schemes mainly suffer from robust or efficient issues. Accordingly, this article investigates the problem of testing CI between latent variables. To this end, we offer an auxiliary regression-based CI (AReCI) test by taking the measured variable as the surrogate variable of the latent variables to conduct the regression over the latent variables under the linear causal models, in which each latent variable has some certain measured variables. Specifically, given a pair of latent variables $L_{X}$ and $L_{Y}$ , and a corresponding latent variable set $\mathcal {L}_{O}$ , $L_{X} \mathrel {\perp \mspace {-10mu}\perp } L_{Y} | \mathcal {L}_{O}$ holds if and only if $A_{\{L_{X}\}}-\omega _{1}^{\intercal} A^{\prime }_{\{\mathcal {L}_{O}\}}$ and $A_{\{L_{Y}\}}-\omega _{2}^{\intercal} A^{\prime \prime }_{\{\mathcal {L}_{O}\}}$ are statistically independent, where $A^{\prime }$ and $A^{\prime \prime }$ are the two disjoint subset of the measured variable for the corresponding latent variables, $A^{\prime }_{\{\mathcal {L}_{O}\}} \cap A^{\prime \prime }_{\{\mathcal {L}_{O}\}} =\emptyset $ , and $\omega _{1}$ is a parameter vector characterized from the cross covariance between $A_{\{L_{X}\}}$ and $A^{\prime }_{\{\mathcal {L}_{O}\}}$ , and $\omega _{2}$ is a parameter vector characterized from the cross covariance between $A_{\{L_{Y}\}}$ and $A^{\prime \prime }_{\{\mathcal {L}_{O}\}}$ . We theoretically show that the AReCI test is capable of addressing both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. In addition, we find that the well-known partial correlation test can be seen as a special case of the AReCI test. Finally, we devise a causal discovery method by using the AReCI test as the CI test. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world data illustrate the effectiveness of our method.},

In this context, the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) constitutes a breakthrough result, that addresses not only the performance of the inference phase, but also of the training phase. It states that it is possible to extract effective sparse subnetworks, called winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation. The development of effective methods to play the lottery, i.e., to find winning tickets, is still an open problem. In this article, we propose a novel class of methods to play the lottery. The key point is the use of concave regularization to promote the sparsity of a relaxed binary mask, which represents the network topology. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method in the convex framework. Then, we propose extended numerical tests on various datasets and architectures, that show that the proposed method can improve the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised temporal action localization (TAL) aims to localize the action instances in untrimmed videos using only video-level action labels. Without snippet-level labels, this task should be hard to distinguish all snippets with accurate action/background categories. The main difficulties are the large variations brought by the unconstraint background snippets and multiple subactions in action snippets. The existing prototype model focuses on describing snippets by covering them with clusters (defined as prototypes). In this work, we argue that the clustered prototype covering snippets with simple variations still suffers from the misclassification of the snippets with large variations. We propose an ensemble prototype network (EPNet), which ensembles prototypes learned with consensus-aware clustering. The network stacks a consensus prototype learning (CPL) module and an ensemble snippet weight learning (ESWL) module as one stage and extends one stage to multiple stages in an ensemble learning way. The CPL module learns the consensus matrix by estimating the similarity of clustering labels between two successive clustering generations. The consensus matrix optimizes the clustering to learn consensus prototypes, which can predict the snippets with consensus labels. The ESWL module estimates the weights of the misclassified snippets using the snippet-level loss. The weights update the posterior probabilities of the snippets in the clustering to learn prototypes in the next stage. We use multiple stages to learn multiple prototypes, which can cover the snippets with large variations for accurate snippet classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art weakly supervised TAL methods on two benchmark datasets, that is, THUMOS’14, ActivityNet v1.2, and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets.},

  abstract     = {Malware open-set recognition (MOSR) is an emerging research domain that aims at jointly classifying malware samples from known families and detecting the ones from novel unknown families, respectively. Existing works mostly rely on a well-trained classifier considering the predicted probabilities of each known family with a threshold-based detection to achieve the MOSR. However, our observation reveals that the feature distributions of malware samples are extremely similar to each other even between known and unknown families. Thus, the obtained classifier may produce overly high probabilities of testing unknown samples toward known families and degrade the model performance. In this article, we propose the multi\modal dual-embedding networks, dubbed MDENet, to take advantage of comprehensive malware features from different modalities to enhance the diversity of malware feature space, which is more representative and discriminative for down-stream recognition. Concretely, we first generate a malware image for each observed sample based on their numeric features using our proposed numeric encoder with a re- designed multiscale CNN structure, which can better explore their statistical and spatial correlations. Besides, we propose to organize tokenized malware features into a sentence for each sample considering its behaviors and dynamics, and utilize language models as the textual encoder to transform it into a representable and computable textual vector. Such parallel multimodal encoders can fuse the above two components to enhance the feature diversity. Last, to further guarantee the open-set recognition (OSR), we dually embed the fused multimodal representation into one primary space and an associated sub-space, i.e., discriminative and exclusive spaces, with contrastive sampling and $\rho $ -bounded enclosing sphere regularizations, which resort to classification and detection, respectively. Moreover, we also enrich our previously proposed large-scaled malware dataset MAL-100 with multimodal characteristics and contribute an improved version dubbed MAL-100+. Experimental results on the widely used malware dataset Mailing and the proposed MAL-100+ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Cross-time spatial dependence (i.e., the interaction between different variables at different time points) is indispensable for detecting anomalies in multivariate time series, as certain anomalies may have time delays in their propagation from one variable to another. However, accurately capturing cross-time spatial dependence remains a challenge. Specifically, real-world time series usually exhibits complex and incomprehensible evolutions that may be compounded by multiple temporal states (i.e., temporal patterns, such as rising, fluctuating, and peak). These temporal states mix and overlap with each other and exhibit dynamic and heterogeneous evolution laws in different time series, making the cross-time spatial dependence extremely intricate and mutable. Therefore, a cross-time spatial graph network with fuzzy embedding is proposed to disentangle latent and mixing temporal states and exploit it to meticulously learn cross-time spatial dependence. First, considering that temporal states are diversiform and their mixing modes are unknown, we introduce a fuzzy state set to uniformly characterize potential temporal states and adaptively generate corresponding membership degrees to depict how these states mix. Further, we propose a cross-time spatial graph, quantifying similarities among fuzzy states and sensing their dynamic evolutions, to flexibly learn mutable cross-time spatial dependence. Finally, we design state diversity and temporal proximity constraints to ensure the differences among fuzzy states and the evolution continuity of fuzzy states. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {The objective of visual question answering (VQA) is to adequately comprehend a question and identify relevant contents in an image that can provide an answer. Existing approaches in VQA often combine visual and question features directly to create a unified cross-modality representation for answer inference. However, this kind of approach fails to bridge the semantic gap between visual and text modalities, resulting in a lack of alignment in cross-modality semantics and the inability to match key visual content accurately. In this article, we propose a model called the caption bridge-based cross-modality alignment and contrastive learning model (CBAC) to address the issue. The CBAC model aims to reduce the semantic gap between different modalities. It consists of a caption-based cross-modality alignment module and a visual-caption (V-C) contrastive learning module. By utilizing an auxiliary caption that shares the same modality as the question and has closer semantic associations with the visual, we are able to effectively reduce the semantic gap by separately matching the caption with both the question and the visual to generate pre-alignment features for each, which are then used in the subsequent fusion process. We also leverage the fact that V-C pairs exhibit stronger semantic connections compared to question-visual (Q-V) pairs to employ a contrastive learning mechanism on visual and caption pairs to further enhance the semantic alignment capabilities of single-modality encoders. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art VQA models. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each module in our model. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative analysis by visualizing the attention matrices to assess the reasoning reliability of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {The recent advances in compressing high-accuracy convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed remarkable progress in real-time object detection. To accelerate detection speed, lightweight detectors always have few convolution layers using a single-path backbone. Single-path architecture, however, involves continuous pooling and downsampling operations, always resulting in coarse and inaccurate feature maps that are disadvantageous to locate objects. On the other hand, due to limited network capacity, recent lightweight networks are often weak in representing large-scale visual data. To address these problems, we present a dual-path network, named DPNet, with a lightweight attention scheme for real-time object detection. The dual-path architecture enables us to extract in parallel high-level semantic features and low-level object details. Although DPNet has a nearly duplicated shape with respect to single-path detectors, the computational costs and model size are not significantly increased. To enhance representation capability, a lightweight self-correlation module (LSCM) is designed to capture global interactions, with only a few computational overheads and network parameters. In the neck, LSCM is extended into a lightweight cross correlation module (LCCM), capturing mutual dependencies among neighboring scale features. We have conducted exhaustive experiments on MS COCO, Pascal VOC 2007, and ImageNet datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DPNet achieves a state-of-the-art trade off between detection accuracy and implementation efficiency. More specifically, DPNet achieves 31.3% AP on MS COCO test-dev, 82.7% mAP on Pascal VOC 2007 test set, and 41.6% mAP on ImageNet validation set, together with nearly 2.5M model size, 1.04 GFLOPs, and 164 and 196 frames/s (FPS) FPS for $320 \; \times \; 320$ input images of three datasets.},

  abstract     = {Face stylization has made notable progress in recent years. However, when training on limited data, the performance of existing approaches significantly declines. Although some studies have attempted to tackle this problem, they either failed to achieve the few-shot setting (less than 10) or can only get suboptimal results. In this article, we propose GAN Prior Distillation (GPD) to enable effective few-shot face stylization. GPD contains two models: a teacher network with GAN Prior and a student network that fulfills end-to-end translation. Specifically, we adapt the teacher network trained on large-scale data in the source domain to the target domain using a handful of samples, where it can learn the target domain’s knowledge. Then, we can achieve few-shot augmentation by generating source domain and target domain images simultaneously with the same latent codes. We propose an anchor-based knowledge distillation module that can fully use the difference between the training and the augmented data to distill the knowledge of the teacher network into the student network. The trained student network achieves excellent generalization performance with the absorption of additional knowledge. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior results than state-of-the-art approaches in a few-shot setting.},

  abstract     = {Off-policy prediction—learning the value function for one policy from data generated while following another policy—is one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning. This article makes two main contributions: 1) it empirically studies 11 off-policy prediction learning algorithms with emphasis on their sensitivity to parameters, learning speed, and asymptotic error and 2) based on the empirical results, it proposes two step-size adaptation methods called Step-size Ratchet and Soft Step-size Ratchet that help the algorithm with the lowest error from the experimental study learn faster. Many off-policy prediction learning algorithms have been proposed in the past decade, but it remains unclear which algorithms learn faster than others. In this article, we empirically compare 11 off-policy prediction learning algorithms with linear function approximation on three small tasks: the Collision task, the Rooms task, and the High Variance Rooms task. The Collision task is a small off-policy problem analogous to that of an autonomous car trying to predict whether it will collide with an obstacle. The Rooms and High Variance Rooms tasks are designed such that learning fast in them is challenging. In the Rooms task, the product of importance sampling ratios can be as large as $2^{14}$ . To control the high variance caused by the product of the importance sampling ratios, step size should be set small, which, in turn, slows down learning. The High Variance Rooms task is more extreme in that the product of the ratios can become as large as $2^{14} \times 25$ . The algorithms considered are Off-policy TD( $\lambda $ ), five Gradient-TD algorithms, two Emphatic-TD algorithms, Vtrace, and variants of Tree Backup and ABQ that are applicable to the prediction setting. We found that the algorithms’ performance is highly affected by the variance induced by the importance sampling ratios. Tree Backup( $\lambda $ ), Vtrace( $\lambda $ ), and ABTD( $\zeta $ ) are not affected by the high variance as much as other algorithms, but they restrict the effective bootstrapping parameter in a way that is too limiting for tasks where high variance is not present. We observed that Emphatic TD( $\lambda $ ) tends to have lower asymptotic error than other algorithms but might learn more slowly in some cases. Based on the empirical results, we propose two step-size adaptation algorithms, which we collectively refer to as the Ratchet algorithms, with the same underlying idea: keep the step-size parameter as large as possible and ratchet it down only when necessary to avoid overshoot. We show that the Ratchet algorithms are effective by comparing them with other popular step-size adaptation algorithms, such as the Adam optimizer.},

  abstract     = {Node importance estimation (NIE) is the task of inferring the importance scores of the nodes in a graph. Due to the availability of richer data and knowledge, recent research interests of NIE have been dedicated to knowledge graphs (KGs) for predicting future or missing node importance scores. Existing state-of-the-art NIE methods train the model by available labels, and they consider every interested node equally before training. However, the nodes with higher importance often require or receive more attention in real-world scenarios, e.g., people may care more about the movies or webpages with higher importance. To this end, we introduce Label Informed ContrAstive Pretraining (LICAP) to the NIE problem for being better aware of the nodes with high importance scores. Specifically, LICAP is a novel type of contrastive learning (CL) framework that aims to fully utilize continuous labels to generate contrastive samples for pretraining embeddings. Considering the NIE problem, LICAP adopts a novel sampling strategy called top nodes preferred hierarchical sampling to first group all interested nodes into a top bin and a nontop bin based on node importance scores, and then divide the nodes within the top bin into several finer bins also based on the scores. The contrastive samples are generated from those bins and are then used to pretrain node embeddings of KGs via a newly proposed predicate-aware graph attention networks (PreGATs), so as to better separate the top nodes from nontop nodes, and distinguish the top nodes within the top bin by keeping the relative order among finer bins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LICAP pretrained embeddings can further boost the performance of existing NIE methods and achieve new state-of-the-art performance regarding both regression and ranking metrics.

In this article, a novel neural-network-based model, Continuous Volatility Forecasting Model, CVFM is proposed to tackle this problem. First, CVFM introduces a continuous-time latent process, whose evolution is modeled with neural differential equations (NDEs), to govern volatility, which effectively captures the continuous evolutionary behavior of volatility in a data-driven way. Second, a scale-similarity-based mechanism is designed to calibrate the evolution equation of the latent process with real-world observations in the absence of high-frequency data. CVFM is tested on six real-world stock index datasets. The main experimental results show that CVFM can significantly outperform existing models in terms of both forecasting accuracy and high-volatility recognition.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the superior performances, exemplar-based methods with knowledge distillation (KD) are widely applied in class incremental learning (CIL). However, it suffers from two drawbacks: 1) data imbalance between the old/learned and new classes causes the bias of the new classifier toward the head/new classes and 2) deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer from distribution drift when learning sequence tasks, which results in narrowed feature space and deficient representation of old tasks. For the first problem, we analyze the insufficiency of softmax loss when dealing with the problem of data imbalance in theory and then propose the imbalance softmax (im-softmax) loss to relieve the imbalanced data learning, where we re-scale the output logits to underfit the head/new classes. For another problem, we calibrate the feature space by incremental-adaptive angular margin (IAAM) loss. The new classes form a complete distribution in feature space yet the old are squeezed. To recover the old feature space, we first compute the included angle of normalized features and normalized anchor prototypes, and use the angle distribution to represent the class distribution, then we replenish the old distribution with the deviation from the new. Each anchor prototype is predefined as a learnable vector for a designated class. The proposed im-softmax reduces the bias in the linear classification layer. IAAM rectifies the representation learning, reduces the intra-class distance, and enlarges the inter-class margin. Finally, we seamlessly combine the im-softmax and IAAM in an end-to-end training framework, called the dual balanced class incremental learning (DBL), for further improvements. Experiments demonstrate the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on several benchmarks, such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-100.},

  abstract     = {Disentanglement learning aims to separate explanatory factors of variation so that different attributes of the data can be well characterized and isolated, which promotes efficient inference for downstream tasks. Mainstream disentanglement approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn interpretable data representation. However, most typical GAN-based works lack the discussion of the latent subspace, causing insufficient consideration of the variation of independent factors. Although some recent research analyzes the latent space on pretrained GANs for image editing, they do not emphasize learning representation directly from the subspace perspective. Appropriate subspace properties could facilitate corresponding feature representation learning to satisfy the independent variation requirements of the obtained explanatory factors, which is crucial for better disentanglement. In this work, we propose a unified framework for ensuring disentanglement, which fully investigates latent subspace learning (SL) in GAN. The novel GAN-based architecture explores orthogonal subspace representation (OSR) on vanilla GAN, named OSRGAN. To guide a subspace with strong correlation, less redundancy, and robust distinguishability, our OSR includes three stages, self-latent-aware, orthogonal subspace-aware, and structure representation-aware, respectively. First, the self-latent-aware stage promotes the latent subspace strongly correlated with the data space to discover interpretable factors, but with poor independence of variation. Second, the following orthogonal subspace-aware stage adaptively learns some 1-D linear subspace spanned by a set of orthogonal bases in the latent space. There is less redundancy between them, expressing the corresponding independence. Third, the structure representation-aware stage aligns the projection on the orthogonal subspace and the latent variables. Accordingly, feature representation in each linear subspace can be distinguishable, enhancing the independent expression of interpretable factors. In addition, we design an alternating optimization step, achieving a tradeoff training of OSRGAN on different properties. Despite it strictly constrains orthogonality, the loss weight coefficient of distinguishability induced by orthogonality could be adjusted and balanced with correlation constraint. To elucidate, this tradeoff training prevents our OSRGAN from overemphasizing any property and damaging the expressiveness of the feature representation. It takes into account both interpretable factors and their independent variation characteristics. Meanwhile, alternating optimization could keep the cost and efficiency of forward inference unchanged and will not burden the computational complexity. In theory, we clarify the significance of OSR, which brings better independence of factors, along with interpretability as correlation could converge to a high range faster. Moreover, through the convergence behavior analysis, including the objective functions under different constraints and the evaluation curve with iterations, our model demonstrates enhanced stability and definitely converges toward a higher peak for disentanglement. To depict the performance in downstream tasks, we compared the state-of-the-art GAN-based and even VAE-based approaches on different datasets. Our OSRGAN achieves higher disentanglement scores on FactorVAE, SAP, MIG, and VP metrics. All the experimental results illustrate that our novel GAN-based framework has considerable advantages on disentanglement.},

  abstract     = {With recent success of deep learning in 2-D visual recognition, deep-learning-based 3-D point cloud analysis has received increasing attention from the community, especially due to the rapid development of autonomous driving technologies. However, most existing methods directly learn point features in the spatial domain, leaving the local structures in the spectral domain poorly investigated. In this article, we introduce a new method, PointWavelet, to explore local graphs in the spectral domain via a learnable graph wavelet transform. Specifically, we first introduce the graph wavelet transform to form multiscale spectral graph convolution to learn effective local structural representations. To avoid the time-consuming spectral decomposition, we then devise a learnable graph wavelet transform, which significantly accelerates the overall training process. Extensive experiments on four popular point cloud datasets, ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, ShapeNet-Part, and S3DIS, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on point cloud classification and segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Denoising diffusion models have shown a powerful capacity for generating high-quality image samples by progressively removing noise. Inspired by this, we present a diffusion-based mesh denoiser that progressively removes noise from mesh. In general, the iterative algorithm of diffusion models attempts to manipulate the overall structure and fine details of target meshes simultaneously. For this reason, it is difficult to apply the diffusion process to a mesh denoising task that removes artifacts while maintaining a structure. To address this, we formulate a structure-preserving diffusion process. Instead of diffusing the mesh vertices to be distributed as zero-centered isotopic Gaussian distribution, we diffuse each vertex into a specific noise distribution, in which the entire structure can be preserved. In addition, we propose a topology-agnostic mesh diffusion model by projecting the vertex into multiple 2-D viewpoints to efficiently learn the diffusion using a deep network. This enables the proposed method to learn the diffusion of arbitrary meshes that have an irregular topology. Finally, the denoised mesh can be obtained via refinement based on 2-D projections obtained from reverse diffusion. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art mesh denoising methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial network (GAN) has achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality synthetic data by learning the underlying distributions of target data. Recent efforts have been devoted to utilizing optimal transport (OT) to tackle the gradient vanishing and instability issues in GAN. They use the Wasserstein distance as a metric to measure the discrepancy between the generator distribution and the real data distribution. However, most optimal transport GANs define loss functions in Euclidean space, which limits their capability in handling high-order statistics that are of much interest in a variety of practical applications. In this article, we propose a computational framework to alleviate this issue from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Particularly, we generalize the optimal transport-based GAN from Euclidean space to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and propose Hilbert Optimal Transport GAN (HOT-GAN). First, we design HOT-GAN with a Hilbert embedding that allows the discriminator to tackle more informative and high-order statistics in RKHS. Second, we prove that HOT-GAN has a closed-form kernel reformulation in RKHS that can achieve a tractable objective under the GAN framework. Third, HOT-GAN’s objective enjoys the theoretical guarantee of differentiability with respect to generator parameters, which is beneficial to learn powerful generators via adversarial kernel learning. Extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed HOT-GAN consistently outperforms the representative GAN works.},

  abstract     = {Neural architecture search (NAS) is a popular method that can automatically design deep neural network structures. However, designing a neural network using NAS is computationally expensive. This article proposes a gradient-guided evolutionary NAS (GENAS) to design convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. GENAS is a hybrid algorithm that combines evolutionary global and local search operators to evolve a population of subnets sampled from a supernet. Each candidate architecture is encoded as a table describing which operations are associated with the edges between nodes signifying feature maps. Besides, evolutionary optimization uses novel crossover and mutation operators to manipulate the subnets using the proposed tabular encoding. Every $n$ generations, the candidate architectures undergo a local search inspired by differentiable NAS. GENAS is designed to overcome the limitations of both evolutionary and gradient descent NAS. This algorithmic structure enables the performance assessment of the candidate architecture without retraining, thus limiting the NAS calculation time. Furthermore, subnet individuals are decoupled during evaluation to prevent strong coupling of operations in the supernet. The experimental results indicate that the searched structures achieve test errors of 2.45%, 16.86%, and 23.9% on CIFAR-10/100/ImageNet datasets and it costs only 0.26 GPU days on a graphic card. GENAS can effectively expedite the training and evaluation processes and obtain high-performance network structures.},

Kinematic control plays a fundamental and crucial role in robot control. Over the past few decades, numerous motion control schemes have been proposed and applied to trajectory tracking tasks. However, most of these schemes do not consider the introduction of sparsity into the motion control of redundant manipulators, resulting in excessive joint movements, which not only consume extra energy but also increase the risk of unexpected collisions in complex environments. To solve this problem, we transform the issue of increasing the sparsity into a nonconvex optimization problem. Furthermore, a collective neural dynamics for sparse motion planning (CNDSMP) scheme for motion planning of redundant manipulators is proposed. By incorporating sparsity into the control scheme, the excessive joint movements are minimized, leading to improved efficiency and reduced collision risks. Through simulations, comparisons, and physical experiments, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Despite the fact that there is a remarkable achievement on multifocus image fusion, most of the existing methods only generate a low-resolution image if the given source images suffer from low resolution. Obviously, a naive strategy is to independently conduct image fusion and image super-resolution. However, this two-step approach would inevitably introduce and enlarge artifacts in the final result if the result from the first step meets artifacts. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a novel method to simultaneously achieve image fusion and super-resolution in one framework, avoiding step-by-step processing of fusion and super-resolution. Since a small receptive field can discriminate the focusing characteristics of pixels in detailed regions, while a large receptive field is more robust to pixels in smooth regions, a subnetwork is first proposed to compute the affinity of features under different types of receptive fields, efficiently increasing the discriminability of focused pixels. Simultaneously, in order to prevent from distortion, a gradient embedding-based super-resolution subnetwork is also proposed, in which the features from the shallow layer, the deep layer, and the gradient map are jointly taken into account, allowing us to get an upsampled image with high resolution. Compared with the existing methods, which implemented fusion and super-resolution independently, our proposed method directly achieves these two tasks in a parallel way, avoiding artifacts caused by the inferior output of image fusion or super-resolution. Experiments conducted on the real-world dataset substantiate the superiority of our proposed method compared with state of the arts.},

The intrinsic parameters and trade-off parameters between losses, however, need to be tuned according to the specific diagnosis tasks; thus, the generalization abilities of these methods in multiple tasks are limited. Besides, the alignment goal of most domain adaptation (DA) mechanisms dynamically changes during the training process, which will result in loss oscillation, slow convergence and poor robustness. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, a novel and simple transfer learning diagnosis method named adaptive intermediate class-wise distribution alignment (AICDA) model is proposed, and it is established via the proposed AICDA mechanism, dynamic intermediate alignment (DIA) adaptive layer and AdaSoftmax loss. The AICDA mechanism develops an adaptive intermediate distribution as the alignment goal of multiple source domains and target domains, and it can simultaneously align the global and class-wise distributions of these domains. The DIA layer is designed to adaptively achieve domain confusion without the distribution distance loss and the correlation regularization loss. Meanwhile, to ensure the classification performance of the AICDA mechanism, AdaSoftmax loss is proposed for boosting the separability of Softmax loss. Finally, in order to evaluate the effectiveness and universality of the AICDA diagnosis model to the most degree, various multisource mixed fault transfer diagnosis tasks of wind turbine planetary gearboxes, including DA and domain generalization (DG), are implemented, and the experimental results indicate that our proposed AICDA model has a higher diagnosis accuracy and a stronger generalization ability than other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.},

This has led to the rapid development of the emerging research field of federated GNNs (FedGNNs). This promising interdisciplinary field is highly challenging for interested researchers to grasp. The lack of an insightful survey on this topic further exacerbates the entry difficulty. In this article, we bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive survey of this emerging field.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) is expected to achieve effective knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a heterogeneous target domain with scarce labeled data. Most prior HDA methods strive to align the cross-domain feature distributions by learning domain invariant representations without considering the intrinsic semantic correlations among categories, which inevitably results in the suboptimal adaptation performance across domains. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose a novel semantic correlation transfer (SCT) method for HDA, which not only matches the marginal and conditional distributions between domains to mitigate the large domain discrepancy, but also transfers the category correlation knowledge underlying the source domain to target by maximizing the pairwise class similarity across source and target. Technically, the domainwise and classwise centroids (prototypes) are first computed and aligned according to the feature embeddings. Then, based on the derived classwise prototypes, we leverage the cosine similarity of each two classes in both domains to transfer the supervised source semantic correlation knowledge among different categories to target effectively. As a result, the feature transferability and category discriminability can be simultaneously improved during the adaptation process. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on standard HDA tasks, such as text-to-image, image-to-image, and text-to-text, have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed SCT against several state-of-the-art HDA methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, unsupervised cross-dataset person reidentification (Re-ID) has attracted more and more attention, which aims to transfer knowledge of a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. There are two common frameworks: one is pixel-alignment of transferring low-level knowledge, and the other is feature-alignment of transferring high-level knowledge. In this article, we propose a novel recurrent autoencoder (RAE) framework to unify these two kinds of methods and inherit their merits. Specifically, the proposed RAE includes three modules, i.e., a feature-transfer (FT) module, a pixel-transfer (PT) module, and a fusion module. The FT module utilizes an encoder to map source and target images to a shared feature space. In the space, not only features are identity-discriminative but also the gap between source and target features is reduced. The PT module takes a decoder to reconstruct original images with its features. Here, we hope that the images reconstructed from target features are in the source style. Thus, the low-level knowledge can be propagated to the target domain. After transferring both high-and low-level knowledge with the two proposed modules above, we design another bilinear pooling layer to fuse both kinds of knowledge. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and MSMT17 datasets show that our method significantly outperforms either pixel-alignment or feature-alignment Re-ID methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modality visible–infrared person reidentification (VI-ReID), which aims to retrieve pedestrian images captured by both visible and infrared cameras, is a challenging but essential task for smart surveillance systems. The huge barrier between visible and infrared images has led to the large cross-modality discrepancy and intraclass variations. Most existing VI-ReID methods tend to learn discriminative modality-sharable features based on either global or part-based representations, lacking effective optimization objectives. In this article, we propose a novel global–local multichannel (GLMC) network for VI-ReID, which can learn multigranularity representations based on both global and local features. The coarse- and fine-grained information can complement each other to form a more discriminative feature descriptor. Besides, we also propose a novel center loss function that aims to simultaneously improve the intraclass cross-modality similarity and enlarge the interclass discrepancy to explicitly handle the cross-modality discrepancy issue and avoid the model fluctuating problem. Experimental results on two public datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Dense captioning provides detailed captions of complex visual scenes. While a number of successes have been achieved in recent years, there are still two broad limitations: 1) most existing methods adopt an encoder–decoder framework, where the contextual information is sequentially encoded using long short-term memory (LSTM). However, the forget gate mechanism of LSTM makes it vulnerable when dealing with a long sequence and 2) the vast majority of prior arts consider regions of interests (RoIs) equally important, thus failing to focus on more informative regions. The consequence is that the generated captions cannot highlight important contents of the image, which does not seem natural. To overcome these limitations, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end transformer-based dense image captioning architecture, termed the transformer-based dense captioner (TDC). TDC learns the mapping between images and their dense captions via a transformer, prioritizing more informative regions. To this end, we present a novel unit, named region-object correlation score unit (ROCSU), to measure the importance of each region, where the relationships between detected objects and the region, alongside the confidence scores of detected objects within the region, are taken into account. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies on the standard dense-captioning datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Multispectral fusion of VIS and NIR images produces color images of high quality, rich textures, and little noise by taking both advantages of VIS and NIR images. In this article, we propose the deep selective fusion of VIS and NIR images using unsupervised U-Net. Existing image fusion methods are afflicted with the low contrast in VIS images and flash-like effect in NIR images. Thus, we adopt unsupervised U-Net to achieve deep selective fusion of multiple scale features. Due to the absence of the ground truth, we use unsupervised learning by formulating an energy function as a loss function. To deal with insufficient training data, we perform data augmentation by rotating images and adjusting their intensity. We synthesize training data by degrading clean VIS images and masking clean NIR images using a circle. First, we utilize pretrained visual geometry group (VGG) to extract features from VIS images. Second, we build an encoding network to obtain edge information from NIR images. Finally, we combine all features and feed them into a decoding network for fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion network produces visually pleasing results with fine details, little noise, and natural color and it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative measurements.},

First, it not only builds graph for the image but also constructs graph for the question in terms of both syntactic and embedding information. Next, we explore the intramodality relationships by a dual-stage graph encoder and then present a bilateral cross-modality GMA to infer the relationships between the image and the question. The updated cross-modality features are then sent into the answer prediction module for final answer prediction. Experiments demonstrate that our network achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the GQA dataset and the VQA 2.0 dataset.

However, multimodal data often suffer from the position shift problem, i.e., the image pair is not strictly aligned, making one object has different positions in different modalities. For the deep learning method, this problem makes it difficult to fuse multimodal features and puzzles the convolutional neural network (CNN) training. In this article, we propose a general multimodal detector named aligned region CNN (AR-CNN) to tackle the position shift problem. First, a region feature (RF) alignment module with adjacent similarity constraint is designed to consistently predict the position shift between two modalities and adaptively align the cross-modal RFs. Second, we propose a novel region of interest (RoI) jitter strategy to improve the robustness to unexpected shift patterns. Third, we present a new multimodal feature fusion method that selects the more reliable feature and suppresses the less useful one via feature reweighting. In addition, by locating bounding boxes in both modalities and building their relationships, we provide novel multimodal labeling named KAIST-Paired. Extensive experiments on 2-D and 3-D object detection, RGB-T, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.},

Current networks usually combine depth maps with red–green–blue (RGB) images for salient object detection (SOD). However, fully leveraging depth information complementary to RGB information by accurately highlighting salient objects deserves further study. We combine a gated attention mechanism and a linear fusion method to construct a dual-stream interactive recursive feature-reshaping network (IRFR-Net). The streams for RGB and depth data communicate through a backbone encoder to thoroughly extract complementary information. First, we design a context extraction module (CEM) to obtain low-level depth foreground information. Subsequently, the gated attention fusion module (GAFM) is applied to the RGB depth (RGB-D) information to obtain advantageous structural and spatial fusion features. Then, adjacent depth information is globally integrated to obtain complementary context features. We also introduce a weighted atrous spatial pyramid pooling (WASPP) module to extract the multiscale local information of depth features. Finally, global and local features are fused in a bottom-up scheme to effectively highlight salient objects. Comprehensive experiments on eight representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed IRFR-Net outperforms 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) RGB-D approaches in various evaluation indicators.},

In this work, we propose a novel duality-gated mutual condition network to fully exploit the discriminative information of all modalities while suppressing the effects of data noise. In specific, we design a mutual condition module, which takes the discriminative information of a modality as the condition to guide feature learning of target appearance in another modality. Such a module can effectively enhance target representations of all modalities even in the presence of low-quality modalities. To improve the quality of conditions and further reduce data noise, we propose a duality-gated mechanism and integrate it into the mutual condition module. To deal with the tracking failure caused by sudden camera motion, which often occurs in RGBT tracking, we design a resampling strategy based on optical flow. It does not increase much computational cost since we perform optical flow calculation only when the model prediction is unreliable and then execute resampling when the sudden camera motion is detected. Extensive experiments on four RGBT tracking benchmark datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.},

By integrating the observations from different sensors, these mobile agents are able to perceive the environment and estimate system states, e.g., locations and orientations. Although deep learning (DL) approaches for multimodal odometry estimation and localization have gained traction, they rarely focus on the issue of robust sensor fusion—a necessary consideration to deal with noisy or incomplete sensor observations in the real world. Moreover, current deep odometry models suffer from a lack of interpretability. To this extent, we propose SelectFusion, an end-to-end selective sensor fusion module that can be applied to useful pairs of sensor modalities, such as monocular images and inertial measurements, depth images, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) point clouds. Our model is a uniform framework that is not restricted to specific modality or task. During prediction, the network is able to assess the reliability of the latent features from different sensor modalities and to estimate trajectory at both scale and global pose. In particular, we propose two fusion modules—a deterministic soft fusion and a stochastic hard fusion—and offer a comprehensive study of the new strategies compared with trivial direct fusion. We extensively evaluate all fusion strategies both on public datasets and on progressively degraded datasets that present synthetic occlusions, noisy and missing data, and time misalignment between sensors, and we investigate the effectiveness of the different fusion strategies in attending the most reliable features, which in itself provides insights into the operation of the various models.},

Nevertheless, most of them use a pooling operation to aggregate viewwise features, which usually leads to the visual information loss. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel layer called capsule attention layer (CAL) by using attention mechanism to fuse the features expressed by capsules. In detail, instead of dynamic routing algorithm, we use an attention module to transmit information from the lower level capsules to higher level capsules, which obviously improves the speed of capsule networks. In particular, the view pooling layer of multiview convolutional neural network (MVCNN) becomes a special case of our CAL when the trainable weights are chosen on some certain values. Furthermore, based on CAL, we propose a capsule attention convolutional neural network (CACNN) for 3D object recognition. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our CACNN and show that it outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Many point-based semantic segmentation methods have been designed for indoor scenarios, but they struggle if they are applied to point clouds that are captured by a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor in an outdoor environment. In order to make these methods more efficient and robust such that they can handle LiDAR data, we introduce the general concept of reformulating 3-D point-based operations such that they can operate in the projection space. While we show by means of three point-based methods that the reformulated versions are between 300 and 400 times faster and achieve higher accuracy, we furthermore demonstrate that the concept of reformulating 3-D point-based operations allows to design new architectures that unify the benefits of point-based and image-based methods. As an example, we introduce a network that integrates reformulated 3-D point-based operations into a 2-D encoder-decoder architecture that fuses the information from different 2-D scales. We evaluate the approach on four challenging datasets for semantic LiDAR point cloud segmentation and show that leveraging reformulated 3-D point-based operations with 2-D image-based operations achieves very good results for all four datasets.},

  abstract     = {Conventional object detection models require large amounts of training data. In comparison, humans can recognize previously unseen objects by merely knowing their semantic description. To mimic similar behavior, zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to recognize and localize “unseen” object instances by using only their semantic information. The model is first trained to learn the relationships between visual and semantic domains for seen objects, later transferring the acquired knowledge to totally unseen objects. This setting gives rise to the need for correct alignment between visual and semantic concepts so that the unseen objects can be identified using only their semantic attributes. In this article, we propose a novel loss function called “polarity loss” that promotes correct visual-semantic alignment for an improved ZSD. On the one hand, it refines the noisy semantic embeddings via metric learning on a “semantic vocabulary” of related concepts to establish a better synergy between visual and semantic domains. On the other hand, it explicitly maximizes the gap between positive and negative predictions to achieve better discrimination between seen, unseen, and background objects. Our approach is inspired by embodiment theories in cognitive science that claim human semantic understanding to be grounded in past experiences (seen objects), related linguistic concepts (word vocabulary), and visual perception (seen/unseen object images). We conduct extensive evaluations on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) and Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) datasets, showing significant improvements over state of the art.

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning casts light on lacking unseen class data by transferring knowledge from seen classes via a joint semantic space. However, the distributions of samples from seen and unseen classes are usually imbalanced. Many zero-shot learning methods fail to obtain satisfactory results in the generalized zero-shot learning task, where seen and unseen classes are all used for the test. Also, irregular structures of some classes may result in inappropriate mapping from visual features space to semantic attribute space. A novel generative mixup networks with semantic graph alignment is proposed in this article to mitigate such problems. To be specific, our model first attempts to synthesize samples conditioned with class-level semantic information as the prototype to recover the class-based feature distribution from the given semantic description. Second, the proposed model explores a mixup mechanism to augment training samples and improve the generalization ability of the model. Third, triplet gradient matching loss is developed to guarantee the class invariance to be more continuous in the latent space, and it can help the discriminator distinguish the real and fake samples. Finally, a similarity graph is constructed from semantic attributes to capture the intrinsic correlations and guides the feature generation process. Extensive experiments conducted on several zero-shot learning benchmarks from different tasks prove that the proposed model can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art generalized zero-shot learning.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, vision-based computing tasks play an important role in various real-world applications. However, many vision computing tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, are usually computationally expensive, posing a challenge to the computing systems that are resource-constrained but require fast response speed. Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision processing models that only require limited computational resources. To this end, we propose the spatial-detail guided context propagation network (SGCPNet) for achieving real-time semantic segmentation. In SGCPNet, we propose the strategy of spatial-detail guided context propagation. It uses the spatial details of shallow layers to guide the propagation of the low-resolution global contexts, in which the lost spatial information can be effectively reconstructed. In this way, the need for maintaining high-resolution features along the network is freed, therefore largely improving the model efficiency. On the other hand, due to the effective reconstruction of spatial details, the segmentation accuracy can be still preserved. In the experiments, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SGCPNet model. On the Cityscapes dataset, for example, our SGCPNet achieves 69.5% mIoU segmentation accuracy, while its speed reaches 178.5 FPS on 768 $\times $ 1536 images on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU card. In addition, SGCPNet is very lightweight and only contains 0.61 M parameters. The code will be released at https://github.com/zhouyuan888888/SGCPNet.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation has achieved great progress by effectively fusing features of contextual information. In this article, we propose an end-to-end semantic attention boosting (SAB) framework to adaptively fuse the contextual information iteratively across layers with semantic regularization. Specifically, we first propose a pixelwise semantic attention (SAP) block, with a semantic metric representing the pixelwise category relationship, to aggregate the nonlocal contextual information. In addition, we improve the computation complexity of SAP block from $O(n^{2})$ to $O(n)$ for images with size $n$ . Second, we present a categorywise semantic attention (SAC) block to adaptively balance the nonlocal contextual dependencies and the local consistency with a categorywise weight, overcoming the contextual information confusion caused by the feature imbalance within intra-category. Furthermore, we propose the SAB module to refine the segmentation with SAC and SAP blocks. By applying the SAB module iteratively across layers, our model shrinks the semantic gap and enhances the structure reasoning by fully utilizing the coarse segmentation information. Extensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves the segmentation results and achieves superior performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and ADE20K datasets.},

Appropriately addressing the gap between low- and high-level features is important in SOD. We first propose a global position embedding attention (GPEA) module to minimize the discrepancy between multilevel features in this article. We extract the position information by utilizing the semantic information at high-level features to resist noises at low-level features. Object refine attention (ORA) module is introduced to refine features used to predict saliency maps further without any additional supervision and heighten discriminative regions near the salient object, such as boundaries. Moreover, we find that the saliency maps generated by the previous methods contain some blurry regions, and we design a pixel value (PV) loss to help the model generate saliency maps with improved clarity. Experimental results on five commonly used SOD datasets demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on multiple metrics.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) relies on hierarchical features extracted by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize closely alike objects. Particularly, shallow layer features containing rich spatial details are vital for specifying subtle differences between objects but are usually inadequately optimized due to gradient vanishing during backpropagation. In this article, hierarchical self-distillation (HSD) is introduced to generate well-optimized CNNs features for accurate fine-grained categorization. HSD inherits from the widely applied deep supervision and implements multiple intermediate losses for reinforced gradients. Besides that, we observe that the hard (one-hot) labels adopted for intermediate supervision hurt the performance of FGVC by enforcing overstrict supervision. As a solution, HSD seeks self-distillation where soft predictions generated by deeper layers of the network are hierarchically exploited to supervise shallow parts. Moreover, self-information entropy loss (SIELoss) is designed in HSD to adaptively soften intermediate predictions and facilitate better convergence. In addition, the gradient detached fusion (GDF) module is incorporated to produce an ensemble result with multiscale features via effective feature fusion. Extensive experiments on four challenging fine-grained datasets show that, with neglectable parameter increase, the proposed HSD framework and the GDF module both bring significant performance gains over different backbones, which also achieves state-of-the-art classification performance.},

Conventional deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods activate the most discriminate part of an object in feature maps and then attempt to expand feature activation to the whole object, which leads to deteriorating the classification performance. In addition, those methods only use the most semantic information in the last feature map, while ignoring the role of shallow features. So, it remains a challenge to enhance classification and localization performance with a single frame. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid network, namely deep and broad hybrid network (DB-HybridNet), which combines deep CNNs with a broad learning network to learn discriminative and complementary features from different layers, and then integrates multilevel features (i.e., high-level semantic features and low-level edge features) in a global feature augmentation module. Importantly, we exploit different combinations of deep features and broad learning layers in DB-HybridNet and design an iterative training algorithm based on gradient descent to ensure the hybrid network work in an end-to-end framework. Through extensive experiments on caltech-UCSD birds (CUB)-200 and imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC) 2016 datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art classification and localization performance.},

This is commonly achieved by obtaining multiple undersampled images, simultaneously, through parallel imaging. In this article, we propose the dual-octave network (DONet), which is capable of learning multiscale spatial-frequency features from both the real and imaginary components of MR data, for parallel fast MR image reconstruction. More specifically, our DONet consists of a series of dual-octave convolutions (Dual-OctConvs), which are connected in a dense manner for better reuse of features. In each Dual-OctConv, the input feature maps and convolutional kernels are first split into two components (i.e., real and imaginary) and then divided into four groups according to their spatial frequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intragroup information updating and intergroup information exchange to aggregate the contextual information across different groups. Our framework provides three appealing benefits: 1) it encourages information interaction and fusion between the real and imaginary components at various spatial frequencies to achieve richer representational capacity; 2) the dense connections between the real and imaginary groups in each Dual-OctConv make the propagation of features more efficient by feature reuse; and 3) DONet enlarges the receptive field by learning multiple spatial-frequency features of both the real and imaginary components. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets (i.e., clinical knee and fastMRI), under different undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, demonstrate the superiority of our model in accelerated parallel MR image reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {The growth of data collection in industrial processes has led to a renewed emphasis on the development of data-driven soft sensors. A key step in building an accurate, reliable soft sensor is feature representation. Deep networks have shown great ability to learn hierarchical data features using unsupervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. For typical deep networks like stacked auto-encoder (SAE), the pretraining stage is unsupervised, in which some important information related to quality variables may be discarded. In this article, a new quality-driven regularization (QR) is proposed for deep networks to learn quality-related features from industrial process data. Specifically, a QR-based SAE (QR-SAE) is developed, which changes the loss function to control the weights of the different input variables. By choosing an appropriate inductive bias for the weight matrix, the model provides quality-relevant information for predictive modeling. Finally, the proposed QR-SAE is used to predict the quality of a real industrial hydrocracking process.

  abstract     = {Filter pruning is a significant feature selection technique to shrink the existing feature fusion schemes (especially on convolution calculation and model size), which helps to develop more efficient feature fusion models while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. In addition, it reduces the storage and computation requirements of deep neural networks (DNNs) and accelerates the inference process dramatically. Existing methods mainly rely on manual constraints such as normalization to select the filters. A typical pipeline comprises two stages: first pruning the original neural network and then fine-tuning the pruned model. However, choosing a manual criterion can be somehow tricky and stochastic. Moreover, directly regularizing and modifying filters in the pipeline suffer from being sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, thus making the pruning procedure less robust. To address these challenges, we propose to handle the filter pruning issue through one stage: using an attention-based architecture that adaptively fuses the filter selection with filter learning in a unified network. Specifically, we present a pruning method named adding before pruning (ABP) to make the model focus on the filters of higher significance by training instead of man-made criteria such as norm, rank, etc. First, we add an auxiliary attention layer into the original model and set the significance scores in this layer to be binary. Furthermore, to propagate the gradients in the auxiliary attention layer, we design a specific gradient estimator and prove its effectiveness for convergence in the graph flow through mathematical derivation. In the end, to relieve the dependence on the complicated prior knowledge for designing the thresholding criterion, we simultaneously prune and train the filters to automatically eliminate network redundancy with recoverability. Extensive experimental results on the two typical image classification benchmarks, CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC-2012, illustrate that the proposed approach performs favorably against previous state-of-the-art filter pruning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {While the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has achieved overwhelming success in various vision tasks, its heavy computational and storage overhead hinders the practical use of resource-constrained devices. Recently, compressing DCNN models has attracted increasing attention, where binarization-based schemes have generated great research popularity due to their high compression rate. In this article, we propose modulated convolutional networks (MCNs) to obtain binarized DCNNs with high performance. We lead a new architecture in MCNs to efficiently fuse the multiple features and achieve a similar performance as the full-precision model. The calculation of MCNs is theoretically reformulated as a discrete optimization problem to build binarized DCNNs, for the first time, which jointly consider the filter loss, center loss, and softmax loss in a unified framework. Our MCNs are generic and can decompose full-precision filters in DCNNs, e.g., conventional DCNNs, VGG, AlexNet, ResNets, or Wide-ResNets, into a compact set of binarized filters which are optimized based on a projection function and a new updated rule during the backpropagation. Moreover, we propose modulation filters (M-Filters) to recover filters from binarized ones, which lead to a specific architecture to calculate the network model. Our proposed MCNs substantially reduce the storage cost of convolutional filters by a factor of 32 with a comparable performance to the full-precision counterparts, achieving much better performance than other state-of-the-art binarized models.},

Recently, works continually demonstrate the advantages of efficient aggregation strategy and some of them refer to multiscale representations. In this article, we describe a novel network architecture for high-level computer vision tasks where densely connected feature fusion provides multiscale representations for the residual network. We term our method the ResDNet which is a simple and efficient backbone made up of sequential ResDNet modules containing the variants of dense blocks named sliding dense blocks (SDBs). Compared with DenseNet, ResDNet enhances the feature fusion and reduces the redundancy by shallower densely connected architectures. Experimental results on three classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of ResDNet. ResDNet always outperforms DenseNet using much less computation on CIFAR-100. On ImageNet, ResDNet-B-129 achieves 1.94% and 0.89% top-1 accuracy improvement over ResNet-50 and DenseNet-201 with similar complexity. Besides, ResDNet with more than 1000 layers achieves remarkable accuracy on CIFAR compared with other state-of-the-art results. Based on MMdetection implementation of RetinaNet, ResDNet-B-129 improves mAP from 36.3 to 39.5 compared with ResNet-50 on COCO dataset.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks, in which each layer receives features from the previous layer(s) and then aggregates/abstracts higher level features from them, are widely adopted for image classification. To avoid information loss during feature aggregation/abstraction and fully utilize lower layer features, we propose a novel decision fusion module (DFM) for making an intermediate decision based on the features in the current layer and then fuse its results with the original features before passing them to the next layers. This decision is devised to determine an auxiliary category corresponding to the category at a higher hierarchical level, which can, thus, serve as category-coherent guidance for later layers. Therefore, by stacking a collection of DFMs into a classification network, the generated decision fusion network is explicitly formulated to progressively aggregate/abstract more discriminative features guided by these decisions and then refine the decisions based on the newly generated features in a layer-by-layer manner. Comprehensive results on four benchmarks validate that the proposed DFM can bring significant improvements for various common classification networks at a minimal additional computational cost and are superior to the state-of-the-art decision fusion-based methods. In addition, we demonstrate the generalization ability of the DFM to object detection and semantic segmentation.},

However, the performance of K-means is highly dependent on the accurate estimation of cluster centers, which is challenging to achieve optimally. Furthermore, it struggles to handle linearly non-separable data. To address these limitations, from the perspective of manifold learning, we reformulate multi-view K-means into a manifold-based multi-view clustering formulation that eliminates the need for computing centroid matrix. This reformulation ensures consistency between the manifold structure and the data labels. Building on this, we propose a novel multi-view K-means model incorporating the tensor rank constraint. Our model employs the indicator matrices from different views to construct a third-order tensor, whose rank is minimized via the tensor Schatten p-norm. This approach effectively leverages the complementary information across views. By utilizing different distance functions, our proposed model can effectively handle linearly non-separable data. Extensive experimental results on multiple databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.},

Depending on whether the initial states of target objects are specified by provided annotations in the first frame or the categories, VOT could be classified as instance tracking (e.g., SOT and VOS) and category tracking (e.g., MOT, MOTS, and VIS) tasks. Different definitions have led to divergent solutions for these two types of tasks, resulting in redundant training expenses and parameter overhead. In this paper, combing the advantages of the best practices developed in both communities, we propose a novel tracking-with-detection paradigm, where tracking supplements appearance priors for detection and detection provides tracking with candidate bounding boxes for the association. Equipped with such a design, a unified tracking model, OmniTracker, is further presented to resolve all the tracking tasks with a fully shared network architecture, model weights, and inference pipeline, eliminating the need for task-specific architectures and reducing redundancy in model parameters. We conduct extensive experimentation on seven prominent tracking datasets of different tracking tasks, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, DAVIS16-17, MOT17, MOTS20, and YTVIS19, and demonstrate that OmniTracker achieves on-par or even better results than both task-specific and unified tracking models.},

  abstract     = {Transformer-based methods have exhibited remarkable potential in single image super-resolution (SISR) by effectively extracting long-range dependencies. However, most of the current research in this area has prioritized the design of transformer blocks to capture global information, while overlooking the importance of incorporating high-frequency priors, which we believe could be beneficial. In our study, we conducted a series of experiments and found that transformer structures are more adept at capturing low-frequency information, but have limited capacity in constructing high-frequency representations when compared to their convolutional counterparts. Our proposed solution, the cross-refinement adaptive feature modulation transformer (CRAFT), integrates the strengths of both convolutional and transformer structures. It comprises three key components: the high-frequency enhancement residual block (HFERB) for extracting high-frequency information, the shift rectangle window attention block (SRWAB) for capturing global information, and the hybrid fusion block (HFB) for refining the global representation. To tackle the inherent intricacies of transformer structures, we introduce a frequency-guided post-training quantization (PTQ) method aimed at enhancing CRAFT&#39;s efficiency. These strategies incorporate adaptive dual clipping and boundary refinement. To further amplify the versatility of our proposed approach, we extend our PTQ strategy to function as a general quantization method for transformer-based SISR techniques. Our experimental findings showcase CRAFT&#39;s superiority over current state-of-the-art methods, both in full-precision and quantization scenarios. These results underscore the efficacy and universality of our PTQ strategy.},

This is followed by the Kinematic Bicycle Model which ensures that reconstructed trajectory predictions adhere strictly to physical laws governing vehicular motion. The integration of these physics-based insights with a subsequent machine learning stage, featuring a Quantum Mechanics-Inspired Interaction-aware Module, allows for sophisticated modeling of complex vehicle interactions.

However, previous work has shown that most feature-level adaptation methods, which employ adversarial training and are validated on synthetic-to-real adaptation, provide marginal gains in condition-level adaptation, being outperformed by simple pixel-level adaptation via stylization. Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage stylization in performing feature-level adaptation by aligning the internal network features extracted by the encoder of the network from the original and the stylized view of each input image with a novel feature invariance loss. In this way, we encourage the encoder to extract features that are already invariant to the style of the input, allowing the decoder to focus on parsing these features and not on further abstracting from the specific style of the input. We implement our method, named Condition-Invariant Semantic Segmentation (CISS), on the current state-of-the-art domain adaptation architecture and achieve outstanding results on condition-level adaptation. In particular, CISS sets the new state of the art in the popular daytime-to-nighttime Cityscapes $\to$ Dark Zurich benchmark. Furthermore, our method achieves the second-best performance on the normal-to-adverse Cityscapes $\to$ ACDC benchmark. CISS is shown to generalize well to domains unseen during training, such as BDD100K-night and ACDC-night.},

A common approach is to learn efficient representations through future prediction tasks, facilitating the agent to make farsighted decisions that benefit its long-term performance. Existing methods extract predictive features by predicting multi-step future state signals. However, they do not fully exploit the structural information inherent in sequential state signals, which can potentially improve the quality of long-term decision-making but is difficult to discern in the time domain. To tackle this problem, we introduce a new perspective that leverages the frequency domain of state sequences to extract the underlying patterns in time series data. We theoretically show that state sequences contain structural information closely tied to policy performance and signal regularity and analyze the fitness of the frequency domain for extracting these two types of structural information. Inspired by that, we propose a novel representation learning method, State Sequences Prediction via Fourier Transform (SPF), which extracts long-term features by predicting the Fourier transform of infinite-step future state sequences. The appealing features of our frequency prediction objective include: 1) simple to implement due to a recursive relationship; 2) providing an upper bound on the performance difference between the optimal policy and the latent policy in the representation space. Experiments on standard and goal-conditioned RL tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {Detecting 3D objects from a monocular camera in mobile applications, such as on a vehicle, drone, or robot, is a crucial but challenging task. The monocular vision’s near-far disparity and the camera’s constantly changing position make it difficult to achieve high accuracy, especially for distant objects. In this paper, we propose a new Mono3D framework named MoGDE, which takes inspiration from the observation that an object’s depth can be inferred from the ground’s depth underneath it. MoGDE estimates the corresponding ground depth of an image and utilizes this information to guide Mono3D. We use a pose detection network to estimate the camera’s orientation and construct a feature map that represents pixel-level ground depth based on the 3D-to-2D perspective geometry. To further improve Mono3D with the estimated ground depth, we design an RGB-D feature fusion network based on transformer architecture. The long-range self-attention mechanism is utilized to identify ground-contacting points and pin the corresponding ground depth to the image feature map. We evaluate MoGDE on the KITTI dataset, and the results show that it significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of Mono3D for both near and far objects. MoGDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and ranks first among the pure image-based methods on the KITTI 3D benchmark.},

  abstract     = {This work develops and analyzes a class of adaptive biased stochastic optimization (ABSO) algorithms from the perspective of the GEneralized Adaptive gRadient (GEAR) method that contains Adam, AdaGrad, RMSProp, etc. Particularly, two preferred biased stochastic optimization (BSO) algorithms, the biased stochastic variance reduction gradient (BSVRG) algorithm and the stochastic recursive gradient algorithm (SARAH), equipped with GEAR, are first considered in this work, leading to two ABSO algorithms: BSVRG-GEAR and SARAH-GEAR. We present a uniform analysis of ABSO algorithms for minimizing strongly convex (SC) and Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) composite objective functions. Second, we also use our framework to develop another novel BSO algorithm, adaptive biased stochastic conjugate gradient (coined BSCG-GEAR), which achieves the well-known oracle complexity. Specifically, under mild conditions, we prove that the resulting ABSO algorithms attain a linear convergence rate on both PŁ and SC cases. Moreover, we show that the complexity of the resulting ABSO algorithms is comparable to that of advanced stochastic gradient-based algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical superiority and the numerical stability of the resulting ABSO algorithms by conducting numerical experiments on different applications of machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Handwriting verification has stood as a steadfast identity authentication method for decades. However, this technique risks potential privacy breaches due to the inclusion of personal information in handwritten biometrics such as signatures. To address this concern, we propose using the Random Digit String (RDS) for privacy-preserving handwriting verification. This approach allows users to authenticate themselves by writing an arbitrary digit sequence, effectively ensuring privacy protection. To evaluate the effectiveness of RDS, we construct a new HRDS4BV dataset composed of online naturally handwritten RDS. Unlike conventional handwriting, RDS encompasses unconstrained and variable content, posing significant challenges for modeling consistent personal writing style. To surmount this, we propose the Pattern Attentive VErification Network (PAVENet), along with a Discriminative Pattern Mining (DPM) module. DPM adaptively enhances the recognition of consistent and discriminative writing patterns, thus refining handwriting style representation. Through comprehensive evaluations, we scrutinize the applicability of online RDS verification and showcase a pronounced outperformance of our model over existing methods. Furthermore, we discover a noteworthy forgery phenomenon that deviates from prior findings and discuss its positive impact in countering malicious impostor attacks. Substantially, our work underscores the feasibility of privacy-preserving biometric verification and propels the prospects of its broader acceptance and application.},

Among recent works, UniMatch (Yang et al. 2023) improves its precedents tremendously by amplifying the practice of weak-to-strong consistency regularization. Subsequent works typically follow similar pipelines and propose various delicate designs. Despite the achieved progress, strangely, even in this flourishing era of numerous powerful vision models, almost all SSS works are still sticking to 1) using outdated ResNet encoders with small-scale ImageNet-1 K pre-training, and 2) evaluation on simple Pascal and Cityscapes datasets. In this work, we argue that, it is necessary to switch the baseline of SSS from ResNet-based encoders to more capable ViT-based encoders (e.g., DINOv2) that are pre-trained on massive data. A simple update on the encoder (even using 2× fewer parameters) can bring more significant improvement than careful method designs. Built on this competitive baseline, we present our upgraded and simplified UniMatch V2, inheriting the core spirit of weak-to-strong consistency from V1, but requiring less training cost and providing consistently better results. Additionally, witnessing the gradually saturated performance on Pascal and Cityscapes, we appeal that we should focus on more challenging benchmarks with complex taxonomy, such as ADE20K and COCO datasets.},

  abstract     = {Generating diverse and high-quality 3D assets automatically poses a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D computer vision. Despite extensive efforts in 3D generation, existing optimization-based approaches struggle to produce large-scale 3D assets efficiently. Meanwhile, feed-forward methods often focus on generating only a single category or a few categories, limiting their generalizability. Therefore, we introduce a diffusion-based feed-forward framework to address these challenges with a single model. To handle the large diversity and complexity in geometry and texture across categories efficiently, we 1) adopt improved triplane to guarantee efficiency; 2) introduce the 3D-aware transformer to aggregate the generalized 3D knowledge with specialized 3D features; and 3) devise the 3D-aware encoder/decoder to enhance the generalized 3D knowledge. Building upon our 3D-aware Diffusion model with TransFormer, DiffTF, we propose a stronger version for 3D generation, i.e., DiffTF++. It boils down to two parts: multi-view reconstruction loss and triplane refinement. Specifically, we utilize multi-view reconstruction loss to fine-tune the diffusion model and triplane decoder, thereby avoiding the negative influence caused by reconstruction errors and improving texture synthesis. By eliminating the mismatch between the two stages, the generative performance is enhanced, especially in texture. Additionally, a 3D-aware refinement process is introduced to filter out artifacts and refine triplanes, resulting in the generation of more intricate and reasonable details. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet and OmniObject3D convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules and the state-of-the-art 3D object generation performance with large diversity, rich semantics, and high quality.},

Conventional data augmentation methods aimed at enhancing corruption robustness typically apply random transformations to all point cloud samples offline, neglecting sample structure, which often leads to over- or under-enhancement. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to address this issue by employing sample-adaptive transformations based on sample structure, through an auto-augmentation framework named AdaptPoint++. Central to this framework is an imitator, which initiates with Position-aware Feature Extraction to derive intrinsic structural information from the input sample. Subsequently, a Deformation Controller and a Mask Controller predict per-anchor deformation and per-point masking parameters, respectively, facilitating corruption simulations. In conjunction with the imitator, a discriminator is employed to curb the generation of excessive corruption that deviates from the original data distribution. Moreover, we integrate a perception-guidance feedback mechanism to steer the generation of samples towards an appropriate difficulty level. To effectively train the classifier using the generated augmented samples, we introduce a Structure Reconstruction-assisted learning mechanism, bolstering the classifier&#39;s robustness by prioritizing intrinsic structural characteristics over superficial discrepancies induced by corruption. Additionally, to alleviate the scarcity of real-world corrupted point cloud data, we introduce two novel datasets: ScanObjectNN-C and MVPNET-C, closely resembling actual data in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance on multiple corruption benchmarks.},

We show the following. 1) An $O(k)$-query algorithm to distinguish whether the given channel is $k$-junta channel or is far from any $k$-junta channels, and a lower bound $\Omega (\sqrt{k})$ on the number of queries and 2) An $\widetilde{O}( 4^{k} )$-query algorithm to learn a $k$-junta channel, and a lower bound $\Omega ( 4^{k}/k )$ on the number of queries. This partially answers an open problem raised by (Chen et al. 2023). In order to settle these problems, we develop a Fourier analysis framework over the space of superoperators and prove several fundamental properties, which extends the Fourier analysis over the space of operators introduced in (Montanaro and Osborne, 2010). The distance metric we consider in this paper is obtained by Fourier analysis, which is essentially the L2-distance between Choi representations. Besides, we introduce Influence-Sample to replace Fourier-Sample proposed in(Atici and Servedio, 2007).

This work addresses two major challenges in realizing this vision: the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs, and the high training costs of SNNs. We identify intrinsic flaws in spiking neurons caused by binary firing mechanisms and propose a Spike Firing Approximation (SFA) method using integer training and spike-driven inference. This optimizes the spike firing pattern of spiking neurons, enhancing efficient training, reducing power consumption, improving performance, enabling easier scaling, and better utilizing neuromorphic chips. We also develop an efficient spike-driven Transformer architecture and a spike-masked autoencoder to prevent performance degradation during SNN scaling. On ImageNet-1k, we achieve state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 78.5%, 79.8%, 84.0%, and 86.2% with models containing 10 M, 19 M, 83 M, and 173 M parameters, respectively. For instance, the 10 M model outperforms the best existing SNN by 7.2% on ImageNet, with training time acceleration and inference energy efficiency improved by 4.5× and 3.9×, respectively. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method across various tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and neuromorphic vision tasks. This work enables SNNs to match ANN performance while maintaining the low-power advantage, marking a significant step towards SNNs as a general visual backbone.},

  abstract     = {Text spotting, a task involving the extraction of textual information from image or video sequences, faces challenges in cross-domain adaption, such as image-to-image and image-to-video generalization. In this paper, we introduce a new method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the model by achieving better synergy among different tasks. Typically, we propose a Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively convert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for both image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters. The Prompt Queries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different tasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable features for each task. Additionally, to further enable the model to learn temporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset (VTD-368 k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm. Notably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of 2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and TT-to-CTW1500. For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses the previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2 by an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data. We further demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations in generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model which requires significantly fewer parameters and data.},

Motivated by the recent success of discrete Ricci curvature in graph neural network (GNNs), we propose TorGNN, an analytic Torsion enhanced Graph Neural Network model. The essential idea is to characterize graph local structures with an analytic torsion based weight formula. Mathematically, analytic torsion is a topological invariant that can distinguish spaces which are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic. In our TorGNN, for each edge, a corresponding local simplicial complex is identified, then the analytic torsion (for this local simplicial complex) is calculated, and further used as a weight (for this edge) in message-passing process. Our TorGNN model is validated on link prediction tasks from sixteen different types of networks and node classification tasks from four types of networks. It has been found that our TorGNN can achieve superior performance on both tasks, and outperform various state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that analytic torsion is a highly efficient topological invariant in the characterization of graph structures and can significantly boost the performance of GNNs.},

  abstract     = {Recently, video-language understanding has achieved great success through large-scale pre-training. However, data scarcity remains a prevailing challenge. This study quantitatively reveals an “impossible trinity” among data quantity, diversity, and quality in pre-training datasets. Recent efforts seek to refine large-scale, diverse ASR datasets compromised by low quality through synthetic annotations. These methods successfully refine the original annotations by leveraging useful information in multimodal video content (frames, tags, ASR transcripts, etc.). Nevertheless, they struggle to mitigate noise within synthetic annotations and lack scalability as the dataset size expands. To address these issues, we introduce the Video DataFlywheel framework, which iteratively refines video annotations with improved noise control methods. For iterative refinement, we first leverage a video-language model to generate synthetic annotations, resulting in a refined dataset. Then, we pre-train on it and fine-tune on human refinement examples for a stronger model. These processes are repeated for continuous improvement. For noise control, we present AdaTaiLr, a novel method that requires weaker assumptions on noise distribution. This method proves more effective in large datasets and offers theoretical guarantees. The combination of iterative refinement and AdaTaiLr can achieve better scalability in video-language understanding. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing data refinement baselines, delivering a 3% performance boost and improving dataset quality with minimal diversity loss. Furthermore, our refined dataset facilitates significant improvements in various video-language understanding tasks, including video question answering and text-video retrieval.},

  abstract     = {Subspace learning and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are two critical techniques in pattern recognition, playing pivotal roles in feature extraction and classification. However, how to learn the optimal subspace such that the SVM classifier can perform the best is still a challenging problem due to the difficulty in optimization, computation, and algorithm convergence. To address these problems, this paper develops a novel method named Optimal Discriminant Support Vector Machine (ODSVM), which integrates support vector classification with discriminative subspace learning in a seamless framework. As a result, the most discriminative subspace and the corresponding optimal SVM are obtained simultaneously to pursue the best classification performance. The efficient optimization framework is designed for binary and multi-class ODSVM. Moreover, a fast sequential minimization optimization (SMO) algorithm with pruning is proposed to accelerate the computation in multi-class ODSVM. Unlike other related methods, ODSVM has a strong theoretical guarantee of global convergence, highlighting its superiority and stability. Numerical experiments are conducted on thirteen datasets and the results demonstrate that ODSVM outperforms existing methods with statistical significance.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods.},

The main idea behind our approach is leveraging the domain-neutral capabilities of CLIP as a bridging mechanism, while utilizing a separate module to extract abstract, domain-agnostic semantics from the embeddings of both the source and target realms. Fusing these abstract semantics with target-specific semantics results in a transformed embedding within the CLIP space. To bridge the gap between the disparate worlds of CLIP and StyleGAN, we introduce a new non-linear mapper, the CLIP2P mapper. Utilizing CLIP embeddings, this module is tailored to approximate the latent distribution in the StyleGAN&#39;s latent space, effectively acting as a connector between these two spaces. The proposed UniTranslator is versatile and capable of performing various tasks, including style mixing, stylization, and translations, even in visually challenging scenarios across different visual domains. Notably, UniTranslator generates high-quality translations that showcase domain relevance, diversity, and improved image quality. UniTranslator surpasses the performance of existing general-purpose models and performs well against specialized models in representative tasks.},

To improve the naturalness and aggressiveness of existing adversarial patches, location-aware patches are proposed, where the patch&#39;s location on the target object is integrated into the optimization process to perform attacks. Although it is effective, efficiently finding the optimal location for placing the patches is challenging, especially under the black-box attack settings. In this paper, we first empirically find that the aggregation regions of adversarial patch&#39;s locations to show effective attacks for the same facial image are pretty similar across different face recognition models. Based on this observation, we then propose a novel framework called Distribution-Optimized Adversarial Patch (DOPatch) to efficiently search for the aggregation regions in a distribution modeling way. Using the distribution prior, we further design two query-based black-box attack methods: Location Optimization Attack (DOP-LOA) and Distribution Transfer Attack (DOP-DTA) to attack unseen face recognition models. We finally evaluate the proposed methods on various SOTA face recognition models and image recognition models (including the popular big models) to demonstrate our effectiveness and generalization. We also conduct extensive ablation studies and analyses to provide insights into the distribution of adversarial locations.},

In particular, we first design an adaptive transformer conditional network, specifically designed for integration into a Denoising Network, which facilitates iterative refinement of the saliency masks. Second, based on the classical diffusion model training, we investigate a variance noise schedule and a structure corruption strategy, which aim to enhance the accuracy of our denoising model by effectively handling uncertain input. Third, we introduce a Consensus Time Ensemble technique, which integrates intermediate predictions using a sampling mechanism, thus reducing overconfidence and incorrect predictions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets that show that: 1) the efficacy and universality of our method is demonstrated in both camouflaged and salient object detection tasks. 2) compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, CamoDiffusion demonstrates superior performance 3) CamoDiffusion offers flexible enhancements, such as an accelerated version based on the VQ-VAE model and a skip approach.},

In this paper, we propose the first latent weight quantization schema for general integerized training, which minimizes quantization perturbation to training process via residual quantization with optimized dual quantizer. We leverage residual quantization to eliminate the correlation between latent weight and integerized weight for suppressing quantization noise. We further propose dual quantizer with optimal nonuniform codebook to avoid frozen weight and ensure statistically unbiased training trajectory as full-precision latent weight. The codebook is optimized to minimize the disturbance on weight update under importance guidance and achieved with a three-segment polyline approximation for hardware-friendly implementation. Extensive experiments show that the proposed schema allows integerized training with lowest 4-bit latent weight for various architectures including ResNets, MobileNetV2, and Transformers, and yields negligible performance loss in image classification and text generation. Furthermore, we successfully fine-tune Large Language Models with up to 13 billion parameters on one single GPU using the proposed schema.},

The second branch conducts pairwise comparisons via the MAE, and a training-free logarithmic summation of both branches derives the final score. Our approach contributes in three ways. First, integrating the KRSA with pairwise comparisons enhances the model’s perceptual awareness. Second, our approach is adaptable to diverse network architectures. Third, our approach can guide perceptual image enhancement. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets validate our method’s efficacy, demonstrating that perceptual deformation widely exists in diverse IQA scenarios and that measuring the joint degradation effect can discern appealing content deformations.},

However, existing task-driven IQE models tend to overlook an underlying fact–different levels of vision tasks have varying and sometimes conflicting requirements of image features. To address this problem, this paper proposes a generalized gradient promotion (GradProm) training strategy for task-driven IQE of medical images. Specifically, we partition a task-driven IQE system into two sub-models, i.e., a mainstream model for image enhancement and an auxiliary model for visual recognition. During training, GradProm updates only parameters of the image enhancement model using gradients of the visual recognition model and the image enhancement model, but only when gradients of these two sub-models are aligned in the same direction, which is measured by their cosine similarity. In case gradients of these two sub-models are not in the same direction, GradProm only uses the gradient of the image enhancement model to update its parameters. Theoretically, we have proved that the optimization direction of the image enhancement model will not be biased by the auxiliary visual recognition model under the implementation of GradProm. Empirically, extensive experimental results on four public yet challenging medical image datasets demonstrated the superior performance of GradProm over existing state-of-the-art methods.},

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Neuromorphic Shutter Control (NSC) system to avoid motion blur and alleviate instant noise, where the extremely low latency of events is leveraged to monitor the real-time motion and facilitate the scene-adaptive exposure. Furthermore, to stabilize the inconsistent Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) caused by the non-uniform exposure times, we propose an event-based image denoising network within a self-supervised learning paradigm, i.e., SEID, exploring the statistics of image noise and inter-frame motion information of events to obtain artificial supervision signals for high-quality imaging in real-world scenes. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed NSC, we implement it in hardware by building a hybrid-camera imaging prototype system, with which we collect a real-world dataset containing well-synchronized frames and events in diverse scenarios with different target scenes and motion patterns.

  abstract     = {Recovering whole-body mesh by inferring the abstract pose and shape parameters from visual content can obtain 3D bodies with realistic structures. However, the inferring process is highly non-linear and suffers from image-mesh misalignment, resulting in inaccurate reconstruction. In contrast, 3D keypoint estimation methods utilize the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level accuracy but may predict unrealistic body structures. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution, HybrIK, that integrates the merits of 3D keypoint estimation and body mesh recovery in a unified framework. HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to body-part rotations via twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotations are analytically solved with 3D joints, while the twist rotations are derived from visual cues through neural networks. To capture comprehensive whole-body details, we further develop a holistic framework, HybrIK-X, which enhances HybrIK with articulated hands and an expressive face. HybrIK-X is fast and accurate by solving the whole-body pose with a one-stage model. Experiments demonstrate that HybrIK and HybrIK-X preserve both the accuracy of 3D joints and the realistic structure of the parametric human model, leading to pixel-aligned whole-body mesh recovery. The proposed method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks for body-only, hand-only, and whole-body scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning, a discriminative self-learning framework, is one of the most popular representation learning methods which has a wide range of application scenarios. Although relative techniques have been continuously updated in recent years, designing and seeking positive pairs are still inevitable. Just because of the requirement of explicit positive pairs, the utilization of contrastive learning is restricted in dense, multi-modal, and other scenarios where positive pairs are difficult to obtain. To solve this problem, in this paper, we design an auto-pairing mechanism called Implicit Relation Circulation (IRC) for discriminative self-learning frameworks. Its core idea is to conduct a random walk among multiple feature groups we want to contrast but without explicit matchup, which we call the complex task (Task C). By linking the head and tail of the random walk to form a circulation with a simple task (task S) containing easy-obtaining pairs, we can apply cycle consistency as supervision guidance to gradually learn the wanted positive pairs among the random walk of feature groups automatically. We provide several amazing applications of IRC: we can learn 1) effective dense image pixel relations and representation with only image-level pairs; 2) 3D temporal point-level multi-modal point cloud relations and representation; and 3) even image representation with the help of language without off-the-shelf vision-language pairs. As an easy-to-use plug-and-play mechanism, we evaluate its universality and robustness with multiple self-learning algorithms, tasks, and datasets, achieving stable and significant improvements. As an illustrative example, IRC improves the SOTA performance by about 3.0 mIoU on image semantic segmentation, 1.5 mIoU on 3D segmentation, 1.3 mAP on 3D detection, and an average of 1.2 top1 accuracy on image classification with the help of the auto-learned positive pairs. Importantly, these improvements are achieved with little parameter and computation overhead. We hope IRC can provide the community with new insight into discriminative self-learning.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal models have shown appealing performance in visual recognition tasks, as free-form text-guided training evokes the ability to understand fine-grained visual content. However, current models cannot be trivially applied to scene text recognition (STR) due to the compositional difference between natural and text images. We propose a novel instruction-guided scene text recognition (IGTR) paradigm that formulates STR as an instruction learning problem and understands text images by predicting character attributes, e.g., character frequency, position, etc. IGTR first devises $\left\langle condition,question,answer\right\rangle$ instruction triplets, providing rich and diverse descriptions of character attributes. To effectively learn these attributes through question-answering, IGTR develops a lightweight instruction encoder, a cross-modal feature fusion module and a multi-task answer head, which guides nuanced text image understanding. Furthermore, IGTR realizes different recognition pipelines simply by using different instructions, enabling a character-understanding-based text reasoning paradigm that differs from current methods considerably. Experiments on English and Chinese benchmarks show that IGTR outperforms existing models by significant margins, while maintaining a small model size and fast inference speed. Moreover, by adjusting the sampling of instructions, IGTR offers an elegant way to tackle the recognition of rarely appearing and morphologically similar characters, which were previous challenges.},

  abstract     = {In pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR), the loose umbrella term ‘attribute’ ranges from human soft-biometrics to wearing accessory, and even extending to various subjective body descriptors. As a result, the vast coverage of ‘attributes’ implies that, instead of being over-specialized to limited attributes with exclusive characteristic, PAR should be approached from a much fundamental perspective. To this end, given that most attributes are greatly under-represented in real-world datasets, we simply distill PAR into a visual task of multi-label recognition under significant data imbalance. Accordingly, we introduce feature re-sampled detached learning (FRDL) to decouple label-balanced learning from the curse of attributes co-occurrence. Specifically, FRDL is able to balance the sampling distribution of an attribute without biasing the label prior of co-occurring others. As a complementary method, we also propose gradient-oriented augment translating (GOAT) to alleviate the feature noise and semantics imbalance aggravated in FRDL. Integrated in a highly unified framework, FRDL and GOAT substantially refresh the state-of-the-art performance on various realistic benchmarks, while maintaining a minimal computational budget. Further analytical discussion and experimental evidence corroborate the veracity of our advancement: this is the first work that establishes labels-independent and impartial balanced learning for PAR.},

Data corruption is unavoidable due to factors, such as random noise, compression artifacts, or environmental conditions in real-world deployment, drastically crippling the entire federated system. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Robust Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning (RAHFL) framework. We propose a Diversity-enhanced supervised Contrastive Learning technique to enhance the resilience and adaptability of local models on various data corruption patterns. Its basic idea is to utilize complex augmented samples obtained by the mixed-data augmentation strategy for supervised contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to learn robust and diverse feature representations. Furthermore, we design an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning strategy to resist corrupt feedback from external clients. The strategy allows clients to perform selective one-way learning during collaborative learning phase, enabling clients to refrain from incorporating lower-quality information from less robust or underperforming collaborators. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in diverse, challenging federated learning environments.},

  abstract     = {Post-training quantization (PTQ) for vision transformers (ViTs) has received increasing attention from both academic and industrial communities due to its minimal data needs and high time efficiency. However, many current methods fail to account for the complex interactions between quantized weights and activations, resulting in significant quantization errors and suboptimal performance. This paper presents ERQ, an innovative two-step PTQ method specifically crafted to reduce quantization errors arising from activation and weight quantization sequentially. The first step, Activation quantization error reduction (Aqer), first applies Reparameterization Initialization aimed at mitigating initial quantization errors in high-variance activations. Then, it further mitigates the errors by formulating a Ridge Regression problem, which updates the weights maintained at full-precision using a closed-form solution. The second step, Weight quantization error reduction (Wqer), first applies Dual Uniform Quantization to handle weights with numerous outliers, which arise from adjustments made during Reparameterization Initialization, thereby reducing initial weight quantization errors. Then, it employs an iterative approach to further tackle the errors. In each iteration, it adopts Rounding Refinement that uses an empirically derived, efficient proxy to refine the rounding directions of quantized weights, complemented by a Ridge Regression solver to reduce the errors. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate ERQ’s superior performance across various ViTs variants and tasks. For example, ERQ surpasses the state-of-the-art GPTQ by a notable 36.81% in accuracy for W3A4 ViT-S.},

  abstract     = {Tensorial Multi-view Clustering (TMC), a prominent approach in multi-view clustering, leverages low-rank tensor learning to capture high-order correlation among views for consistent clustering structure identification. Despite its promising performance, the TMC algorithms face three key challenges: 1). The severe computational burden makes it difficult for TMC methods to handle large-scale datasets. 2). Estimation bias problem caused by the convex surrogate of the tensor rank. 3). Lack of explicit balance of consistency and complementarity. Being aware of these, we propose a basic framework Efficient and Scalable Tensorial Multi-View Subspace Clustering (ESTMC) for large-scale multi-view clustering. ESTMC integrates anchor representation learning and non-convex function-based low-rank tensor learning with a Generalized Non-convex Tensor Rank (GNTR) into a unified objective function, which enhances the efficiency of the existing subspace-based TMC framework. Furthermore, a novel model ESTMC-C$^{2}$ with the proposed Enhanced Tensor Rank (ETR), Consistent Geometric Regularization (CGR), and Tensorial Exclusive Regularization (TER) is extended to balance the learning of consistency and complementarity among views, delivering divisible representations for the clustering task. Efficient iterative optimization algorithms are designed to solve the proposed ESTMC and ESTMC-C$^{2}$, which enjoy time-economical complexity and exhibit theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms as compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims at predicting relations of all entity pairs in one document, which plays an important role in information extraction. DocRE is more challenging than previous sentence-level relation extraction, as it often requires coreference and logical reasoning across multiple sentences. Graph-based methods are the mainstream solution to this complex reasoning in DocRE. They generally construct the heterogeneous graphs with entities, mentions, and sentences as nodes, co-occurrence and co-reference relations as edges. Their performance is difficult to further break through because the semantics and direction of the relation are not jointly considered in graph inference process. To this end, we propose a novel translation-guided double-graph inference network named TDGI for DocRE. On one hand, TDGI includes two relation semantics-aware and direction-aware reasoning graphs, i.e., mention graph and entity graph, to mine relations among long-distance entities more explicitly. Each graph consists of three elements: vectorized nodes, edges, and direction weights. On the other hand, we devise an interesting translation-based graph updating strategy that guides the embeddings of mention/entity nodes, relation edges, and direction weights following the specific translation algebraic structure, thereby to enhance the reasoning skills of TDGI. In the training procedure of TDGI, we minimize the relation multi-classification loss and triple contrastive loss together to guarantee the model’s stability and robustness. Comprehensive experiments on three widely-used datasets show that TDGI achieves outstanding performance comparing with state-of-the-art baselines.},

After that, we propose an innovative network architecture based on the ISN algorithm for blind image restoration, namely DeepSN-Net. To the best of our knowledge, DeepSN-Net is the first successful endeavor to design a second-order deep unfolding network for image restoration, which fills the blank of this area. Furthermore, it offers several distinct advantages: 1) DeepSN-Net provides a unified framework to a variety of image restoration tasks in both synthetic and real-world contexts, without imposing constraints on the degradation conditions. 2) The network architecture is meticulously aligned with the ISN algorithm, ensuring that each module possesses robust physical interpretability. 3) The network exhibits high learning efficiency, superior restoration accuracy and good generalization ability across 11 datasets on three typical restoration tasks.

  abstract     = {The performance gap between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) persists due to the lack of inductive bias, notably when training from scratch with limited datasets. This paper identifies two crucial shortcomings in ViTs: spatial relevance and diverse channel representation. Thus, ViTs struggle to grasp fine-grained spatial features and robust channel representation due to insufficient data. We propose the Dynamic Hybrid Vision Transformer (DHVT) to address these challenges. Regarding the spatial aspect, DHVT introduces convolution in the feature embedding phase and feature projection modules to enhance spatial relevance. Regarding the channel aspect, the dynamic aggregation mechanism and a groundbreaking design “head token” facilitate the recalibration and harmonization of disparate channel representations. Moreover, we investigate the choices of the network meta-structure and adopt the optimal multi-stage hybrid structure without the conventional class token. The methods are then modified with a novel dimensional variable residual connection mechanism to leverage the potential of the structure sufficiently. This updated variant, called DHVT2, offers a more computationally efficient solution for vision-related tasks. DHVT and DHVT2 achieve state-of-the-art image recognition results, effectively bridging the performance gap between CNNs and ViTs. The downstream experiments further demonstrate their strong generalization capacities.},

Recent advances in learning-based systems have highlighted the importance of integrating prediction and planning.

To address these challenges, we introduce a Hybrid-Prediction integrated Planning (HPP) framework, which operates through three novel modules collaboratively. First, we introduce marginal-conditioned occupancy prediction to align joint occupancy with agent-specific motion forecasting. Our proposed MS-OccFormer module achieves spatial-temporal alignment with motion predictions across multiple granularities. Second, we propose a game-theoretic motion predictor, GTFormer, to model the interactive dynamics among agents based on their joint predictive awareness. Third, hybrid prediction patterns are concurrently integrated into the Ego Planner and optimized by prediction guidance. The HPP framework establishes state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating superior accuracy and safety in end-to-end configurations. Moreover, HPP’s interactive open-loop and closed-loop planning performance are demonstrated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and CARLA benchmark, outperforming existing integrated pipelines by achieving enhanced consistency between prediction and planning.},

  abstract     = {In the context of incremental learning, a network is sequentially trained on a stream of tasks, where data from previous tasks are particularly assumed to be inaccessible. The major challenge is how to overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma, i.e., learning knowledge from new tasks without forgetting the knowledge of previous tasks. To this end, we propose two mathematical conditions for guaranteeing network stability and plasticity with theoretical analysis. The conditions demonstrate that we can restrict the parameter update in the null space of uncentered feature covariance at each linear layer to overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma, which can be realized by layerwise projecting gradient into the null space. Inspired by it, we develop two algorithms, dubbed Adam-NSCL and Adam-SFCL respectively, for incremental learning. Adam-NSCL and Adam-SFCL provide different ways to compute the projection matrix. The projection matrix in Adam-NSCL is constructed by singular vectors associated with the smallest singular values of the uncentered feature covariance matrix, while the projection matrix in Adam-SFCL is constructed by all singular vectors associated with adaptive scaling factors. Additionally, we explore adopting self-supervised techniques, including self-supervised label augmentation and a newly proposed contrastive loss, to improve the performance of incremental learning. These self-supervised techniques are orthogonal to Adam-NSCL and Adam-SFCL and can be incorporated with them seamlessly, leading to Adam-NSCL-SSL and Adam-SFCL-SSL respectively. The proposed algorithms are applied to task-incremental and class-incremental learning on various benchmark datasets with multiple backbones, and the results show that they outperform the compared incremental learning methods.},

However, the hand-crafted priors and conventional optimization algorithm adopted to solve the layer decomposition problem result in the lack of adaptivity and efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a Retinex-based deep unfolding network (URetinex-Net++), which unfolds an optimization problem into a learnable network to decompose a low-light image into reflectance and illumination layers. By formulating the decomposition problem as an implicit priors regularized model, three learning-based modules are carefully designed, responsible for data-dependent initialization, high-efficient unfolding optimization, and fairly-flexible component adjustment, respectively. Particularly, the proposed unfolding optimization module, introducing two networks to adaptively fit implicit priors in the data-driven manner, can realize noise suppression and details preservation for decomposed components. URetinex-Net++ is a further augmented version of URetinex-Net, which introduces a cross-stage fusion block to alleviate the color defect in URetinex-Net. Therefore, boosted performance on LLIE can be obtained in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, where only a few parameters are introduced and little time is cost. Extensive experiments on real-world low-light images qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed URetinex-Net++ over state-of-the-art methods.},

However, existing solutions for editing facial geometry and appearance independently usually require retraining and are not optimized for the recent work of generation, thus tending to lag behind the generation process. To address these issues, we introduce NeRFFaceEditing, which enables editing and decoupling geometry and appearance in the pretrained tri-plane-based neural radiance field while retaining its high quality and fast inference speed. Our key idea for disentanglement is to use the statistics of the tri-plane to represent the high-level appearance of its corresponding facial volume. Moreover, we leverage a generated 3D-continuous semantic mask as an intermediary for geometry editing. We devise a geometry decoder (whose output is unchanged when the appearance changes) and an appearance decoder. The geometry decoder aligns the original facial volume with the semantic mask volume. We also enhance the disentanglement by explicitly regularizing rendered images with the same appearance but different geometry to be similar in terms of color distribution for each facial component separately. Our method allows users to edit via semantic masks with decoupled control of geometry and appearance. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superior geometry and appearance control abilities of our method compared to existing and alternative solutions.},

  abstract     = {Consistency and complementarity are two key ingredients for boosting multi-view clustering (MVC). Recently with the introduction of popular contrastive learning, the consistency learning of views has been further enhanced in MVC, leading to promising performance. However, by contrast, the complementarity has not received sufficient attention except just in the feature facet, where the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion term or the independent encoder-decoder network is usually adopted to capture view-specific information. This motivates us to reconsider the complementarity learning of views comprehensively from multiple facets including the feature-, view-label- and contrast- facets, while maintaining the view consistency. We empirically find that all the facets contribute to the complementarity learning, especially the view-label facet, which is usually neglected by existing methods. Based on this, a simple yet effective Multifacet Complementarity learning framework for Multi-View Clustering (MCMVC) is naturally developed, which fuses multifacet complementarity information, especially explicitly embedding the view-label information. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use view-labels explicitly to guide the complementarity learning of views. Compared with the SOTA baselines, MCMVC achieves remarkable improvements, e.g., by average margins over 5.00% and 7.00% respectively in complete and incomplete MVC settings on Caltech101-20 in terms of three evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose RankFeat, a simple yet effective post hoc approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature. RankFeat achieves state-of-the-art performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90% compared with the previous best method. The success of RankFeat motivates us to investigate whether a similar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We thus propose RankWeight which removes the rank-1 weight from the parameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our RankWeight is also post hoc and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a standalone approach, RankWeight has very competitive performance against other methods across various backbones. Moreover, RankWeight enjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The combination of RankWeight and RankFeat refreshes the new state-of-the-art performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses are presented to support the empirical results.},

Recurrent neural networks, the widely used framework in deep learning, suffer from the gradient vanishing and exploding problem, which limits their ability to learn long-term dependencies. To address this challenge, in this work, we develop the sequential model of Quantum Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNNs). This model naturally integrates the gating mechanism into the framework of the variational ansatz circuit of QNNs, enabling efficient execution on near-term quantum devices. We present rigorous proof that QGRNNs can preserve the gradient norm of long-term interactions throughout the recurrent network, enabling efficient learning of long-term dependencies. Meanwhile, the architectural features of QGRNNs can effectively mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon. The effectiveness of QGRNNs in sequential learning is convincingly demonstrated through various typical tasks, including solving the adding problem, learning gene regulatory networks, and predicting stock prices. The hardware-efficient architecture and superior performance of our QGRNNs indicate their promising potential for finding quantum advantageous applications in the near term.},

  abstract     = {The rising importance of 3D representation learning, pivotal in computer vision, autonomous driving, and robotics, is evident. However, a prevailing trend, which straightforwardly resorted to transferring 2D alignment strategies to the 3D domain, encounters three distinct challenges: (1) Information Degradation: This arises from the alignment of 3D data with mere single-view 2D images and generic texts, neglecting the need for multi-view images and detailed subcategory texts. (2) Insufficient Synergy: These strategies align 3D representations to image and text features individually, hampering the overall optimization for 3D models. (3) Underutilization: The fine-grained information inherent in the learned representations is often not fully exploited, indicating a potential loss in detail. To address these issues, we introduce JM3D, a comprehensive approach integrating point cloud, text, and image. Key contributions include the Structured Multimodal Organizer (SMO), enriching vision-language representation with multiple views and hierarchical text, and the Joint Multi-modal Alignment (JMA), combining language understanding with visual representation. Our advanced model, JM3D-LLM, marries 3D representation with large language models via efficient fine-tuning. Evaluations on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN establish JM3D&#39;s superiority. The superior performance of JM3D-LLM further underscores the effectiveness of our representation transfer approach.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems have been widely employed on various online platforms to improve user experience. In these systems, recommendation models are often learned from the users’ historical behaviors that are automatically collected. Notably, recommender systems differ slightly from ordinary supervised learning tasks. In recommender systems, there is an exposure mechanism that decides which items could be presented to each specific user, which breaks the i.i.d assumption of supervised learning and brings biases into the recommendation models. In this paper, we focus on unbiased ranking loss weighted by inversed propensity scores (IPS), which are widely used in recommendations with implicit feedback labels. More specifically, we first highlight the fact that there is a gap between theory and practice in IPS-weighted unbiased loss. The existing pairwise loss could be theoretically unbiased by adopting an IPS weighting scheme. Unfortunately, the propensity scores are hard to estimate due to the inaccessibility of each user-item pair&#39;s true exposure status. In practical scenarios, we can only approximate the propensity scores. In this way, the theoretically unbiased loss would be still practically biased. To solve this problem, we first construct a theoretical framework to obtain a generalization upper bound of the current theoretically unbiased loss. The bound illustrates that we can ensure the theoretically unbiased loss&#39;s generalization ability if we lower its implementation loss and practical bias at the same time. To that aim, we suggest treating feedback label $Y_{ui}$ as a noisy proxy for exposure result $O_{ui}$ for each user-item pair $(u, i)$. Here we assume the noise rate meets the condition that $\hat{P}(O_{ui}=1, Y_{ui}\ne O_{ui}) &amp;lt; 1/2$. According to our analysis, this is a mild assumption that can be satisfied by many real-world applications. Based on this, we could train an accurate propensity model directly by leveraging a noise-resistant loss function. Then we could construct a practically unbiased recommendation model weighted by precise propensity scores. Lastly, experimental findings on public datasets demonstrate our suggested method&#39;s effectiveness.},

Generally, these Big Data may be in a non-independently and identically distributed fashion (non-IID). In this paper, we have contributions in such a way enable multi-view k-means (MVKM) clustering to maintain the privacy of each database by allowing MVKM to be operated on the local principle of clients’ multi-view data. This work integrates the exponential distance to transform the weighted Euclidean distance on MVKM so that it can make full use of development in federated learning via the MVKM clustering algorithm. The proposed algorithm, called a federated MVKM (Fed-MVKM), can provide a whole new level adding a lot of new ideas to produce a much better output. The proposed Fed-MVKM is highly suitable for clustering large data sets. To demonstrate its efficient and applicable, we implement a synthetic and six real multi-view data sets and then perform Federated Peter-Clark in Huang et al. 2023 for causal inference setting to split the data instances over multiple clients, efficiently. The results show that shared-models based local cluster centers with data-driven in the federated environment can generate a satisfying final pattern of one multi-view data that simultaneously improve the clustering performance of (non-federated) MVKM clustering algorithms.},

First, to mitigate the undesirable impacts of the potential mode collapse while training the generator, we propose the joint-data optimization scheme, which utilizes both the synthesized data and the proxy data to optimize the surrogate model. Second, we propose the self-conditional data synthesis framework, an interesting effort that builds the pseudo-class mapping framework via grouping class information extraction to hold the class-specific constraints while holding the diversity. Within this new framework, we inherit and integrate the class-specific constraints of STDatav1 and design a dual cross-entropy loss to fit this new framework. Finally, to facilitate comprehensive evaluations, we perform experiments on four commonly adopted datasets, and a total of eight kinds of models are employed. These assessments witness the considerable performance gains compared to our early work and demonstrate the competitive ability and promising potential of our approach.},

This paper aims to identify the real gains of popular convolution and attention operators through a detailed study. We find that the key difference among these feature transformation modules, such as attention or convolution, lies in their spatial feature aggregation approach, known as the “spatial token mixer” (STM). To facilitate an impartial comparison, we introduce a unified architecture to neutralize the impact of divergent network-level and block-level designs. Subsequently, various STMs are integrated into this unified framework for comprehensive comparative analysis. Our experiments on various tasks and an analysis of inductive bias show a significant performance boost due to advanced network-level and block-level designs, but performance differences persist among different STMs. Our detailed analysis also reveals various findings about different STMs, including effective receptive fields, invariance, and adversarial robustness tests.},

Identifying the redundancy in the network and removing the redundant filters is an effective way to compress the CNN model size with a minimal reduction in performance. However, most of the existing redundancy-based pruning methods only consider the distance information between two filters, which can only model simple correlations between filters. Moreover, we point out that distance-based pruning methods are not applicable for high-dimensional features in CNN models by our experimental observations and analysis. To tackle this issue, we propose a new pruning strategy based on high-order spectral clustering. In this approach, we use hypergraph structure to construct complex correlations among filters, and obtain high-order information among filters by hypergraph structure learning. Finally, based on the high-order information, we can perform better clustering on the filters and remove the redundant filters in each cluster. Experiments on various CNN models and datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art works. For example, with ResNet50, we achieve a 57.1% FLOPs reduction with no accuracy drop on ImageNet, which is the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio.},

Traditional YOLO models, while powerful, have limitations in their neck designs that restrict the integration of cross-level features and the exploitation of high-order feature interrelationships. To address these challenges, we propose the Hypergraph Computation Empowered Semantic Collecting and Scattering (HGC-SCS) framework, which transposes visual feature maps into a semantic space and constructs a hypergraph for high-order message propagation. This enables the model to acquire both semantic and structural information, advancing beyond conventional feature-focused learning. Hyper-YOLO incorporates the proposed Mixed Aggregation Network (MANet) in its backbone for enhanced feature extraction and introduces the Hypergraph-Based Cross-Level and Cross-Position Representation Network (HyperC2Net) in its neck. HyperC2Net operates across five scales and breaks free from traditional grid structures, allowing for sophisticated high-order interactions across levels and positions. This synergy of components positions Hyper-YOLO as a state-of-the-art architecture in various scale models, as evidenced by its superior performance on the COCO dataset.

  abstract     = {Cross-modal 3D shape retrieval is a crucial and widely applied task in the field of 3D vision. Its goal is to construct retrieval representations capable of measuring the similarity between instances of different 3D modalities. However, existing methods face challenges due to the performance bottlenecks of single-modal representation extractors and the modality gap across 3D modalities. To tackle these issues, we propose a Heterogeneous Dynamic Graph Representation (HDGR) network, which incorporates context-dependent dynamic relations within a heterogeneous framework. By capturing correlations among diverse 3D objects, HDGR overcomes the limitations of ambiguous representations obtained solely from instances. Within the context of varying mini-batches, dynamic graphs are constructed to capture proximal intra-modal relations, and dynamic bipartite graphs represent implicit cross-modal relations, effectively addressing the two challenges above. Subsequently, message passing and aggregation are performed using Dynamic Graph Convolution (DGConv) and Dynamic Bipartite Graph Convolution (DBConv), enhancing features through heterogeneous dynamic relation learning. Finally, intra-modal, cross-modal, and self-transformed features are redistributed and integrated into a heterogeneous dynamic representation for cross-modal 3D shape retrieval. HDGR establishes a stable, context-enhanced, structure-aware 3D shape representation by capturing heterogeneous inter-object relationships and adapting to varying contextual dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on the ModelNet10, ModelNet40, and real-world ABO datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HDGR in cross-modal and intra-modal retrieval tasks. Moreover, under the supervision of robust loss functions, HDGR achieves remarkable cross-modal retrieval against label noise on the 3D MNIST dataset. The comprehensive experimental results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of HDGR on cross-modal 3D shape retrieval.},

  abstract     = {Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental and critical task in the field of computer vision. Its aim is to integrate the unique characteristics of both infrared and visible spectra into a holistic representation. Since 2018, growing amount and diversity IVIF approaches step into a deep-learning era, encompassing introduced a broad spectrum of networks or loss functions for improving visual enhancement. As research deepens and practical demands grow, several intricate issues like data compatibility, perception accuracy, and efficiency cannot be ignored. Regrettably, there is a lack of recent surveys that comprehensively introduce and organize this expanding domain of knowledge. Given the current rapid development, this paper aims to fill the existing gap by providing a comprehensive survey that covers a wide array of aspects. Initially, we introduce a multi-dimensional framework to elucidate the prevalent learning-based IVIF methodologies, spanning topics from basic visual enhancement strategies to data compatibility, task adaptability, and further extensions. Subsequently, we delve into a profound analysis of these new approaches, offering a detailed lookup table to clarify their core ideas. Last but not the least, We also summarize performance comparisons quantitatively and qualitatively, covering registration, fusion and follow-up high-level tasks. Beyond delving into the technical nuances of these learning-based fusion approaches, we also explore potential future directions and open issues that warrant further exploration by the community.},

  abstract     = {A basic premise in graph signal processing (GSP) is that a graph encoding pairwise (anti-)correlations of the targeted signal as edge weights is leveraged for graph filtering. Existing fast graph sampling schemes are designed and tested only for positive graphs describing positive correlations. However, there are many real-world datasets exhibiting strong anti-correlations, and thus a suitable model is a signed graph, containing both positive and negative edge weights. In this paper, we propose the first linear-time method for sampling signed graphs, centered on the concept of balanced signed graphs. Specifically, given an empirical covariance data matrix $\bar{{\mathbf {C}}}$, we first learn a sparse inverse matrix ${\mathcal {L}}$, interpreted as a graph Laplacian corresponding to a signed graph ${\mathcal {G}}$. We approximate ${\mathcal {G}}$ with a balanced signed graph ${\mathcal {G}}^{b}$ via fast edge weight augmentation in linear time, where the eigenpairs of Laplacian ${\mathcal {L}}^{b}$ for ${\mathcal {G}}^{b}$ are graph frequencies. Next, we select a node subset for sampling to minimize the error of the signal interpolated from samples in two steps. We first align all Gershgorin disc left-ends of Laplacian ${\mathcal {L}}^{b}$ at the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda _{\min }({\mathcal {L}}^{b})$ via similarity transform ${\mathcal {L}}^{s} = {\mathbf {S}}{\mathcal {L}}^{b} {\mathbf {S}}^{-1}$, leveraging a recent linear algebra theorem called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA). We then perform sampling on ${\mathcal {L}}^{s}$ using a previous fast Gershgorin disc alignment sampling (GDAS) scheme. Experiments show that our signed graph sampling method outperformed fast sampling schemes designed for positive graphs on various datasets with anti-correlations.},

  abstract     = {Quantization is one of the efficient model compression methods, which represents the network with fixed-point or low-bit numbers. Existing quantization methods address the network quantization by treating it as a single-objective optimization that pursues high accuracy (performance optimization) while keeping the quantization constraint. However, owing to the non-differentiability of the quantization operation, it is challenging to integrate the quantization operation into the network training and achieve optimal parameters. In this paper, a novel multi-objective convex quantization for efficient model compression is proposed. Specifically, the network training is modeled as a multi-objective optimization to find the network with both high precision and low quantization error (actually, these two goals are somewhat contradictory and affect each other). To achieve effective multi-objective optimization, this paper designs a quantization error function that is differentiable and ensures the computation convexity in each period, so as to avoid the non-differentiable back-propagation of the quantization operation. Then, we perform a time-series self-distillation training scheme on the multi-objective optimization framework, which distills its past softened labels and combines the hard targets to guarantee controllable and stable performance convergence during training. At last and more importantly, a new dynamic Lagrangian coefficient adaption is designed to adjust the gradient magnitude of quantization loss and performance loss and balance the two losses during training processing. The proposed method is evaluated on well-known benchmarks: MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, Penn Treebank and Microsoft COCO, and experimental results show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {We present a deep learning model, dubbed Glissando-Net, to simultaneously estimate the pose and reconstruct the 3D shape of objects at the category level from a single RGB image. Previous works predominantly focused on either estimating poses (often at the instance level), or reconstructing shapes, but not both. Glissando-Net is composed of two auto-encoders that are jointly trained, one for RGB images and the other for point clouds. We embrace two key design choices in Glissando-Net to achieve a more accurate prediction of the 3D shape and pose of the object given a single RGB image as input. First, we augment the feature maps of the point cloud encoder and decoder with transformed feature maps from the image decoder, enabling effective 2D-3D interaction in both training and prediction. Second, we predict both the 3D shape and pose of the object in the decoder stage. This way, we better utilize the information in the 3D point clouds presented only in the training stage to train the network for more accurate prediction. We jointly train the two encoder-decoders for RGB and point cloud data to learn how to pass latent features to the point cloud decoder during inference. In testing, the encoder of the 3D point cloud is discarded. The design of Glissando-Net is inspired by codeSLAM. Unlike codeSLAM, which targets 3D reconstruction of scenes, we focus on pose estimation and shape reconstruction of objects, and directly predict the object pose and a pose invariant 3D reconstruction without the need of the code optimization step. Extensive experiments, involving both ablation studies and comparison with competing methods, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, and compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Event cameras form a fundamental foundation for visual perception in scenes characterized by high speed and a wide dynamic range. Although deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable success in estimating event-based optical flow, existing methods have not adequately addressed the significance of temporal information in capturing spatiotemporal features. Due to the dynamics of spiking neurons in SNNs, which preserve important information while forgetting redundant information over time, they are expected to outperform analog neural networks (ANNs) with the same architecture and size in sequential regression tasks. In addition, SNNs on neuromorphic hardware achieve advantages of extremely low power consumption. However, present SNN architectures encounter issues related to limited generalization and robustness during training, particularly in noisy scenes. To tackle these problems, this study introduces an innovative spike-based self-supervised learning algorithm known as SeLHIB, which leverages the information bottleneck theory. By utilizing event-based camera inputs, SeLHIB enables robust estimation of optical flow in the presence of noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a self-supervised information bottleneck learning strategy based on SNNs. Furthermore, we develop spike-based self-supervised algorithms with nonlinear and high-order information bottleneck learning that employs nonlinear and high-order mutual information to enhance the extraction of relevant information and eliminate redundancy. We demonstrate that SeLHIB significantly enhances the generalization ability and robustness of optical flow estimation in various noise conditions. In terms of energy efficiency, SeLHIB achieves 90.44% and 45.70% cut down of energy consumption compared to its counterpart ANN and counterpart SNN models, while attaining 33.78% lower AEE (MVSEC), 5.96% lower RSAT (ECD) and 6.21% lower RSAT (HQF) compared to the counterpart ANN implementations with the same sizes and architectures.},

  abstract     = {Effective video frame interpolation hinges on the adept handling of motion in the input scene. Prior work acknowledges asynchronous event information for this, but often overlooks whether motion induces blur in the video, limiting its scope to sharp frame interpolation. We instead propose a unified framework for event-based frame interpolation that performs deblurring ad-hoc and thus works both on sharp and blurry input videos. Our model consists in a bidirectional recurrent network that incorporates the temporal dimension of interpolation and fuses information from the input frames and the events adaptively based on their temporal proximity. To enhance the generalization from synthetic data to real event cameras, we integrate self-supervised framework with the proposed model to enhance the generalization on real-world datasets in the wild. At the dataset level, we introduce a novel real-world high-resolution dataset with events and color videos named HighREV, which provides a challenging evaluation setting for the examined task. Extensive experiments show that our network consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on frame interpolation, single image deblurring, and the joint task of both. Experiments on domain transfer reveal that self-supervised training effectively mitigates the performance degradation observed when transitioning from synthetic data to real-world data.

The complex relations between objects and their locations, ambiguities, and variations in the real-world environment can be better described in human language, naturally governed by grammatical rules and other modalities such as audio and depth. The models learned to bridge the gap between such modalities and large-scale training data facilitate contextual reasoning, generalization, and prompt capabilities at test time. These models are referred to as foundation models. The output of such models can be modified through human-provided prompts without retraining, e.g., segmenting a particular object by providing a bounding box, having interactive dialogues by asking questions about an image or video scene or manipulating the robot&#39;s behavior through language instructions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of such emerging foundation models, including typical architecture designs to combine different modalities (vision, text, audio, etc.), training objectives (contrastive, generative), pre-training datasets, fine-tuning mechanisms, and the common prompting patterns; textual, visual, and heterogeneous. We discuss the open challenges and research directions for foundation models in computer vision, including difficulties in their evaluations and benchmarking, gaps in their real-world understanding, limitations of contextual understanding, biases, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and interpretability issues. We review recent developments in this field, covering a wide range of applications of foundation models systematically and comprehensively.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent solution for distributed learning environments, enabling collaborative model training without centralized data collection. However, FL faces significant challenges such as data heterogeneity and resource-constraint edge devices for model training and analysis, leading to accuracy degradation and bias in model performance. To address these critical issues, we propose a novel FL strategy named FedTune-SGM, designed to optimize model training in decentralized settings. In this strategy, a cloud-based model is initially trained and fine-tuned on the edge devices with additional layers tailored to the specific data characteristics. This fine-tuning process effectively mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity, enhancing the robustness and generalization capability of the model. FedTune-SGM employs a strategic weighting mechanism that ensures a balanced and equitable contribution from participating edge devices to prevent dominant influences from resource-rich devices and promote a fairer and more accurate aggregated model. Additionally, the proposed strategy integrates a Stackelberg Game model to foster an interactive and dynamic cloud-edge setup that motivates edge devices to invest more effort in model training and ensures the effectiveness of resource-constraint edge devices. Extensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets highlight the superior performance of the proposed FedTune-SGM strategy compared to state-of-the-art FL techniques in terms of accuracy and robustness while meeting the critical challenges of data heterogeneity and resource limitations in FL environments. Through these innovations, FedTune-SGM paves the way for more reliable and efficient distributed learning systems, unlocking the full potential of FL in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Federated continual learning (FCL) has attracted growing attention in achieving collaborative model training among edge clients, each of which learns its local model for a sequence of tasks. Most existing FCL approaches aggregate clients’ latest local models to exchange knowledge. This unfortunately deviates from real-world scenarios where each model is optimized independently using the client’s own dynamic data and different clients have heterogeneous tasks. These tasks not only have distinct class labels (e.g., animals or vehicles) but also differ in input feature distributions. The aggregated model thus often shifts to a higher loss value and incurs accuracy degradation. In this article, we depart from the model-grained view of aggregation and transform it into multiple task-grained aggregations. Each aggregation allows a client to learn from other clients to improve its model accuracy on one task. To this end, we propose Loci to provide abstractions for clients’ past and peer task knowledge using compact model weights, and develop a communication-efficient approach to train each client’s local model by exchanging its tasks’ knowledge with the most accuracy relevant one from other clients. Through its general-purpose API, Loci can be used to provide efficient on-device training for existing deep learning applications of graph, image, nature language processing, and multimodal data. Using extensive comparative evaluations, we show Loci improves the model accuracy by 32.48% without increasing training time, reduces communication cost by 83.6%, and achieves more improvements when scale (task/client number) increases.},

Unfortunately, the existing solutions fall short of achieving this design objective, which we argue, is largely attributed to the fact that they fail to take the query fanout explicitly into account. In this paper, we propose TailGuard based on a Tail-latency-SLO-and-Fanout-aware Earliest-Deadline-First Queuing policy (TF-EDFQ) for task queuing at individual task servers the query tasks are fanned out to. With the task pre-dequeuing time deadline for each task being derived based on both query tail latency SLO and query fanout, TailGuard takes an important first step towards achieving the design objective. A query admission control scheme is also developed to provide tail latency SLO guarantee in the presence of resource shortages. TailGuard is evaluated against First-In-First-Out (FIFO) task queuing, task PRIority Queuing (PRIQ) and Tail-latency-SLO-aware EDFQ (T-EDFQ) policies by both simulation and testing in the Amazon EC2 cloud. It is driven by three types of applications in the Tailbench benchmark suite, featuring web search, in-memory key-value store, and transactional database applications. The results demonstrate that TailGuard can significantly improve resource utilization (e.g., up to 80% compared to FIFO), while also meeting the targeted tail latency SLOs, as compared with the other three policies. TailGuard is also implemented and tested in a highly heterogeneous Sensing-$a$s-a-Service (SaS) testbed for a data sensing service, demonstrating performance gains of up to 33% . These results are consistent with both the simulation and Amazon EC2 results.},

The memory-intensive embedding layers of recommendation systems are the crucial performance bottleneck, with operations manifesting as sparse memory lookups and simple reduction computations. Recent studies propose near-memory processing (NMP) architectures to speed up embedding operations by utilizing high internal memory bandwidth. However, these solutions typically employ a fixed vector partitioning strategy that fail to adapt to changes in data center deployment scenarios and lack practicality. We propose Flips, a flexible partitioning strategy NMP architecture that accelerates embedding layers. Flips supports more than ten partitioning strategies through hardware-software co-design. Novel hardware architectures and address mapping schemes are designed for the memory-side and host-side. We provide two approaches to determine the optimal partitioning strategy for each embedding table, enabling the architecture to accommodate changes in deployment scenarios. Importantly, Flips is decoupled from the NMP level and can utilize rank-level, bank-group-level and bank-level parallelism. In peer-level NMP evaluations, Flips outperforms state-of-the-art NMP solutions, RecNMP, TRiM, and ReCross by up to 4.0×, 4.1×, and 3.5×, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning has been a driving force in the evolution of tremendous computing services and applications in the past decade. Traditional learning systems rely on centralized training and inference, which poses serious privacy and security concerns. To solve this problem, distributed learning over wireless edge networks (DLWENs) emerges as a trending solution and has attracted increasing research interests. In DLWENs, corresponding services need to be placed onto the edge servers to process the distributed tasks. Apparently, different placement of training services can significantly affect the performance of all distributed learning tasks. In this article, we propose TASP, a task-aware service placement scheme for distributed learning in wireless edge networks. By carefully considering the structures (directed acyclic graphs) of the distributed learning tasks, the fine-grained task requests and inter-task dependencies are incorporated into the placement strategies to realize the parallel computation of learning services. We also exploit queuing theory to characterize the dynamics caused by task uncertainties. Extensive experiments based on the Alibaba ML dataset show that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed work reduces the overall delay of distributed learning tasks by 38.6% on average.},

  abstract     = {Transformer models have shown significant success in a wide range of tasks. However, the massive resources required for its inference prevent deployment on a single device with relatively constrainted resources, thus leaving a high threshold of integrating their advancements. Observing scenarios such as smart home applications on edge devices and cloud deployment on commodity hardware, it is promising to distribute Transformer inference across multiple devices. Unfortunately, due to the tightly-coupled feature of Transformer model, existing model parallelism approaches necessitate frequent communication to resolve data dependencies, making them unacceptable for distributed inference, especially under relatively weak interconnection. In this paper, we propose DeTransformer, a communication-efficient distributed Transformer inference system. The key idea of DeTransformer involves the co-design of Transformer architecture to reduce the communication during distributed inference. In detail, DeTransformer is based on a novel block parallelism approach, which restructures the original Transformer layer with a single block to the decoupled layer with multiple sub-blocks. Thus, it can exploit model parallelism between sub-blocks. Next, DeTransformer contains an adaptive execution approach that strikes a trade-off among communication capability, computing power and memory budget over multiple devices. It incorporates a two-phase planning for execution, namely static planning and runtime planning. The static planning runs offline, containing a profiling procedure and a weight placement strategy before execution. The runtime planning dynamically determines the optimal parallel computing strategy from an expertly crafted search space based on real-time requests. Notably, this execution approach can adapt to heterogeneous devices by distributing workload based on devices’ computing capabilities. We conduct experiments for both auto-regressive and auto-encoder tasks of Transformer models. Experimental results show that DeTransformer can reduce distributed inference latency by up to 2.81× compared to the SOTA approach on 4 devices, while effectively maintaining task accuracy and a consistent model size.},

  abstract     = {Logs are a known abstraction used to develop dependable and secure distributed systems. By logging entries on a sequential global log, systems can synchronize updates over replicas and provide a consistent state recovery in the presence of faults. However, their usage incurs a non-negligible overhead on the application&#39;s performance. This article presents Beelog, an approach to reduce logging impact and accelerate recovery on log-based protocols by safely discarding entries from logs. The technique involves executing a log compaction during run-time concurrently with the persistence and execution of commands. Besides compacting logging information, the proposed technique splits the log file and incorporates strategies to reduce logging overhead, such as batching and parallel I/O. We evaluate the proposed approach by implementing it as a new feature of the etcd key-value store and comparing it against etcd&#39;s standard logging. Utilizing workloads from the YCSB benchmark and experimenting with different configurations for batch size and number of storage devices, our results indicate that Beelog can reduce application recovery time, especially in write-intensive workloads with a small number of keys and a probability favoring the most recent keys to be updated. In such scenarios, we observed up to a 50% compaction in the log file size and a 65% improvement in recovery time compared to etcd&#39;s standard recovery protocol. As a side effect, batching results in higher command execution latency, ranging from $ \text{100 ms}$ to $ \text{350 ms}$ with Beelog, compared to the default etcd&#39;s $ \text{90 ms}$. Except for the latency increase, the proposed technique does not impose other significant performance costs, making it a practical solution for systems where fast recovery and reduced storage are priorities.},

  abstract     = {Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) efficiently trains large models by using sparse activation to lower costs, selecting a few experts based on data characteristics. However, it faces challenges such as All-to-All communication overhead and load imbalance, with most optimizations targeting dynamic graphs rather than the more efficient static graphs. This study identifies two key challenges in training MoE on static graphs: 1) excessive All-to-All communication (up to 75% of iteration time) and load imbalance (70% of tokens handled by two experts) between experts due to the sparse structure of the MoE model and the token distribution; and 2) inefficient zero-padding for static shapes, leading to unnecessary computational overhead(wasting approximately 50% of resources). Thus, EfficientMoE, a scheduling method based on expert load and data characteristics, is introduced. EfficientMoE first designs a sampler to collect real-time information about token distribution, expert load, etc. It constructs a load prediction model to evaluate expert load. Subsequently, EfficientMoE proposes a dynamic schedule strategy for experts with evaluated expert load, reducing All-to-All communication and addressing load-balancing issues. Additionally, an expert capacity model is proposed to set different capacities for replicas of hot experts before static graph compilation, minimizing computation and storage overhead caused by significant padding. This study implements EfficientMoE in MindSpore and uses 32 Ascend AI accelerators to train an MoE model with 21 billion parameters and evaluate its validity. EfficientMoE demonstrated an improvement of 30% in model training time, approximately 12% reduction in communication time, and saved 35% computational resources across different clusters, compared with Switch transformers, and the Fastermoe method for static graphs.},

Parallel computing resources exhibit heightened computational and energy efficiency when operating with larger batch sizes. However, in the realm of online services, the adoption of a larger batch size may lead to longer response times. This paper aims to provide a dynamic batching scheme that delicately balances latency and efficiency. The system is modeled as a batch service queue with size-dependent service times. Then, the design of dynamic batching is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problem, with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average response time and average power consumption. A method is proposed to derive an approximate optimal SMDP solution, representing the chosen dynamic batching policy. By introducing an abstract cost to reflect the impact of “tail” states, the space complexity and the time complexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%, respectively. Numerical results showcase the superiority of SMDP-based batching policies across various parameter setups. Additionally, the proposed scheme exhibits noteworthy flexibility in balancing power consumption and latency.},

  abstract     = {Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a promising technology for secure, non-interactive outsourced computation. One notable method to increase the throughput of FHE-based outsourcing is batching, which typically involves large-scale matrix-matrix multiplications (MM). However, the substantial overhead inherent in existing FHE schemes poses a major challenge for processing these large-scale tasks, often resulting in insufficient memory or prolonged delays on a single machine, making it practically unviable. Utilizing multi-machine parallelism in cloud clusters for outsourced computation offers a natural solution to these obstacles. In this work, we propose FHE4DMM, a distributed algorithm that provides a unified view on encrypted matrices, accommodating various FHE schemes and any matrix dimensions, to accelerate large-scale encrypted MM. A key innovation is its reuse optimizations for parallelized homomorphic computations, which can offer valuable insights for broader FHE-based applications. We utilized FHE4DMM to conduct large-scale square ($4096\times 4096$) and rectangular ($32768\times 32768,32768\times 16$ ) matrix multiplications on 256 machines, achieving computation time of 172.2 s and 76.1 s, respectively, while ensuring a 128-bit security level. For scalability, the experiments demonstrate that FHE4DMM achieves linear speedup for $2^{i}$ ($i$ is from 0 to 6) machines across various matrix dimension cases. In addition, within the range of matrix dimensions that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) distributed FHE-MM algorithm (Huang et al. 2023) can handle, FHE4DMM attains a maximum speedup of 16.62x. To assess its practical performance, FHE4DMM is applied in a basic multi-layer feedforward network. We used 64 machines to perform secure outsourced inference on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with encrypted models and data. Compared to using the SOTA, our method achieved speedups of up to 3.54x and 4.22x respectively, with the MM module obtaining a 4.09x and 4.87x speedup.},

To improve the performance of SFCs, programmable data planes are used to leverage their low latency and high performance packet processing. However, SFCs need to be adaptable to dynamics such as changes in requirements and attributes. Therefore, the ability to migrate SFCs is essential. Unfortunately, migrating SFCs in distributed programmable data planes is challenging due to the risk of degraded performance and failure to meet SFCs requirements and resource constraints in switches. In this paper, we propose Monte, which provides an effective SFCs migration scheme in distributed programmable data planes. We build a novel integer programming model to represent the migration process with constraints on resource limitations of switches and SFCs attributes in the distributed data plane. Additionally, an SFCs migration algorithm is designed to optimize the migration cost by deeply analyzing resource allocation in the switch pipeline. Monte has been implemented on both P4 software switches (Bmv2) and hardware switches (Intel Tofino ASIC). Extensive evaluation results show that the migration cost in Monte is 94.03% lower on average than the state-of-the-art deployment scheme, and Monte can effectively save pipeline resources.},

  abstract     = {Motion planning for robotic systems with complex dynamics is a challenging problem. While recent sampling-based algorithms achieve asymptotic optimality by propagating random control inputs, their empirical convergence rate is often poor, especially in high-dimensional systems such as multirotors. An alternative approach is to first plan with a simplified geometric model and then use trajectory optimization to follow the reference path while accounting for the true dynamics. However, this approach may fail to produce a valid trajectory if the initial guess is not close to a dynamically feasible trajectory. In this article, we present Iterative Discontinuity Bounded A* (iDb-A*), a novel kinodynamic motion planner that combines search and optimization iteratively. The search step utilizes a finite set of short trajectories (motion primitives) that are interconnected while allowing for a bounded discontinuity between them. The optimization step locally repairs the discontinuities with trajectory optimization. By progressively reducing the allowed discontinuity and incorporating more motion primitives, our algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality with excellent any-time performance. We provide a benchmark of 43 problems across eight different dynamical systems, including different versions of unicycles and multirotors. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, iDb-A* consistently solves more problem instances and finds lower-cost solutions more rapidly.},

First, under hybrid stochastic faults, an observer is constructed to estimate all states, which converts the process stochastic faults into a processable form. Second, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the estimated states to reduce their update frequency. To deal with the problem that the triggered estimated states are nondifferentiable, a continuous controller with continuous estimated states is developed, and the event-triggered controller with triggered estimated states is established accordingly. By the use of Lyapunov stability theory, it can be rigorously shown that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded in probability.

  abstract     = {This article extends the problem of safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) to the platooning of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such multivehicle systems, SOTIF objectives are particularly challenging, since new issues arise due to the presence of interactions that propagate and intensify the effects and the risk connected to faults/failures/uncertainties, triggered by any platoon member and external conditions. To tackle and solve the SOTIF-oriented platoon control problem, we propose a robust and resilient decentralized control protocol, based on distributed observer which exploits the information shared via the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication network. The approach allows maintaining acceptable SOTIF performance in adversarial conditions, mitigating the effects of the unreasonable risks originated from sensors/actuators performance limitations/faults and disturbances. The uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stability and the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) of the platoon dynamics are analytically proved via the Lyapunov theory. Feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained as stability conditions, whose solution allows adapting the distributed control/observer gains according to leader-tracking performance and robustness margins. A detailed analysis via the vehicular co-simulation platform mixed traffic simulator (MiTraS) corroborates the theoretical derivations and shows the achievement of the SOTIF platoon goals for a set of nontrivial and uncertain driving scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the article, a stabilized issue for complex-valued hybrid stochastic multilinks networks (CHSMNs) is investigated under event-triggered control (E-TC). In contrast to existing literature, the proposed E-TC defines the event-triggered instant sequence as the random sequence rather than the number sequence, which is more accurate concerning hybrid stochastic systems. Especially, a modified more general event-triggered function is proposed. After the Zeno behavior is eliminated by the contradiction, several stabilized conditions are established to guarantee the input-to-state stability and exponential stability in the mean square and almost surely exponential stability of CHSMNs, where studying in the complex domain and no splitting real and imaginary parts. Subsequently, we analyze the lower bound of the event-triggered intervals for E-TC in the sense of mathematical expectation. Whereafter, the stabilized problem for the Cohen–Grossberg neural networks (CSDLCNs) and the islanded micro grid model (IMGM) is considered as an application. Meanwhile, numerical simulations are presented for verification.},

In addition, a tailored SMC law that ensures the system’s trajectory reaches and maintains a preset sliding surface over a specified finite time is applied. To address the challenges of communication load, a novel multizone probabilistic dynamic event-triggered protocol is introduced, leveraging the time-varying nature of transmission delays and incorporating two adjustable internal dynamic variables. The establishment of sufficient conditions for ensuring the stochastic finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is achieved through an effective Lyapunov functional methodology.

  abstract     = {Exploring the structure information is crucial for data clustering task, particularly for the sceneries of incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) when some views are missing. However, almost all of the existing graph-based IMVC methods either introduce the Laplacian constraint with fixed graphs or simply fuse the graphs of all views, which are vulnerable to the quality of the constructed graphs. To address this issue, we propose a new graph-based method, called confident local structure-aware incomplete multiview spectral clustering. Different from existing works, our method seeks to adaptively uncover the inherent similarity structure among the available instances in each view and learn the optimal consensus graph within a unified learning framework. Moreover, to mitigate the adverse effects of imbalance information across incomplete views and improve the quality of consensus graph, we further impose some adaptive weights on the consensus graph learning model w.r.t. each view and introduce some confident structure graphs to explore the most confident similarity information in the model. In contrast to existing works, our approach simultaneously takes into account the pairwise similarity information and neighbor group-based confident structure information. This dual consideration makes our method more effective in achieving the optimal consensus graph and delivering superior IMVC performance. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our method effectively learns a high-quality and clustering-friendly graph from incomplete multiview data, and it outperforms many state-of-the-art IMVC methods in terms of clustering performance.},

However, these methods often necessitate large model sizes, leading to substantial computational and storage resource requirements during training and inference. Unfortunately, existing research has not yet provided a lightweight solution to address this issue. This work aims to develop a generic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing lifelong DRL methods to facilitate their achievement of lightweight models while also yielding higher returns. While sparse training (ST) methods have been extensively used in the DRL community to achieve lightweight models, they exacerbate the issue of catastrophic forgetting and compromise generalization when applied in lifelong DRL. To improve generalization, we develop a gradient optimization method that leverages sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) to smooth the gradient surface of the model without introducing excessive computational complexity. In addition, to alleviate catastrophic forgetting and promote model convergence, we introduce a priority-based approach that samples effective past experiences from the replay buffer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 90% sparsity in five representative lifelong DRL methods while achieving higher episode return and average return (up to 34% improvement) across all episodes compared to the dense models.},

During real-time information exchange among agents, communication failures between agents occur randomly, which may result in each possible network topology occurring with a certain probability, and its sojourn time is also stochastic. This necessitates the consideration of a more general switching signal to describe the stochastic switching phenomenon of networks. In pursuit of this goal, a semi-Markov chain is introduced to characterize the switching signal of stochastic interaction networks, whose sojourn time distribution allows for arbitrary continuous-time distribution and depends on the current and next state. Additionally, this article delves into the impact of two distinct types of DoS attacks on MASs. The first type involves random DoS attacks, which are also modeled by a semi-Markov chain to capture the stochastic nature of attack durations. The second type is deterministic DoS attacks, characterized by their frequency and duration. The proposed new stochastic analysis method, based on the law of large numbers, is used to analyze the ASC for MASs featuring SMSNs under the DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by evaluating the results obtained from two illustrative numerical examples.},

Hence, a novel modeling approach is proposed for constructing CBRBS in the aim of providing a better XAI, in which a joint optimization model is proposed first to describe the mathematical model of parameter and structure optimization, and the corresponding algorithm is further designed to automatically achieve the joint optimization of CBRBS. Afterward, a domain-based calculation method of synthesis factor is proposed to develop a new rule synthesis method for CBRBS, which not only achieves the reduction of inefficient and inconsistent rules but also takes into account interpretability and generalization ability. In experimental analysis, the proposed modeling approach is employed to construct CBRBS for handling rice taste assessment and benchmark classification problems. The comparison results show that the proposed approach makes it possible for CBRBS to achieve a good balance between model complexity and inference accuracy. More importantly, the resulting CBRBS has better accuracy and lower complexity than some existing rule-based systems and classical classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Industrial robots inevitably incur kinematic errors in the advanced manufacturing and assembly processes, resulting in the severe reduction of the absolute positioning accuracy (APA). Kinematic calibration (KC) is well-known as a vital technique in APA-promoting tasks. However, existing KC models generally adopt a single distance-oriented Loss, e.g., an $L_{2}$ norm-oriented one that neglects the featured $L_{p}$ norms. In response to this critical issue, this study presents an Adaptive p-norms-oriented Kinematic Calibration (ApKC) model on the basis of threefold ideas: 1) studying the effects of diversified $L_{p}$ norms on the industrial robot calibration performance; 2) combining multiple $L_{p}$ norms to obtain the aggregated loss with the hybrid effects by different norms; and 3) implementing the weight adaptation on the norm components of the aggregated loss, and rigorously prove its ensemble capability benefiting the calibration performance. Afterwards, a novel Newton interpolated Adaptive Differential Evolution (NADE) algorithm is further proposed to optimize the ApKC model. Empirical studies on an HRS JR680 industrial robot demonstrate that the achieved ApKC-NADE calibrator can significantly reduce the robot’s maximum positioning error from 4.610 to 0.856 mm. It can vigorously support the high-accuracy application of industrial robots.},

  abstract     = {This article utilizes parallel control to investigate the problem of continuous-time (CT) nonzero-sum games (NZSGs) for completely unknown nonlinear systems via reinforcement learning (RL), and a parallel control-based NZSG (PNZSG) method is developed without reconstructing unknown dynamics or employing off-policy integral RL (IRL). First, novel dynamic control policies (DCPs) are developed for NZSGs by introducing controls into feedback, and an augmented system with augmented performance indices is constructed to derive the DCPs. Then, we theoretically analyze the effect of the DCPs on the control stability and performance indices, and the optimality of PNZSG is proven to be equivalent to the optimality of the original NZSGs. Subsequently, an IRL technique is employed to achieve the developed PNZSG method, and we show that no prior knowledge of the dynamics of NZSGs is needed to deploy the developed PNZSG method because of the augmented system and performance indices. Finally, numerical examples, including cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of a vehicular platoon, demonstrate the correctness of the developed PNZSG method.

The system operator (SO) determines the response power amount and provides tiered subsidy policies. The load aggregators (LAs) are rational decision-makers and formulate multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) to make compromises for incentive income, user comfort, and environmental contribution. The innovation lies in the proposed distributed event-triggered solution methodology, including a distance-minimization algorithm to find the decision closest to the ideal point from the Pareto front, and a weighting coefficients optimization algorithm to allocate the importance of each objective at a predefined time. The distributed solution framework maintains the autonomy of each LA, and the event-triggered communication mechanism saves communication resources. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution methodology, including the realization of the response power target given by the SO, the optimal compromise of the MOP, and the saving of communication resources in the solution process.},

An adaptive fuzzy practical fixed-time MASs consistency control algorithm is proposed by combining these techniques with backstepping control.

  abstract     = {In recent years, pretrained language-image models (PLIMs) have delivered advances in video captioning. However, existing PLIMs primarily focus on extracting global feature representations from still images and text sequences, while neglecting fine-grained semantic alignment and temporal variations between vision and text pairs. To this end, we propose a global-local alignment module and a temporal parsing module to reflect the detailed correspondence and temporal perception between the two modalities, respectively. In particular, the global-local alignment module enables cross-modal registration at two levels, i.e., the sentence-video level and the word-frame level, to obtain mixed-granularity semantic video features. The temporal parsing module is a dedicated self-attention structure that highlights temporal order cues along video frames, compensating for the limited temporal capacity of PLIMs. In addition, an adaptive two-stage gating structure is designed to leverage the linguistic predictions further. The linguistic information derived from the first stage prediction is dynamically routed through an adaptive decision gate, allowing for quality assessment of whether the information should proceed to the second stage. This structure can effectively reduce the computational burden for easy samples and further improve the accuracy of the prediction results. The experimental results obtained on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, with improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

In the classic ILC framework, three key steps are often involved: 1) making necessary hypotheses over ILC systems, 2) designing the ILC algorithms, and 3) establishing convergence conditions. However, a basic trackability problem is neglected: whether there exist some inputs that drive the ILC system such that the output is identical to the specified trajectory from beginning to end. This article is targeted at addressing the trackability problem and the related ILC design and analysis issues for continuous-time linear systems subject to vector relative degrees. The frequency-domain criteria are developed to determine the trackability of the given trajectory. In addition, the ILC design and analysis are proposed by utilizing a frequency-domain method, which establishes a close connection between the achievement of the perfect tracking tasks in ILC and the trackability of the given trajectory.

Additionally, the presence of strong couplings and slugging disturbances in the system further complicate the development of fault-tolerant control (FTC). To achieve this, this article investigates the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem in the topside separation system. To recover control performance against actuator faults while reducing disturbance sensitivity, the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem is formulated for the topside separation system and is expressed as a two-player differential game problem. A Nash equilibrium solution to the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem is derived by solving the game algebraic Riccati equation (GARE). Considering the tailor-made property and difficulty in full-state sensing in industry, an output feedback reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to implement the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control method without the need for system dynamics. Simulation studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

For realizing the requirements of performance, the algorithm converts the tracking error to a new state by means of a coordinate transformation via the tangent function. In addition, the universal approximation capacity of the fuzzy-logic system is utilized to estimate the unknown nonlinear term effectively. On this basis, the designed adaptive dynamic event-triggered controller can not only ensure that all the signals for the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability but also guarantee that the tracking error will converge to a predetermined small neighborhood. Meanwhile, different piecewise functions are added into the controller to characterize prescribed performance and avoid singularity problems, respectively.

In this work, we study how to recognize the diffusion source based on limited observational knowledge. To date, the applicability of existing methods is often challenged when dealing with large-scale networks. To improve the scalability, we here develop a community-based source localization (CSL) model by splitting the network into several clusters from the community perspective. In addition, we study an issue that has received less attention but is rather important, i.e., observer deployment. Specifically, we categorize three types of observers and propose a two-stage placement strategy to enhance the accuracy of localization. Our findings suggest that the optimized deployed observers tend to situate at key positions and have higher betweenness compared to non-observer nodes. Based on the information obtained from deployed observers, we further develop five different strategies to locate the community where the source belongs, and our study shows that the diffusion often occurs within a small number of communities so that the search scope can be effectively refined. We validate our method through simulations on various networks, and the experimental results demonstrate the excellent efficacy and efficiency of CSL in early source localization.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical modelling of visual perception in two dimensions is described. Although perception is ubiquitously mentioned in literature and it is used in various contexts, its explicit measurable presentation has not yet been given beyond verbal descriptions. In this seminal work the visual perception is explicitly defined for clarity. Based on this definition, it is treated as a mathematical entity in the form of probability in a particular circular region. Theoretically, human vision is expressed in advanced probabilistic terms and the enigmatic relation between vision and perception is mathematically formulated. Here, the perception concerns a special range of interest, coined as vision circle, where percepts describe the vision act of human as the retinal ophthalmic sensing. Perceptual intelligence quotient (PIQ) is introduced, that it is subject to measurement. The results of the theoretical considerations are shown to be closely matching the common visual perception experiences as well as the reported visual perception studies, including the variation of peripheral acuity. Two eye-tracking experiments demonstrate that saccadic movement behavior of human is reasonably matching the prediction based on the novel perception theory. The work demystifies the visual perception and understanding its role in sciences. As to the cybernetics, perception plays an important role in the control of complex, integrated processing systems, which are interfaced by indispensable man-machine control systems. In these systems, the role of perception is critical, referring to the hazard situations. The implications of the study are investigated and explained in two such cybernetics applications, too.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to derive an adaptive optimal speed regulator for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) affected by both disturbances and actuator faults. Load torque is first modeled as a mismatched disturbance, where its estimation via a disturbance observer is drawn to construct an error system. Then, optimal speed regulation problem for PMSM is equivalently transformed into an optimal control problem for the error system. Given the presence of model variable couplings, an adaptive dynamic programming method is adopted to derive the optimal controller, where a critic neural network (NN) and an actor NN are used to approximate the cost function and the optimal controller, respectively. Notably, this article addresses the simultaneous occurrence of disturbances and actuator faults within the optimal control framework by designing separate treatments. Eventually, a composite controller, fulfilling optimality, robustness and safety constraints, is presented with rigorous proof via Lyapunov method. The proposed method is substantiated through both comparative numerical examples and experimental validation on a PMSM platform.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel visionary policy iteration (VPI) framework is proposed to address the continuous-action reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In VPI, a visionary Q-function is constructed by incorporating the successor state into the standard Q-function. Due to the introduction of the successor state, the proposed visionary Q-function captures information about state transitions within the Markov decision process (MDP), thereby providing a forward-looking perspective that enables a more accurate and foresighted evaluation of potential action outcomes. The relationship between the visionary Q-function and the standard Q-function is analyzed. Subsequently, both the policy evaluation and policy improvement rules in VPI are designed based on the proposed visionary Q-function. The convergence proof for VPI is provided, ensuring that the iterative policy sequence in VPI will converge to the optimal policy. By combining the VPI framework with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, a visionary TD3 (VTD3) algorithm is developed. The evaluation of VTD3 is performed on multiple continuous-action control tasks from Mujoco and OpenAI Gym platforms. The results of comparative experiments demonstrate that VTD3 can achieve more competitive performance than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL approaches. Additionally, the experimental results indicate that VPI enhances decision-making capability, reduces Q-function estimation bias, and improves sample efficiency, thereby boosting the performance of existing RL algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The aim of RGB-D Co-salient object detection (RGB-D Co-SOD) is to locate the most prominent objects within a provided collection of correlated RGB and depth images. The development of the Transformer has resulted in significant advancements in RGB-D Co-SOD. However, existing methods overlook the considerable computational and parametric costs associated with using the Transformer. Although compact models are computationally efficient, they suffer from performance degradation, which limits their practical applicability. This is because the reduction of model parameters weakens their feature representation capability. To bridge the performance gap between compact and complex models, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation (KD) network, HKDNet-S*, to perform the RGB-D Co-SOD task. This method incorporates positive-negative logits approximation KD to guide the student network (HKDNet-S) in effectively learning the interrelationships among samples with multiple attributes by considering both positive and negative logits. HKDNet-S* primarily consists of the group cosaliency semantic exploration module and the positive and negative logits approximation KD method. Specifically, we employ a trained RGB-D Co-SOD model as a teacher model (HKDNet-T) to train the HKDNet-S with a limited number of participants using KD. Through extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets (RGBD CoSal1k, RGBD CoSal150, and RGBD CoSeg183), we demonstrate that HKDNet-S* achieves superior accuracy while utilizing fewer parameters in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The opinions of experts often exhibit initial variance in group decision-making process due to the differences in background, knowledge, stance, and other influential factors. Thus, an incentive mechanism is critical to motivate experts to adjust individuals’ opinions and achieve a consensus solution. The incentive mechanism is usually costly and included in the consensus reaching process (CRP), and its effect relies on the behavior interaction between the moderator and experts. Within the Stackelberg game framework, we present the maximum-experts and minimum-cost consensus models with multiple incentives and cost budget. First, from a two-side perspective of the moderator and experts, a consensus model with maximum-return modification and maximum-experts feedback (MRMECM) is built to pursue the maximum number of consensus experts under an established cost budget, where the incentive mechanism is realized with the allocation of unit return to each return-driven expert. Then, a double incentive mechanism (DIM) is designed with the modification and shared return incentives. Subsequently, the MRMECM with DIM is constructed to improve the utilization efficiency of cost budget. Finally, the DIM module is integrated into the maximum-return modification and minimum-cost feedback consensus model (MRMCCM), which aims to minimize the consensus cost in the feedback mechanism. All the proposed consensus models are built as bi-level programming models in a unified Stackelberg game framework. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the best-response update strategy with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to solve the equilibrium solutions. Consequently, several experimental studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models.},

First, the optimal controllers with the auxiliary compensation term are constructed by utilizing the online approximation of the modified performance index function and RL actor-critic structure. The designed controller can deal with unknown structure impacts and avoid model identification. Besides, in designing the prescribed-time scale function, the introduced constant term not only prevents singularity but also allows flexible setting of constraint regions. The proposed scheme is theoretically verified to satisfy the Bellman optimality principle and ensure the tracking error converges to the desired zone within the prescribed time. Finally, the practicability of the designed control scheme is further demonstrated by the 2-link FJ robot simulation example.},

  abstract     = {A recursive minimum upper bound estimator (UBE) is proposed in this article for stochastic systems with colored measurement noise (CMN) in the presence of generalized unknown disturbance (UD), which is motivated by noncooperative target tracking in the environment of continuous external interference. The CMN causes system noises to be correlated in time dimension, and the UD makes online calculation of estimate error covariance intractable, both of which give rise to deterioration of classical Kalman-like filtering and smoothing. By considering that constructing the upper bound of estimate error covariance requires looser conditions than directly calculating the theoretical covariance, an UBE is first defined, to obtain the filtered estimate and smoothed estimate together. Then, based on the reconstructed measurement model containing multiple state vectors due to measurement differencing to whiten system noises, the recursive structure of the defined UBE is derived in the case of CMN (CUBE) by introducing a free parameter to be optimized, and the existence condition of CUBE is also discussed. Finally, the minimum UBE with CMN, i.e., CMUBE, is presented by pursuing the minimum upper bound of estimate error covariance online through parameter optimization, in order to further suppress the peak of estimate errors. The advantages of estimation accuracy of the proposed CMUBE over Kalman filter (KF)/smoother, KF with CMN and minimum upper bound filter (MUBF) are demonstrated by an example of noncooperative target tracking in persistent interference environment, in terms of filtering versus smoothing, different values of the initial estimate error covariance and the positive-definite matrix setting a priori, sensor accuracies and different levels of UD.},

The limited availability of labeled samples for each class poses a major challenge. To tackle this, we propose a simple yet effective approach called deep discriminative handcrafted feature regression (DDHFR) to explore intrinsic information and select improved discriminative features in few-shot data by mining knowledge from classical handcrafted features. To explore intrinsic information, we design several deep handcrafted feature regression (DHFR) modules and plugged them separately into different layers of the backbone to use feature engineering knowledge for feature learning optimization at different granularities. To achieve discriminative feature selection, we incorporate an auxiliary classifier (AC) into each DHFR module to enhance the acquisition of discriminative information. Furthermore, we employed self-distillation to boost ability of ACs ot be classified. Experimental results in three backbones on three datasets show that DDHFR can generally improve the performance of existing FSL methods. On average, it improves the recognition accuracy by 1.16% in two common few-shot settings.},

First, such a class of constraints under interest is more practical. Unlike most of the existing constraints that need to be addressed at the moment of inception, the initial value requirement of the constrained object in this work is released. A predefined setting time can be installed in advance through the implementation of a shifting function embedded within the proposed ABLF. Second, the problem of unknown actuator faults is considered where the actuator faults can be both multiplicative and additive. Third, by combining the command filter and backstepping techniques, a twice-transformation design method is presented to construct the desired controller, under which the errors between the virtual control laws and the outputs of the command filters can be compensated thoroughly. Aside from avoiding the “explosion of complexity” issue, the designed controller also achieves the requisite tracking performance.

  abstract     = {Achieving full state regulation within a prescribed-time for uncertain nonlinear systems under any initial condition is rather challenging although highly desirable, whereas most existing prescribed-time control results are literally contingent upon infinite feedback gain at the equilibrium. This article presents a new prescribed-time control design method that is able to ensure prescribed-time stability with bounded feedback gain and bounded control action during the entire process of system operation, elegantly circumventing the infinite feedback gain problem. As a nonscaling-based method with structural adaptation is utilized, the proposed control scheme is able to regulate all the states to zero well before the prescribed-time, yet in the presence of time-varying and mismatched structural uncertainties, substantially reducing the numerical computational complexity induced by scaling-based methods. The theoretical results are supported by two numerical simulations.},

In this article, finite-time resilient control is investigated for the networked Markov switched nonlinear systems (NMSNSs). Both additive and multiplicative feedback gain perturbations with randomly occurring manners are considered during the controller design to improve its tolerance of inaccurate controller implementation. The mode information that is partially available to the controller is incorporated into the design. With the help of the fuzzy-logic method, fuzzy resilient output-feedback controllers are established to cope with the gain perturbations and immeasurable system states. Then, by developing a novel switching model, relaxed conditions compared with the existing results are obtained which guarantee the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of NMSNSs. Based on the FTB analysis, a fuzzy design algorithm is proposed via a new separation approach to obtain the controller gains. Eventually, simulations are conducted via a multimode robotic arm system to validate the achieved results.},

This article aims to address the control performance optimization problem of flight control system in the presence of an incompletely known aircraft model and real-time flight data. First, the longitudinal aircraft dynamic model is formulated, followed by the establishment of two typical disturbance models, including periodic and constant disturbances.

Moreover, the gradient-based performance optimization strategy is proposed to mitigate the performance degradation induced by disturbances, using the online monitored actuator and sensor data of flight control system.

While most existing methods for debunking rumors consider a solitary debunker, they overlook that rumor-mongering and debunking are interdependent and confrontational behaviors. In reality, a debunker must consider the impact of rumor-mongering behavior when making decisions. Moreover, a single rumor-debunking strategy is ineffective in addressing the complexity of the rumor environment in networks. Therefore, this article proposes a hybrid rumor-debunking approach that combines truth dissemination and regulatory measures based on the differential game theory under adversarial behaviors of rumor-mongering and debunking. Toward this end, we first establish a rumor propagation model using node-based modeling techniques that can be applied to any network structure. Next, we mathematically describe and analyze the processes of rumor-mongering and debunking. Finally, we validate the theoretical results of the proposed method through various comparative experiments, including comparisons with a random strategy, a uniform strategy, and single strategy models on real-world datasets collected from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Furthermore, we harness two actual rumor events to estimate parameters and predict rumor propagation, thereby affirming the veracity and effectiveness of our rumor propagation model.},

This approach initially leverages a multiscale residual convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract data features across various scales, thereby preventing model degradation and autonomously learning and integrating abundant fault information from multiple monitoring variables. Subsequently, a channel attention mechanism (CAM) is introduced to prioritize focus on pertinent convolutional channels to enhance the network’s effectiveness and discriminative capacity. Furthermore, the Transformer is employed to establish dependencies among distinct features to enhance fault diagnosis accuracy. Lastly, the input data is classified for fault diagnosis. The efficacy of the proposed method was validated through simulation experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process and an industrial coking furnace. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Complete coverage path planning (CCPP) is a trending research area in floor cleaning robotics. CCPP is often approached as an optimization problem, typically solved by considering factors, such as power consumption and time as key objectives. In recent years, the safety of cleaning robots has become a major concern, which can critically limit the performance and lifetime of the robots. However, so far, optimizing safety has rarely been addressed in CCPP. Most of the path-planning algorithms in literature tend to identify and avoid the hazards detected by the robot’s perception. However, these systems can limit the area coverage of the robot or pose a risk of failing when the robot is near a hazard. Therefore, this article proposes a novel CCPP method with the awareness of risk levels for a robot to minimize possible hazards to the robot during a coverage task. The proposed CCPP strategy uses reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain a safety-ensured path plan that evaluates and when necessary, avoid the hazardous components in their environment in real time. Furthermore, the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method has been adopted to classify the hazards identified in the environment of the robot and suitably modified to evaluate the risk levels. These risk levels are used in the reward architecture of the RL. Thus, the robot can cross the low-risk hazardous environments if it is necessary to obtain complete coverage. Experimental results showed a noticeable reduction in overall risk faced by a robot compared to the existing methods, while also effectively achieving complete coverage.},

Our approach proposes a layered framework for the multi-AAV multitarget wildlife tracking problem: 1) the state estimation layer performs fast receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) signal acquisition and employs the particle filtering algorithm to localize targets’ positions; 2) the task assignment layer uses a quadratic allocation method for AAVs’ real-time target allocation, starting with reasonable initial target sets via mixed-integer programming and efficiently readjusting targets based on real-time environment; and 3) the motion planning layer introduces an optimization-based approach to generate smooth and executable trajectories that can simultaneously ensure desired safe distances from objects of interest.

However, the control performance of the existing SMC schemes depends on initial states and multiple parameters, and the robustness needs to be improved. To address these issues, a novel predefined-time robust SMC framework based on two zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) schemes, referred to as ZND-based predefined-time robust SMC (ZNDPRSMC) framework, is developed to facilitate position and attitude tracking of a quadrotor under bounded disturbances. Initially, a nonsingular sliding mode surface (SMS) is formulated by incorporating a general ZND along with a differentiable predefined-time activation function. Following this, an approaching law is introduced by utilizing a variable-parameter noise-tolerant ZND and a novel dynamic adaptive parameter. The nonsingular SMS and the approaching law are then combined to construct a nonsingular predefined-time robust controller. The theoretical proofs provided ascertain the predefined-time convergence of the closed-loop system utilizing ZNDPRSMC and its robustness against bounded disturbances.

  abstract     = {In our daily lives, emotions are extremely important. However, predicting and regulating emotion is still a critical problem to be solved in the research of the human-computer interaction (HCI). In this study, we explore this problem using a regulation method. A novel multimodal affective computing algorithm is proposed and implemented in an emotion regulation system. The selection of music stimuli and the modeling of dynamic emotions are done using emotional Markov chains. This regulation system can monitor the user’s emotion and play music, selected by the regulation policy until the user can maintain the desired emotion. Our system was verified by two experiments. In the first experiment, by predicting the participants’ affective states, we tested the precision of our multimodal affective computing system. In the second experiment, we tested the regulation algorithm embedded in a closed-loop regulation system by comparing it with playing music without feedback. The results suggest that participants can regulate and maintain the desired affective state by using the emotion regulation system.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the inappropriateness of the recently-developed fully interpretable Takagi-Sugeno–Kang fuzzy systems (FIMG-TSK) for high-dimensional classification tasks, which is caused by their unreliable Gaussian mixture models and their very lengthy fuzzy rules on all the original features, this study attempts to develop a stacked ensemble of extremely interpretable first-order TSK fuzzy classifiers (SEXI-TSK-FC) comprising extremely interpretable FIMG-TSK-based classifiers. SEXI-TSK-FC has structural and algorithmic novelties. In the structural sense, to guarantee enhanced generalizability and short fuzzy rules, the proposed XI-TSK is created as each subclassifier on a subset of the original features. Then it stacks each successive subclassifier on both the outputs and the important features selected, which are from the incorrectly classified dataset by the previous subclassifier. After that, SEXI-TSK-FC linearly aggregates all the outputs of its subclassifiers with a one-step calculation to enhance classification accuracy while preserving extreme interpretability. In the algorithmic sense, each short fuzzy rule of the XI-TSK subclassifier is determined using the proposed fuzzy feature selection and clustering algorithm to select the subset of all the original features and simultaneously fix the antecedent and consequent of each rule. After that, the rule weights in each subclassifier are trained quickly with strong generalizability using the proposed Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension minimization-based learning. Experimental results on 12 benchmark datasets demonstrate the power of the proposed classifier SEXI-TSK-FC on high-dimensional data in testing accuracy, training time, and extreme interpretability.},

Against this backdrop, this article investigates the multiobjective distributed flow shop group scheduling problem by formulating a mathematical model and introducing an advanced memetic algorithm integrated with reinforcement learning (RLMA). The RLMA involves a novel cooperative crossover operation in conjunction with the nature of the coupled problems to extensively explore the solution space. Additionally, the Sarsa algorithm enhanced with eligibility traces guides the selection of optimal schemes during the local enhancement phase. To ensure a balance between convergence and diversity, a solution selection strategy based on penalty-based boundary intersection decomposition is utilized. Furthermore, the increasing-efficiency and reducing-consumption strategies integrating a rapid evaluation mechanism are designed by dynamically changing the machine speed to balance economic and sustainability metrics. Comprehensive numerical experiments and comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed RLMA surpasses existing state-of-the-art algorithms in addressing this complex problem.},

They introduce complex hand-crafted pose-processes like RoI cropping, NMS and grouping or rely on dense representations to preserve the spatial features. In this article, we dive a deeper thought into this task and propose a simpler and effective framework, termed SparsePose, which can directly predict multiperson joint coordinates from the full image without any post-processes and dense representations. In SparsePose, the full-body instances are decoupled by exploring spatial-aware feature learning (SFL) without box and classification supervision. For improving the quality of instance map, the instance contrastive constraint (ICC) and center correction (CC) strategy are proposed to make the instance-wise spatial feature more discriminative. Importantly, we propose a visibility-guided weighting mechanism to enable model be confident to the visible joint predictions and insensitive to the occlusions or partial bodies. In general, SparsePose is conceptually simpler and plays favorably against the existing counterparts on three benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

TSEQs exist in application domains, such as sleeping behavior, earthquake aftershocks, and stock market crashes. Domain experts face four challenges, for which they could use interactive and visual data analysis methods. First, TSEQs can be large with respect to both the number of sequences and events, often leading to millions of events. Second, domain experts need validated metrics and features to identify interesting patterns. Third, after identifying interesting patterns, domain experts contextualize the patterns to foster sensemaking. Finally, domain experts seek to reduce data complexity by data simplification and machine learning support. We present IVESA, a visual analytics approach for TSEQs. It supports the analysis of TSEQs at the granularities of sequences and events, supported with metrics and feature analysis tools. IVESA has multiple linked views that support overview, sort+filter, comparison, details-on-demand, and metadata relation-seeking tasks, as well as data simplification through feature analysis, interactive clustering, filtering, and motif detection and simplification. We evaluated IVESA with three case studies and a user study with six domain experts working with six different datasets and applications. Results demonstrate the usability and generalizability of IVESA across applications and cases that had up to 1,000,000 events.},

Quantum computers have the potential to significantly improve rendering performance through reducing the underlying complexity of the algorithms behind light transport. This article investigates hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for ray tracing, a core component of most rendering techniques. Through a practical implementation of quantum ray tracing in a 3D environment, we show quantum approaches provide a quadratic improvement in query complexity compared to the equivalent classical approach. Based on domain specific knowledge, we then propose algorithms to significantly reduce the computation required for quantum ray tracing through exploiting image space coherence and a principled termination criteria for quantum searching. We show results obtained using a simulator for both Whitted style ray tracing, and for accelerating ray tracing operations when performing classical Monte Carlo integration for area lights and indirect illumination.},

Around the world, initiatives to increase the use of DNA sequencing in clinical routine are being deployed, such as the use of broad panels in the standard care for oncology patients. Such a development comes at the cost of increased demands on throughput in genomic data analysis. In this paper, we use the task of copy number variant (CNV) analysis as a context for exploring visualization concepts for clinical genomics. CNV calls are generated algorithmically, but time-consuming manual intervention is needed to separate relevant findings from irrelevant ones in the resulting large call candidate lists. We present a visualization environment, named Copycat, to support this review task in a clinical scenario. Key components are a scatter-glyph plot replacing the traditional list visualization, and a glyph representation designed for at-a-glance relevance assessments. Moreover, we present results from a formative evaluation of the prototype by domain specialists, from which we elicit insights to guide both prototype improvements and visualization for clinical genomics in general.},

Our collaborating domain scientists are going beyond traditional methods by employing both X-ray and neutron computed tomography to obtain complementary representations expected to better resolve material boundaries. However, the use of two modalities creates its own challenges for visualization, requiring either complex adjustments of bimodal transfer functions or the need for multiple views. Together with experts in nondestructive evaluation, we designed a novel interactive bimodal visualization approach to create a combined view of the co-registered X-ray and neutron acquisitions of industrial objects. Using an automatic topological segmentation of the bivariate histogram of X-ray and neutron values as a starting point, the system provides a simple yet effective interface to easily create, explore, and adjust a bimodal visualization. We propose a widget with simple brushing interactions that enables the user to quickly correct the segmented histogram results. Our semiautomated system enables domain experts to intuitively explore large bimodal datasets without the need for either advanced segmentation algorithms or knowledge of visualization techniques. We demonstrate our approach using synthetic examples, industrial phantom objects created to stress bimodal scanning techniques, and real-world objects, and we discuss expert feedback.},

To tackle this issue, we propose a dual mixup-induced consistency regularization to integrate both source and target domain to improve robustness and generalization capability. Specifically, we mix up virtual and real-world shapes in the input and latent feature space respectively, and then regularize the completion network by forcing two kinds of mixed completion predictions to be consistent. To further adapt to each instance within the real-world domain, we design a novel density-aware refiner to utilize local context information to preserve the fine-grained details and remove noise or outliers for coarse completion. Extensive experiments on real-world scans and our synthetic unpaired datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

In the first experiment, the sphere and peg were both virtual, while in the second experiment, the sphere is virtual and the peg is real. In both experiments, depth perception accuracy was found to depend on the levels of realism and congruence between the sphere, pegs, and background. In Experiment 1, realistic backgrounds lead to overestimation of depth, but resulted in underestimation when the background was virtual, and when depth cues were applied to the sphere and target peg. In Experiment 2, background and target pegs were real but matched with the virtual sphere; in comparison to Experiment 1, realistically rendered targets prompted an underestimation and more accuracy with the manipulated object. These findings suggest that congruence can affect distance estimation and the underestimation effect in the AR environment resulted from increased graphical fidelity of the foreground target and background.},

  abstract     = {Single-view clothing reconstruction usually relies on topologically fixed clothing templates to reduce the problem complexity, but this strategy also makes the reconstructed clothing shape contours simple and lack diversity. In this article, we propose a novel clothing reconstruction method to generate complex shape contours and open clothing mesh from a single image. At the heart of our work is an implicit unsigned distance field condition on clothing-oriented and pose-stable spatial shape features to represent the clothing from the image. This feature can provide spatially aligned clothing shape priors to improve the pose robustness. It is based on a type-generic clothing template derived from the mainstream clothing generative model to avoid tedious template design and switching. To output open clothing mesh results from noisy clothing unsigned distance fields, we develop a two-stage clothing mesh extraction method. It takes the point clouds as an intermediate representation and produces smooth, plausible and editable clothing mesh results. To provide effective supervision, we construct a pose-rich and shape-complete clothing scan dataset by enhancing clothing pose diversity and complementing missing clothing geometry caused by occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art levels. More importantly, we provide a simple but effective, and low-cost way to reconstruct complex shape contours clothing from a single image.},

  abstract     = {View-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in 3D shape understanding. However, they tend to make strong assumptions about the relations between views or learn the multi-view correlations indirectly, which limits the flexibility of exploring inter-view correlations and the effectiveness of target tasks. To overcome the above problems, this article investigates flexible organization and explicit correlation learning for multiple views. In particular, we propose to incorporate different views of a 3D shape into a permutation-invariant set, referred to as View Set, which removes rigid relation assumptions and facilitates adequate information exchange and fusion among views. Based on that, we devise a nimble Transformer model, named VSFormer, to explicitly capture pairwise and higher-order correlations of all elements in the set. Meanwhile, we theoretically reveal a natural correspondence between the Cartesian product of a view set and the correlation matrix in the attention mechanism, which supports our model design. Comprehensive experiments suggest that VSFormer has better flexibility, efficient inference efficiency and superior performance. Notably, VSFormer reaches state-of-the-art results on various 3 d recognition datasets, including ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN and RGBD. It also establishes new records on the SHREC’17 retrieval benchmark.},

Unfortunately, classical scatterplots suffer from scalability issues, since growing data sizes eventually lead to overplotting and visual clutter on a screen with a fixed resolution, which hinders the data analysis process. We propose an algorithm that compensates for irregular sample distributions by a smooth transformation of the scatterplot&#39;s visual domain. Our algorithm evaluates the scatterplot&#39;s density distribution to compute a regularization mapping based on integral images of the rasterized density function. The mapping preserves the samples’ neighborhood relations. Few regularization iterations suffice to achieve a nearly uniform sample distribution that efficiently uses the available screen space. We further propose approaches to visually convey the transformation that was applied to the scatterplot and compare them in a user study. We present a novel parallel algorithm for fast GPU-based integral-image computation, which allows for integrating our de-cluttering approach into interactive visual data analysis systems.},

  abstract     = {Cartoon animation video is a popular visual entertainment form worldwide, however many classic animations were produced in a 4:3 aspect ratio that is incompatible with modern widescreen displays. Existing methods like cropping lead to information loss while retargeting causes distortion. Animation companies still rely on manual labor to renovate classic cartoon animations, which is tedious and labor-intensive, but can yield higher-quality videos. Conventional extrapolation or inpainting methods tailored for natural videos struggle with cartoon animations due to the lack of textures in anime, which affects the motion estimation of the objects. In this article, we propose a novel framework designed to automatically outpaint 4:3 anime to 16:9 via region-guided motion inference. Our core concept is to identify the motion correspondences between frames within a sequence in order to reconstruct missing pixels. Initially, we estimate optical flow guided by region information to address challenges posed by exaggerated movements and solid-color regions in cartoon animations. Subsequently, frames are stitched to produce a pre-filled guide frame, offering structural clues for the extension of optical flow maps. Finally, a voting and fusion scheme utilizes learned fusion weights to blend the aligned neighboring reference frames, resulting in the final outpainting frame. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our approach over existing methods.},

Unlike birds and fish, bees fly in a low-aligned zigzag pattern. Additionally, bees rely on visual signals for foraging and predator avoidance, exhibiting distinctive local body oscillations, such as body lifting, thrusting, and swaying. These inherent features pose significant challenges to realistic bee simulations in practical animation applications. In this article, we present a bio-inspired model for bee simulations capable of replicating both macro collective behavior and local body dynamics of bees. Our approach utilizes a visually-driven system to simulate a bee&#39;s local body dynamics, incorporating obstacle perception and body rolling control for effective collision avoidance. Moreover, we develop an oscillation rule that captures the dynamics of the bee&#39;s local bodies, drawing on insights from biological research. Our model extends beyond simulating individual bees’ dynamics; it can also represent bee swarms by integrating a fluid-based field with the bees’ innate noise and zigzag motions. To fine-tune our model, we utilize pre-collected honeybee flight data. Through extensive simulations and comparative experiments, we demonstrate that our model can efficiently generate realistic low-aligned and inherently noisy bee swarms.},

Our solver eliminates this issue by entirely avoiding the use of an active set, which in turn makes the inner problems of our Newton iteration process fully unconstrained. For efficiency, exploiting the solution uniqueness of convex QPs and the fact that the pressure constraints are simple box constraints, we aggressively update solution candidates without performing any step selection procedure (such as line search) and instead directly clamp candidates back to the bounds wherever constraint violations occur. Additionally, to accelerate the inner linear solves, we present a topology-aware geometry-inspired aggregation algebraic multigrid preconditioner and describe in detail several key performance optimizations that we incorporate. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solver in various practical scenarios and show that it often surpasses various alternatives in terms of speed and memory usage.},

  abstract     = {Photorealistic stylization of 3D scenes aims to generate photorealistic images from arbitrary novel views according to a given style image, while ensuring consistency when rendering video from different viewpoints. Some existing stylization methods using neural radiance fields can effectively predict stylized scenes by combining the features of the style image with multi-view images to train 3D scenes. However, these methods generate novel view images that contain undesirable artifacts. In addition, they cannot achieve universal photorealistic stylization for a 3D scene. Therefore, a stylization image needs to retrain a 3D scene representation network based on a neural radiation field. We propose a novel photorealistic 3D scene stylization transfer framework to address these issues. It can realize photorealistic 3D scene style transfer with a 2D style image for novel view video rendering. We first pre-trained a 2D photorealistic style transfer network, which can satisfy the photorealistic style transfer between any content image and style image. Then, we use voxel features to optimize a 3D scene and obtain the geometric representation of the scene. Finally, we jointly optimize a hypernetwork to realize the photorealistic style transfer of arbitrary style images. In the transfer stage, we use a pre-trained 2D photorealistic network to constrain the photorealistic style of different views and different style images in the 3D scene. The experimental results show that our method not only realizes the 3D photorealistic style transfer of arbitrary style images, but also outperforms the existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency.},

Deep learning methods, particularly graph convolutional networks (GCNs) based mesh denoisers, have demonstrated their effectiveness in removing various complex real-world noises while preserving authentic geometry. However, it is still a quite challenging work to faithfully regress uncontaminated normals and vertices on meshes with irregular topology. In this article, we propose a novel pipeline that incorporates two parallel normal-aware and vertex-aware branches to achieve a balance between smoothness and geometric details while maintaining the flexibility of surface topology. We introduce ResGEM, a new GCN, with multi-scale embedding modules and residual decoding structures to facilitate normal regression and vertex modification for mesh denoising. To effectively extract multi-scale surface features while avoiding the loss of topological information caused by graph pooling or coarsening operations, we encode the noisy normal and vertex graphs using four edge-conditioned embedding modules (EEMs) at different scales. This allows us to obtain favorable feature representations with multiple receptive field sizes. Formulating the denoising problem into a residual learning problem, the decoder incorporates residual blocks to accurately predict true normals and vertex offsets from the embedded feature space. Moreover, we propose novel regularization terms in the loss function that enhance the smoothing and generalization ability of our network by imposing constraints on normal fidelity and consistency. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets.},

Utilizing the concept of Voronoi tessellation may help overcome the challenges owing to its distinguished properties on highly flexible topology, natural edge connectivity, and easy shape conforming. However, a variational optimization of the so-called Voronoi foams has not yet been fully explored. In addressing the issue, a concept of explicit topology optimization of open-cell Voronoi foams is proposed that can efficiently and reliably guide the foam&#39;s topology and geometry variations under critical physical and geometric requirements. Taking the site (or seed) positions and beam radii as the DOFs, we explore the differentiability of the open-cell Voronoi foams w.r.t. its seed locations, and propose a highly efficient local finite difference method to estimate the derivatives. During the gradient-based optimization, the foam topology can change freely, and some seeds may even be pushed out of shape, which greatly alleviates the challenges of prescribing a fixed underlying grid. The foam&#39;s mechanical property is also computed with a much-improved efficiency by an order of magnitude, in comparison with benchmark FEM, via a new material-aware numerical coarsening method on its highly heterogeneous density field counterpart. We show the improved performance of our Voronoi foam in comparison with classical topology optimization approaches and demonstrate its advantages in various settings.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of holographic media drives the standardization of Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) to sustain networked service provisioning. However, G-PCC inevitably introduces visually annoying artifacts, degrading the quality of experience (QoE). This work focuses on restoring G-PCC compressed point cloud attributes, e.g., RGB colors, to which fully data-driven and rules-unrolling-based post-processing filters are studied. At first, as compressed attributes exhibit nested blockiness, we develop a learning-based sample adaptive offset (NeuralSAO), which leverages a neural model using multiscale feature aggregation and embedding to characterize local correlations for quantization error compensation. Later, given statistically Gaussian distributed quantization noise, we suggest the utilization of a bilateral filter with Gaussian kernels to weigh neighbors by jointly considering their geometric and photometric contributions for restoration. Since local signals often present varying distributions, we propose estimating the smoothing parameters of the bilateral filter using an ultra-lightweight neural model. Such a bilateral filter with learnable parameters is called NeuralBF. The proposed NeuralSAO demonstrates the state-of-art restoration quality improvement, e.g., $&amp;gt; $20% BD-BR (Bjøntegaard delta rate) reduction over G-PCC on solid points clouds. However, NeuralSAO is computationally intensive and may suffer from poor generalization. On the other hand, although NeuralBF only achieves half of the gains of NeuralSAO, it is lightweight and exhibits impressive generalization across various samples. This comparative study between the data-driven large-scale NeuralSAO and the rules-unrolling-based small-scale NeuralBF helps to understand the capacity (i.e., performance, complexity, generalization) of underlying filters in terms of the quality restoration for compressed point cloud attribute.},

  abstract     = {In order to serve better VR experiences to users, existing predictive methods of Redirected Walking (RDW) exploit future information to reduce the number of reset occurrences. However, such methods often impose a precondition during deployment, either in the virtual environment&#39;s layout or the user&#39;s walking direction, which constrains its universal applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose a mechanism F-RDW that is twofold: (1) forecasts the future information of a user in the virtual space without any assumptions by using the conventional method, and (2) fuse this information while maneuvering existing RDW methods. The backbone of the first step is an LSTM-based model that ingests the user&#39;s spatial and eye-tracking data to predict the user&#39;s future position in the virtual space, and the following step feeds those predicted values into existing RDW methods (such as MPCRed, S2C, TAPF, and ARC) while respecting their internal mechanism in applicable ways. The results of our simulation test and user study demonstrate the significance of future information when using RDW in small physical spaces or complex environments. We prove that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the number of resets and increases the traveled distance between resets, hence augmenting the redirection performance of all RDW methods explored in this work.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a secure mobile edge computing (MEC) in both uplink and downlink communication with the help of autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), whereby offloading for terrestrial users (TUs) is performed at AAV equipped with an MEC server by secure communication between multiple TUs and AAV in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). In order to establish a secure communication link, we propose the joint optimal design of 3D AAV trajectory and resource allocation with the aim of minimizing total user energy consumption (UEC) under the AAV constraints including the limited energy budget, computation resources, and mobility. Especially, for 3D AAV trajectory, Rician fading is considered by including the vertical domain of AAV leading to higher AAV flight freedom. To tackle the optimization problem, the proposed algorithmic solutions leverage iterative algorithms for AAV trajectory, offloading data, and both uplink and downlink transmit power. Via numerical results, it is shown that the proposed joint design significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with a separate design.},

With multiple successive CSI snapshots, STFM can achieve excellent compression and reconstruction performance. Besides, a residual vector quantization (RVQ) with a shared and learnable codebook is introduced. The RVQ includes multiple stages to quantize the output of the encoder recursively and the corresponding quantization error can be reduced.

We then analyze that the user set can be determined by solely considering the effective signal power, which is achieved by the convergence of the sum of interference as the numbers of users and antennas go to infinity. Based on the analysis, we propose a user selection algorithm that utilizes the effective signal power.

Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. For the transmit power allocation subproblem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization subproblem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods. Additionally, numerical results contrast with those of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO systems, highlighting the advantages of SIMs in CF networks and demonstrating the efficacy of SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design, where increasing the number of meta-atoms and layers of SIMs is beneficial for improving the sum rate.},

However, the existing terrestrial routing algorithms cannot well handle the high-speed movement issue of satellites, while the existing satellite routing algorithms usually suffer from high communication overhead or high computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose a fully distributed dynamic packet routing algorithm based on Graph Neural Network (GNN)-enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL), named GraphPR. In GraphPR, the satellite routing problem is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where each satellite only needs to share the information with one-hop neighbors. Then, Graph Attention Network (GAT) is leveraged to encode the perceived one-hop information and derive a hidden representation implicitly consisting of multi-hop satellite information. Subsequently, MADRL is employed to build a fully distributed optimization framework and make routing decisions. In addition, a special mechanism called Residual Shortest Path Hops (RSPH) is designed to guide the routing selection and avoid routing loops. Finally, the experimental results illustrate that GraphPR has better performance in terms of packet loss rate, average delivery time, throughput, and average queuing length than the baseline algorithms.},

In contrast, HAPs are being considered due to their extensive coverage and line-of-sight (LoS) paths. These platforms aim to offer communication capabilities that leverage the advantages of both terrestrial and satellite systems. Due to their extensive coverage, there is no need for frequent beam switching, thereby reducing the requirement for additional overhead costs. However, there can be unexpected floating of HAPs, lead to beam misalignment and deterioration in antenna gain, especially in narrow beams. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive time slot allocation algorithm with neighbor-grid-based beam search scheme which optimizes the 3D beam direction to maximize the total transmitted data.

Besides, we jointly design the covert transmission beamforming, target beamforming, and public transmission beamforming for maximizing the covert rate, subject to satisfying the successive interference cancellation decoding order, the quality of service requirement constraint at the public user, the sensing constraint, the covert constraint, and the total transimt power constraint. The sub-optimal solutions can be derived by employing semidefinite relaxation and the Charnes-Cooper transformation, which are provided to solve the proposed non-convex covert rate maximization problem. Simulation results demostrate that the covert rate of the proposed scheme can be effectively enhanced, compared to the ISAC systems assisted by orthogonal multiple access.},

  abstract     = {The short packet transmission (SPT) has gained much attention in recent years. In SPT, the most significant characteristic is that the finite blocklength code (FBC) is adopted. With FBC, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cannot be expressed as an explicit function with respect to the other transmission parameters. This raises the following two problems for the resource allocation in SPTs: (i) The exact value of the SNR is hard to determine, and (ii) The property of SNR w.r.t. the other parameters is hard to analyze, which hinders the efficient optimization of them. To simultaneously tackle these problems, we have developed a recursion method in our prior work. To emphasize the significance of this method, we further analyze its convergence rate and investigate the property of the recursion function in this paper. Specifically, we first analyze the convergence rate of the recursion method, which indicates it can determine the SNR with low complexity. Then, we analyze the property of the recursion function, which facilitates the optimization of the other parameters during the recursion. Finally, we also enumerate some applications for the recursion method. Simulation results indicate that the recursion method converges faster than the other SNR determination methods.},

In specific, the transmission and reflection coefficients of the STAR-RIS are updated through a novel STAR-RIS element allocation technique. The STAR-RIS element allocation technique allocates each element to two sub-carriers, where one sub-carrier serves a single user-equipment (UE) in the transmission region of the STAR-RIS, and the other sub-carrier serves a single UE in the reflection region of the STAR-RIS. Through the element allocation process, the phase coefficients of the STAR-RIS are obtained in closed-form, and the amplitude coefficients of the STAR-RIS, which are to satisfy the law of conservation of energy, are obtained by iteratively solving a properly defined problem that has a closed-form solution, decreasing the complexity of the overall algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves high sum rate performance close to an optimization-based benchmark even with low complexity.},

This work aims to propose a joint user activity detection and channel estimate approach for asynchronous mMTC scenarios in CFmMIMO. We deal with user activity detection and channel estimation as a structural compressive sensing problem, which is related to asynchronous latency, active users, and channel coefficients, making use of sporadic nature of mMTC traffic. In particular, we implement an asynchronous aware simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (AA-SOMP) scheme at central processing unit. This approach is effective to retrieve channel coefficients and active user information of numerous APs, even with restricted pilot length and asynchronous delays.

In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition. Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed. Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell. The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.},

Different from centralized schemes, which gather all the channel state information (CSI) at the central processing unit (CPU) for calculating the resource allocation, the local resource of access points (APs) is exploited in the proposed distributed GNN-based framework to allocate transmit powers. Specifically, APs can use a unique GNN model to allocate their power based on the local CSI. The GNN model is trained at the CPU using the local CSI of one AP, with partially exchanged information from other APs to calculate the loss function to reflect system characteristics, capturing comprehensive network information while avoiding computation burden.

By exploiting the geometrical structure of the combined base station-RIS-user equipment channel, the proposed HDR estimator recasts parametric channel estimation as a single sixth-order rank-one tensor approximation problem, which can be efficiently solved using higher-order singular value decomposition to deliver parallel estimates of each channel component vector. Numerical results show that the proposed method provides significantly more accurate parameter estimates than competing state-of-the-art tensor-based RIS channel estimation, Khatri-Rao factorization, and least squares methods. For higher-rank channels, the HDR method shows similar spectral efficiency compared to its competitors while having similar computational complexity to the classical least squares estimator.},

A transmit power minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the beamforming vector of the primary base station, reflection coefficients and common stream. To solve the non-convex problem, an iterative-based robust RA algorithm is proposed by using the alternating optimization method, successive convex approximation, and semi-definite relaxation.

This letter investigates MA technology-enabled multiuser uplink communications over general Rician fading channels, which consist of a base station (BS) equipped with the MA array and multiple single-antenna users. Since it is practically challenging to collect all instantaneous channel state information (CSI) by traversing all possible antenna positions at the BS, we instead propose a two-timescale scheme for maximizing the ergodic sum rate. Specifically, antenna positions at the BS are first optimized using only the statistical CSI. Subsequently, the receiving beamforming at the BS (for which we consider the three typical zero-forcing (ZF), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and MMSE with successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receivers) is designed based on the instantaneous CSI with optimized antenna positions, thus significantly reducing practical implementation complexities. The formulated problems are highly non-convex and we develop projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithms to effectively handle them. Simulation results illustrate that compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array, the MA array can achieve significant performance gains by reaping an additional spatial degree of freedom.},

However, in an outdoor environment specifically at the road intersection, VLC faces some challenges such as line-of-sight (LoS) link blockages due to obstacles, and uneven power distribution due to unguided non-line-of-sight (NLoS) reflections, which limits its large-scale deployment in dense scenarios. In this paper, we propose an optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS)-aided V2V system with an optimal irradiance angle method to guide the NLoS link towards the desired user in order to maximize the received power at the user. Further, for a given user distribution, we propose a novel algorithm to find the optimal orientation of the OIRS element that will produce the maximum power at the receiver. The proposed algorithm returns the rotational angles which will result in the optimal orientation of the OIRS elements with the time complexity of $O(1)$ . In addition, closed-form expression is derived for the obtained optimal irradiance angle, essentially a cosine of the irradiance angle for an element of OIRS based on the location of OIRS and the receiver&#39;s (user) position.},

  abstract     = {Movable antenna (MA) technology, which can reconfigure wireless channels by flexibly moving antenna positions in a specified region, has great potential for improving communication performance. In this paper, we consider a new setup of MAs-enabled multicasting, where we adopt a simple setting in which a linear MA array-enabled source ($\mathrm{{S}}$) transmits a common message to two single-antenna users $\mathrm{{U}}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{{U}}_{2}$. We aim to maximize the minimum rate among these two users, by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna positions at $\mathrm{{S}}$. Instead of utilizing the widely-used alternating optimization (AO) approach, we reveal, with rigorous proof, that the above two variables can be optimized separately: i) the optimal antenna positions can be firstly determined via the successive convex approximation technique, based on the rule of maximizing the correlation between $\mathrm{{S}}$-$\mathrm{{U}}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{{S}}$-$\mathrm{{U}}_{2}$ channels; ii) afterwards, the optimal closed-form transmit beamforming can be derived via simple arguments. Compared to AO, this new approach yields the same performance but reduces the computational complexities significantly. Moreover, it can provide insightful conclusions which are not possible with AO.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a geometrically-based wireless channel model with limited Angle of Arrival (AOA). This model assumes that the line-of-sight (LOS) paths are obscured and scatterers are distributed within the scattering angle around a mobile station, resulting in the AOA received by the base station being limited to a certain range. Such a single bounce scattering models can be used for different 6G scenarios such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) by adjusting the angle parameter. Accordingly, the azimuthal angle and time of arrival marginal probability density functions (PDFs) are derived in closed form, which is evaluated in numerical simulation by compared to the normalized histograms. Finally, the proposed model is analyzed and verified with the measured data in micro and macro cells, which clearly demonstrates its accuracy and flexibility.},

Traditional fault detection faces challenges due to the high mobility of vehicles and prevalent software, hardware, and communication link faults, necessitating a robust solution for timely and accurate fault detection. This paper introduces ET-FD, a novel fault detection method based on ensemble learning designed to address the unique challenges in VANETs. ET-FD satisfies stringent accuracy requirements and aims to reduce system overhead significantly. We present experimental results demonstrating the superior performance of ET-FD in terms of fault detection accuracy and false positive rates, alongside comparisons with other classification methods that highlight its reduced training time.

  abstract     = {In this article, an efficient wireless federated learning (FL) framework based on blockchain (BC) assistance is studied. Many existing frameworks adopt lots of third-party servers as consensus nodes, which is vulnerable to collusion attacks. In our framework, the blockchain-assisted FL (BFL) model selects edge users as blockchain nodes without any third-party intervention. Besides, the convergence analysis of this FL algorithm considering transmission outages is provided to prove the effects of wireless factors on FL. To solve the low efficiency of the BC based on the conventional linear chain structure, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain is introduced into our work. Moreover, since the design and optimization of FL and BC in most existing works are done separately, this may result in sub-optimal performance. To achieve an excellent trade-off between FL efficiency and BC performance, a joint optimization problem regarding DAG-BFL is formulated. The optimization objective is to maximize the FL performance and DAG-BC throughput. To solve the complex nonconvex optimization problem, considering the resource-constrained BFL system, the joint communication and computing resource allocation as well as block designing schemes are proposed, which are based on the twin-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method and the successive block minimization technique (BSUM). Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, compared with the traditional alternative optimization, the proposed PDD-based algorithm achieves better performance.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), data sharing as a key service for most IoV applications has emerged as an effective way to break down data silos and unlock the data&#39;s potential. In order to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data-sharing process, various advanced cryptographic techniques have been proposed by both the research community and industry. As one of the most intensive primitives among these techniques, searchable encryption (SE) has attracted extensive attention. SE enables users to search encrypted sharing data without decrypting operations. However, most existing works suffer from drawbacks such as privacy leakage, deployment complexity, or low efficiency when applied in practical IoV environments. In this paper, we design a lightweight certificateless searchable public key encryption (CLSPKE) scheme with trapdoor indistinguishability to simultaneously solve the above security and efficiency problems. The proposed scheme not only eliminates the need for complex certificate management and key escrow issues, but also achieves trapdoor indistinguishability without relying on the bilinear pairing operation. We compare the proposed scheme with other relevant schemes and implement its prototype. Extensive experiments and evaluations indicate that the proposed scheme is practical as it significantly reduces computation and communication costs while still maintaining strong privacy protection.},

The mobility of UAVs and the signal redirection capabilities of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be utilized to reduce these negative effects. In this paper, we propose a multi-user localization scheme in UAV-enabled millimeter-wave wireless networks, where the UAV localizes the chosen ground user by receiving the positioning reference signal from both the direct path and the reflected path via a RIS in each time instance. We derive the positioning error bound (PEB) based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of the unknown channel parameters and location parameters. Then we propose an alternating algorithm to minimize the maximum PEB among all users, by optimizing the UAV trajectory, the user scheduling, the UAV beamforming, and the RIS phase shifts iteratively until convergence. Furthermore, we formulate a robust optimization problem with imperfect knowledge of location parameters to minimize the maximum worst-case PEB, which can also be solved by the alternating algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed alternating algorithm can improve the localization accuracy by more than twice compared to the scheme with a fixed base station and the scheme without RIS deployment.},

To address the issue of excessive response latency caused by the surge in data traffic, edge caching (EC) technology has proven to be effective. However, accurately predicting the popularity of content in different regions is challenging due to the high degree of mobility of the vehicles. Additionally, as vehicles typically do not remain in the same region for a long period of time, making the content popularity within a region highly dynamic. To address this issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based mobile-aware edge cooperative caching scheme (MAECCD). Our approach utilizes an AutoEncoder to capture user features from local vehicle user data and accurately forecast content popularity in both vehicle-local and edge regions. Furthermore, the MAECCD incorporates a cooperation model between edge nodes to optimize cache utilization and employs techniques in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to refresh cached content and reduce transmission delay. Experimental results indicate that our MAECCD scheme outperforms other baseline algorithms in terms of cache hit ratio and content transmission delay.},

In this paper, we aim to understand two key challenges: 1) how often a client uses the service in the presence of acquisition time and price, and 2) how the provider prices the service based on limited resources, acquisition time, and incomplete information about the clients. We first analyze a single-client Stackelberg game with a finite time horizon. Our analysis shows that the client&#39;s optimal decision is to use the service at equal intervals whose length depends on the minimum acquisition time and price. Leveraging the equal-interval insight, we further analyze the provider&#39;s pricing from a multi-client Stackelberg game with an infinite time horizon. We devise efficient algorithms for the multi-client problem with complete and incomplete information settings. Moreover, numerical results reveal that the realized profit from the complete information setting can be much lower than the expected profit from the incomplete information setting. We, therefore, develop a method for the provider to make the trade-off between profit and the risk of profit loss. Our numerical results suggest that lower pricing to serve a smaller number of clients reduces the risk of profit loss.},

However, the performance of virtualized nodes sharing cache resources in 6G network slicing is degraded by the inappropriate allocation of resources. This paper proposes a cache resource allocation strategy for 6G network slicing based on game dynamics (RASGD). A 6G slicing network model is developed that describes the relationship between virtualized node mapping and resource sharing, and an evolutionary public goods game cache resource allocation (PGGRA) method is proposed to improve data transmission performance. This strategy defines the cache resource gap and selects the input cost according to the cache resource gap and evolutionary game strategy. When the cache resources are sufficient, the input is carried out, and when the cache resources are insufficient or the demand is large, unnecessary input is reduced to avoid the waste of resources, so as to achieve the intelligent allocation of cache resource. Simulation results demonstrate that the RASGD strategy improves the successful arrival rate of slice packets by at least 4.79% and improves the network congestion by at least 22.9% compared with the resource allocation strategy based on number of nodes (RANN) and resource allocation strategy based on node degree (RAND).},

  abstract     = {In the domain of vehicular engineering, multipath detection plays a critical role in the accurate assessment of the environment. This paper introduces a Shapley value-based power resource allocation (SVPRA) method developed for low-grazing angle detection in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) radar sensor networks (RSN). The SVPRA leverages multipath echoes for improved detection performance through coordinated power resource allocation (PRA). A systematic multipath scattering model with uncertainty identifies four independent spatial paths, highlighting the impact of multipath effects (ME) fluctuations on detection. The PRA is then formulated as a non-convex Max-min optimization problem, incorporating the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) indicator and modeling cognitive collaboration detection as a cooperative game. The application of the PRA rule has been mathematically proven to consistently enhance the detection performance. To address convergence challenges in multi-target scenarios, a fine-tuning method is introduced, providing a provisional iteration outcome, succeeded by a greedy selection process to achieve a feasible solution. Simulation results validate that the SVPRA method effectively enhances detection performance while reducing the system&#39;s timeliness load.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a fundamental task in array processing. A popular family of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation algorithms are subspace methods, which operate by dividing the measurements into distinct signal and noise subspaces. Subspace methods, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and Root-MUSIC, rely on several restrictive assumptions, including narrowband non-coherent sources and fully calibrated arrays, and their performance is considerably degraded when these do not hold. In this work we propose SubspaceNet; a data-driven DoA estimator which learns how to divide the observations into distinguishable subspaces. This is achieved by utilizing a dedicated deep neural network to learn the empirical autocorrelation of the input, by training it as part of the Root-MUSIC method, leveraging the inherent differentiability of this specific DoA estimator, while removing the need to provide a ground-truth decomposable autocorrelation matrix. Once trained, the resulting SubspaceNet serves as a universal surrogate covariance estimator that can be applied in combination with any subspace-based DoA estimation method, allowing its successful application in challenging setups. SubspaceNet is shown to enable various DoA estimation algorithms to cope with coherent sources, wideband signals, low SNR, array mismatches, and limited snapshots, while preserving the interpretability and the suitability of classic subspace methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of low earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, the ultra-dense LEO satellite network (UDLSN) has become a promising solution to provide Internet services for civil aviation due to its wide coverage, exceptional flexibility and high reliability. To guarantee the continuity and high-quality Internet services, satellite-aircraft handover is inevitable because of the high mobility of aircraft and satellites. However, the stringent passenger communication requirements and the considerable increase in the scale of candidate satellites pose huge challenges in satellite-aircraft handover in UDLSNs. In this paper, we investigate multiple civil aircraft handover issue including satellite handover, subchannel allocation, and power selection in the UDLSN and consider different levels of usersâ rate satisfaction, power overhead, and handover overhead as handover criteria for performance measure. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize the handover satisfaction of all civil aircraft. Particularly, the formulated handover problem is represented as a local cooperation game, where each aircraft determines the handover action and the power level by cooperating with other interference aircraft. We prove that the proposed game has at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution in which no aircraft changes its handover strategy. The NE solution in the proposed game is further proven to locally or globally maximize the optimization objective and we then design the parallel handover strategy update (PHSU) algorithm to find the NE solution. Simulation results based on trajectories of real civil aircraft demonstrate that, the designed algorithm is robust, can effectively meet diverse user requirements, and reduce both handover frequency and delays.},

  abstract     = {With the exponential advancement of vehicle networking applications and autonomous driving technology, the demand for efficient and secure autonomous vehicles (AVs) is increasing. AVs require the ability to gather information to navigate complex and ever-changing traffic environments, making effective communication with other vehicles or roadside units (RSUs) crucial for achieving co-awareness. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology emerges as a promising solution for the future of autonomous driving. However, in the dynamic and uncertain real-world road environment, the selection of sensing and communication (SC) functions becomes paramount in enhancing performance. Moreover, ambient noise often disrupts the interaction between vehicles and roadside units, leading to a partial loss of environmental states. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for selecting sensing and communication functions, even in the presence of partial loss of environmental states. Specifically, we approximate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to a complete Markov decision process (MDP) through matrix completion and subsequently utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve it. Additionally, we propose a matrix completion algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with deep unfolding to accurately complete the missing environmental states. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other POMDP-based approaches for SC function selection in an ISAC-enabled vehicular network.},

However, the onboard computation resources may be insufficient, resulting in long processing latencies. To deal with this critical issue, we jointly consider roadside unit (RSU) and assistant vehicle offloading, along with resource allocation, to minimize latency for vehicular tasks. This approach also takes into account frequency reuse among sub-areas for assistant vehicle offloading. The latency minimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Given the inherent complexity of the MINLP problem, we propose a two-step solution. The first step focuses on the combined decision of assistant vehicle offloading and transmit power allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with low complexity and low average transmit power. The second step deals with RSU offloading/local computation decision, bandwidth allocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Without adding additional computation resources, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicular task offloading approach improves overall delay performance than the adaptive MEC offloading scheme and the pure MEC computing scheme.},

However, this issue has received little attention, and traditional cooperative positioning methods are no longer suitable for the network of high-density vehicles. In order to solve the cooperative localization issue in high-density vehicle networks, This paper proposes a region-constrained vehicle cooperative localization algorithm based on stochastic geometry. By setting restricted areas of vehicles, the communication capability and network capacity between vehicles are effectively improved. Then, to take full advantage of the density of the Ultra-high density vehicles network, the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDoP) metric is used to dynamically introduce cooperative vehicles. By dynamically selecting vehicles, the value of GDoP decreases significantly with the increase of vehicle density. Finally, experimental simulations show that the network capacity in the vehicle system is improved by about 71% at the maximum interruption probability when using vehicle selection with restricted areas. Furthermore, the positioning performance of vehicles improves continuously with the increasing density of the cooperative vehicle network.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are increasingly being used to provide communications in emergencies. Maintaining the required quality of service of information including its timely delivery, in MANETs, is extremely challenging under dynamic conditions such as a changing bushfire scenario. Nodes get destroyed or their link qualities degrade leading to sub-optimal paths, reduced network performance, and disconnected end nodes. To remedy partitioning in ground-based MANETs and to improve their communication performance, aUtonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising relay solution. This paper presents U-QoIT, a UAV deployment algorithm for connecting the disconnected end nodes in a dynamic bushfire scenario. It aims to meet the Quality of Information requirements, with a minimal number of UAVs deployed. U-QoIT takes the UAV deployment problem as a combinatorial search problem and reduces the deployment complexity by applying a reduction by minimization approach. This is done to deploy fewer UAVs without compromising connectivity. Extensive simulation results depict that U-QoIT significantly improves user usability by 48% compared to the best-performing baseline approach, of Dynamic Service Area (DSA) based UAV deployment, at the expense of a negligible increase in computational time. It achieves a 38% drop in packet latency and retains its out-performance in a highly mobile network. In a sparse network, it improves user usability by 106%. Furthermore, it needs fewer UAVs, compared to the baseline UAV deployment methods, without compromising its performance gains.},

In this paper, we put the fast worker identification into a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and propose a Thompson sampling (TS)-based approach to tackle it. Then, our approach leverages the heterogeneity of computing speeds by formulating the task allocation problem to minimize the expected computing delay. We derive a lower bound for the delay and prove that our proposed algorithm minimizes this bound. Importantly, the time complexity of our algorithm is independent of the number of tasks to be assigned, which is typically large in practical scenarios. When our scheme is applied to solve the linear regression problem, simulation results show that it reduces the computing delay of a state-of-the-art method by more than 15% in two different scenarios.},

However, it still faces substantial challenges posed by large-scale complex DT communications in sustaining real-time collaborative endeavors. In particular, within the dynamic VECONs, the decision regarding DT migration plays a pivotal role in sustaining the quality of services. In this paper, we propose an adaptive DT migration (ADM) algorithm to minimize the overall migration costs when DTs deliver services. Specifically, 1) We formulate ADM as a combinatorial optimization problem in VECONs, comprehensively considering communication latency and migration latency under complex DT communications, vehicular mobilities, and dynamic states of edges; 2) An ADM algorithm based on off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning is proposed to make migration decisions. Moreover, the ADM agent employs warm-up policies to address exploration challenges in sparse state spaces; 3) Simulations based on real-world, large-scale urban vehicular mobility datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing algorithms by approximately 39% on average, and it can achieve results close to the optimal.},

  abstract     = {Compressive sensing (CS) has been applied as an effective technique to reconstruct collected data from a subset of sensors in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Although many algorithms have been proposed to exploit data correlation among sensors, a majority of these research endeavors focus on sensor selection under ideal communication links. As a result, reconstruction quality would be severely affected when packet losses occur during transmissions. In this paper, we propose to optimize allocation of communication resources to sensors for allowing data retransmissions so the impact of packet losses can be effectively mitigated. Unlike previous work that either does not allow retransmissions or determines the number of retransmissions for each sensor purely based on its packet delivery ratio while disregarding data correlation with other sensors, we further exploit data correlation among sensors for optimization of resource allocation. To proceed, we apply CS with Bayesian estimation to derive the analytical lower bound of data reconstruction error in the target scenario and incorporate retransmission opportunities into the problem formulation. Based on the principle of rank-one adjustment for matrix inversion, we efficiently compute matrix inversion of the data-loss matrix required to minimize reconstruction error. We then propose a greedy yet effective algorithm to determine resource allocation strategy and apply a meta-heuristic search algorithm to further validate its solution. Our proposed algorithms are evaluated using both simulated environment and data from real-world sensor deployment under various resource constraints and data correlation settings. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform existing algorithms in terms of reconstruction error and computation efficiency under link losses.},

  abstract     = {The significance of transportation efficiency, safety, and related services continues to increase in urban vehicular networks. Within such networks, roadside units (RSUs) serve as intermediaries in facilitating communication. Therefore, the deployment of RSUs is of utmost importance in ensuring the quality of communication services. However, the optimization objectives, such as time delay and deployment cost, are commonly developed from diverse perspectives. As a result, it is possible that conflicts may arise among the objectives. Furthermore, in urban environments, the presence of various obstacles, such as buildings, gardens, lakes, and other infrastructure, poses challenges for the deployment of RSUs. Consequently, the deployment encounters significant difficulties due to the existence of multiple objectives, constraints imposed by obstacles, and the need to explore a large-scale optimization space. To address this issue, two versions of multi-objective optimization algorithms are proposed in this paper. By utilizing a multi-population strategy and an adaptive exploration technique, the proposed methods efficiently explore a large-scale decision-variable space. In order to mitigate the issue of an overcrowded deployment of RSUs, a calibrating mechanism is adopted to adjust RSU density during the optimization procedures. The proposed methods also address data offloading between vehicles and RSUs by setting up an iterative best response sequence game (IBRSG). Comparative analyses against several state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that our strategies achieve superior performance in both high-density and low-density urban scenarios.

  abstract     = {As smart cities rapidly evolve, the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network faces significant challenges in data security and communication efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative algorithm based on a reputation mechanism, named the Dynamic Vehicle Reputation Consensus (DVRC), which focuses on improving the data security and communication efficiency of vehicular networks using blockchain technology. The DVRC algorithm comprehensively assesses vehicle behaviors and the consensus contribution within the blockchain network, utilizing a reputation scoring system to evaluate the reliability within the network. Furthermore, this study delves into multimodal communication strategies in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. Notably, when vehicles leave the range of basic infrastructure, those with high reputation scores (as determined by the DVRC&#39;s reputation values) relay the communication service. Additionally, the introduction of a reputation incentive mechanism and dynamic consensus threshold adjustments aim to improve consensus efficiency and encourage honest behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the DVRC algorithm significantly improves communication efficiency in blockchain-based vehicular networks, such as increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved network scalability. These advances have substantial theoretical and practical significance for the development of vehicular networks in smart cities.},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) have become a key area of research, representing a cutting-edge architectural concept for sixth-generation (6G) networks aimed at achieving ubiquitous connectivity. This paper focuses on the challenge of online access scheduling across multiple platforms. Specifically, when multiple users randomly enter the network and request access through high-altitude platform (HAP) relays, the system must make real-time decisions on whether to grant or deny access, while considering the connections between HAPs and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. By explicitly modelingthe data collection process and the workload associated with transmission tasks, we formulate the multi-access scheduling challenge as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, which presents high computational complexity. Given the practical system&#39;s lack of prior knowledge about user attributes, such as arrival times and channel conditions, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based model for real-time decision-making. To enhance feature extraction within the DRL architecture, we introduce a graph neural network (GNN)-based encoder, and employ a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) module to manage the exponential increase in action space resulting from simultaneous decisions on multiple access requests. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the integrated GNN and Seq2Seq (iGNNSeq)-enhanced RL achieves performance comparable to offline solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the spectrum access and power control problem in a heterogeneous cellular and vehicular communication network comprising both cellular links and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. We formulate the spectrum access and power control problem as a fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning task, where each V2V link receives an identical reward at each time step. This strategy caters to the heterogeneous Quality-of-Service requirements, including the high reliability and low latency requirements for safety-centric applications, as well as the high transmission rate requirements for entertainment applications. Consequently, we design a multi-criterion objective reward function that accounts for the heterogeneous traffic demands. Subsequently, we introduce a robust multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. The proposed approach employs global observation to learn policies for each V2V agent during training, while allowing each agent to take an action based on its local observation during distributed execution phase. Furthermore, we consider imperfect spectrum sensing and outdated channel state information (CSI) in the work. Henceforth, a critic network incorporating long short-term memory layers is developed to effectively leverage the global observation, thereby mitigating the impact of outdated CSI and sensing errors. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method comparing to other existing methods in terms of transmission success rate of cellular links, average capacity for entertainment applications of V2V links, and payload delivery rate for safety-centric applications of V2V links.

  abstract     = {The incorporation of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents a promising shift of paradigm for traditional mobile edge computing (MEC) with ground infrastructure. An air-ground coordinated MEC framework provides extensive signaling coverage and additional computing power for user equipments (UEs), especially in remote areas or emerging scenarios. This paper proposes a novel air-ground coordinated MEC system, comprising a laser-powered UAV and a ground access point (AP). In this setup, the UAV serves both as an MEC server and a relay, while the AP supplies energy to the UAV through laser charging. Given the uncertainties in wireless energy harvesting, our goal is to minimize the UAV&#39;s long-term average energy consumption by collaboratively optimizing its trajectory, task allocation between the UAV and AP, and time for energy harvesting. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce a two-step alternating optimization algorithm that decouples the optimization variables into two subproblems. Subproblem 1 focuses on computation task and energy harvesting time allocation, formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. Subproblem 2 addresses real-time trajectory scheduling for the UAV, tackled using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm&#39;s convergence and its effectiveness in reducing UAV energy consumption compared to benchmark schemes across various scenarios. Additionally, the optimal policies pertaining to UAV trajectory and task allocation ratios are identified and discussed, highlighting key features and implications.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio (CR) and Energy Harvesting (EH) techniques have offered insights to mitigate issues related to inefficient spectrum utilization and limited energy storage capacity. In Cognitive Radio Networks, security threats, particularly from eavesdroppers, may result in information leakage. This study focuses on enhancing the Physical Layer Security (PLS) of multi-users with EH by employing cooperative jamming via a Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) to maximize the secure communication rate. In the AAV-assisted EH-CR system, Secondary Users (SUs) can utilize the licensed spectrum band occupied by a Primary User (PU) if the cooperative jamming power from SUs to the PU remains below a certain threshold. SUs can harvest and use Radio Frequency (RF) energy from the Primary Transmitter (PT). The AAV jammer disrupts the eavesdropper by transmitting jamming signals, thereby minimizing stolen information to optimize long-term secure communication performance. The paper formulates the problem of maximizing the average secure communication rate while considering system constraints and jointly optimizes the AAV trajectory, transmission power, and EH coefficient. As the problem is non-convex, it is reformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper employs the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to address the problem, introduces counterfactual baselines to tackle the credit assignment problem in centralized learning, and integrates the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enhance the learning capability of sequential sample data, thereby improving the training efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.

However, existing solutions fail to support pseudonym unlinkability, and lacks a mechanism to ensure public verification of tracing and avoid malicious accusations against innocent vehicles for ensuring tracing robustness. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based robust and conditional privacy-preserving authentication (LRCPA) scheme for VANETs, which enables anonymous authentication on vehicles and adopts the small integer solution problem to withstand quantum attacks. Specially, obfuscated expiration dates are set for vehicles&#39; credentials and pseudonyms to guarantee the unlinkability of new and old pseudonyms. The public verification of tracing is ensured by adopting vehicles&#39; commitments or signatures on their real identities and pseudonyms as the proof of tracing, and tracing robustness is provided by employing vehicles&#39; credentials issued by a central authority as the proof of malicious accusations or framing behaviors by the corrupted authority during tracing. LRCPA not only achieves message authentication and integrity, non-repudiation, anonymity, conditional privacy, unlinkability, key escrow freedom, public verification of tracing, and tracing robustness, but also effectively withstands most known attacks. Comprehensive performance analysis and evaluation show the potential usability of LRCPA.},

In this paper, with consideration of the constraint induced by the UAV flight dynamics, the dynamic trajectory design challenge within the blockchain-based multi-UAV-assisted MEC framework is investigated. An intelligent algorithm that integrates multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and CVXPY solver, named MADDPG-LC, is proposed to achieve real-time joint optimization of dynamic trajectory control and resource allocation with respect to minimizing weighted energy consumption and delays.

To handle this problem, the alternate optimization (AO) method is utilized to decouple the formulated problem into several sub-problems which are solved by optimizing one set of variables with other sets being fixed. Specifically, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to obtain the BS&#39;s transmit beamforming vectors (TBVs), while obtaining the RIS phase shifts based on the combination of SCA and penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) algorithms, and an optimal power splitting (PS) ratio of each user is derived in a closed-form solution.

We formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem involving hybrid RSMA matrices and a common rate allocation vector, with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency while approaching the performance of ideal hybrid RSMA. Departing from traditional non-convex problem-solving methods, we introduce a hybrid RSMA optimization scheme based on deep residual networks to enhance the feasibility of hybrid precoding and decoding. Initially, due to the absence of standardized and universal datasets, we propose a dataset generation algorithm to create training and testing datasets for subsequent communication model training. Subsequently, we construct a loss function that integrates the objective function with the constraints of the optimization problem. Lastly, to ensure that the optimization variables strictly comply with the constraints, we design a mandatory constraint module comprising modulus, power, and rate constraint sub-modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional optimization methods, and RSMA shows significant advantages over conventional multiple access (MA) schemes.},

  abstract     = {The use of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) bands in 5G/6G cellular networks offers high data rates but demands infrastructure densification. To reduce deployment costs, the 3GPP has introduced Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) enabling multi-hop connectivity via low-cost IAB relay nodes. Multicast communications appear particularly advantageous in IAB systems as they permit saving spectrum resources both in access and backhaul. This work aims at evaluating the impact of the multicast transmission mode and multicast-aware user association in 5G/6G mmWave/sub-THz self-backhauled systems serving unicast and multicast traffic. We develop an optimization framework for user association and multicast grouping in IAB taking into account the specifics of the propagation in mmWave/sub-THz spectrum, antenna design, and resource sharing between access and backhaul. The resulting optimization problem is solved using an approximate dynamic programming approach capable of handling the 3GPP-recommended numbers of cell users. Our results show that in an IAB network unicast and multicast users differ in their optimal associations, namely, multicast users tend to be associated more frequently with the relay nodes compared to unicast users, and this difference is more notable in low blockage scenarios. Quantitatively, the use of multicasting in an IAB system permits saving up to 40% of resources.},

With the deploying of SLM units, OMC systems can split one light beam to multiple beams directing to different receivers, and hence bring in a new design freedom on the energy allocation for each sub-beam. In this paper, we study a general model of the OMC systems that the transmitter wants to broadcast multiple messages to multiple users, and some of the users may request a same message. We focus on characterizing the capacity region of such OMC systems, in order to assess the benefits on capacity by deploying SLM units. For the general cases, numerical solutions of the capacity region are raised, and for special cases that the system is symmetric or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is rather low, closed form results of the capacity region are proposed. We also study the OMC system which broadcasts two different messages, and give out a partial closed form result of the capacity region. From this case, we can find that characterizing the capacity region for OMC systems is equivalent to optimizing high order polynomial, which is doable but impossible to find closed form results in general.

Our approach leverages orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to address the challenges of frequency-selective fading. To mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issues inherent in OFDM signals, the desired low-PAPR property is also incorporated into the design of the waveforms. For enhanced radar sensing functionality, we introduce an advanced metric, the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL), meticulously crafted to measure and minimize low-range sidelobes. On the communication front, we integrate constructive interference (CI) techniques to significantly enhance quality of service (QoS) in data transmission. To address the intricate optimization challenges presented by our design objectives, we have developed an efficient algorithm anchored in the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm notably surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in reducing range sidelobe interference. Furthermore, our CI-based approach yields enhanced performance compared to traditional least squares (LS) methods, achieving lower symbol error rates (SER) and higher average achievable sum rates.},

  abstract     = {The uniform circular array (UCA) currently stands as the predominant method for generating orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the radio frequency band. Existing studies paid little attention to the impact of the antenna element&#39;s radiation pattern (AERP) on the OAM communication performance. In this paper, we present a UCA-based OAM communication model that considers the AERP. Through the model, it is theoretically demonstrated that perfect orthogonality of OAM modes is maintained only when the AERP is symmetric in the azimuthal angle. However, AERP is typically asymmetric due to the designing or manufacturing error, leading to a decline in OAM mode isolation. To address this issue, we propose the use of the sequentially rotated UCA (SRUCA) and prove that the mode orthogonality of SRUCA can always be maintained despite the asymmetry of the AERP. However, because the spatial orientation of each antenna element changes, the attribute of the SRUCA-based OAM communications also changes. To explore the performance difference, we further construct the electric field vector model of SRUCA-based OAM communications and theoretically prove that orthogonality among excitation modes still exists. Additionally, there is mode gain variation for the SRUCA compared with the UCA. Typically, in general communication scenarios where the communication distance is significantly larger than the UCA radius, there is 50% polarization loss (PL) for the linear polarization (LP) SRUCA when full modes multiplexing is performed. Comprehensive simulations of phase and amplitude error, mode isolation, polarization variation, and PL are performed. The results validate the theoretical analysis.},

In addition, embedded devices are not able to provide sufficient computing power, which hinders the application of DL solutions. Motivated by this, the dynamic self-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the dependence of DL on training samples. Aiming for the optimal trade-off between sensing performance and computational complexity, the efficient model design, Self-Attention Channel Shuffle Mobile Network (SACSMN), is formulated. Experimental results demonstrate that SACSMN achieves similar sensing performance to that based on the full training set under the condition of few samples, the dependence of SACSMN on training samples is significantly reduced. Furthermore, SACSMN significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving the same level of sensing performance as the benchmarks, realizing the optimal trade-off between system sensing performance and computational complexity.

  abstract     = {A novel integrated antenna supporting polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability is proposed for emerging millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicular communication. To meet the reconfigurability requirement of the vehicular communication system, a compact shared-aperture two-dimensional leaky-wave antenna (LWA) is designed. The LWA is generated by the parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) long-slot structure and its open stopband issue is suppressed completely by employing a unit cell with two asymmetrical slots, leading to high-gain and broadband characteristics. Besides, a multifunction feeding network constituted by four switchable input ports, four parabolic reflector systems, and an integrated multifunction coupler is seamlessly incorporated with the radiation aperture within a single substrate, realizing a low-cost solution for vehicular communication applications. Based on the proposed design concept, a broadband high-gain integrated antenna featuring polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability is engineered, fabricated, and installed into an antenna measurement system for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed antenna achieves a peak gain of 23.6 dBi together with a bandwidth of 56.6% from 19 GHz to 34 GHz. Additionally, it exhibits good polarization and radiation beam reconfigurable capability, providing horizontal/vertical linear-polarization single-beam, right-/left-handed circular-polarization single-beam, and dual-linear-polarization equal/unequal-amplitude dual-beam operating capability. Furthermore, a wide beam scanning coverage of 105$^{\circ }$ in xoz-plane and 108$^{\circ }$ in yoz-plane is achieved by the presented design. The extraordinary advantages of the proposed integrated antenna such as wide bandwidth, high gain, polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability, and low cost make it suitable for various millimeter-wave vehicular communication application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Delay-sensitive services, particularly Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) services, are envisioned as one of the primary applications for 5G and forthcoming 6G networks. However, guaranteeing the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements through efficient resource allocation remains a formidable challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising solution, conventional online RL methodologies typically necessitate direct interactions with practical wireless networks during training, posing potential risks to URLLC services if suboptimal actions are taken. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel offline data-driven optimization framework for designing radio resource allocation algorithms. Inspired by the dynamic nature of the wireless network inherently captured in the historical operation data traces, our proposed framework takes advantage of offline RL to optimize resource allocation policies solely from offline datasets, thus avoiding the risks associated with online training on practical networks. Moreover, to effectively characterize dynamic fluctuations in the number of active users, our framework incorporates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the GNN-based architecture can enhance the policies&#39; scalability and generalization capabilities, enabling the learned policies to adapt to evolving network conditions. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel radio resource allocation algorithm, namely GNN-based offline RL (GNN-ORL). Extensive experimental results validate the performance of the proposed GNN-ORL algorithm. Specifically, GNN-ORL exhibits both stable convergence and excellent generalization capabilities, and outperforms baseline schemes in meeting the QoS requirements of URLLC services.},

Traditional spectrum prediction techniques predominantly employ machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) approaches. However, ML-based methods often require manual feature extraction, leading to inefficiencies, while DL-based techniques typically demand computationally intensive graphics processing units (GPUs). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight multi-dimensional spectrum prediction model based on an adaptive broad learning network (ABLN). The model utilizes a sliding window approach for preprocessing historical spectrum data and establishes an input layer containing mapped feature nodes and enhancement nodes by randomly generating weights and biases. The weight parameters of the network are determined by solving the pseudo-inverse problem, and the network structure is extended by incremental learning method without necessitating retraining, effectively reducing the model&#39;s computational complexity. Furthermore, an adaptive node increment module is employed to quickly obtain the optimal hyperparameters. Experimental results on real-world spectrum datasets demonstrate that the proposed ABLN method consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across multi-step prediction tasks. Additionally, the model exhibits robust stability and adaptability in diverse scenarios.},

In this paper, we propose an effective superimposed full pilots (SFP)-aided iterative channel estimation (SFPCE) scheme for multi-user OTFS uplink systems. First, we derive a multi-user minimum root mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation algorithm and a message passing (MP) data detection algorithm based on the proposed multi-user SFP structure. Then, a de-interference iterative detection (DIID) algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of channel estimation and symbol detection. The DIID algorithm only requires a few iterations to achieve optimal performance. Besides, a hybrid superimposed pilot (HSP) structure is introduced to estimate the delay/Doppler taps without sacrificing the SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of channel estimation and symbol detection can be significantly improved after several iterations. Moreover, the proposed SFPCE scheme is superior to the superimposed single pilot-aided channel estimation (SSIPCE) and the superimposed sparse pilot-aided channel estimation (SSPPCE) schemes in the bit error rate (BER) performance.},

To remedy the mentioned problem, this article proposes a novel localization method utilizing received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (TOA) measurements. To this end, the TOA/RSS hybrid maximum likelihood (ML) problem is cast into a probabilistic non-linear weighted least square (PNLWLS) problem, including probabilistic cost function and probabilistic constraints. Seven hypothesis tests are introduced to determine with what probability each measurement belongs to LOS (or mixed LOS/NLOS) or NLOS propagations. These probability values tightly bound the unknown NLOS error in the PNLWLS problem. The PNLWLS problem is then relaxed to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by interior point methods. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for 5G technology using MATLAB 5G toolbox. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing hybrid methods and attains an estimation variance comparatively closer to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).},

  abstract     = {In complex multipath environments, accurate direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for wideband signal and effectively separating the main path signal remain challenging problems. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging the parallel factor (PARAFAC) model fitting and the multi-frequency characteristics of wideband signal. Firstly, the PARAFAC model is constructed based on the wideband array output to suppress the noise influence. The propagation matrix, which includes DOA and time delay information, is then separated using a trilinear alternating least squares method. Subsequently, accurate DOA estimation and time delay vectors are obtained using a distributed compressed sensing approach. Finally, the multi-frequency characteristics of the wideband signal are employed to distinguish the main path of the multipath signal based on time delay differences among different paths. Both simulation and practical tests are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) systems, instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is essential for the optimization of the RIS phase shifts. However, the D-MIMO systems often involve numerous RISs and access points (APs), requiring the transmission of a significant amount of pilots for CSI estimation, thus resulting in high signaling overhead. To mitigate the high signaling overhead associated with CSI estimation, this paper introduces a location-aware communication method that only relies on large-scale fading information. Two new challenges have arisen in the proposed location-aware communication method. First, it is challenging to design a user position estimation method to achieve fast and accurate localization. Second, it is hard to handle the location uncertainty brought by the estimation error when performing beamforming. In response to the above challenges, we first design a space-time cooperative beam training-based localization method to achieve a favorable trade-off between localization accuracy and time cost. Subsequently, to handle the location uncertainty, by taking historical error distribution into consideration, we formulate a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based problem for sum-rate maximization. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed localization method, which can achieve sub-meter accuracy with low beam training overhead. Furthermore, the proposed DRO-based beamforming method can improve the sum-rate by 11.4% compared to the robust optimization and non-robust schemes.},

In this work, we focus on the joint MUS-BF design with the goal of minimizing the network experience delay. Since the objective function is long-term and non-convex, we first equate the network experience delay with the long-term average network experience delay cost, which can be optimized by reinforcement learning techniques. Then, we propose a distributed MUS-BF scheme based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to minimize the long-term average network experience delay cost, where the adaptive multi-deep Q network (DQN) architecture is designed at each base station (BS) to find suitable MUS-BF with low computational complexity. Each BS is able to train its own multi-DQN and implement appropriate MUS-BF based on the local information. Simulation results validate that the adaptive multi-DQN architecture decreases 70% computational complexity of the proposed algorithm without compromising performance compared to the non-adaptive design. Compared to existing schemes, the proposed scheme achieves superior performance with the lowest information overhead, making it a more appealing solution for real-time MUS-BF in delay-sensitive scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) represents a notable technological advancement that has gained considerable interest within the wireless communication domain. However, due to cost and privacy concerns, different operators may not make an agreement on cooperatively utilizing RISs and sharing resources. In the presence of non-cooperative base stations (BSs) from different operators, conventional resource allocation and RIS design are rendered inapplicable. Motivated by this fact, we explore the resource allocation scheme for RIS-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) systems with cooperative and non-cooperative BSs. We first delineate between the cooperation and non-cooperation modes of BSs, based on their agreement concerning the joint utilization of RISs. We then formulate the joint optimization problem of the reflection coefficients of RISs, active beamforming, power allocation, and user association at BSs. The objective is to maximize the sum rates for users served by cooperative BSs while ensuring the channel gain constraints between non-cooperative BSs and their associated users so as to mitigate the effects of RISs on the communication of non-cooperative BSs. To address the mixed binary optimization problem, we leverage the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique to decompose the original problem into several sub-problems, each iteratively optimized until convergence is achieved. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of RISs in improving sum rate performance, while also providing additional benefits by mitigating their impact on non-cooperative BSs and their associated users.},

However, the fast dynamic network environment brings out big challenges to the resource allocation issue in V2X communications. Considering the difficulty of accurately obtaining channel state information (CSI) in dynamic vehicular network environments, we propose a joint double deep Q-network (DDQN) based centralized spectrum allocation and distributed power control algorithm for V2X communications to utilize the spectrum resource more effectively and reduce the multiple interference between V2X links. The proposed algorithm decouples the channel matching and transmission power selection to balance the resource utilization and quality of user experience satisfaction levels. In the first stage, we present a graph theory based centralized spectrum matching scheme to reduce the multiple interference between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, and improve the system capacity of vehicular networks. Secondly, through predicting the future dynamic CSI trends of terminal vehicles based on the locally obtained CSI information, we propose a distributed DDQN based power control scheme to enhance the system reliability and meet the quality of terminal user experience requirements.

  abstract     = {Sub-terahertz (THz) (100–300 GHz) has attracted huge interest in recent years as a promising candidate band for applications in the future sixth-generation wireless networks. However, when extending to higher sub-THz band, the problems of scarce measurement data and incomplete channel characteristics become increasingly evident, hindering the establishment of sub-THz communications. This paper presents the measurements of small-scale fading (SSF) channel characterization and sparsity analysis based on the vector network analyzer in typical indoor scenarios at 215–225 GHz. The directional scanning scheme is adopted to identify the multipath components (MPCs) in a three-dimensional space. The MPC-level parameters, including power, delay, azimuth and elevation angles are estimated based on the power angular delay profiles and then processed with the multipath component distance-based density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. Modeling of MPC-level and cluster-level temporal-spatial characteristics are presented. With the correlation matrix of sub-THz MPC-level SSF characteristics, the Gini index, root mean square delay spread, azimuth spread of arrival and elevation spread of arrival are firstly used to comprehensively evaluate the sparsity of the sub-THz channel. In addition, the key factors affecting sub-THz channel sparsity are explored. The numerical results indicate the strong sparsity of the channel at sub-THz band. Specifically, in empty and closed scenarios, the sparse channel characteristics are less pronounced, and there is a notable reduction in sparsity from line-of-sight (LoS) channel to non-LoS channel. The channel characterization extracted from the sub-THz channels in this paper is instrumental in the development of channel modeling, system design and performance assessment of sub-THz communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have become a revolutionary wireless channel control paradigm as a potential solution for future 6G networks. However, in many scenarios, due to the influence of “multiple-scatterer” environments, the existing RIS-assisted multi-user systems still have limitations in terms of capacity. Therefore, this paper proposes the novel concept of active RIS-assisted movable antenna systems (MAs), which can optimize channel conditions and improve communication performance by locally moving the antenna solely in the receiving area. Additionally, the optimization problem for RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, which aims to maximize the sum-rate among multiple users, also entails beamforming optimization at the base station (BS), phase shift design at the RIS, and MAs positioning. To solve this challenging and nonconvex optimization problem, in the case of a fixed MA&#39;s position, the Lagrange dual transform is used to introduce auxiliary variables to decouple the original problem into three subproblems: the optimization of auxiliary variables, the optimization of beamforming transmission on the BS, and the phase shift design of the RIS. Furthermore, to identify the optimal positions of the MAs, an adaptive fractional programming quadratic transform algorithm based on a genetic algorithm (GA) (FPQT-GA) is proposed to investigate the proposed system. The simulation results show that compared with traditional fixed antenna systems (FAs) active RIS-assisted, the employment of MAs can significantly enhance the system&#39;s overall performance in typical application scenarios.},

The application of this developing technology in the field of underwater wireless communication (UWC) systems is a promising way to overcome the limitations associated with such challenging environments. In this research, we analyze the performance improvement provided by OIRS in the context of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC). The OIRS support multiple users by grouping and allocating different OIRS elements to different users based on their distance from the transmitter. To increase the aggregate spectral efficiency (ASE) and preserve user fairness, techniques based on equal mirror assignment (EMA) and distance-based mirror assignment (DMA) are presented. The outcomes are evaluated against conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate split multiple access (RSMA) schemes for UWOC. The performance variation of the overall system is also analyzed with respect to the ocean depth. We have also derived the analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) considering exponential and generalized gamma (EGG) turbulent model and zero bore-sight model for pointing errors. We use Monte-Carlo simulation results to validate our analytical expressions. Furthermore, an asymptotic analysis of average spectral efficiency is performed to provide a deeper understanding of the proposed system&#39;s performance at high SNR. From the results obtained, it is analyzed that proposed DMA based scheme outperforms the EMA, OMA, NOMA and RSMA even with a large number of users. Furthermore, it is shown that the system performance improves with the oceanic depth. The results of this work provide valuable insights for the design of UWOC systems in challenging underwater environments.},

Approximate closed-form expressions for users&#39; outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are respectively derived to capture the main system characteristics and the performance boundaries at high transmit power regimes, thereby providing useful insights involving the diversity order, coding gain, and ergodic slope. Several extensive simulations are presented and reveal some remarkable points: First, active RISs always bring higher EC than passive RISs and have outstanding outage performance in lower and moderate transmit power regimes. Second, active RIS-based systems can achieve a significantly improved performance by either reducing thermal noise or increasing the amplitude gain. Thirdly, the use of a large number of passive RIS elements yields a significant OP improvement when compared to active RIS design. Finally, increasing the number of antennas can achieve the users&#39; OP and EC enhancement for both active and passive RIS-based systems.},

  abstract     = {The integration of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology with the dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) system is pivotal for enhancing the capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, conventional MIMO-DFRC designs lack support for simultaneous multi-user communication in the same direction, limiting their utility in IoV applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel robust transmit beamforming approach for the MIMO-DFRC system, facilitating multi-user communication through beampattern modulation. Initially, the orthogonal Oppermann sequences are allocated to each user. Subsequently, these sequences are embedded into sub-beampatterns, which encode communication symbols for multi-user information transmission. Furthermore, the encoded information is strategically placed within the sidelobes of the transmit beampattern, aiming to minimize the integrated sidelobe levels. This goal serves as the objective function while maintaining mainlobe detection performance, which imposes a constraint, forming an optimization model for transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization model, it is decomposed using a coordinate rotation strategy and addressed iteratively via a convex optimization algorithm.

  abstract     = {Full duplex (FD) is an auspicious wireless technology that holds the potential to double data rates through simultaneous transmission and reception. This paper proposes two innovative designs of hybrid beamforming (HYBF) for a multicell massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) FD system. Initially, we introduce a novel centralized HYBF (C-HYBF) scheme, which employs the minorization-maximization (MM) method. However, while centralized beamforming designs offer superior performance, they suffer from high computational complexity, substantial communication overhead, and demand expensive computational resources. To surmount these challenges, we present a framework that facilitates per-link parallel and distributed HYBF (P&amp;D-HYBF) in the mmWave frequency band. This cooperative approach enables each base station (BS) to independently solve its local, low-complexity sub-problems in parallel for each user, resulting in a substantial reduction in communication overhead and computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that P&amp; D-HYBF achieves comparable performance to C-HYBF, and with only a few radio-frequency (RF) chains, both designs surpass the capabilities of fully digital half duplex (HD) systems.},

However, in the face of limited wireless communication resources and diverse services, ensuring effective transmission and on-demand dissemination of traffic information has become increasingly urgent. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel targeted dissemination strategy driven by integrated sensing, communication and computing (ISCC-TDS), which endows traffic information dissemination with the capability of service awareness and on-demand scheduling. This paper initially establishes the targeted dissemination matrix, which incorporates the sensing of traffic flow and service arrival distribution. Furthermore, the service coexistence mechanism oriented towards communication modeling is designed to maximize the data transmission rate of regular services while ensuring the reliable transmission of emergency services. Additionally, this paper employs an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for computing integration. Simulation results show that the ISCC-TDS can achieve the lowest travel cost in the case of heavy traffic and severe congestion, and there is less than 5% transmission loss for regular services even with the dense arrival of emergency services.zhong},

  abstract     = {The next-generation Internet of Vehicle (IoV) with V2X as the core is the foundation for safe and reliable autonomous driving. As one of the crucial components of V2X, V2I requires roadside units (RSUs) to be equipped with both sensing and communication capabilities. For this reason, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered a promising technology that will be applied in RSUs. However, when vehicle users (VUs) move to the edge of RSU coverage, ISAC beams from different RSUs may collide and cause inter-region interference. We propose an ISAC-based beam tracking scheme for the multi-RSU V2I scenario based on coordinated multi-point (CoMP) to address this issue. The beam tracking scheme can be divided into two parts. The first part is the beam tracking approach including the method of predicting and estimating state parameters based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the method of managing VU sets based on predicted state parameters. The second part is the multi-RSU joint resource allocation against inter-region interference based on predicted VU sets to improve the tracking accuracy of VUs. Specifically, an optimization problem to minimize the sum of the posterior Crámer-Rao bound (PCRB) of all VUs is considered. By employing the alternative optimization (AO) algorithm, appropriate wireless resources can be allocated to different VUs, and then a bandwidth index method based on predicted state parameters to avoid spectral conflicts is designed. Finally, we analyze the performance of various schemes through numerical simulations. Our proposed scheme using UKF based on CoMP is outstanding in improving SINR for VUs while maintaining high tracking accuracy compared with other schemes.},

It provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output (MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over traditional designs.

Motivated by this, we first establish multiple access interference (MAI) for satellite communication. Since the satellite channel is mainly a direct path, and the Nakagami-$m$ distribution fits more experimental data with different $m$, we assume the Nakagami-$m$ distribution as the fading model for the downlink satellite communication system. Furthermore, we derive an exact expression of the system bit-error rate (BER). Then, we optimize the information rate by setting the appropriate number of access users according to BER. Finally, simulations validate the analytical results.

Specifically, these two users are both legitimate users and mutual eavesdroppers. In this system, we investigate the achievable rate for these two users under three typical STAR-RIS protocols, i.e., energy splitting (ES), time splitting (TS) and mode switching (MS). Based on that, a series of weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) maximization problems subject to the constraints of BS transmit power and the transmitting and reflecting coefficients (TRCs) of STAR-RIS are formulated, which consider to jointly optimize the active and passive beamforming vectors at the BS and STAR-RIS, respectively. Due to the non-convexity of these problems and the coupled decision variables, the path-following method is applied to approximate the non-convex objective function and then, the alternating optimization (AO) method is utilized to decouple the decision variables. After that, relaxation and penalty convex concave procedure (PCCP) are adopted to solve the decomposed subproblems. In further, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence of the proposed AO-based algorithms. In the end, some numerical simulations have been done to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the ES protocol always obtains the best performances, followed by the MS protocol, and the TS protocol obtains the worst performance.},

We show that there exist two drawbacks which are not discussed in traditional LM based IA: 1) the necessary condition for the feasibility of IA is loose, and 2) the secret signal cancellation may occur at the desired receiver, which makes secure transmission infeasible. We analyze the reason and establish a condition under which either the secret signal cancellation is inevitable or IA is infeasible. Then a modified IA is proposed. Compared with the traditional LM based IA, a tighter necessary condition is established and the secret signal is protected against cancellation. Moreover, we prove that the proposed condition guarantees the properness of system, which is a rigorous characterization of necessary conditions for achieving IA. Under assumption that the modified IA is feasible, we provide a secrecy enhancing design to maximize the secrecy rate. subject to a secrecy outage constraint.

  abstract     = {Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems. Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous success in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies, and extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes. Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to classify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle to capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures of the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in signal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal dependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel characteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation strategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model&#39;s robustness to modulation-related features. Experimental results on widely-used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits significant advantages in terms of complexity. Our framework serves as a foundational backbone that can be extended to different datasets and applied to both mobile and static scenarios. We have verified the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in enhancing the generalization, particularly in few-shot scenarios.},

In this system, orthogonal reference signals are generated using Gram-Schmidt algorithm, and reference index modulation is performed in each time slot of each subcarrier by discarding a chosen reference signal. Additionally, the selected Walsh code in active subcarriers is used to perform the Kronecker product with the reference signal to achieve higher data rates. Furthermore, at the receiver, an efficient joint carrier-code index detection algorithm is proposed, and noise reduction processing is employed to improve the system&#39;s bit error rate (BER) performance. The theoretical BER expressions of the HCCRIM-TF-DCSK system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Furthermore, this paper provides an analysis of the system&#39;s data rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and complexity compared to those of advanced competitors.

Besides seeking for additional physical resources for improving performance, such as Device-to-Device (D2D) paradigm and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), information forecast brings a new dimension to unleash the potential of MEC. However, most existing literature does not tailor information forecast algorithm to the MEC context, which diminishes the utility of the forecast information. In this work, we propose a framework for adaptive task offloading based on channel forecast for MEC system. Specifically, we first propose an online resource allocation algorithm with forecast information through Lyapunov optimization. Then, the performance in terms of delay and power consumption is analyzed in closed-form, based on which critical insight towards the requirements on forecast algorithm is obtained. Next, based on Sparse Gaussian Process and Linear Model of Coregionalization (SGP-LMC), we propose a channel forecast algorithm to find a desired trade-off between forecast accuracy and model complexity in terms of maximizing the utility of forecast information. Finally, simulation is performed to verify the performance improvements.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) is one of the key enabling technologies for massive machine type communications (mMTC). While CFmMIMO can achieve a macro diversity gain in mMTC, its fronthaul link capacity severely limits system performance. To balance fronthaul overhead and detection/estimation performance, in this paper we investigate joint user activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) and develop a framework for uplink grant-free CFmMIMO systems based on mixed-quantization fronthaul compression. First, we model the JADCE problem as a mixed-quantization compressing sensing problem, making use of sporadic transmission nature of devices in mMTC. A multiple measurement vector (MMV) generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of activity detection and channel estimation. Unknown priori parameters of the GAMP algorithm can be estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm. In addition, we design a threshold detection rule at central processing unit (CPU) side and derive a lower bound of active user detection performance in a centralized CFmMIMO system. Numerical results reveal that the proposed mixed-quantization scheme can strike a good balance between fronthaul overhead and detection/estimation performance, verifying that a CFmMIMO with mixed-quantization scheme can perform well in activity detection and channel estimation by selecting an appropriate number of quantization bits.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) are two critical services in vehicular networks. However, the presence of both services creates a difficult resource allocation problem due to their heterogeneous requirements. To address the challenge of simultaneously providing eMBB and URLLC services in vehicular networks, we propose a resource allocation approach that maximizes eMBB rate while ensuring that both URLLC latency and reliability requirements are satisfied. Our approach utilizes non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology, where the resource for eMBB services is allocated by slot and the traffic of URLLC service is accommodated using mini-slots. To solve this dual time-scale problem, we employ a dual decomposition and sub-gradient method to solve the power allocation and resource block assignment of eMBB services, while the Vogel&#39;s approximation method (VAM) and modified distribution method (MODI) are proposed to solve the URLLC resource allocation problem. Additionally, we present two low-complexity heuristic algorithms for the URLLC sub-problem. Simulation results indicate that our proposed approach surpasses baseline methods in terms of both eMBB rate and fairness.},

The EMS enables power sharing among the ICE and the HESS under a fully active topology to improve control flexibility, considering that the ICE-generator set and HESS efficiencies are limited to a specific power injection operating range and transient responses. In this context, power sharing is performed using S-shaped functions that focus on maximizing supercapacitor usability to reduce fuel consumption and battery current stress. The advantage of the S-shaped function lies on its easy configuration and reduced number of control parameters. Additionally, meta-heuristic optimization is used to tune the S-shaped functions according to the sources requirements for optimal performance in standard driving cycles, while Lyapunov’s indirect method performs the stability analysis of the control strategy. Finally, experimental and computational simulations are accomplished to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared with traditional methods and an optimal approach.},

In this method, five topologies are considered, including three kinds of speed coupling topologies, one kind of torque coupling topology, and one kind of topology with variable coupling. The dynamic model and efficiency model of each topology are established. The proposed integration optimization method includes a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. DP takes energy loss as the objective function to optimize the control strategy of the operation process. PSO takes the linear superposition value of energy loss and motor power level as the objective function to optimize design parameters. The optimization results of five topologies are compared to get the optimal topology. The results of integrated optimization experiments show that the speed coupling - double brake topology is the optimal topology. Compared with the prototype, the energy loss is reduced by 10.37% and the system production cost has been well controlled. The comparison experiments further validate the superiority of utilizing PSO as the upper layer algorithm compared to other comparative algorithms.},

In order to solve this issue and improve the angle tracking accuracy under unknown disturbances, an anti-disturbance sliding mode control (ADSMC) method is designed and applied to SBW system. Firstly, the mathematical model with reflecting unknown disturbances of SBW system is established. Secondly, a new sliding mode reaching law with parameter adjustment function is proposed, which can dynamically adjust the reaching speed of system state according to the distance from sliding mode surface. Thirdly, an extended state observer with hyperbolic tangent function is designed to prevent the observation peak, and an adaptive law with mapping method is constructed to limit excessive disturbance compensation, which can estimate and compensate unknown disturbances effectually. Finally, the ADSMC method is applied to SBW system, and the effectiveness of ADSMC method is verified by simulation and test. Test results show that, compared with traditional sliding mode control, the ADSMC method can improve the tracking accuracy of steering angle command for SBW system (the average response error is reduced by 73.94%) in typical circular road.},

A unitary parallel factor (PARAFAC) algorithm is proposed to achieve super-resolution estimate and outstanding performance, using forward-backward averaging scheme. The forward-backward averaging scheme is adopted to construct real-valued tensor signal model instead of the complex-valued one, yielding the better accuracy at modest complexity. The proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm is performed by decomposing the real-valued tensor without signal subspace estimate. Due to the inherent smoothing processing of the proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm, it can effectively deal with high correlated target. Additionally, the proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm can automatically obtain pair parameters including range and velocity of the same target without additional pair-matching operation. More importantly the regularized alternative least squares (RALS) algorithm is used to improve the decomposition performance of the real-valued tensor while maintaining iteration stability. The numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superior performance, especially for high correlated and closely spaced targets in low-SNR scenario.},

  abstract     = {Controller design and tuning are crucial to the driving performance of autonomous vehicles. Typically, engineers define a control structure in advance and then tune its parameters in a real-world driving scenario through trial-and-error method. This method is undoubtedly time and resource consuming, and dis-courages the exploration of different control structures. In this paper, we present an improved learning-based controller tuning approach and achieve the rapid tuning of a trajectory tracking controller for a real vehicle. The proposed approach employs the framework of model-based reinforcement learning, in which a probabilistic dynamics model is first learned from the real data and then the controller parameters are updated based on the learned model. To facilitate real-world applications, the aleatoric uncertainties of the real vehicle and the measurement system are distinguished and separated during the learning of probabilistic model. Additionally, the original state propagation framework is extended by incorporating steering response model and prepro-cessed Gaussian noise. Simulation and experimental results show that controllers can be well tuned within 3 trials by our approach and the comprehensive tracking performance (i.e., cumulative cost) can be improved by up to 76% compared with the initial controller parameters. More importantly, the tuned controllers maintain high tracking accuracy in untrained driving scenarios. We believe that this approach will help to accelerate the controller design and tuning of autonomous vehicles.},

However, complicated intersection conditions and several safety problems challenge the optimal cooperative driving of CAVs. This paper proposes a bilevel coordination framework for CAVs at unsignalized intersections to improve efficiency and robustness while guaranteeing safety. The upper level focuses on a conflict-free and real-time scheduling problem for optimal passing order, and the results are transmitted to each CAV in the lower level for distributed control. To guarantee safety, we first project the conflicting vehicles on virtual lanes based on the conflict zones inside the intersection. Furthermore, the scheduling problem is transformed into a packing problem and formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for higher traffic efficiency. We propose three practical principles to obtain the real-time solutions by removing several redundant constraints in the optimization problem. Eventually, considering the inevitable bounded disturbances (e.g., unmodeled dynamics and equipment measurement errors), a distributed robust model predictive controller is designed to form and keep the desired virtual platoons under uncertainty. Numerical simulations validate that the proposed method saves 4.2%-6.6% total evacuation time under heavy traffic volume.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is crucial for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles. However, current methods based on neural networks still have room for improvement by further reducing their long-term error. This challenge stems from extracting temporal feature dependencies and mining spatial interactions in lane change scenarios. Previous research has not adequately established the connection between the past and the future features. To this end, we propose a spatial-temporal multi-feature fusion and intention-enlightened decoding (STMF-IE) model that jointly considers all these aspects. Initially, STMF-IE uses multi-head temporal self-attention to establish temporal dependencies that make explicit the extent of information usage at different time steps. The interplay between the neighboring vehicles and the target vehicle is quantitatively depicted through a devised multi-head spatial cross-attention mechanism. Furthermore, a multi-feature fusion module is proposed such that the extracted temporal dependence and spatial interaction features are integrated to reduce the superfluous features. Additionally, a novel mask matrix and an intention-enlightened decoding module are developed to refine the prediction performance in different lane change scenarios. Experimental results show that STMF-IE outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long-term prediction on NGSIM and highD datasets. We improve the RMSE metric by 13%–36% at a prediction horizon of 3$\sim$5 s. We also analyze the spatial-temporal feature correlation through visual results, promoting more interpretation.},

To well enhance the tradeoff between control performance and communication constraint, a prescribed specification is established via a boundary function, thereby precisely specifying the transient and steady-state performances of synchronized errors. Based on that, the controller is then devised via an input-based event-triggered rule and thruster allocation technique.

  abstract     = {Rear-end collision where a human-driven vehicle (HV) hits an autonomous vehicle (AV) from behind (called HV-AV collision) represents a critical scenario in the context of mixed traffic including both AVs and HVs. In the present paper, the Human-like Brake Initiation and Modulation (HLBIM) model is first proposed to emulate the driver brake control, and further employed to investigate HV-AV collision risk in the Stop-in-Lane (SiL) scenario where an HV follows an AV. The HLBIM model combines human driving intention, vision-based expectancy and certain inherent characteristics of human driving based on a novel dynamic accumulation of braking-needed evidence. Especially, the HLBIM model incorporates a high-level expectancy derived from practical driving expertise to ensure precise timing for braking initiation. Furthermore, the combined distribution of Off-Road-Glance and Time-Headway is originally proposed and integrated into the HLBIM model, to emulate drivers&#39; diverted attention during their driving activities. Our approach addresses a main issue, which is often neglected in the existing studies on HV-AV collision, which corresponds to the coupling effect of human driving intention, vision-based expectancy and inherent characteristic of human driving on HV-AV collision risk. Moreover, we analyze HV-AV collision risk in two specified SiL cases, which has rarely been investigated in existing related studies. The model performance comparison shows that our HLBIM model outperforms the referred models. Furthermore, the case study comprehensively reveals how the HV-AV collision probability changes with respect to various collision speeds, initial speeds, decelerations of cars under test, percentages of overlap detection of the AV in front, and lane change durations. The HLBIM model can be used to simulate driver-in-the-loop car-following experiment. Moreover, it can be fitted in automatic braking systems within AVs to achieve human-like braking.},

First, considering the special structure of received samples, an alternative well-estimated second-order statistic, known as the Gram matrix, is originally constructed to better utilize the spatial and statistical information of signals and noise contained by small samples. Second, two novel methods for estimating the number of targets are derived by combining the Gram matrix and information-theoretic criteria. Third, a novel object function and the corresponding algorithm based on the Gram matrix are designed to estimate the signal subspace more efficiently, and then the DOAs of targets are obtained by multiple signal classification methods. In particular, the theoretical analysis indicates that the improved signal subspace estimation algorithm only needs to decompose the low-dimensional Gram matrix instead of the high-dimensional sample covariance matrix. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the high accuracy and lower computational complexity of the proposed methods in the case of high-dimensional and small samples.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rising number of Electric Vehicles (EV), the subsequent increase in demand for charging, as well as the long charging time, will make it difficult for drivers to charge their vehicles. Current charging service platforms inform their customers of the charging station information for the network to which they belong. However, they do not ensure the reliability and credibility of information and do not share the charging information of other charging stations. To address this issue, a model in which CSs collaborate for information sharing and charging must be developed. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based integrated charging platform for charging cooperation. Verifier groups for each CS verify the reliability of shared information. We applied the concept of Mobile Charging Stations (MCSs) to help busy CSs, reducing EV charging latency. We also designed a contribution-based incentive distribution process to elicit active CSs&#39; cooperation. We performed a charging scenario simulation and blockchain implementation to demonstrate the proposed model&#39;s efficacy. The simulation results showed that the proposed charging scenario with MCS application showed a 46.9 % reduction in waiting time. Also, when the number of verifier members equals the global average of EVs per charging spot, the verification time is approximately 547 ms, demonstrating that the proposed model is effective.},

  abstract     = {The Virtually Coupled Train Set (VCTS) is a promising framework to improve the efficiency of urban rail transits (URTs), addressing challenges introduced by time-varying and location-varying passenger flow. However, traditional train control models, relying on liner approximation methods to fit nonlinear dynamic models, cannot meet the safety-critical and latency-sensitive task requirements of VCTS systems. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based control models are promising, substantial training data and computational resources is challenging in URTs. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel digital twin (DT) driven VCTS framework and an iterative-based control policy learning approach. In the designed DT-driven VCTS system, we collect essential training data from the physical domain, representing the real-world environment. We employ model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to learn the dynamic train model and optimize the train control policy in the digital domain, a simulated environment mirroring the physical domain. This approach uniquely leverages model predictions for policy optimization during the training process, adapting to a broad range of scenarios beyond reliance on actual operational data. Furthermore, by employing an iterative learning approach and integrating the physical and digital domains, the train control model and policy can be updated to effectively handle uncertainties and complexities encountered in real-world situations. Extensive experiments validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating its robust performance and adaptability across diverse conditions.},

In this paper, an obstacle avoidance and path point tracking control frame for ASVs is proposed. The frame includes two parts. One is the decision-making module, in which the desired sailing speed and course angular velocity are generated. More specifically, through adopting the velocity obstacle approach (VOA), the feasible obstacle avoidance action set is obtained. Then, considering the maneuvering characteristics of ASVs, the discrete optional obstacle avoidance actions are obtained by using the dynamic window approach (DWA). Finally, by introducing the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), the obstacle avoidance actions that meet the rules can be screened out. An evaluation function is designed to select the final practical obstacle avoidance action. The second part is the dynamic controller module. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network-based path point tracking controller design is given in this part. The RBF neural network is designed to estimate the unknown model nonlinearity, and the stability of the closed-loop system is proved.

It is worthwhile to note that more and more vehicles are equipped with automotive radars, resulting in mutual interference between radars. Interference degrades radar target detection performance and makes sensed information unreliable, so interference suppression is necessary. In this paper, a novel method based on power-weighted Hough transform is proposed for mitigating the radar mutual interference and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems. Firstly, the frequency modulation characteristics of interference signals and target echo signals are analyzed, and differences between the two signals are presented. Secondly, based on the straight line detection technique, the interference power in the time-frequency domain is accumulated, and the interference is accurately detected and localized. Finally, the target echo is recovered by an autoregressive model. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has the ability to retain more useful signals after interference mitigation, and achieve better interference detection robustness under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Simulation experiments and real scenario experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its superiority.},

This paper proposes a novel semantic-driven aerial reconstruction planner, which integrates the task relevance into the planning, making the concentrative reconstruction more efficient. Specifically, a new surface-frontier information structure is extended to maintain the rich semantic information for the fine-grained planning. Driven by an attention-based frontier filter, a novel relevance-aware frontier sequence generation method is proposed to achieve the concentrative reconstruction of the target. Then a semantic-informed local refinement, which incorporates the semantic gain into the graph search, is proposed to further reduce the flight cost and improve the reconstruction quality.

  abstract     = {Urban autonomous driving decision-making poses a significant challenge, particularly when navigating unsignalized intersections. This complexity mainly stems from the stochastic interactions between various traffic participants. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making has shown promise, there are valid concerns regarding safety and adaptability. In particular, current RL-based models lack safeguards to prevent issuing potentially unsafe commands in unfamiliar scenarios that are not covered during training. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a safe decision-making framework to improve driving safety at unsignalized intersections. First, the RL-based policy is constructed based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) that maps environmental observations into actions directly. Subsequently, the reliability of the SAC policy is measured at run-time via epistemic uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the risky actions of the RL policy are filtered based on the estimated reliability with integrating a risk-adaptive model predictive control (RAMPC) backup policy. Finally, an unsignalized intersection with occlusion is built via Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). More importantly, several cases are carried out to simulate scenario data distribution shifts, i.e., traffic flow density variation, observation with sensor noise, and observation range decrease, which are not included in the RL policy training process. The results suggest that the proposed method can reduce risk and enhance the safety of autonomous driving at unsignalized intersections.},

Considering that existing research mainly focuses on the calibration of single antenna GNSS/IMU and odometry, and frequently neglects the time-delay between sensors, so in order to make up for the gap in the calibration of dual-antenna GNSS and odometry, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal calibration method based on Kalman filter. The method comprehensively considers motion constraints among multiple vectors during vehicle movement and the time-delay between sensors, employs the feedback correction strategy of indirect filtering to solve the challenge of estimating large installation misalignment angle, and realizes joint estimation of time-delay and spatial extrinsic parameters. The results of simulation and field tests show that the proposed method can accurately achieve the spatiotemporal calibration and has significant advantages over existing methods. The time-delay estimation accuracy is smaller than the minimum data output interval, and the estimation errors of rotation and translation extrinsic parameters are about 0.1° and 0.01 m, respectively.},

Our research pioneers the use of the Age of Information (AoI) to measure task scheduling performance within ADS. With theoretical analysis, we disclose that optimizing AoI simultaneously minimizes response time and maximizes throughput. We then offer a formal definition of the AoI-centric task scheduling problem. Given the NP-hardness of this problem, we design a 4-approximation algorithm. To enhance the practicality of our solutions, we propose an extended formulation optimizing AoI-centric scheduling over a specified cycle and correspondingly develop a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental simulations, benchmarked against the Apollo driving system, demonstrate that our AoI-optimized task scheduling outperforms Apollo&#39;s scheduling mechanisms in terms of AoI, throughput, and worst-case response time.

  abstract     = {Airport delay prediction plays a crucial role in air traffic management practices, including rerouting aircraft, implementing ground delays, and sequencing arrivals. This task is challenging due to the inherent nonlinear characteristics in traffic evolution. The popular deep learning-based traffic prediction methods lack the in-depth exploration of traffic evolution features. In this work, we propose a novel three-channel Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) framework incorporating temporal complex network feature information for airport delay prediction. The complex network feature sequence of the temporal networks can effectively capture the nonlinear dynamic behavior of airport delays. Firstly, we divide the original time series of airport delays into three distinct series (current, daily, and weekly) and feed them into three channels of our model. This operation allows the model to effectively capture the inherent characteristics of local proximity and global periodicity in airport delay time series. Secondly, the complex networks are converted from airport delay time series using complex network theory, and the topological features of networks are combined with three-chamel TCN, to improve the ability of learning short-term nonlinearity of airport delay evolution.

  abstract     = {Ensuring accurate and efficient perception and motion planning is critical for the safety of autonomous vehicles. Addressing these pivotal challenges, this paper introduces a novel motion planning method employing a Lidar point cloud-based potential field (PF). Our approach innovatively extracts the drivable area boundary from point cloud, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing common perception errors, such as missed detections and inaccurate obstacle shape estimation. Built upon this drivable area boundary, the PF effectively represents the cost of traversing diverse areas. The PF is integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to generate control commands considering vehicle dynamics, constraints, collision avoidance, and passenger comfort. Given the highly nonlinear nature of simultaneous longitudinal and lateral motion planning, an efficient Frenet frame-based trajectory sampling method is developed to provide an initial guess of the optimal trajectory for this complex motion planning task. The perception module has been validated in real bus tests, confirming its reliability and efficiency, and the entire motion planning methodology has been rigorously tested through simulations. These simulations show that our method efficiently generates smooth and safe control commands, even in challenging scenarios where the obstacle vehicle suddenly changes its lane, and remains robust under considerable state observation noise.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in urban traffic congestion, the problem of identifying vulnerable areas of road networks has attracted wide attention. Existing studies have mainly used mediated centrality methods or algorithms based on link analysis to find critical and vulnerable nodes in road network systems through network centrality methods. However, the experimental results of the mediated centrality approach under large-scale road network datasets have a certain degree of randomness, while the link analysis algorithms ignore the structure and interrelationships among nodes. For this reason, this paper proposes a new method to quickly identify vulnerable areas of road networks based on interflow degree and spatial density clustering. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a clustering-based road network density-related area vulnerability indicator $AVI$ aimed at assessing the level of area vulnerability. The indicator focuses on the relationship between the road network structure and nodes, avoiding randomness by considering all intersection nodes. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed method demonstrates excellent global stability and achieves a significantly lower time complexity of $O(n^{2})$ compared to the traditional Betweenness Centrality method, which has a time complexity of $O(n^{5})$. Through experimental validation of data from Beijing, London, New York, and Tokyo, the results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and reliability in identifying vulnerable areas of the road network with acceptable time complexity.},

While data-driven methodologies, including recent advancements such as transformers and graph neural networks, have made significant progress, managing multimodality, achieving scene conformability, and providing human-like decision-making in future steps of the autonomy stack remains challenging. Unlike existing data-driven motion forecasting approaches that do not explicitly consider human-like motion planning, this work proposes learning from human (expert) behavior based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). We design a novel Hierarchical Transformer-based Motion Forecasting framework, called HTMF, that learns the multimodal future motion distribution using maximum entropy IRL and leverages transformer-based learned occupancy grid maps as a context-aware approximation to the true distribution, enabling the generation of realistic motions. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across diverse challenging scenarios such as highways and unsignalized intersections. The results demonstrate that HTMF outperforms other benchmark motion forecasting methods in terms of prediction errors and in generating more plausible and human-like trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Path tracking control is a crucial function in an autonomous vehicle. Previous studies have presented conventional model-based controllers, which lack generalization ability, especially in dealing with high-curvature cases. In contrast to those model-based controllers, data-driven controllers, represented by reinforcement learning (RL), are promising to improve tracking control accuracy and generalization by online learning. However, the inherent inexplicability of RL degrades the stability of an RL-based controller, further limiting its applications in real-world autonomous driving cases. To resolve this issue, this study proposes an adaptive tracking controller based on RL, allowing to enhance network stability through a preview model and adaptive correction. It is composed of three modules, namely a lateral controller, a lateral adaptive corrector, and a longitudinal speed planner. Specifically, the preview control theory is combined with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method to improve the tracking convergence of the lateral controller; the adaptive corrector derives correction compensations based on predicted waypoints along a path, thus enhancing control accuracy; the longitudinal planner outputs a speed profile via a reward increment soft actor-critic algorithm, through which large lateral tracking errors are reduced. Using an intelligent vehicle with sufficient steering capability, simulations and real-world tests show that curvy paths with a curvature larger than 2.0 m−1 can be closely tracked within an error bound of 0.1 m.},

To this end, this study proposes a methodology that integrates a diverse array of sensory inputs, including pose data, images, and point clouds, to enhance UGVs&#39; situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Central to our innovation is the development of a multi-modal reinforcement learning framework, which enhances UGVs&#39; perceptual and decision-making ability. This framework incorporates a lattice-based motion planning algorithm, meticulously calibrated to optimize action selection while respecting UGVs&#39; kinematic constraints. Additionally, a novel dual-training paradigm is introduced, combining curriculum learning and modal separation techniques to address the complexities of multi-modal learning. A notable contribution is the strategic integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms, which mitigate information decay and preserve essential navigational strategies over extended periods.

These challenges arise from a “task-unaware” conventional tracking methodology that treats bounding box regression and classification as indistinct tasks, neglecting their differing feature requirements. This paper introduces a “task-aware” tracking methodology, addressing these issues by discriminating between the two subtasks and assigning them their optimal feature representations. The methodology includes a “task-aware” encoder, a “task-aware” decoder, and a mutual-self training strategy. The encoder provides tailored feature representations for each subtask, while the decoder employs distinct structures to leverage these task-specific features. The mutual-self training strategy further enhances performance by fostering synergy between the subtasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. It outperforms the SOTA drone tracker by 2.3% and 3.8% across six drone tracking datasets and surpasses its baseline by 12% and 9% on average. Additionally, tests on conventional tracking datasets show the method&#39;s robustness, matching SOTA conventional trackers while improving the baseline by 28% and 13.5% across two metrics. This innovative method bridges the gap between task-specific needs and feature usage, advancing drone tracking performance. Codes and results will be publicly available.},

However, the “waist-shaped client-channel-cloud” architecture of maritime communication network greatly limits the implementation of hierarchical federated edge learning. Considering the aforementioned limitations, a hierarchical federated data distillation method based on UAV-assisted MEC systems is proposed, called Data Augmentation Distilled Federated Learning (DADFL). Specifically, DADFL reduce the communication process between clients and edge servers to just one round. Each client extracts their private dataset, sends synthesized data to the server, and collectively trains a global model. Building upon this, we propose a Global Optimal Iterative Search Algorithm (GOISA) considering client heterogeneity and resource constraints. GOISA minimizes overall latency by optimizing client heterogeneity, bandwidth allocation, and UAV transmission rates. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed system achieves performance comparable to or even better than traditional federated learning, while reducing communication overhead by three orders of magnitude, greatly improving communication efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The swift and accurate detection of traffic signs in traffic scenes is a pivotal aspect of environmental perception technology in autonomous driving systems. Traffic signs provide essential road information and regulatory instructions, which are critical to ensuring road safety. This paper presents the HCLT-YOLO model to address the challenges of false alarms and missed detections in complex traffic environments. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-transformer network architecture that efficiently integrates both local and global features, thereby improving traffic sign feature representation. To further enhance the modelâs sensitivity to small traffic signs, we optimize the structure by introducing a dedicated small-object detection layer through upsampling and by leveraging SIoU to improve detection accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the addition of the small object detection layer and the Transformer module increases the overall computational complexity and parameter count, potentially affecting real-time performance. To address this issue, we introduce the DG-C2f module, which employs linear transformations for feature mapping, streamlining the convolution process and enhancing real-time feasibility. Experimental evaluations on the GTSDB and TT100K datasets demonstrate that the proposed model improves detection accuracy by 2.5$\%$ and 6.8$\%$, respectively, compared to YOLOv8s models. Notably, the detection accuracy for small traffic signs improved significantly, by 6.9$\%$ and 11.7$\%$, respectively. Additionally, processor-in-the-loop experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin show that the model achieves an inference speed of 46 FPS, meeting the real-time requirements for in-vehicle applications.},

A methodology based on studies from various procedures, both from research and the industrial sector (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) &amp; Tier1), is employed. A Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was employed to guide the experimental procedures, enabling the precise determination of critical parameters, magnitudes, and their interrelationships. Most studies on characterization focus on a single aspect, idealizing or simplifying other influences and nonlinearities, which limits the analysis and does not include the complete drivetrain. An analysis of Field Oriented Control (FOC) and its performance was conducted. This included experimentally quantification of factors such as losses, inertias, phase resistances, temperatures, back electromotive force (BEMF), nominal and peak torque and power, efficiencies, inductances and magnetic flux. Correlations were established through equations or Look Up Tables (LUT), to capture the nonlinearities, determining their effects on other variables. A numerical model of the powertrain was generated and validated in AVL CRUISETM M. The prediction error for torque and power of the model is less than 3%, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the phase (id) and quadrature (iq) currents are less than 4.74% and 2.51%, respectively. The model reduces the need for experimental testing in the development of electric powertrains. The experimental procedure described in this work enables a comprehensive characterization of the drivetrain, specifically addressing the nonlinearities and associated effects such as magnetic circuit saturation, inductance variation, and temperature impact, thereby providing a more accurate representation of the SPMSM motor&#39;s behavior.},

As the number of vehicles and their interactions increase, there is a heightened need for prompt and precise risk evaluation. Traditional collision warning systems, which rely on conflict points, are limited to specific traffic scenarios and are inadequate for the dynamic demands of complex and diverse traffic environments. Additionally, current field-based risk assessment methods evaluate collision risks based only on instantaneous vehicle motion states, lacking in both timeliness and accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a novel risk assessment method. It involves constructing a vehicle-road cooperative environment using a distributed digital twins system and employs a multi-agent multi-modal trajectory prediction algorithm to forecast future vehicle motion states. By leveraging predictive multi-dimensional kinematic features, the proposed method dynamically generates future driving risk fields, effectively assesses collision risks in complex traffic scenarios by modeling multi-source collision risks within future traffic scenes. Extensive simulation results and analyses reveal that DPDRF significantly improves the average Pre-Collision Warning Time (PCWT) by 2.53 times compared to DDRPF and by 1.81 times compared to DSF. Furthermore, DPDRF reduces the average Pre-Collision Warning Error (PCWE) by 79% relative to PRF.},

Among them, the rate matching and interleaving hardware module occupies a significant portion of power consumption in the baseband chip, so it is of great significance to design a low power rate matching and interleaving hardware. The interleavers used in 4G LTE and 5G NR/ 6G have not been merged into a single architecture. It is possible to use the same hardware for different communication standards to reduce hardware resources and power consumption.

With regard to the different algorithms for these four types of encoding, the sharing design is carried out on the hardware structure. In this experiment, according to the proposed storage and interleaving sharing scheme for hardware design and hardware implementation, the memory area of 0.1 μm2 and power consumption overhead of 4.33 mW are obtained based on the SMIC 28 nm process and the operating frequency of 50 MHZ.

Using the Lyapunov method, it is shown that all three subproblems can be solved within any user-prescribed time, independent of the system&#39;s initial states or topology. To further exploit the independence of prescribed-time convergence from system states, the algorithm eliminates the reliance on system topology information in parameter settings by introducing adaptive parameters in place of traditional fixed ones, thus enabling fully distributed control. Finally, numerical simulations and an UAV target tracking experiment are conducted to validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet (UV) communication has garnered considerable attention as a method utilizing UV particle scattering for signal transmission. However, the significant path loss due to scattering presents challenges in maintaining signal quality in dynamic communication scenarios. Increasing the emitted signal power is not a viable solution due to safety regulations on radiated energy. Therefore, adaptive power control mechanisms are essential. In this paper, we develop a radiation model for UV LED arrays and propose a power optimization method tailored for UV LED arrays in linear communication links. This method accounts for variables such as communication distance, the number of active LEDs, and the transmit power of each LED, integrating both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components into the receiver power calculation. We formulate an optimization problem with constraints on bit error rate (BER) and control parameters, aiming to minimize transmit power and beam coverage area. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to solve this problem. The results indicate that the model we proposed is able to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 3.05dB to 4.06dB, thereby reducing the transmit power requirements. With BER constraints, the proposed power control strategy ensures energy stabilization across a broad range, with the maximum energy overshoot during distance variations being 41.22%. Compared to power control methods in visible light communication (VLC) systems, the method proposed in this paper is more aligned with the channel characteristics of UV communication. Building on traditional constant-power UV communication systems, the method proposed in this paper can reduce the transmit power by up to 84.24%.},

  abstract     = {To design a reliable communication system leveraging millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technology-gaining popularity for its capacity to deliver multi-gigabit-per-second data rates-it is essential to consider the site-specific nature of mm-wave propagation. Conventional site-general stochastic channel models often fail to reproduce channel responses in specific usage scenarios or environments accurately. To enable high-precision channel simulation that captures site-specific characteristics, this paper proposes a channel modeling framework leveraging the widely accepted 3GPP map-based hybrid channel modeling approach and provides a detailed methodology for applying it to real-world scenarios with practical examples. First, an extensive measurement campaign was conducted in typical urban macro and micro cellular environments using an in-house dual-band (24/60 GHz) double-directional channel sounder. The mm-wave channel behavior was then characterized, with a focus on differences between the two frequencies. Following this, site-specific large-scale and small-scale channel properties were parameterized. As a critical component for enhancing prediction accuracy, this paper introduces an exponential decay model for the power-delay characteristics of non-line-of-sight clusters, which are often significantly overestimated by deterministic prediction tools. Finally, using the in-house channel model simulator (CPSQDSIM) developed for grid-wise channel data (PathGridData) generation, a marked improvement in prediction accuracy over the existing 3GPP map-based channel model was demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is one promising approach for the future wireless system with high-mobility users. This paper proposed a channel estimation for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS system with high delay resolution in high-mobility environment. Shifts of the path indices and path appearance/disappearance are studied in this work. Due to the high mobility of the user and high delay resolution, the studied system can be more sensitive to index shift of paths. Considering the fractional components in OTFS channel, only the significant CSI elements are processed with minimum performance loss. A Deep Learning supported 3-phase scheme is developed. An auto-encoder (AE) is first deployed for compressed channel features, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) based scheme that provides a rough channel prediction. The indices of significant elements in the predicted channel are then extracted using the decoder function of the AE process. Finally, the values of the significant elements are reconstructed via the Least Squares based method. Analysis is provided on erroneous path predictions, i.e., missing existing paths or detecting non-existent paths. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3-phase scheme can outperform the existing channel prediction schemes with a much better accuracy and lower bit error rate in high-mobility use cases.},
