  abstract     = {Linear quadratic control with unknown value functions and dynamics is extremely challenging, and most of the existing studies have focused on the regulation problem, incapable of dealing with the tracking problem. To solve both linear quadratic regulation and tracking problems for continuous-time systems with unknown value functions, this article develops a discounted inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL) method that inherits the model-independent property of reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we first formulate a standard paradigm for solving linear quadratic control using DIRL. To recover the value function and the target control gain, an error metric is elaborately constructed, and a quasi-Newton algorithm is adopted to minimize it. Furthermore, three DIRL algorithms, including model-based, model-free off-policy, and model-free on-policy algorithms, are proposed. The latter two rely on the expert’s demonstration data or the online observed data, requiring no prior knowledge of the system dynamics and value function. The stability, convergence, and existence conditions of multiple solutions are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The cyber attacker can manipulate control commands, resulting in containment failure in the position loop. Within a zero-sum graphical game framework, secure containment controllers and malicious attackers are regarded as game players, and the attack-defense process is recast as a min-max optimization problem. Acquiring optimal distributed secure control policies requires solving the game-related Hamilton-Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Based on the critic-only neural network (NN) structure, the reinforcement learning (RL) method is employed in solving coupled HJI equations. The fixed-time convergence technique is introduced to improve the convergence rate of RL, and the experience replay mechanism is utilized to relax the persistence of excitation condition. The associated NN convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed. In the attitude loop, the optimal feedback control law is obtained by solving Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equations using the fixed-time convergent RL method. The simulation example and the quadrotor experiment are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Compared to previous works on output constraints, the main challenge addressed in this article is the unavailability of the true system states during the controller design process and the nondifferentiability of the sensor’s output functions. To achieve the control objectives, the following control scheme is proposed in this study. First, a novel barrier Lyapunov function is introduced, which is specifically designed to handle systems with unknown measurement drifts. This function can be uniformly applied to satisfy both scenarios of systems with or without output constraints. Second, the adding a power integrator (AAPI) technique and dynamic surface control (DSC) techniques are enhanced to effectively handle the unknown measurement drifts and avoid singularity problems in the controller design. The decentralized controller proposed in this article can realize that the outputs are strictly constrained within predefined boundaries and guarantees convergence of all system states to an arbitrarily small neighborhood. Finally, we provide two simulation examples to validate the effectiveness of our proposed control strategy.},

It can be used to deal with the challenges coming from a stochastic controller’s switching and state signals sampled, whose results are also less conservative compared to some existing results. In order to get the best mode separation having the best performance, an optimization problem is proposed by applying an augmented Lagrangian cost function, which can ensure the existence and calculability of a locally optimal solution. Moreover, an improved hill-climbing algorithm is established to reduce computational complexity while retaining as much performance as possible, which is enhanced by applying Q-learning technique to determine an optimal attenuation coefficient.

  abstract     = {The agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem (AEOSSP) with time-dependent transition time is a combinatorial optimization challenge. Due to its NP-hardness, problem-tailored methods are sensitive to instances and require massive computational overhead. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have shown promise in efficiently addressing the AEOSSP. However, these models may make decision mistakes in specific scenarios due to prioritizing maximizing average reward expectation over individual decision accuracy during DRL training, directly leading to resource wastage. To address these issues, we propose a reconstruction model (RCM), which is a DRL-based two-stage construction model (CM), including a CM and a reconstruction mechanism (RM). RCM constructs solutions initially using a DRL-trained CM, which are subsequently refined by RM. CM utilizes a more efficient network for policy representation to make decisions. RM applies two operators, “repair” and “removal,” with a “repair-removal-repair” solution reconstruction process to identify and rectify decision mistakes from CM, offering a modular component to enhance the stability and solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RCM outperforms the state-of-the-art AEOSSP iterative search method, achieving such performance within a computational time of 0.1 s. Additionally, CM surpasses the state-of-the-art DRL policy model and RM can effectively rectify decision errors or suboptimalities, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing DRL outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to develop a foundational model capable of detecting anomalies across arbitrary categories without relying on reference images. However, since “abnormality” is inherently defined in relation to “normality” within specific categories, detecting anomalies without reference images describing the corresponding normal context remains a significant challenge. As an alternative to reference images, this study explores the use of widely available product standards to characterize normal contexts and potential abnormal states. Specifically, this study introduces AnomalyVLM, which leverages generalized pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to interpret these standards and detect anomalies. Given the current limitations of VLMs in comprehending complex textual information, AnomalyVLM generates hybrid prompts—comprising prompts for abnormal regions, symbolic rules, and region numbers—from the standards to facilitate more effective understanding. These hybrid prompts are incorporated into various stages of the anomaly detection process within the selected VLMs, including an anomaly region generator and an anomaly region refiner. By utilizing hybrid prompts, VLMs are personalized as anomaly detectors for specific categories, offering users flexibility and control in detecting anomalies across novel categories without the need for training data. Experimental results on four public industrial anomaly detection datasets, as well as a practical automotive part inspection task, highlight the superior performance and enhanced generalization capability of AnomalyVLM, especially in texture categories.

A comprehensive framework is proposed, encompassing new modeling, problem formulation, control design, and stability analysis. The framework integrates continuous system dynamics, used for low-level control, with discrete Markov decision processes (MDP) for high-level decision making. To capture the interactions between these domains, the decision-making system is modeled as a hybrid system consisting of a controlled MDP and autonomous (uncontrolled) continuous dynamics, collectively referred to as the hybrid Markov decision process (HMDP). The design focuses on ensuring safety and optimality by accounting for both discrete and continuous state variables across different levels. With the help of the model predictive control (MPC) concept, a decision-making scheme is developed for the hybrid model, with guarantees for recursive feasibility and stability. The proposed framework is applied to the autonomous lane changing system for intelligent vehicles, and simulation shows its capability to handle diverse behaviors in dynamic and complex environments.},

Initially, the system under investigation is reformulated into a new system that encompasses both the original system state and the compromised state, enabling the use of compromised states for feedback control. Subsequently, two innovative asymptotic integral barrier Lyapunov functions (IBLFs) are developed by directly imposing constraints on the compromised state, thereby eliminating the necessity to convert state constraints into error constraints as required by traditional BLFs-based methods. Furthermore, controllers designed using relative/switched threshold event-triggered strategies ensure that all signals within the entire closed-loop system remain bounded, that the constant or time-varying full-state constraints are not breached, and that asymptotic stability is attained without Zeno behavior. Ultimately, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed strategies through a practical example.},

  abstract     = {Fault-tolerant control (FTC) is an effective control method designed to maintain a faulty system within an acceptable risk level while ensuring its safety. However, handling both uncertainties and faults in a system remains challenging. In this article, we propose two probabilistic model-based adaptive FTC methods for faulty nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics. We study Gaussian process (GP) regression in two cases: 1) an offline learning-based control method and 2) an event-triggered online data-driven modeling method, to learn unknown system dynamics. Considering the computational complexity of GP regression in practical applications, we discuss the case of computational delays in real-time predictions. Moreover, we develop four theoretical criteria to ensure the probabilistic stability of closed-loop systems. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of proposed control methods and demonstrate their competitiveness compared to existing approaches.},

A key challenge in analyzing the SGFTS of such systems lies in the evolving integration methods caused by the impulses. To address this, we dynamically partition the semi-global attraction set (SGAS) and solve the corresponding differential equations within each subset. Additionally, by constructing the transition dynamics of impulse points and iteratively computing these points, we establish the conditions for SGFTS under both stabilizing and destabilizing impulses. For GFTS, the primary difficulty arises from the distinct trajectories and dynamics of points located inside and outside the SGAS. To overcome this, we introduce the concept of the maximum-minimum impulse interval and derive a sufficient condition that ensures the system can enter the SGAS from a distance under a finite number of impulses. Furthermore, we develop a criterion for GFTS under varying impulse degrees and provide convergence time estimation based on the research on SGFTS of NIS. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results. Notably, in Example 3, a fixed-time impulse controller is designed based on the proposed theoretical framework to achieve global stabilization of complex systems. This example highlights the potential applications of this work in the field of control.},

Note that most existing TVF controllers can only achieve formation targets under small delays, which significantly limits their performance. The proposed TVF control method in this article demonstrates remarkable robustness by effectively accommodating larger delays and additionally mitigating the impact of disturbances on MASs. On this basis, a robust TVF controller optimization scheme of MASs combined with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. Comparing the optimized results with those under conventional control methods, it has been proved that optimized controller has obvious improvement on the formation performance of MASs. Finally, the feasibility and the superiority of the developed TVF control approach are validated by a simulation of an autonomous aerial vehicle swarm system (AAVSS) composed of six AAVs.},

  abstract     = {Zeroing neural network (ZNN), as a special type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is very competitive in solving time-varying linear matrix-vector equations. Recently, various ZNNs with predefined-time convergence (PTC) capabilities have been reported. Such ZNNs with PTC capabilities can achieve the predefined convergence time via explicitly presetting multiple parameters related to the upper bounds of their convergence time. However, obtaining suitable and robust values for these parameters through reasonable adjustments is a challenging task in many engineering applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNN (APTC-RNN) with a novel nonlinear piecewise activation-function (NPAF). Unlike most existing ZNNs with PTC capabilities, the proposed APTC-RNN, due to its NPAF, can achieve arbitrarily PTC (APTC) without adjusting any upper bound parameters. Furthermore, due to the piecewise computation form of the NPAF, the proposed APTC-RNN can provide a lower computational cost compared to most existing RNNs. The stability and APTC capability of the proposed APTC-RNN are proven by rigorous theoretical analysis and mathematical derivation. Numerical simulations show that APTC-RNN has faster and more accurate PTC capability than three state-of-the-art RNNs, while having less computational time. Finally, the practicality of the APTC-RNN is verified by applying it to the UR3 robotic arm and multiagent systems.},

This area has garnered significant research interest due to its extensive applications in robotics, particularly concerning household robots. Nevertheless, the majority of task planning methodologies exhibit suboptimal performance regarding the success and efficiency of completing household tasks, primarily due to a lack of cognitive capacity of household items and home environments. To address these challenges, we propose an efficiency-driven adaptive task planning approach based on hierarchical item-environment cognition. Initially, we establish a multiple semantic attribute-based priori knowledge (MSAPK) framework to facilitate the attributive representation of household items. Utilizing MSAPK, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) based item cognition model that assigns relevant attributes and substitutes to specified household items, thereby enhancing the cognitive capabilities of household robots at the attribute level. Subsequently, we construct an environment cognition model that delineates the relationships between household items and room types, enabling household robots to locate target items more efficiently. Through hierarchical item-environment cognition, we introduce a strategy for adaptive task planning, empowering household robots to execute household tasks with both flexibility and efficiency. The generated plans are evaluated in both virtual and real-world experiments, with promising results affirming the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet, multisource information fusion has become a forefront issue due to its ability to merge different information. Granular computing (GrC), as a methodology simulating human hierarchical cognition, provides a new approach for multisource information fusion. However, on one hand, the existing information fusion studies in GrC all focus on feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion based on multisource data, neglecting the basic characteristics and advantages of GrC: granulation. On the other hand, the existing methods for fusing the knowledge spaces in GrC suffer from losing the necessary information or artificially adding information. In order to address these issues, a novel information fusion mode from the perspective of GrC is proposed in this article, named knowledge-level fusion. First, by introducing a new step, that is, granulate data to construct the knowledge space, into the multisource information fusion process, the knowledge-level fusion mode is proposed. Second, the optimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus and information gap of multisource knowledge spaces in the static data environment. The pessimistic core quotient space is proposed to characterize the information consensus in the dynamic data environment. Related theorems are given to describe the characteristics of the core quotient spaces. Then, the knowledge-level fusion method driven jointly by the data space and the knowledge space is introduced based on the principle of extracting the core quotient space first and then allocating other objects in the candidate set. On the basis, the superiority of the proposed method over the existing methods is demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Finally, experiments on 12 UCI datasets and three UKB datasets are carried out to verify the promoting effect on classification and clustering algorithms, the effectiveness compared to feature-level and decision-level fusion modes, efficiency and statistical significance of the proposed knowledge-level fusion method and mode.},

The controlled system aims to track the optimal trajectory of a target system, despite the cost function governing the target’s behaviors being unknown. The problem is complicated by random state dropouts occurring in two crucial scenarios: 1) the reception of the target’s state and 2) feedback of the controlled system’s states. Our approach enables the controlled system to infer the target’s cost function and optimal control policy, thereby facilitating effective tracking. Specifically, we develop a model-based IRL algorithm that integrates the Smith predictor for state estimation. Then, we advance a state-dropout-aware inverse Q-learning algorithm that uses solely accessible system data, eliminating the need for system models. The theoretical validity of the proposed algorithms is rigorously established, and their practical effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Determining the optimal number of clusters in cluster analysis without prior knowledge remains a critical and challenging task. Existing methods often depend on calculating clustering validity indices (CVIs), which increases complexity and may reduce efficiency. Furthermore, different CVIs frequently suggest varying optimal cluster numbers, complicating the selection process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, self-regulating possibilistic C-means (PCM) with high-density points (SR-PCM-HDP), which simplifies cluster number determination while improving clustering efficiency. First, the density-based knowledge extraction (DBKE) method is introduced to estimate an appropriate initial cluster number and identify high-density points. DBKE enhances the density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm by removing the need for a predefined density radius. Second, SR-PCM-HDP refines the clustering process by incorporating a parameter to balance the interactions between high-density points and cluster centers, reducing sensitivity to initial configurations and accelerating convergence. Third, the parameter adjustment mechanism in classical PCM is redefined to enable adaptive updates during SR-PCM-HDP iterations. This mechanism facilitates the gradual elimination of obsolete clusters and iterative cluster formation. The theoretical foundations of the SR-PCM-HDP cluster elimination mechanism are rigorously established. Experimental results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of SR-PCM-HDP in determining cluster numbers and ensuring clustering validity, particularly for datasets with overlapping or imbalanced distributions. Comparisons are conducted against 13 state-of-the-art algorithms, including fuzzy clustering, possibilistic clustering, and CVI-based cluster determination methods.},

Recent efforts have explored the integration of granular-ball (GB) computing with clustering algorithms to address this challenge, yielding promising results. However, existing methods for generating GBs often rely on single indicators to measure GB quality and employ threshold-based or greedy strategies, potentially leading to GBs that do not accurately capture the underlying data distribution. To address these limitations, this article leverages the principle of justifiable granularity (POJG) to measure the quality of a GB for clustering tasks and introduces a novel GB generation method, termed GB-POJG. Specifically, a comprehensive metric integrating the coverage and specificity of a GB is introduced to assess GB quality. Utilizing this quality metric, GB-POJG incorporates a strategy of maximizing overall quality and an anomaly detection method to determine the generated GBs and identify abnormal GBs, respectively. Compared to previous GB generation methods, GB-POJG maximizes the overall quality of generated GBs while ensuring alignment with the data distribution, thereby enhancing the rationality of the generated GBs. Experimental results obtained from both synthetic and publicly available datasets underscore the effectiveness of GB-POJG, showcasing improvements in clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information.

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is a significant research topic in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but it becomes complicated in the high dimensional search space due to the vast number of features. Evolutionary computation (EC) has been widely used in solving FS by modeling it as an expensive wrapper-form optimization task, where a classifier is used to obtain classification accuracy for fitness evaluation (FE). In this article, we propose that the FS problem can be also modeled as a cheap filter-form optimization task, where the FE is based on the relevance and redundancy of the selected features. The wrapper-form optimization task is beneficial for classification accuracy while the filter-form optimization task has the strength of a lighter computational cost. Therefore, different from existing multitask-based FS that uses various wrapper-form optimization tasks, this article uses a multiform optimization technique to model the FS problem as a wrapper-form optimization task and a filter-form optimization task simultaneously. An evolutionary multitask FS (EMTFS) algorithm for parallel tacking these two tasks is proposed followed by, in which a two-channel knowledge transfer strategy is proposed to transfer positive knowledge across the two tasks. Experiments on widely used public datasets show that EMTFS can select as few features as possible on the premise of superior classification accuracy than the compared state-of-the-art FS algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the past years, latent variable models have played an important role in various industrial AI systems, among which quality prediction is one of the most representative applications. Inspired by the idea of deep learning, those basic latent variable models have been extended to deep forms, based on which the quality prediction performance has been significantly improved. However, different latent variable models have their own strengths and weaknesses, a model works well under one scenario might not provide satisfactory performance under another. The motivation of this article is based on the viewpoint of information fusion and ensemble learning for heterogeneous latent variable models. Particularly, a collaborative deep learning and model fusion framework is formulated for the purpose of industrial quality prediction. In the first stage of the framework, collaborative layer-by-layer feature extractions are implemented among different latent variable models, through which different patterns of latent variables are identified in different layers of the deep model. Then, in the second stage, an ensemble regression modeling strategy is proposed to fuse the quality prediction results from different latent variable models, which is based on a well-designed data description method. Two real industrial examples are used for performance evaluation of the proposed method, based on which we can observe that information fusions in terms of both collaborative layer-by-layer feature extraction and heterogeneous model ensemble have positive effects in improving prediction accuracy and stability.},

Specifically, the system outputs are expected to be synchronized at the solution of an uncertain distributed time-varying quadratic optimization problem, where each local time-varying cost function includes uncertain parameters. From a centralized perspective, we first develop a controller with adaptive control gains to guide the output of a double-integrator system toward the time-varying optimal solution. By employing the modified average estimators, we extend the centralized design to a distributed implementation to address the OOSP for uncertain EL systems. Using matrix trace properties and composite Lyapunov analysis, we prove that the system outputs can asymptotically converge to the desired time-varying optimal solution.

Building on these systems, an enhanced fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode (NITSM) surface and a new virtual control law are designed, respectively. Next, a novel saturated adaptive fuzzy fixed-time NITSM controller is proposed, circumventing the restrictions on uncertainties and input saturation in the existing results. The proposed controller ensures that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed time. Furthermore, to facilitate the adaptive fixed-time stability analysis, two new inequalities are established and rigorously proved. Using the two inequalities, the fixed-time stability of closed-loop systems is demonstrated by the Lyapunov’s theory. Finally, representative numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Discovering clusters remains challenging when dealing with complex data structures, including those with varying densities, arbitrary shapes, weak separability, or the presence of noise. In this article, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called representative point-based clustering with neighborhood information (RPC-NI), which highlights the significance of neighborhood information often overlooked by existing clustering methods. The proposed algorithm first introduces a new local centrality metric that integrates both neighborhood density and topological convergence to identify core representative points, effectively capturing the structural characteristics of the data. Subsequently, a density-adaptive distance is defined to evaluate dissimilarities between these core representative points, and such distance is used to construct a minimum spanning tree (MST) over these points. Finally, an MST-based clustering algorithm is employed to yield the desired clusters. Incorporating neighborhood information enables RPC-NI to comprehensively determine representative points, and having multiple representative points per cluster allows RPC-NI to adapt to clusters of arbitrary shapes, varying densities, and different sizes. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that RPC-NI outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy and robustness. These results provide further evidence for the importance of incorporating neighborhood information discovering clusters with complex structures.},

To overcome these obstacles, a generalized MSPP in large-scale networks is investigated with the aim of solving it with diverse preferences of decision makers satisfied and low spatiotemporal overhead. Toward this end, with a novel concept, the generalized dominance relation is introduced, and the generalized multiobjective shortest path algorithm via the generalized dynamic programming approach is developed. Moreover, the H-reducible technique is further employed to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, several rigorous proofs are provided for the conclusions that all efficient paths could be found within a tolerable time by the developed algorithm and the algorithm could be implemented in a distributed manner under mild assumptions.

Existing gaze or gesture-based interaction systems are often constrained by their dependence on continuous visual engagement, limited interaction surfaces, or cumbersome hardware. To address these challenges, we propose MetaSkin, a novel neurohaptic interface that uniquely integrates neural signals with on-skin interaction for bare-handed, eyes-free interaction by exploiting human’s natural proprioceptive capabilities. To support the interface, we developed a deep learning framework that employs multiscale temporal-spectral feature representation and selective feature attention to effectively decode neural signals generated by on-skin touch and motion gestures. In experiments with 12 participants, our method achieved offline accuracies of 81.95% for touch location discrimination, 71.00% for motion type identification, and 46.08% for 10-class touch-motion classification. In pseudo-online settings, accuracies reached 99.43% for touch onset detection, and 80.34% and 67.02% for classification of touch location and motion type, respectively. Neurophysiological analyses revealed distinct neural activation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, underscoring the efficacy of our multiscale approach in capturing rich temporal and spectral dynamics. Future work will focus on optimizing the system for diverse user populations and dynamic environments, with a long-term goal of advancing human-centered, neuroadaptive interfaces for next-generation HMI systems. This work represents a significant step toward a paradigm shift in design of brain-computer interfaces, bridging sensory and motor paradigms for building more sophisticated systems.},

We also define a more general joint necessary condition, whereby each constituent itself is a necessary condition for the TSK-FIS-product model. The first necessary condition indicates that the normalized firing strength must not be indeterminate (i.e., 0/0), i.e., susceptible to the tomato classification problem. The second necessary condition indicates that all restricted consequents of fuzzy if-then rules must be defined. Based on the principle of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator as well as the concept of increasing orness in OWA and hyperboxes, a general joint sufficient condition for a TSK-FIS-product model to be monotone is derived. Three case studies of the developed methods for undertaking failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and image processing tasks are presented.

Existing methods mainly utilize deep neural network, which is relatively time-consuming due to the complex network structure and back propagation iterations.

Co-BSLN learns knowledge from two-view data and can be used for multiview data with the help of feature concatenation. Different from existing deep learning methods, Co-BSLN utilizes a simple shallow network based on broad learning system (BLS) to simplify the network structure and reduce training time. It replaces back propagation iterations with a direct pseudo inverse calculation to further reduce time consumption. In Co-BSLN, different views of the same instance are considered as positive pairs due to cross-view consistency. Predictions of views in positive pairs are used to guide the training of each other through a direct logit vector mapping. Such a design is fast and effectively utilizes cross-view consistency to improve the accuracy of semi-supervised learning. Evaluation results demonstrate that Co-BSLN is able to improve accuracy and reduce training time on popular datasets.},

  abstract     = {The event-triggered control strategy is capable of significantly reducing the number of control task executions while achieving desired control objectives, such as stability. In this article, we introduce a novel learning-based method for event-triggered model predictive control with initially unknown dynamics. The formulation of optimal control problems (OCPs) is based on predictive states derived from Gaussian process (GP) regression under terminal constraints. The event-triggered condition proposed in this article is derived from the recursive feasibility, so that the OCPs are solved only when an error between the predictive and the actual states exceeds a certain threshold. This article analyzes the convergence of the closed-loop system under the event-triggered condition, demonstrating that the system’s state will enter the terminal set within a finite time, assuming small-enough uncertainty in the GP model. We validate this approach through a tracking control problem, illustrating its practical effectiveness.},
