  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a secure mobile edge computing (MEC) in both uplink and downlink communication with the help of autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), whereby offloading for terrestrial users (TUs) is performed at AAV equipped with an MEC server by secure communication between multiple TUs and AAV in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). In order to establish a secure communication link, we propose the joint optimal design of 3D AAV trajectory and resource allocation with the aim of minimizing total user energy consumption (UEC) under the AAV constraints including the limited energy budget, computation resources, and mobility. Especially, for 3D AAV trajectory, Rician fading is considered by including the vertical domain of AAV leading to higher AAV flight freedom. To tackle the optimization problem, the proposed algorithmic solutions leverage iterative algorithms for AAV trajectory, offloading data, and both uplink and downlink transmit power. Via numerical results, it is shown that the proposed joint design significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with a separate design.},

In this paper, we configure a Real2Sim2Real pipeline, which aims to automatically generate a realistic synthetic dataset, close to that obtained from real sensors, for pre-training by analyzing a small real-world dataset and computer simulation.

In this paper, a CSI feedback method based on spatio-temporal focal modulation (STFM) is proposed. By using a focal modulation mechanism that incorporates the interaction between the spatial and temporal features, the proposed STFM jointly exploits the cross-domain correlation. With multiple successive CSI snapshots, STFM can achieve excellent compression and reconstruction performance. Besides, a residual vector quantization (RVQ) with a shared and learnable codebook is introduced. The RVQ includes multiple stages to quantize the output of the encoder recursively and the corresponding quantization error can be reduced.

We then analyze that the user set can be determined by solely considering the effective signal power, which is achieved by the convergence of the sum of interference as the numbers of users and antennas go to infinity. Based on the analysis, we propose a user selection algorithm that utilizes the effective signal power. To this end, we introduce feedback of the effective channel quality representing the effective signal power, which is then employed in choosing users.

The multi-user access problem is formulated to a sequential decision problem in reinforcement learning (RL). A distributed multi-armed bandit (MAB) based algorithm is proposed to address this issue. The MAB based algorithm uses straightforward reward feedback to maintain a set of probabilistic weights, which help users to make decisions.

The MAPPO based algorithm is centrally trained and executed in a distributed manner, and it is capable of efficiently handling multi-user access decisions.

In this work, we explore the performance of a SIM-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system that incorporates joint beamforming and power allocation. Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. For the transmit power allocation subproblem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization subproblem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods. Additionally, numerical results contrast with those of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO systems, highlighting the advantages of SIMs in CF networks and demonstrating the efficacy of SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design, where increasing the number of meta-atoms and layers of SIMs is beneficial for improving the sum rate.},

However, the existing terrestrial routing algorithms cannot well handle the high-speed movement issue of satellites, while the existing satellite routing algorithms usually suffer from high communication overhead or high computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose a fully distributed dynamic packet routing algorithm based on Graph Neural Network (GNN)-enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL), named GraphPR. In GraphPR, the satellite routing problem is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where each satellite only needs to share the information with one-hop neighbors. Then, Graph Attention Network (GAT) is leveraged to encode the perceived one-hop information and derive a hidden representation implicitly consisting of multi-hop satellite information. Subsequently, MADRL is employed to build a fully distributed optimization framework and make routing decisions. In addition, a special mechanism called Residual Shortest Path Hops (RSPH) is designed to guide the routing selection and avoid routing loops. Finally, the experimental results illustrate that GraphPR has better performance in terms of packet loss rate, average delivery time, throughput, and average queuing length than the baseline algorithms.},

In contrast, HAPs are being considered due to their extensive coverage and line-of-sight (LoS) paths. These platforms aim to offer communication capabilities that leverage the advantages of both terrestrial and satellite systems. Due to their extensive coverage, there is no need for frequent beam switching, thereby reducing the requirement for additional overhead costs. However, there can be unexpected floating of HAPs, lead to beam misalignment and deterioration in antenna gain, especially in narrow beams.

The sub-optimal solutions can be derived by employing semidefinite relaxation and the Charnes-Cooper transformation, which are provided to solve the proposed non-convex covert rate maximization problem.

  abstract     = {The short packet transmission (SPT) has gained much attention in recent years. In SPT, the most significant characteristic is that the finite blocklength code (FBC) is adopted. With FBC, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cannot be expressed as an explicit function with respect to the other transmission parameters. This raises the following two problems for the resource allocation in SPTs: (i) The exact value of the SNR is hard to determine, and (ii) The property of SNR w.r.t. the other parameters is hard to analyze, which hinders the efficient optimization of them. To simultaneously tackle these problems, we have developed a recursion method in our prior work. To emphasize the significance of this method, we further analyze its convergence rate and investigate the property of the recursion function in this paper. Specifically, we first analyze the convergence rate of the recursion method, which indicates it can determine the SNR with low complexity. Then, we analyze the property of the recursion function, which facilitates the optimization of the other parameters during the recursion. Finally, we also enumerate some applications for the recursion method. Simulation results indicate that the recursion method converges faster than the other SNR determination methods.},

In specific, the transmission and reflection coefficients of the STAR-RIS are updated through a novel STAR-RIS element allocation technique. The STAR-RIS element allocation technique allocates each element to two sub-carriers, where one sub-carrier serves a single user-equipment (UE) in the transmission region of the STAR-RIS, and the other sub-carrier serves a single UE in the reflection region of the STAR-RIS. Through the element allocation process, the phase coefficients of the STAR-RIS are obtained in closed-form, and the amplitude coefficients of the STAR-RIS, which are to satisfy the law of conservation of energy, are obtained by iteratively solving a properly defined problem that has a closed-form solution, decreasing the complexity of the overall algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves high sum rate performance close to an optimization-based benchmark even with low complexity.},

This work aims to propose a joint user activity detection and channel estimate approach for asynchronous mMTC scenarios in CFmMIMO. We deal with user activity detection and channel estimation as a structural compressive sensing problem, which is related to asynchronous latency, active users, and channel coefficients, making use of sporadic nature of mMTC traffic. In particular, we implement an asynchronous aware simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (AA-SOMP) scheme at central processing unit. This approach is effective to retrieve channel coefficients and active user information of numerous APs, even with restricted pilot length and asynchronous delays.

In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition. Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed. Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell. The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.},

Different from centralized schemes, which gather all the channel state information (CSI) at the central processing unit (CPU) for calculating the resource allocation, the local resource of access points (APs) is exploited in the proposed distributed GNN-based framework to allocate transmit powers. Specifically, APs can use a unique GNN model to allocate their power based on the local CSI. The GNN model is trained at the CPU using the local CSI of one AP, with partially exchanged information from other APs to calculate the loss function to reflect system characteristics, capturing comprehensive network information while avoiding computation burden.

By exploiting the geometrical structure of the combined base station-RIS-user equipment channel, the proposed HDR estimator recasts parametric channel estimation as a single sixth-order rank-one tensor approximation problem, which can be efficiently solved using higher-order singular value decomposition to deliver parallel estimates of each channel component vector. Numerical results show that the proposed method provides significantly more accurate parameter estimates than competing state-of-the-art tensor-based RIS channel estimation, Khatri-Rao factorization, and least squares methods. For higher-rank channels, the HDR method shows similar spectral efficiency compared to its competitors while having similar computational complexity to the classical least squares estimator.},

A transmit power minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the beamforming vector of the primary base station, reflection coefficients and common stream. To solve the non-convex problem, an iterative-based robust RA algorithm is proposed by using the alternating optimization method, successive convex approximation, and semi-definite relaxation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively decrease power consumption and improve the robustness by comparing it with the RA algorithms with traditional access methods.},

Since it is practically challenging to collect all instantaneous channel state information (CSI) by traversing all possible antenna positions at the BS, we instead propose a two-timescale scheme for maximizing the ergodic sum rate. Specifically, antenna positions at the BS are first optimized using only the statistical CSI. Subsequently, the receiving beamforming at the BS (for which we consider the three typical zero-forcing (ZF), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and MMSE with successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receivers) is designed based on the instantaneous CSI with optimized antenna positions, thus significantly reducing practical implementation complexities. The formulated problems are highly non-convex and we develop projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithms to effectively handle them. Simulation results illustrate that compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array, the MA array can achieve significant performance gains by reaping an additional spatial degree of freedom.},

In this paper, we propose an optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS)-aided V2V system with an optimal irradiance angle method to guide the NLoS link towards the desired user in order to maximize the received power at the user. Further, for a given user distribution, we propose a novel algorithm to find the optimal orientation of the OIRS element that will produce the maximum power at the receiver. The proposed algorithm returns the rotational angles which will result in the optimal orientation of the OIRS elements with the time complexity of $O(1)$ . In addition, closed-form expression is derived for the obtained optimal irradiance angle, essentially a cosine of the irradiance angle for an element of OIRS based on the location of OIRS and the receiver&#39;s (user) position.},

Instead of utilizing the widely-used alternating optimization (AO) approach, we reveal, with rigorous proof, that the above two variables can be optimized separately: i) the optimal antenna positions can be firstly determined via the successive convex approximation technique, based on the rule of maximizing the correlation between $\mathrm{{S}}$-$\mathrm{{U}}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{{S}}$-$\mathrm{{U}}_{2}$ channels; ii) afterwards, the optimal closed-form transmit beamforming can be derived via simple arguments. Compared to AO, this new approach yields the same performance but reduces the computational complexities significantly. Moreover, it can provide insightful conclusions which are not possible with AO.},

This model assumes that the line-of-sight (LOS) paths are obscured and scatterers are distributed within the scattering angle around a mobile station, resulting in the AOA received by the base station being limited to a certain range. Such a single bounce scattering models can be used for different 6G scenarios such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) by adjusting the angle parameter. Accordingly, the azimuthal angle and time of arrival marginal probability density functions (PDFs) are derived in closed form, which is evaluated in numerical simulation by compared to the normalized histograms. Finally, the proposed model is analyzed and verified with the measured data in micro and macro cells, which clearly demonstrates its accuracy and flexibility.},

Traditional fault detection faces challenges due to the high mobility of vehicles and prevalent software, hardware, and communication link faults, necessitating a robust solution for timely and accurate fault detection. This paper introduces ET-FD, a novel fault detection method based on ensemble learning designed to address the unique challenges in VANETs. ET-FD satisfies stringent accuracy requirements and aims to reduce system overhead significantly. We present experimental results demonstrating the superior performance of ET-FD in terms of fault detection accuracy and false positive rates, alongside comparisons with other classification methods that highlight its reduced training time.

  abstract     = {In this article, an efficient wireless federated learning (FL) framework based on blockchain (BC) assistance is studied. Many existing frameworks adopt lots of third-party servers as consensus nodes, which is vulnerable to collusion attacks. In our framework, the blockchain-assisted FL (BFL) model selects edge users as blockchain nodes without any third-party intervention. Besides, the convergence analysis of this FL algorithm considering transmission outages is provided to prove the effects of wireless factors on FL. To solve the low efficiency of the BC based on the conventional linear chain structure, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain is introduced into our work. Moreover, since the design and optimization of FL and BC in most existing works are done separately, this may result in sub-optimal performance. To achieve an excellent trade-off between FL efficiency and BC performance, a joint optimization problem regarding DAG-BFL is formulated. The optimization objective is to maximize the FL performance and DAG-BC throughput. To solve the complex nonconvex optimization problem, considering the resource-constrained BFL system, the joint communication and computing resource allocation as well as block designing schemes are proposed, which are based on the twin-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method and the successive block minimization technique (BSUM). Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, compared with the traditional alternative optimization, the proposed PDD-based algorithm achieves better performance.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), data sharing as a key service for most IoV applications has emerged as an effective way to break down data silos and unlock the data&#39;s potential. In order to guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data-sharing process, various advanced cryptographic techniques have been proposed by both the research community and industry. As one of the most intensive primitives among these techniques, searchable encryption (SE) has attracted extensive attention. SE enables users to search encrypted sharing data without decrypting operations. However, most existing works suffer from drawbacks such as privacy leakage, deployment complexity, or low efficiency when applied in practical IoV environments. In this paper, we design a lightweight certificateless searchable public key encryption (CLSPKE) scheme with trapdoor indistinguishability to simultaneously solve the above security and efficiency problems. The proposed scheme not only eliminates the need for complex certificate management and key escrow issues, but also achieves trapdoor indistinguishability without relying on the bilinear pairing operation. We compare the proposed scheme with other relevant schemes and implement its prototype. Extensive experiments and evaluations indicate that the proposed scheme is practical as it significantly reduces computation and communication costs while still maintaining strong privacy protection.},

The mobility of UAVs and the signal redirection capabilities of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be utilized to reduce these negative effects. In this paper, we propose a multi-user localization scheme in UAV-enabled millimeter-wave wireless networks, where the UAV localizes the chosen ground user by receiving the positioning reference signal from both the direct path and the reflected path via a RIS in each time instance. We derive the positioning error bound (PEB) based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of the unknown channel parameters and location parameters. Then we propose an alternating algorithm to minimize the maximum PEB among all users, by optimizing the UAV trajectory, the user scheduling, the UAV beamforming, and the RIS phase shifts iteratively until convergence. Furthermore, we formulate a robust optimization problem with imperfect knowledge of location parameters to minimize the maximum worst-case PEB, which can also be solved by the alternating algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed alternating algorithm can improve the localization accuracy by more than twice compared to the scheme with a fixed base station and the scheme without RIS deployment.},

To address the issue of excessive response latency caused by the surge in data traffic, edge caching (EC) technology has proven to be effective. However, accurately predicting the popularity of content in different regions is challenging due to the high degree of mobility of the vehicles. Additionally, as vehicles typically do not remain in the same region for a long period of time, making the content popularity within a region highly dynamic. To address this issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based mobile-aware edge cooperative caching scheme (MAECCD). Our approach utilizes an AutoEncoder to capture user features from local vehicle user data and accurately forecast content popularity in both vehicle-local and edge regions. Furthermore, the MAECCD incorporates a cooperation model between edge nodes to optimize cache utilization and employs techniques in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to refresh cached content and reduce transmission delay. Experimental results indicate that our MAECCD scheme outperforms other baseline algorithms in terms of cache hit ratio and content transmission delay.},

In this paper, we aim to understand two key challenges: 1) how often a client uses the service in the presence of acquisition time and price, and 2) how the provider prices the service based on limited resources, acquisition time, and incomplete information about the clients. We first analyze a single-client Stackelberg game with a finite time horizon. Our analysis shows that the client&#39;s optimal decision is to use the service at equal intervals whose length depends on the minimum acquisition time and price. Leveraging the equal-interval insight, we further analyze the provider&#39;s pricing from a multi-client Stackelberg game with an infinite time horizon. We devise efficient algorithms for the multi-client problem with complete and incomplete information settings. Moreover, numerical results reveal that the realized profit from the complete information setting can be much lower than the expected profit from the incomplete information setting. We, therefore, develop a method for the provider to make the trade-off between profit and the risk of profit loss. Our numerical results suggest that lower pricing to serve a smaller number of clients reduces the risk of profit loss.},

However, the performance of virtualized nodes sharing cache resources in 6G network slicing is degraded by the inappropriate allocation of resources. This paper proposes a cache resource allocation strategy for 6G network slicing based on game dynamics (RASGD). A 6G slicing network model is developed that describes the relationship between virtualized node mapping and resource sharing, and an evolutionary public goods game cache resource allocation (PGGRA) method is proposed to improve data transmission performance. This strategy defines the cache resource gap and selects the input cost according to the cache resource gap and evolutionary game strategy. When the cache resources are sufficient, the input is carried out, and when the cache resources are insufficient or the demand is large, unnecessary input is reduced to avoid the waste of resources, so as to achieve the intelligent allocation of cache resource. Simulation results demonstrate that the RASGD strategy improves the successful arrival rate of slice packets by at least 4.79% and improves the network congestion by at least 22.9% compared with the resource allocation strategy based on number of nodes (RANN) and resource allocation strategy based on node degree (RAND).},

This paper introduces a Shapley value-based power resource allocation (SVPRA) method developed for low-grazing angle detection in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) radar sensor networks (RSN). The SVPRA leverages multipath echoes for improved detection performance through coordinated power resource allocation (PRA). A systematic multipath scattering model with uncertainty identifies four independent spatial paths, highlighting the impact of multipath effects (ME) fluctuations on detection. The PRA is then formulated as a non-convex Max-min optimization problem, incorporating the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) indicator and modeling cognitive collaboration detection as a cooperative game. The application of the PRA rule has been mathematically proven to consistently enhance the detection performance. To address convergence challenges in multi-target scenarios, a fine-tuning method is introduced, providing a provisional iteration outcome, succeeded by a greedy selection process to achieve a feasible solution. Simulation results validate that the SVPRA method effectively enhances detection performance while reducing the system&#39;s timeliness load.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a fundamental task in array processing. A popular family of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation algorithms are subspace methods, which operate by dividing the measurements into distinct signal and noise subspaces. Subspace methods, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and Root-MUSIC, rely on several restrictive assumptions, including narrowband non-coherent sources and fully calibrated arrays, and their performance is considerably degraded when these do not hold. In this work we propose SubspaceNet; a data-driven DoA estimator which learns how to divide the observations into distinguishable subspaces. This is achieved by utilizing a dedicated deep neural network to learn the empirical autocorrelation of the input, by training it as part of the Root-MUSIC method, leveraging the inherent differentiability of this specific DoA estimator, while removing the need to provide a ground-truth decomposable autocorrelation matrix. Once trained, the resulting SubspaceNet serves as a universal surrogate covariance estimator that can be applied in combination with any subspace-based DoA estimation method, allowing its successful application in challenging setups. SubspaceNet is shown to enable various DoA estimation algorithms to cope with coherent sources, wideband signals, low SNR, array mismatches, and limited snapshots, while preserving the interpretability and the suitability of classic subspace methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of low earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, the ultra-dense LEO satellite network (UDLSN) has become a promising solution to provide Internet services for civil aviation due to its wide coverage, exceptional flexibility and high reliability. To guarantee the continuity and high-quality Internet services, satellite-aircraft handover is inevitable because of the high mobility of aircraft and satellites. However, the stringent passenger communication requirements and the considerable increase in the scale of candidate satellites pose huge challenges in satellite-aircraft handover in UDLSNs. In this paper, we investigate multiple civil aircraft handover issue including satellite handover, subchannel allocation, and power selection in the UDLSN and consider different levels of usersâ rate satisfaction, power overhead, and handover overhead as handover criteria for performance measure. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize the handover satisfaction of all civil aircraft. Particularly, the formulated handover problem is represented as a local cooperation game, where each aircraft determines the handover action and the power level by cooperating with other interference aircraft. We prove that the proposed game has at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution in which no aircraft changes its handover strategy. The NE solution in the proposed game is further proven to locally or globally maximize the optimization objective and we then design the parallel handover strategy update (PHSU) algorithm to find the NE solution. Simulation results based on trajectories of real civil aircraft demonstrate that, the designed algorithm is robust, can effectively meet diverse user requirements, and reduce both handover frequency and delays.},

  abstract     = {With the exponential advancement of vehicle networking applications and autonomous driving technology, the demand for efficient and secure autonomous vehicles (AVs) is increasing. AVs require the ability to gather information to navigate complex and ever-changing traffic environments, making effective communication with other vehicles or roadside units (RSUs) crucial for achieving co-awareness. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology emerges as a promising solution for the future of autonomous driving. However, in the dynamic and uncertain real-world road environment, the selection of sensing and communication (SC) functions becomes paramount in enhancing performance. Moreover, ambient noise often disrupts the interaction between vehicles and roadside units, leading to a partial loss of environmental states. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for selecting sensing and communication functions, even in the presence of partial loss of environmental states. Specifically, we approximate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to a complete Markov decision process (MDP) through matrix completion and subsequently utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve it. Additionally, we propose a matrix completion algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with deep unfolding to accurately complete the missing environmental states. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other POMDP-based approaches for SC function selection in an ISAC-enabled vehicular network.},

  abstract     = {Delay-sensitive applications for autonomous vehicles (AVs) require a substantial amount of computational resources. However, the onboard computation resources may be insufficient, resulting in long processing latencies. To deal with this critical issue, we jointly consider roadside unit (RSU) and assistant vehicle offloading, along with resource allocation, to minimize latency for vehicular tasks. This approach also takes into account frequency reuse among sub-areas for assistant vehicle offloading. The latency minimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Given the inherent complexity of the MINLP problem, we propose a two-step solution. The first step focuses on the combined decision of assistant vehicle offloading and transmit power allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with low complexity and low average transmit power. The second step deals with RSU offloading/local computation decision, bandwidth allocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Without adding additional computation resources, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicular task offloading approach improves overall delay performance than the adaptive MEC offloading scheme and the pure MEC computing scheme.},

However, this issue has received little attention, and traditional cooperative positioning methods are no longer suitable for the network of high-density vehicles. In order to solve the cooperative localization issue in high-density vehicle networks, This paper proposes a region-constrained vehicle cooperative localization algorithm based on stochastic geometry. By setting restricted areas of vehicles, the communication capability and network capacity between vehicles are effectively improved. Then, to take full advantage of the density of the Ultra-high density vehicles network, the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDoP) metric is used to dynamically introduce cooperative vehicles. By dynamically selecting vehicles, the value of GDoP decreases significantly with the increase of vehicle density. Finally, experimental simulations show that the network capacity in the vehicle system is improved by about 71% at the maximum interruption probability when using vehicle selection with restricted areas. Furthermore, the positioning performance of vehicles improves continuously with the increasing density of the cooperative vehicle network.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are increasingly being used to provide communications in emergencies. Maintaining the required quality of service of information including its timely delivery, in MANETs, is extremely challenging under dynamic conditions such as a changing bushfire scenario. Nodes get destroyed or their link qualities degrade leading to sub-optimal paths, reduced network performance, and disconnected end nodes. To remedy partitioning in ground-based MANETs and to improve their communication performance, aUtonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising relay solution. This paper presents U-QoIT, a UAV deployment algorithm for connecting the disconnected end nodes in a dynamic bushfire scenario. It aims to meet the Quality of Information requirements, with a minimal number of UAVs deployed. U-QoIT takes the UAV deployment problem as a combinatorial search problem and reduces the deployment complexity by applying a reduction by minimization approach. This is done to deploy fewer UAVs without compromising connectivity. Extensive simulation results depict that U-QoIT significantly improves user usability by 48% compared to the best-performing baseline approach, of Dynamic Service Area (DSA) based UAV deployment, at the expense of a negligible increase in computational time. It achieves a 38% drop in packet latency and retains its out-performance in a highly mobile network. In a sparse network, it improves user usability by 106%. Furthermore, it needs fewer UAVs, compared to the baseline UAV deployment methods, without compromising its performance gains.},

In this paper, we put the fast worker identification into a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and propose a Thompson sampling (TS)-based approach to tackle it. Then, our approach leverages the heterogeneity of computing speeds by formulating the task allocation problem to minimize the expected computing delay. We derive a lower bound for the delay and prove that our proposed algorithm minimizes this bound. Importantly, the time complexity of our algorithm is independent of the number of tasks to be assigned, which is typically large in practical scenarios. When our scheme is applied to solve the linear regression problem, simulation results show that it reduces the computing delay of a state-of-the-art method by more than 15% in two different scenarios.},

However, it still faces substantial challenges posed by large-scale complex DT communications in sustaining real-time collaborative endeavors. In particular, within the dynamic VECONs, the decision regarding DT migration plays a pivotal role in sustaining the quality of services. In this paper, we propose an adaptive DT migration (ADM) algorithm to minimize the overall migration costs when DTs deliver services. Specifically, 1) We formulate ADM as a combinatorial optimization problem in VECONs, comprehensively considering communication latency and migration latency under complex DT communications, vehicular mobilities, and dynamic states of edges; 2) An ADM algorithm based on off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning is proposed to make migration decisions. Moreover, the ADM agent employs warm-up policies to address exploration challenges in sparse state spaces; 3) Simulations based on real-world, large-scale urban vehicular mobility datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing algorithms by approximately 39% on average, and it can achieve results close to the optimal.},

  abstract     = {Compressive sensing (CS) has been applied as an effective technique to reconstruct collected data from a subset of sensors in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Although many algorithms have been proposed to exploit data correlation among sensors, a majority of these research endeavors focus on sensor selection under ideal communication links. As a result, reconstruction quality would be severely affected when packet losses occur during transmissions. In this paper, we propose to optimize allocation of communication resources to sensors for allowing data retransmissions so the impact of packet losses can be effectively mitigated. Unlike previous work that either does not allow retransmissions or determines the number of retransmissions for each sensor purely based on its packet delivery ratio while disregarding data correlation with other sensors, we further exploit data correlation among sensors for optimization of resource allocation. To proceed, we apply CS with Bayesian estimation to derive the analytical lower bound of data reconstruction error in the target scenario and incorporate retransmission opportunities into the problem formulation. Based on the principle of rank-one adjustment for matrix inversion, we efficiently compute matrix inversion of the data-loss matrix required to minimize reconstruction error. We then propose a greedy yet effective algorithm to determine resource allocation strategy and apply a meta-heuristic search algorithm to further validate its solution. Our proposed algorithms are evaluated using both simulated environment and data from real-world sensor deployment under various resource constraints and data correlation settings. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform existing algorithms in terms of reconstruction error and computation efficiency under link losses.},

  abstract     = {The significance of transportation efficiency, safety, and related services continues to increase in urban vehicular networks. Within such networks, roadside units (RSUs) serve as intermediaries in facilitating communication. Therefore, the deployment of RSUs is of utmost importance in ensuring the quality of communication services. However, the optimization objectives, such as time delay and deployment cost, are commonly developed from diverse perspectives. As a result, it is possible that conflicts may arise among the objectives. Furthermore, in urban environments, the presence of various obstacles, such as buildings, gardens, lakes, and other infrastructure, poses challenges for the deployment of RSUs. Consequently, the deployment encounters significant difficulties due to the existence of multiple objectives, constraints imposed by obstacles, and the need to explore a large-scale optimization space. To address this issue, two versions of multi-objective optimization algorithms are proposed in this paper. By utilizing a multi-population strategy and an adaptive exploration technique, the proposed methods efficiently explore a large-scale decision-variable space. In order to mitigate the issue of an overcrowded deployment of RSUs, a calibrating mechanism is adopted to adjust RSU density during the optimization procedures. The proposed methods also address data offloading between vehicles and RSUs by setting up an iterative best response sequence game (IBRSG). Comparative analyses against several state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that our strategies achieve superior performance in both high-density and low-density urban scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed solutions significantly enhance the efficiency of vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {As smart cities rapidly evolve, the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network faces significant challenges in data security and communication efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative algorithm based on a reputation mechanism, named the Dynamic Vehicle Reputation Consensus (DVRC), which focuses on improving the data security and communication efficiency of vehicular networks using blockchain technology. The DVRC algorithm comprehensively assesses vehicle behaviors and the consensus contribution within the blockchain network, utilizing a reputation scoring system to evaluate the reliability within the network. Furthermore, this study delves into multimodal communication strategies in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. Notably, when vehicles leave the range of basic infrastructure, those with high reputation scores (as determined by the DVRC&#39;s reputation values) relay the communication service. Additionally, the introduction of a reputation incentive mechanism and dynamic consensus threshold adjustments aim to improve consensus efficiency and encourage honest behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the DVRC algorithm significantly improves communication efficiency in blockchain-based vehicular networks, such as increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved network scalability. These advances have substantial theoretical and practical significance for the development of vehicular networks in smart cities.},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) have become a key area of research, representing a cutting-edge architectural concept for sixth-generation (6G) networks aimed at achieving ubiquitous connectivity. This paper focuses on the challenge of online access scheduling across multiple platforms. Specifically, when multiple users randomly enter the network and request access through high-altitude platform (HAP) relays, the system must make real-time decisions on whether to grant or deny access, while considering the connections between HAPs and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. By explicitly modelingthe data collection process and the workload associated with transmission tasks, we formulate the multi-access scheduling challenge as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, which presents high computational complexity. Given the practical system&#39;s lack of prior knowledge about user attributes, such as arrival times and channel conditions, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based model for real-time decision-making. To enhance feature extraction within the DRL architecture, we introduce a graph neural network (GNN)-based encoder, and employ a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) module to manage the exponential increase in action space resulting from simultaneous decisions on multiple access requests. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the integrated GNN and Seq2Seq (iGNNSeq)-enhanced RL achieves performance comparable to offline solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the spectrum access and power control problem in a heterogeneous cellular and vehicular communication network comprising both cellular links and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. We formulate the spectrum access and power control problem as a fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning task, where each V2V link receives an identical reward at each time step. This strategy caters to the heterogeneous Quality-of-Service requirements, including the high reliability and low latency requirements for safety-centric applications, as well as the high transmission rate requirements for entertainment applications. Consequently, we design a multi-criterion objective reward function that accounts for the heterogeneous traffic demands. Subsequently, we introduce a robust multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. The proposed approach employs global observation to learn policies for each V2V agent during training, while allowing each agent to take an action based on its local observation during distributed execution phase. Furthermore, we consider imperfect spectrum sensing and outdated channel state information (CSI) in the work. Henceforth, a critic network incorporating long short-term memory layers is developed to effectively leverage the global observation, thereby mitigating the impact of outdated CSI and sensing errors. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method comparing to other existing methods in terms of transmission success rate of cellular links, average capacity for entertainment applications of V2V links, and payload delivery rate for safety-centric applications of V2V links. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method against variations in V2V payloads and SINR thresholds.},

  abstract     = {The incorporation of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents a promising shift of paradigm for traditional mobile edge computing (MEC) with ground infrastructure. An air-ground coordinated MEC framework provides extensive signaling coverage and additional computing power for user equipments (UEs), especially in remote areas or emerging scenarios. This paper proposes a novel air-ground coordinated MEC system, comprising a laser-powered UAV and a ground access point (AP). In this setup, the UAV serves both as an MEC server and a relay, while the AP supplies energy to the UAV through laser charging. Given the uncertainties in wireless energy harvesting, our goal is to minimize the UAV&#39;s long-term average energy consumption by collaboratively optimizing its trajectory, task allocation between the UAV and AP, and time for energy harvesting. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce a two-step alternating optimization algorithm that decouples the optimization variables into two subproblems. Subproblem 1 focuses on computation task and energy harvesting time allocation, formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. Subproblem 2 addresses real-time trajectory scheduling for the UAV, tackled using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm&#39;s convergence and its effectiveness in reducing UAV energy consumption compared to benchmark schemes across various scenarios. Additionally, the optimal policies pertaining to UAV trajectory and task allocation ratios are identified and discussed, highlighting key features and implications.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio (CR) and Energy Harvesting (EH) techniques have offered insights to mitigate issues related to inefficient spectrum utilization and limited energy storage capacity. In Cognitive Radio Networks, security threats, particularly from eavesdroppers, may result in information leakage. This study focuses on enhancing the Physical Layer Security (PLS) of multi-users with EH by employing cooperative jamming via a Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) to maximize the secure communication rate. In the AAV-assisted EH-CR system, Secondary Users (SUs) can utilize the licensed spectrum band occupied by a Primary User (PU) if the cooperative jamming power from SUs to the PU remains below a certain threshold. SUs can harvest and use Radio Frequency (RF) energy from the Primary Transmitter (PT). The AAV jammer disrupts the eavesdropper by transmitting jamming signals, thereby minimizing stolen information to optimize long-term secure communication performance. The paper formulates the problem of maximizing the average secure communication rate while considering system constraints and jointly optimizes the AAV trajectory, transmission power, and EH coefficient. As the problem is non-convex, it is reformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The paper employs the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to address the problem, introduces counterfactual baselines to tackle the credit assignment problem in centralized learning, and integrates the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enhance the learning capability of sequential sample data, thereby improving the training efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a lattice-based robust and conditional privacy-preserving authentication (LRCPA) scheme for VANETs, which enables anonymous authentication on vehicles and adopts the small integer solution problem to withstand quantum attacks. Specially, obfuscated expiration dates are set for vehicles&#39; credentials and pseudonyms to guarantee the unlinkability of new and old pseudonyms. The public verification of tracing is ensured by adopting vehicles&#39; commitments or signatures on their real identities and pseudonyms as the proof of tracing, and tracing robustness is provided by employing vehicles&#39; credentials issued by a central authority as the proof of malicious accusations or framing behaviors by the corrupted authority during tracing. LRCPA not only achieves message authentication and integrity, non-repudiation, anonymity, conditional privacy, unlinkability, key escrow freedom, public verification of tracing, and tracing robustness, but also effectively withstands most known attacks. Comprehensive performance analysis and evaluation show the potential usability of LRCPA.},

In this paper, with consideration of the constraint induced by the UAV flight dynamics, the dynamic trajectory design challenge within the blockchain-based multi-UAV-assisted MEC framework is investigated. An intelligent algorithm that integrates multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and CVXPY solver, named MADDPG-LC, is proposed to achieve real-time joint optimization of dynamic trajectory control and resource allocation with respect to minimizing weighted energy consumption and delays.

To handle this problem, the alternate optimization (AO) method is utilized to decouple the formulated problem into several sub-problems which are solved by optimizing one set of variables with other sets being fixed. Specifically, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to obtain the BS&#39;s transmit beamforming vectors (TBVs), while obtaining the RIS phase shifts based on the combination of SCA and penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) algorithms, and an optimal power splitting (PS) ratio of each user is derived in a closed-form solution.

Departing from traditional non-convex problem-solving methods, we introduce a hybrid RSMA optimization scheme based on deep residual networks to enhance the feasibility of hybrid precoding and decoding. Initially, due to the absence of standardized and universal datasets, we propose a dataset generation algorithm to create training and testing datasets for subsequent communication model training. Subsequently, we construct a loss function that integrates the objective function with the constraints of the optimization problem. Lastly, to ensure that the optimization variables strictly comply with the constraints, we design a mandatory constraint module comprising modulus, power, and rate constraint sub-modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional optimization methods, and RSMA shows significant advantages over conventional multiple access (MA) schemes.},

  abstract     = {The use of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) bands in 5G/6G cellular networks offers high data rates but demands infrastructure densification. To reduce deployment costs, the 3GPP has introduced Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) enabling multi-hop connectivity via low-cost IAB relay nodes. Multicast communications appear particularly advantageous in IAB systems as they permit saving spectrum resources both in access and backhaul. This work aims at evaluating the impact of the multicast transmission mode and multicast-aware user association in 5G/6G mmWave/sub-THz self-backhauled systems serving unicast and multicast traffic. We develop an optimization framework for user association and multicast grouping in IAB taking into account the specifics of the propagation in mmWave/sub-THz spectrum, antenna design, and resource sharing between access and backhaul. The resulting optimization problem is solved using an approximate dynamic programming approach capable of handling the 3GPP-recommended numbers of cell users. Our results show that in an IAB network unicast and multicast users differ in their optimal associations, namely, multicast users tend to be associated more frequently with the relay nodes compared to unicast users, and this difference is more notable in low blockage scenarios. Quantitatively, the use of multicasting in an IAB system permits saving up to 40% of resources.},

  abstract     = {Optical Mobile Communication (OMC) is a newly raised optical wireless communication system, where a novel device called Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) is applied. With the deploying of SLM units, OMC systems can split one light beam to multiple beams directing to different receivers, and hence bring in a new design freedom on the energy allocation for each sub-beam. In this paper, we study a general model of the OMC systems that the transmitter wants to broadcast multiple messages to multiple users, and some of the users may request a same message. We focus on characterizing the capacity region of such OMC systems, in order to assess the benefits on capacity by deploying SLM units. For the general cases, numerical solutions of the capacity region are raised, and for special cases that the system is symmetric or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is rather low, closed form results of the capacity region are proposed. We also study the OMC system which broadcasts two different messages, and give out a partial closed form result of the capacity region. From this case, we can find that characterizing the capacity region for OMC systems is equivalent to optimizing high order polynomial, which is doable but impossible to find closed form results in general.

Our approach leverages orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to address the challenges of frequency-selective fading. To mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issues inherent in OFDM signals, the desired low-PAPR property is also incorporated into the design of the waveforms. For enhanced radar sensing functionality, we introduce an advanced metric, the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL), meticulously crafted to measure and minimize low-range sidelobes. On the communication front, we integrate constructive interference (CI) techniques to significantly enhance quality of service (QoS) in data transmission. To address the intricate optimization challenges presented by our design objectives, we have developed an efficient algorithm anchored in the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm notably surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in reducing range sidelobe interference. Furthermore, our CI-based approach yields enhanced performance compared to traditional least squares (LS) methods, achieving lower symbol error rates (SER) and higher average achievable sum rates.},

  abstract     = {The uniform circular array (UCA) currently stands as the predominant method for generating orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the radio frequency band. Existing studies paid little attention to the impact of the antenna element&#39;s radiation pattern (AERP) on the OAM communication performance. In this paper, we present a UCA-based OAM communication model that considers the AERP. Through the model, it is theoretically demonstrated that perfect orthogonality of OAM modes is maintained only when the AERP is symmetric in the azimuthal angle. However, AERP is typically asymmetric due to the designing or manufacturing error, leading to a decline in OAM mode isolation. To address this issue, we propose the use of the sequentially rotated UCA (SRUCA) and prove that the mode orthogonality of SRUCA can always be maintained despite the asymmetry of the AERP. However, because the spatial orientation of each antenna element changes, the attribute of the SRUCA-based OAM communications also changes. To explore the performance difference, we further construct the electric field vector model of SRUCA-based OAM communications and theoretically prove that orthogonality among excitation modes still exists. Additionally, there is mode gain variation for the SRUCA compared with the UCA. Typically, in general communication scenarios where the communication distance is significantly larger than the UCA radius, there is 50% polarization loss (PL) for the linear polarization (LP) SRUCA when full modes multiplexing is performed. Comprehensive simulations of phase and amplitude error, mode isolation, polarization variation, and PL are performed. The results validate the theoretical analysis.},

This paper develops the deep learning-based predictive beamforming method for the ISAC-enabled vehicular networks. Traditional deep learning (DL) is a data-driven approach, which means that numerous training samples are required to improve system performance. In addition, embedded devices are not able to provide sufficient computing power, which hinders the application of DL solutions. Motivated by this, the dynamic self-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the dependence of DL on training samples. Aiming for the optimal trade-off between sensing performance and computational complexity, the efficient model design, Self-Attention Channel Shuffle Mobile Network (SACSMN), is formulated. Experimental results demonstrate that SACSMN achieves similar sensing performance to that based on the full training set under the condition of few samples, the dependence of SACSMN on training samples is significantly reduced. Furthermore, SACSMN significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving the same level of sensing performance as the benchmarks, realizing the optimal trade-off between system sensing performance and computational complexity. Benefiting from the robust sensing performance of SACSMN, the system achieves the same level of communication performance as that based on full training samples in the case of few samples.},

  abstract     = {A novel integrated antenna supporting polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability is proposed for emerging millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicular communication. To meet the reconfigurability requirement of the vehicular communication system, a compact shared-aperture two-dimensional leaky-wave antenna (LWA) is designed. The LWA is generated by the parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) long-slot structure and its open stopband issue is suppressed completely by employing a unit cell with two asymmetrical slots, leading to high-gain and broadband characteristics. Besides, a multifunction feeding network constituted by four switchable input ports, four parabolic reflector systems, and an integrated multifunction coupler is seamlessly incorporated with the radiation aperture within a single substrate, realizing a low-cost solution for vehicular communication applications. Based on the proposed design concept, a broadband high-gain integrated antenna featuring polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability is engineered, fabricated, and installed into an antenna measurement system for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed antenna achieves a peak gain of 23.6 dBi together with a bandwidth of 56.6% from 19 GHz to 34 GHz. Additionally, it exhibits good polarization and radiation beam reconfigurable capability, providing horizontal/vertical linear-polarization single-beam, right-/left-handed circular-polarization single-beam, and dual-linear-polarization equal/unequal-amplitude dual-beam operating capability. Furthermore, a wide beam scanning coverage of 105$^{\circ }$ in xoz-plane and 108$^{\circ }$ in yoz-plane is achieved by the presented design. The extraordinary advantages of the proposed integrated antenna such as wide bandwidth, high gain, polarization and radiation beam reconfigurability, and low cost make it suitable for various millimeter-wave vehicular communication application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Delay-sensitive services, particularly Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) services, are envisioned as one of the primary applications for 5G and forthcoming 6G networks. However, guaranteeing the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements through efficient resource allocation remains a formidable challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising solution, conventional online RL methodologies typically necessitate direct interactions with practical wireless networks during training, posing potential risks to URLLC services if suboptimal actions are taken. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel offline data-driven optimization framework for designing radio resource allocation algorithms. Inspired by the dynamic nature of the wireless network inherently captured in the historical operation data traces, our proposed framework takes advantage of offline RL to optimize resource allocation policies solely from offline datasets, thus avoiding the risks associated with online training on practical networks. Moreover, to effectively characterize dynamic fluctuations in the number of active users, our framework incorporates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the GNN-based architecture can enhance the policies&#39; scalability and generalization capabilities, enabling the learned policies to adapt to evolving network conditions. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel radio resource allocation algorithm, namely GNN-based offline RL (GNN-ORL). Extensive experimental results validate the performance of the proposed GNN-ORL algorithm. Specifically, GNN-ORL exhibits both stable convergence and excellent generalization capabilities, and outperforms baseline schemes in meeting the QoS requirements of URLLC services.},

Traditional spectrum prediction techniques predominantly employ machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) approaches. However, ML-based methods often require manual feature extraction, leading to inefficiencies, while DL-based techniques typically demand computationally intensive graphics processing units (GPUs). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight multi-dimensional spectrum prediction model based on an adaptive broad learning network (ABLN). The model utilizes a sliding window approach for preprocessing historical spectrum data and establishes an input layer containing mapped feature nodes and enhancement nodes by randomly generating weights and biases. The weight parameters of the network are determined by solving the pseudo-inverse problem, and the network structure is extended by incremental learning method without necessitating retraining, effectively reducing the model&#39;s computational complexity. Furthermore, an adaptive node increment module is employed to quickly obtain the optimal hyperparameters. Experimental results on real-world spectrum datasets demonstrate that the proposed ABLN method consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across multi-step prediction tasks. Additionally, the model exhibits robust stability and adaptability in diverse scenarios.},

In this paper, we propose an effective superimposed full pilots (SFP)-aided iterative channel estimation (SFPCE) scheme for multi-user OTFS uplink systems. First, we derive a multi-user minimum root mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation algorithm and a message passing (MP) data detection algorithm based on the proposed multi-user SFP structure. Then, a de-interference iterative detection (DIID) algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of channel estimation and symbol detection. The DIID algorithm only requires a few iterations to achieve optimal performance. Besides, a hybrid superimposed pilot (HSP) structure is introduced to estimate the delay/Doppler taps without sacrificing the SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of channel estimation and symbol detection can be significantly improved after several iterations. Moreover, the proposed SFPCE scheme is superior to the superimposed single pilot-aided channel estimation (SSIPCE) and the superimposed sparse pilot-aided channel estimation (SSPPCE) schemes in the bit error rate (BER) performance.},

To remedy the mentioned problem, this article proposes a novel localization method utilizing received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (TOA) measurements. To this end, the TOA/RSS hybrid maximum likelihood (ML) problem is cast into a probabilistic non-linear weighted least square (PNLWLS) problem, including probabilistic cost function and probabilistic constraints. Seven hypothesis tests are introduced to determine with what probability each measurement belongs to LOS (or mixed LOS/NLOS) or NLOS propagations. These probability values tightly bound the unknown NLOS error in the PNLWLS problem. The PNLWLS problem is then relaxed to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by interior point methods. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated for 5G technology using MATLAB 5G toolbox. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing hybrid methods and attains an estimation variance comparatively closer to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).},

Firstly, the PARAFAC model is constructed based on the wideband array output to suppress the noise influence. The propagation matrix, which includes DOA and time delay information, is then separated using a trilinear alternating least squares method. Subsequently, accurate DOA estimation and time delay vectors are obtained using a distributed compressed sensing approach. Finally, the multi-frequency characteristics of the wideband signal are employed to distinguish the main path of the multipath signal based on time delay differences among different paths. Both simulation and practical tests are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) systems, instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is essential for the optimization of the RIS phase shifts. However, the D-MIMO systems often involve numerous RISs and access points (APs), requiring the transmission of a significant amount of pilots for CSI estimation, thus resulting in high signaling overhead. To mitigate the high signaling overhead associated with CSI estimation, this paper introduces a location-aware communication method that only relies on large-scale fading information. Two new challenges have arisen in the proposed location-aware communication method. First, it is challenging to design a user position estimation method to achieve fast and accurate localization. Second, it is hard to handle the location uncertainty brought by the estimation error when performing beamforming. In response to the above challenges, we first design a space-time cooperative beam training-based localization method to achieve a favorable trade-off between localization accuracy and time cost. Subsequently, to handle the location uncertainty, by taking historical error distribution into consideration, we formulate a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based problem for sum-rate maximization. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed localization method, which can achieve sub-meter accuracy with low beam training overhead. Furthermore, the proposed DRO-based beamforming method can improve the sum-rate by 11.4% compared to the robust optimization and non-robust schemes.},

In this work, we focus on the joint MUS-BF design with the goal of minimizing the network experience delay. Since the objective function is long-term and non-convex, we first equate the network experience delay with the long-term average network experience delay cost, which can be optimized by reinforcement learning techniques. Then, we propose a distributed MUS-BF scheme based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to minimize the long-term average network experience delay cost, where the adaptive multi-deep Q network (DQN) architecture is designed at each base station (BS) to find suitable MUS-BF with low computational complexity. Each BS is able to train its own multi-DQN and implement appropriate MUS-BF based on the local information. Simulation results validate that the adaptive multi-DQN architecture decreases 70% computational complexity of the proposed algorithm without compromising performance compared to the non-adaptive design. Compared to existing schemes, the proposed scheme achieves superior performance with the lowest information overhead, making it a more appealing solution for real-time MUS-BF in delay-sensitive scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) represents a notable technological advancement that has gained considerable interest within the wireless communication domain. However, due to cost and privacy concerns, different operators may not make an agreement on cooperatively utilizing RISs and sharing resources. In the presence of non-cooperative base stations (BSs) from different operators, conventional resource allocation and RIS design are rendered inapplicable. Motivated by this fact, we explore the resource allocation scheme for RIS-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) systems with cooperative and non-cooperative BSs. We first delineate between the cooperation and non-cooperation modes of BSs, based on their agreement concerning the joint utilization of RISs. We then formulate the joint optimization problem of the reflection coefficients of RISs, active beamforming, power allocation, and user association at BSs. The objective is to maximize the sum rates for users served by cooperative BSs while ensuring the channel gain constraints between non-cooperative BSs and their associated users so as to mitigate the effects of RISs on the communication of non-cooperative BSs. To address the mixed binary optimization problem, we leverage the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique to decompose the original problem into several sub-problems, each iteratively optimized until convergence is achieved. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of RISs in improving sum rate performance, while also providing additional benefits by mitigating their impact on non-cooperative BSs and their associated users.},

Considering the difficulty of accurately obtaining channel state information (CSI) in dynamic vehicular network environments, we propose a joint double deep Q-network (DDQN) based centralized spectrum allocation and distributed power control algorithm for V2X communications to utilize the spectrum resource more effectively and reduce the multiple interference between V2X links. The proposed algorithm decouples the channel matching and transmission power selection to balance the resource utilization and quality of user experience satisfaction levels. In the first stage, we present a graph theory based centralized spectrum matching scheme to reduce the multiple interference between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, and improve the system capacity of vehicular networks. Secondly, through predicting the future dynamic CSI trends of terminal vehicles based on the locally obtained CSI information, we propose a distributed DDQN based power control scheme to enhance the system reliability and meet the quality of terminal user experience requirements.

  abstract     = {Sub-terahertz (THz) (100–300 GHz) has attracted huge interest in recent years as a promising candidate band for applications in the future sixth-generation wireless networks. However, when extending to higher sub-THz band, the problems of scarce measurement data and incomplete channel characteristics become increasingly evident, hindering the establishment of sub-THz communications. This paper presents the measurements of small-scale fading (SSF) channel characterization and sparsity analysis based on the vector network analyzer in typical indoor scenarios at 215–225 GHz. The directional scanning scheme is adopted to identify the multipath components (MPCs) in a three-dimensional space. The MPC-level parameters, including power, delay, azimuth and elevation angles are estimated based on the power angular delay profiles and then processed with the multipath component distance-based density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. Modeling of MPC-level and cluster-level temporal-spatial characteristics are presented. With the correlation matrix of sub-THz MPC-level SSF characteristics, the Gini index, root mean square delay spread, azimuth spread of arrival and elevation spread of arrival are firstly used to comprehensively evaluate the sparsity of the sub-THz channel. In addition, the key factors affecting sub-THz channel sparsity are explored. The numerical results indicate the strong sparsity of the channel at sub-THz band. Specifically, in empty and closed scenarios, the sparse channel characteristics are less pronounced, and there is a notable reduction in sparsity from line-of-sight (LoS) channel to non-LoS channel. The channel characterization extracted from the sub-THz channels in this paper is instrumental in the development of channel modeling, system design and performance assessment of sub-THz communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have become a revolutionary wireless channel control paradigm as a potential solution for future 6G networks. However, in many scenarios, due to the influence of “multiple-scatterer” environments, the existing RIS-assisted multi-user systems still have limitations in terms of capacity. Therefore, this paper proposes the novel concept of active RIS-assisted movable antenna systems (MAs), which can optimize channel conditions and improve communication performance by locally moving the antenna solely in the receiving area. Additionally, the optimization problem for RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, which aims to maximize the sum-rate among multiple users, also entails beamforming optimization at the base station (BS), phase shift design at the RIS, and MAs positioning. To solve this challenging and nonconvex optimization problem, in the case of a fixed MA&#39;s position, the Lagrange dual transform is used to introduce auxiliary variables to decouple the original problem into three subproblems: the optimization of auxiliary variables, the optimization of beamforming transmission on the BS, and the phase shift design of the RIS. Furthermore, to identify the optimal positions of the MAs, an adaptive fractional programming quadratic transform algorithm based on a genetic algorithm (GA) (FPQT-GA) is proposed to investigate the proposed system. The simulation results show that compared with traditional fixed antenna systems (FAs) active RIS-assisted, the employment of MAs can significantly enhance the system&#39;s overall performance in typical application scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRSs) represent a paradigm shift towards improving the optical wireless communications capabilities. The application of this developing technology in the field of underwater wireless communication (UWC) systems is a promising way to overcome the limitations associated with such challenging environments. In this research, we analyze the performance improvement provided by OIRS in the context of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC). The OIRS support multiple users by grouping and allocating different OIRS elements to different users based on their distance from the transmitter. To increase the aggregate spectral efficiency (ASE) and preserve user fairness, techniques based on equal mirror assignment (EMA) and distance-based mirror assignment (DMA) are presented. The outcomes are evaluated against conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate split multiple access (RSMA) schemes for UWOC. The performance variation of the overall system is also analyzed with respect to the ocean depth. We have also derived the analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) considering exponential and generalized gamma (EGG) turbulent model and zero bore-sight model for pointing errors. We use Monte-Carlo simulation results to validate our analytical expressions. Furthermore, an asymptotic analysis of average spectral efficiency is performed to provide a deeper understanding of the proposed system&#39;s performance at high SNR. From the results obtained, it is analyzed that proposed DMA based scheme outperforms the EMA, OMA, NOMA and RSMA even with a large number of users. Furthermore, it is shown that the system performance improves with the oceanic depth. The results of this work provide valuable insights for the design of UWOC systems in challenging underwater environments.},

Approximate closed-form expressions for users&#39; outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are respectively derived to capture the main system characteristics and the performance boundaries at high transmit power regimes, thereby providing useful insights involving the diversity order, coding gain, and ergodic slope. Several extensive simulations are presented and reveal some remarkable points: First, active RISs always bring higher EC than passive RISs and have outstanding outage performance in lower and moderate transmit power regimes. Second, active RIS-based systems can achieve a significantly improved performance by either reducing thermal noise or increasing the amplitude gain. Thirdly, the use of a large number of passive RIS elements yields a significant OP improvement when compared to active RIS design. Finally, increasing the number of antennas can achieve the users&#39; OP and EC enhancement for both active and passive RIS-based systems.},

  abstract     = {The integration of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology with the dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) system is pivotal for enhancing the capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, conventional MIMO-DFRC designs lack support for simultaneous multi-user communication in the same direction, limiting their utility in IoV applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel robust transmit beamforming approach for the MIMO-DFRC system, facilitating multi-user communication through beampattern modulation. Initially, the orthogonal Oppermann sequences are allocated to each user. Subsequently, these sequences are embedded into sub-beampatterns, which encode communication symbols for multi-user information transmission. Furthermore, the encoded information is strategically placed within the sidelobes of the transmit beampattern, aiming to minimize the integrated sidelobe levels. This goal serves as the objective function while maintaining mainlobe detection performance, which imposes a constraint, forming an optimization model for transmit beamforming. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization model, it is decomposed using a coordinate rotation strategy and addressed iteratively via a convex optimization algorithm. Simulations validate that our method facilitates reliable unidirectional communication among multiple users and preserves the integrity of radar detection performance, contributing to the IoV application of the DFRC technology.},

  abstract     = {Full duplex (FD) is an auspicious wireless technology that holds the potential to double data rates through simultaneous transmission and reception. This paper proposes two innovative designs of hybrid beamforming (HYBF) for a multicell massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) FD system. Initially, we introduce a novel centralized HYBF (C-HYBF) scheme, which employs the minorization-maximization (MM) method. However, while centralized beamforming designs offer superior performance, they suffer from high computational complexity, substantial communication overhead, and demand expensive computational resources. To surmount these challenges, we present a framework that facilitates per-link parallel and distributed HYBF (P&amp;D-HYBF) in the mmWave frequency band. This cooperative approach enables each base station (BS) to independently solve its local, low-complexity sub-problems in parallel for each user, resulting in a substantial reduction in communication overhead and computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that P&amp; D-HYBF achieves comparable performance to C-HYBF, and with only a few radio-frequency (RF) chains, both designs surpass the capabilities of fully digital half duplex (HD) systems.},

  abstract     = {In the contemporary era of large-scale Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with intelligent connectivity, efficient dissemination of traffic information is essential for monitoring and analyzing traffic conditions as well as deploying timely emergency rescue. However, in the face of limited wireless communication resources and diverse services, ensuring effective transmission and on-demand dissemination of traffic information has become increasingly urgent. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel targeted dissemination strategy driven by integrated sensing, communication and computing (ISCC-TDS), which endows traffic information dissemination with the capability of service awareness and on-demand scheduling. This paper initially establishes the targeted dissemination matrix, which incorporates the sensing of traffic flow and service arrival distribution. Furthermore, the service coexistence mechanism oriented towards communication modeling is designed to maximize the data transmission rate of regular services while ensuring the reliable transmission of emergency services. Additionally, this paper employs an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm for computing integration. Simulation results show that the ISCC-TDS can achieve the lowest travel cost in the case of heavy traffic and severe congestion, and there is less than 5% transmission loss for regular services even with the dense arrival of emergency services.zhong},

  abstract     = {The next-generation Internet of Vehicle (IoV) with V2X as the core is the foundation for safe and reliable autonomous driving. As one of the crucial components of V2X, V2I requires roadside units (RSUs) to be equipped with both sensing and communication capabilities. For this reason, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered a promising technology that will be applied in RSUs. However, when vehicle users (VUs) move to the edge of RSU coverage, ISAC beams from different RSUs may collide and cause inter-region interference. We propose an ISAC-based beam tracking scheme for the multi-RSU V2I scenario based on coordinated multi-point (CoMP) to address this issue. The beam tracking scheme can be divided into two parts. The first part is the beam tracking approach including the method of predicting and estimating state parameters based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the method of managing VU sets based on predicted state parameters. The second part is the multi-RSU joint resource allocation against inter-region interference based on predicted VU sets to improve the tracking accuracy of VUs. Specifically, an optimization problem to minimize the sum of the posterior Crámer-Rao bound (PCRB) of all VUs is considered. By employing the alternative optimization (AO) algorithm, appropriate wireless resources can be allocated to different VUs, and then a bandwidth index method based on predicted state parameters to avoid spectral conflicts is designed. Finally, we analyze the performance of various schemes through numerical simulations. Our proposed scheme using UKF based on CoMP is outstanding in improving SINR for VUs while maintaining high tracking accuracy compared with other schemes.},

It provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output (MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.},

Motivated by this, we first establish multiple access interference (MAI) for satellite communication. Since the satellite channel is mainly a direct path, and the Nakagami-$m$ distribution fits more experimental data with different $m$, we assume the Nakagami-$m$ distribution as the fading model for the downlink satellite communication system. Furthermore, we derive an exact expression of the system bit-error rate (BER). Then, we optimize the information rate by setting the appropriate number of access users according to BER. Finally, simulations validate the analytical results.

Specifically, these two users are both legitimate users and mutual eavesdroppers. In this system, we investigate the achievable rate for these two users under three typical STAR-RIS protocols, i.e., energy splitting (ES), time splitting (TS) and mode switching (MS). Based on that, a series of weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) maximization problems subject to the constraints of BS transmit power and the transmitting and reflecting coefficients (TRCs) of STAR-RIS are formulated, which consider to jointly optimize the active and passive beamforming vectors at the BS and STAR-RIS, respectively. Due to the non-convexity of these problems and the coupled decision variables, the path-following method is applied to approximate the non-convex objective function and then, the alternating optimization (AO) method is utilized to decouple the decision variables. After that, relaxation and penalty convex concave procedure (PCCP) are adopted to solve the decomposed subproblems. In further, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence of the proposed AO-based algorithms. In the end, some numerical simulations have been done to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the ES protocol always obtains the best performances, followed by the MS protocol, and the TS protocol obtains the worst performance.},

The feasibility of traditional leakage minimization (LM) based IA is analyzed. We show that there exist two drawbacks which are not discussed in traditional LM based IA: 1) the necessary condition for the feasibility of IA is loose, and 2) the secret signal cancellation may occur at the desired receiver, which makes secure transmission infeasible. We analyze the reason and establish a condition under which either the secret signal cancellation is inevitable or IA is infeasible. Then a modified IA is proposed. Compared with the traditional LM based IA, a tighter necessary condition is established and the secret signal is protected against cancellation. Moreover, we prove that the proposed condition guarantees the properness of system, which is a rigorous characterization of necessary conditions for achieving IA. Under assumption that the modified IA is feasible, we provide a secrecy enhancing design to maximize the secrecy rate. subject to a secrecy outage constraint. We also establish a condition under which a positive secrecy rate is feasible. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems. Deep learning AMR strategies have achieved tremendous success in recent years. Modulated signals exhibit long temporal dependencies, and extracting global features is crucial in identifying modulation schemes. Traditionally, human experts analyze patterns in constellation diagrams to classify modulation schemes. Classical convolutional-based networks, due to their limited receptive fields, excel at extracting local features but struggle to capture global relationships. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hybrid deep framework named TLDNN, which incorporates the architectures of the transformer and long short-term memory (LSTM). We utilize the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to model the global correlations in signal sequences while employing LSTM to enhance the capture of temporal dependencies. To mitigate the impact like RF fingerprint features and channel characteristics on model generalization, we propose data augmentation strategies known as segment substitution (SS) to enhance the model&#39;s robustness to modulation-related features. Experimental results on widely-used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits significant advantages in terms of complexity. Our framework serves as a foundational backbone that can be extended to different datasets and applied to both mobile and static scenarios. We have verified the effectiveness of our augmentation approach in enhancing the generalization, particularly in few-shot scenarios.},

In this system, orthogonal reference signals are generated using Gram-Schmidt algorithm, and reference index modulation is performed in each time slot of each subcarrier by discarding a chosen reference signal. Additionally, the selected Walsh code in active subcarriers is used to perform the Kronecker product with the reference signal to achieve higher data rates. Furthermore, at the receiver, an efficient joint carrier-code index detection algorithm is proposed, and noise reduction processing is employed to improve the system&#39;s bit error rate (BER) performance. The theoretical BER expressions of the HCCRIM-TF-DCSK system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Furthermore, this paper provides an analysis of the system&#39;s data rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and complexity compared to those of advanced competitors.

However, most existing literature does not tailor information forecast algorithm to the MEC context, which diminishes the utility of the forecast information.

Then, the performance in terms of delay and power consumption is analyzed in closed-form, based on which critical insight towards the requirements on forecast algorithm is obtained. Next, based on Sparse Gaussian Process and Linear Model of Coregionalization (SGP-LMC), we propose a channel forecast algorithm to find a desired trade-off between forecast accuracy and model complexity in terms of maximizing the utility of forecast information.

  abstract     = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) is one of the key enabling technologies for massive machine type communications (mMTC). While CFmMIMO can achieve a macro diversity gain in mMTC, its fronthaul link capacity severely limits system performance. To balance fronthaul overhead and detection/estimation performance, in this paper we investigate joint user activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) and develop a framework for uplink grant-free CFmMIMO systems based on mixed-quantization fronthaul compression. First, we model the JADCE problem as a mixed-quantization compressing sensing problem, making use of sporadic transmission nature of devices in mMTC. A multiple measurement vector (MMV) generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of activity detection and channel estimation. Unknown priori parameters of the GAMP algorithm can be estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm. In addition, we design a threshold detection rule at central processing unit (CPU) side and derive a lower bound of active user detection performance in a centralized CFmMIMO system. Numerical results reveal that the proposed mixed-quantization scheme can strike a good balance between fronthaul overhead and detection/estimation performance, verifying that a CFmMIMO with mixed-quantization scheme can perform well in activity detection and channel estimation by selecting an appropriate number of quantization bits.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) are two critical services in vehicular networks. However, the presence of both services creates a difficult resource allocation problem due to their heterogeneous requirements. To address the challenge of simultaneously providing eMBB and URLLC services in vehicular networks, we propose a resource allocation approach that maximizes eMBB rate while ensuring that both URLLC latency and reliability requirements are satisfied. Our approach utilizes non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology, where the resource for eMBB services is allocated by slot and the traffic of URLLC service is accommodated using mini-slots. To solve this dual time-scale problem, we employ a dual decomposition and sub-gradient method to solve the power allocation and resource block assignment of eMBB services, while the Vogel&#39;s approximation method (VAM) and modified distribution method (MODI) are proposed to solve the URLLC resource allocation problem. Additionally, we present two low-complexity heuristic algorithms for the URLLC sub-problem. Simulation results indicate that our proposed approach surpasses baseline methods in terms of both eMBB rate and fairness.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an energy management system (EMS) applied to a series hybrid vehicle (SHV) powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE) and a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of chemical batteries and supercapacitors. The EMS enables power sharing among the ICE and the HESS under a fully active topology to improve control flexibility, considering that the ICE-generator set and HESS efficiencies are limited to a specific power injection operating range and transient responses. In this context, power sharing is performed using S-shaped functions that focus on maximizing supercapacitor usability to reduce fuel consumption and battery current stress. The advantage of the S-shaped function lies on its easy configuration and reduced number of control parameters. Additionally, meta-heuristic optimization is used to tune the S-shaped functions according to the sources requirements for optimal performance in standard driving cycles, while Lyapunov’s indirect method performs the stability analysis of the control strategy. Finally, experimental and computational simulations are accomplished to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared with traditional methods and an optimal approach.},

In this method, five topologies are considered, including three kinds of speed coupling topologies, one kind of torque coupling topology, and one kind of topology with variable coupling. The dynamic model and efficiency model of each topology are established. The proposed integration optimization method includes a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. DP takes energy loss as the objective function to optimize the control strategy of the operation process. PSO takes the linear superposition value of energy loss and motor power level as the objective function to optimize design parameters. The optimization results of five topologies are compared to get the optimal topology. The results of integrated optimization experiments show that the speed coupling - double brake topology is the optimal topology. Compared with the prototype, the energy loss is reduced by 10.37% and the system production cost has been well controlled. The comparison experiments further validate the superiority of utilizing PSO as the upper layer algorithm compared to other comparative algorithms.},

In order to solve this issue and improve the angle tracking accuracy under unknown disturbances, an anti-disturbance sliding mode control (ADSMC) method is designed and applied to SBW system. Firstly, the mathematical model with reflecting unknown disturbances of SBW system is established. Secondly, a new sliding mode reaching law with parameter adjustment function is proposed, which can dynamically adjust the reaching speed of system state according to the distance from sliding mode surface. Thirdly, an extended state observer with hyperbolic tangent function is designed to prevent the observation peak, and an adaptive law with mapping method is constructed to limit excessive disturbance compensation, which can estimate and compensate unknown disturbances effectually. Finally, the ADSMC method is applied to SBW system, and the effectiveness of ADSMC method is verified by simulation and test. Test results show that, compared with traditional sliding mode control, the ADSMC method can improve the tracking accuracy of steering angle command for SBW system (the average response error is reduced by 73.94%) in typical circular road.},

A unitary parallel factor (PARAFAC) algorithm is proposed to achieve super-resolution estimate and outstanding performance, using forward-backward averaging scheme. The forward-backward averaging scheme is adopted to construct real-valued tensor signal model instead of the complex-valued one, yielding the better accuracy at modest complexity. The proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm is performed by decomposing the real-valued tensor without signal subspace estimate. Due to the inherent smoothing processing of the proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm, it can effectively deal with high correlated target. Additionally, the proposed unitary PARAFAC algorithm can automatically obtain pair parameters including range and velocity of the same target without additional pair-matching operation. More importantly the regularized alternative least squares (RALS) algorithm is used to improve the decomposition performance of the real-valued tensor while maintaining iteration stability. The numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superior performance, especially for high correlated and closely spaced targets in low-SNR scenario.},

  abstract     = {Controller design and tuning are crucial to the driving performance of autonomous vehicles. Typically, engineers define a control structure in advance and then tune its parameters in a real-world driving scenario through trial-and-error method. This method is undoubtedly time and resource consuming, and dis-courages the exploration of different control structures. In this paper, we present an improved learning-based controller tuning approach and achieve the rapid tuning of a trajectory tracking controller for a real vehicle. The proposed approach employs the framework of model-based reinforcement learning, in which a probabilistic dynamics model is first learned from the real data and then the controller parameters are updated based on the learned model. To facilitate real-world applications, the aleatoric uncertainties of the real vehicle and the measurement system are distinguished and separated during the learning of probabilistic model. Additionally, the original state propagation framework is extended by incorporating steering response model and prepro-cessed Gaussian noise. Simulation and experimental results show that controllers can be well tuned within 3 trials by our approach and the comprehensive tracking performance (i.e., cumulative cost) can be improved by up to 76% compared with the initial controller parameters. More importantly, the tuned controllers maintain high tracking accuracy in untrained driving scenarios. We believe that this approach will help to accelerate the controller design and tuning of autonomous vehicles.},

However, complicated intersection conditions and several safety problems challenge the optimal cooperative driving of CAVs. This paper proposes a bilevel coordination framework for CAVs at unsignalized intersections to improve efficiency and robustness while guaranteeing safety. The upper level focuses on a conflict-free and real-time scheduling problem for optimal passing order, and the results are transmitted to each CAV in the lower level for distributed control. To guarantee safety, we first project the conflicting vehicles on virtual lanes based on the conflict zones inside the intersection. Furthermore, the scheduling problem is transformed into a packing problem and formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for higher traffic efficiency. We propose three practical principles to obtain the real-time solutions by removing several redundant constraints in the optimization problem. Eventually, considering the inevitable bounded disturbances (e.g., unmodeled dynamics and equipment measurement errors), a distributed robust model predictive controller is designed to form and keep the desired virtual platoons under uncertainty. Numerical simulations validate that the proposed method saves 4.2%-6.6% total evacuation time under heavy traffic volume.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is crucial for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles. However, current methods based on neural networks still have room for improvement by further reducing their long-term error. This challenge stems from extracting temporal feature dependencies and mining spatial interactions in lane change scenarios. Previous research has not adequately established the connection between the past and the future features. To this end, we propose a spatial-temporal multi-feature fusion and intention-enlightened decoding (STMF-IE) model that jointly considers all these aspects. Initially, STMF-IE uses multi-head temporal self-attention to establish temporal dependencies that make explicit the extent of information usage at different time steps. The interplay between the neighboring vehicles and the target vehicle is quantitatively depicted through a devised multi-head spatial cross-attention mechanism. Furthermore, a multi-feature fusion module is proposed such that the extracted temporal dependence and spatial interaction features are integrated to reduce the superfluous features. Additionally, a novel mask matrix and an intention-enlightened decoding module are developed to refine the prediction performance in different lane change scenarios. Experimental results show that STMF-IE outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long-term prediction on NGSIM and highD datasets. We improve the RMSE metric by 13%–36% at a prediction horizon of 3$\sim$5 s. We also analyze the spatial-temporal feature correlation through visual results, promoting more interpretation.},

To well enhance the tradeoff between control performance and communication constraint, a prescribed specification is established via a boundary function, thereby precisely specifying the transient and steady-state performances of synchronized errors.

  abstract     = {Rear-end collision where a human-driven vehicle (HV) hits an autonomous vehicle (AV) from behind (called HV-AV collision) represents a critical scenario in the context of mixed traffic including both AVs and HVs. In the present paper, the Human-like Brake Initiation and Modulation (HLBIM) model is first proposed to emulate the driver brake control, and further employed to investigate HV-AV collision risk in the Stop-in-Lane (SiL) scenario where an HV follows an AV. The HLBIM model combines human driving intention, vision-based expectancy and certain inherent characteristics of human driving based on a novel dynamic accumulation of braking-needed evidence. Especially, the HLBIM model incorporates a high-level expectancy derived from practical driving expertise to ensure precise timing for braking initiation. Furthermore, the combined distribution of Off-Road-Glance and Time-Headway is originally proposed and integrated into the HLBIM model, to emulate drivers&#39; diverted attention during their driving activities. Our approach addresses a main issue, which is often neglected in the existing studies on HV-AV collision, which corresponds to the coupling effect of human driving intention, vision-based expectancy and inherent characteristic of human driving on HV-AV collision risk. Moreover, we analyze HV-AV collision risk in two specified SiL cases, which has rarely been investigated in existing related studies. The model performance comparison shows that our HLBIM model outperforms the referred models. Furthermore, the case study comprehensively reveals how the HV-AV collision probability changes with respect to various collision speeds, initial speeds, decelerations of cars under test, percentages of overlap detection of the AV in front, and lane change durations. The HLBIM model can be used to simulate driver-in-the-loop car-following experiment. Moreover, it can be fitted in automatic braking systems within AVs to achieve human-like braking.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that classical direction of arrival (DOA) estimation methods work well in the case of large samples. However, these methods may be theoretically invalid in the case of small samples, which frequently occur in large array systems. Such a large array has two effects: i) The number of samples is relatively quite small, and ii) the dimension of samples is very large. To handle the above problems, a more appropriate method for solving DOA estimators in the case of high-dimensional and small samples is proposed in this paper. First, considering the special structure of received samples, an alternative well-estimated second-order statistic, known as the Gram matrix, is originally constructed to better utilize the spatial and statistical information of signals and noise contained by small samples. Second, two novel methods for estimating the number of targets are derived by combining the Gram matrix and information-theoretic criteria. Third, a novel object function and the corresponding algorithm based on the Gram matrix are designed to estimate the signal subspace more efficiently, and then the DOAs of targets are obtained by multiple signal classification methods. In particular, the theoretical analysis indicates that the improved signal subspace estimation algorithm only needs to decompose the low-dimensional Gram matrix instead of the high-dimensional sample covariance matrix. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the high accuracy and lower computational complexity of the proposed methods in the case of high-dimensional and small samples.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rising number of Electric Vehicles (EV), the subsequent increase in demand for charging, as well as the long charging time, will make it difficult for drivers to charge their vehicles. Current charging service platforms inform their customers of the charging station information for the network to which they belong. However, they do not ensure the reliability and credibility of information and do not share the charging information of other charging stations. To address this issue, a model in which CSs collaborate for information sharing and charging must be developed. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based integrated charging platform for charging cooperation. Verifier groups for each CS verify the reliability of shared information. We applied the concept of Mobile Charging Stations (MCSs) to help busy CSs, reducing EV charging latency. We also designed a contribution-based incentive distribution process to elicit active CSs&#39; cooperation. We performed a charging scenario simulation and blockchain implementation to demonstrate the proposed model&#39;s efficacy. The simulation results showed that the proposed charging scenario with MCS application showed a 46.9 % reduction in waiting time. Also, when the number of verifier members equals the global average of EVs per charging spot, the verification time is approximately 547 ms, demonstrating that the proposed model is effective.},

Firstly, an image enhancement algorithm for SLAM is proposed to enhance low-light images of subterranean environments in real time. Secondly, line features, represented by utilizing Plücker coordinates and standard orthogonal, are added on the basis of existing point features. To reduce the computational burden and maintain real-time performance, an improved line feature matching and screening strategy is proposed by using the line feature geometric feature filter.

  abstract     = {The Virtually Coupled Train Set (VCTS) is a promising framework to improve the efficiency of urban rail transits (URTs), addressing challenges introduced by time-varying and location-varying passenger flow. However, traditional train control models, relying on liner approximation methods to fit nonlinear dynamic models, cannot meet the safety-critical and latency-sensitive task requirements of VCTS systems. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based control models are promising, substantial training data and computational resources is challenging in URTs. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel digital twin (DT) driven VCTS framework and an iterative-based control policy learning approach. In the designed DT-driven VCTS system, we collect essential training data from the physical domain, representing the real-world environment. We employ model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to learn the dynamic train model and optimize the train control policy in the digital domain, a simulated environment mirroring the physical domain. This approach uniquely leverages model predictions for policy optimization during the training process, adapting to a broad range of scenarios beyond reliance on actual operational data. Furthermore, by employing an iterative learning approach and integrating the physical and digital domains, the train control model and policy can be updated to effectively handle uncertainties and complexities encountered in real-world situations. Extensive experiments validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating its robust performance and adaptability across diverse conditions.},

In this paper, an obstacle avoidance and path point tracking control frame for ASVs is proposed. The frame includes two parts. One is the decision-making module, in which the desired sailing speed and course angular velocity are generated. More specifically, through adopting the velocity obstacle approach (VOA), the feasible obstacle avoidance action set is obtained. Then, considering the maneuvering characteristics of ASVs, the discrete optional obstacle avoidance actions are obtained by using the dynamic window approach (DWA). Finally, by introducing the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), the obstacle avoidance actions that meet the rules can be screened out. An evaluation function is designed to select the final practical obstacle avoidance action. The second part is the dynamic controller module. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network-based path point tracking controller design is given in this part. The RBF neural network is designed to estimate the unknown model nonlinearity, and the stability of the closed-loop system is proved.

It is worthwhile to note that more and more vehicles are equipped with automotive radars, resulting in mutual interference between radars. Interference degrades radar target detection performance and makes sensed information unreliable, so interference suppression is necessary. In this paper, a novel method based on power-weighted Hough transform is proposed for mitigating the radar mutual interference and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems. Firstly, the frequency modulation characteristics of interference signals and target echo signals are analyzed, and differences between the two signals are presented. Secondly, based on the straight line detection technique, the interference power in the time-frequency domain is accumulated, and the interference is accurately detected and localized. Finally, the target echo is recovered by an autoregressive model. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has the ability to retain more useful signals after interference mitigation, and achieve better interference detection robustness under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Simulation experiments and real scenario experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its superiority.},

The state-of-the-art methods mainly extend the classic next-best-view (NBV) framework with the semantic information to concentrate on the reconstruction target. However, the greedy decision of the next viewpoint or branch without global consideration leads to the low efficiency. This paper proposes a novel semantic-driven aerial reconstruction planner, which integrates the task relevance into the planning, making the concentrative reconstruction more efficient. Specifically, a new surface-frontier information structure is extended to maintain the rich semantic information for the fine-grained planning. Driven by an attention-based frontier filter, a novel relevance-aware frontier sequence generation method is proposed to achieve the concentrative reconstruction of the target. Then a semantic-informed local refinement, which incorporates the semantic gain into the graph search, is proposed to further reduce the flight cost and improve the reconstruction quality. Comparative experiments are conducted in simulation environments, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the reconstruction efficiency and quality.},

  abstract     = {Urban autonomous driving decision-making poses a significant challenge, particularly when navigating unsignalized intersections. This complexity mainly stems from the stochastic interactions between various traffic participants. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making has shown promise, there are valid concerns regarding safety and adaptability. In particular, current RL-based models lack safeguards to prevent issuing potentially unsafe commands in unfamiliar scenarios that are not covered during training. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a safe decision-making framework to improve driving safety at unsignalized intersections. First, the RL-based policy is constructed based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) that maps environmental observations into actions directly. Subsequently, the reliability of the SAC policy is measured at run-time via epistemic uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the risky actions of the RL policy are filtered based on the estimated reliability with integrating a risk-adaptive model predictive control (RAMPC) backup policy. Finally, an unsignalized intersection with occlusion is built via Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). More importantly, several cases are carried out to simulate scenario data distribution shifts, i.e., traffic flow density variation, observation with sensor noise, and observation range decrease, which are not included in the RL policy training process. The results suggest that the proposed method can reduce risk and enhance the safety of autonomous driving at unsignalized intersections.},

Considering that existing research mainly focuses on the calibration of single antenna GNSS/IMU and odometry, and frequently neglects the time-delay between sensors, so in order to make up for the gap in the calibration of dual-antenna GNSS and odometry, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal calibration method based on Kalman filter. The method comprehensively considers motion constraints among multiple vectors during vehicle movement and the time-delay between sensors, employs the feedback correction strategy of indirect filtering to solve the challenge of estimating large installation misalignment angle, and realizes joint estimation of time-delay and spatial extrinsic parameters. The results of simulation and field tests show that the proposed method can accurately achieve the spatiotemporal calibration and has significant advantages over existing methods. The time-delay estimation accuracy is smaller than the minimum data output interval, and the estimation errors of rotation and translation extrinsic parameters are about 0.1° and 0.01 m, respectively.},

Our research pioneers the use of the Age of Information (AoI) to measure task scheduling performance within ADS. With theoretical analysis, we disclose that optimizing AoI simultaneously minimizes response time and maximizes throughput. We then offer a formal definition of the AoI-centric task scheduling problem. Given the NP-hardness of this problem, we design a 4-approximation algorithm. To enhance the practicality of our solutions, we propose an extended formulation optimizing AoI-centric scheduling over a specified cycle and correspondingly develop a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental simulations, benchmarked against the Apollo driving system, demonstrate that our AoI-optimized task scheduling outperforms Apollo&#39;s scheduling mechanisms in terms of AoI, throughput, and worst-case response time.

This task is challenging due to the inherent nonlinear characteristics in traffic evolution. The popular deep learning-based traffic prediction methods lack the in-depth exploration of traffic evolution features. In this work, we propose a novel three-channel Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) framework incorporating temporal complex network feature information for airport delay prediction. The complex network feature sequence of the temporal networks can effectively capture the nonlinear dynamic behavior of airport delays. Firstly, we divide the original time series of airport delays into three distinct series (current, daily, and weekly) and feed them into three channels of our model. This operation allows the model to effectively capture the inherent characteristics of local proximity and global periodicity in airport delay time series. Secondly, the complex networks are converted from airport delay time series using complex network theory, and the topological features of networks are combined with three-chamel TCN, to improve the ability of learning short-term nonlinearity of airport delay evolution. Finally, we incorporate weather condition and flight schedule information as external features to further enhance the prediction accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on a flight dataset at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring accurate and efficient perception and motion planning is critical for the safety of autonomous vehicles. Addressing these pivotal challenges, this paper introduces a novel motion planning method employing a Lidar point cloud-based potential field (PF). Our approach innovatively extracts the drivable area boundary from point cloud, enhancing computational efficiency and reducing common perception errors, such as missed detections and inaccurate obstacle shape estimation. Built upon this drivable area boundary, the PF effectively represents the cost of traversing diverse areas. The PF is integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to generate control commands considering vehicle dynamics, constraints, collision avoidance, and passenger comfort. Given the highly nonlinear nature of simultaneous longitudinal and lateral motion planning, an efficient Frenet frame-based trajectory sampling method is developed to provide an initial guess of the optimal trajectory for this complex motion planning task. The perception module has been validated in real bus tests, confirming its reliability and efficiency, and the entire motion planning methodology has been rigorously tested through simulations. These simulations show that our method efficiently generates smooth and safe control commands, even in challenging scenarios where the obstacle vehicle suddenly changes its lane, and remains robust under considerable state observation noise.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in urban traffic congestion, the problem of identifying vulnerable areas of road networks has attracted wide attention. Existing studies have mainly used mediated centrality methods or algorithms based on link analysis to find critical and vulnerable nodes in road network systems through network centrality methods. However, the experimental results of the mediated centrality approach under large-scale road network datasets have a certain degree of randomness, while the link analysis algorithms ignore the structure and interrelationships among nodes. For this reason, this paper proposes a new method to quickly identify vulnerable areas of road networks based on interflow degree and spatial density clustering. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a clustering-based road network density-related area vulnerability indicator $AVI$ aimed at assessing the level of area vulnerability. The indicator focuses on the relationship between the road network structure and nodes, avoiding randomness by considering all intersection nodes. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed method demonstrates excellent global stability and achieves a significantly lower time complexity of $O(n^{2})$ compared to the traditional Betweenness Centrality method, which has a time complexity of $O(n^{5})$. Through experimental validation of data from Beijing, London, New York, and Tokyo, the results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and reliability in identifying vulnerable areas of the road network with acceptable time complexity.},

While data-driven methodologies, including recent advancements such as transformers and graph neural networks, have made significant progress, managing multimodality, achieving scene conformability, and providing human-like decision-making in future steps of the autonomy stack remains challenging. Unlike existing data-driven motion forecasting approaches that do not explicitly consider human-like motion planning, this work proposes learning from human (expert) behavior based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). We design a novel Hierarchical Transformer-based Motion Forecasting framework, called HTMF, that learns the multimodal future motion distribution using maximum entropy IRL and leverages transformer-based learned occupancy grid maps as a context-aware approximation to the true distribution, enabling the generation of realistic motions. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets across diverse challenging scenarios such as highways and unsignalized intersections. The results demonstrate that HTMF outperforms other benchmark motion forecasting methods in terms of prediction errors and in generating more plausible and human-like trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Path tracking control is a crucial function in an autonomous vehicle. Previous studies have presented conventional model-based controllers, which lack generalization ability, especially in dealing with high-curvature cases. In contrast to those model-based controllers, data-driven controllers, represented by reinforcement learning (RL), are promising to improve tracking control accuracy and generalization by online learning. However, the inherent inexplicability of RL degrades the stability of an RL-based controller, further limiting its applications in real-world autonomous driving cases. To resolve this issue, this study proposes an adaptive tracking controller based on RL, allowing to enhance network stability through a preview model and adaptive correction. It is composed of three modules, namely a lateral controller, a lateral adaptive corrector, and a longitudinal speed planner. Specifically, the preview control theory is combined with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method to improve the tracking convergence of the lateral controller; the adaptive corrector derives correction compensations based on predicted waypoints along a path, thus enhancing control accuracy; the longitudinal planner outputs a speed profile via a reward increment soft actor-critic algorithm, through which large lateral tracking errors are reduced. Using an intelligent vehicle with sufficient steering capability, simulations and real-world tests show that curvy paths with a curvature larger than 2.0 m−1 can be closely tracked within an error bound of 0.1 m.},

To this end, this study proposes a methodology that integrates a diverse array of sensory inputs, including pose data, images, and point clouds, to enhance UGVs&#39; situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. Central to our innovation is the development of a multi-modal reinforcement learning framework, which enhances UGVs&#39; perceptual and decision-making ability. This framework incorporates a lattice-based motion planning algorithm, meticulously calibrated to optimize action selection while respecting UGVs&#39; kinematic constraints. Additionally, a novel dual-training paradigm is introduced, combining curriculum learning and modal separation techniques to address the complexities of multi-modal learning. A notable contribution is the strategic integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms, which mitigate information decay and preserve essential navigational strategies over extended periods.

These challenges arise from a “task-unaware” conventional tracking methodology that treats bounding box regression and classification as indistinct tasks, neglecting their differing feature requirements. This paper introduces a “task-aware” tracking methodology, addressing these issues by discriminating between the two subtasks and assigning them their optimal feature representations. The methodology includes a “task-aware” encoder, a “task-aware” decoder, and a mutual-self training strategy. The encoder provides tailored feature representations for each subtask, while the decoder employs distinct structures to leverage these task-specific features. The mutual-self training strategy further enhances performance by fostering synergy between the subtasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. It outperforms the SOTA drone tracker by 2.3% and 3.8% across six drone tracking datasets and surpasses its baseline by 12% and 9% on average. Additionally, tests on conventional tracking datasets show the method&#39;s robustness, matching SOTA conventional trackers while improving the baseline by 28% and 13.5% across two metrics. This innovative method bridges the gap between task-specific needs and feature usage, advancing drone tracking performance. Codes and results will be publicly available.},

However, the “waist-shaped client-channel-cloud” architecture of maritime communication network greatly limits the implementation of hierarchical federated edge learning. Considering the aforementioned limitations, a hierarchical federated data distillation method based on UAV-assisted MEC systems is proposed, called Data Augmentation Distilled Federated Learning (DADFL). Specifically, DADFL reduce the communication process between clients and edge servers to just one round. Each client extracts their private dataset, sends synthesized data to the server, and collectively trains a global model. Building upon this, we propose a Global Optimal Iterative Search Algorithm (GOISA) considering client heterogeneity and resource constraints. GOISA minimizes overall latency by optimizing client heterogeneity, bandwidth allocation, and UAV transmission rates. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed system achieves performance comparable to or even better than traditional federated learning, while reducing communication overhead by three orders of magnitude, greatly improving communication efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The swift and accurate detection of traffic signs in traffic scenes is a pivotal aspect of environmental perception technology in autonomous driving systems. Traffic signs provide essential road information and regulatory instructions, which are critical to ensuring road safety. This paper presents the HCLT-YOLO model to address the challenges of false alarms and missed detections in complex traffic environments. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-transformer network architecture that efficiently integrates both local and global features, thereby improving traffic sign feature representation. To further enhance the modelâs sensitivity to small traffic signs, we optimize the structure by introducing a dedicated small-object detection layer through upsampling and by leveraging SIoU to improve detection accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the addition of the small object detection layer and the Transformer module increases the overall computational complexity and parameter count, potentially affecting real-time performance. To address this issue, we introduce the DG-C2f module, which employs linear transformations for feature mapping, streamlining the convolution process and enhancing real-time feasibility. Experimental evaluations on the GTSDB and TT100K datasets demonstrate that the proposed model improves detection accuracy by 2.5$\%$ and 6.8$\%$, respectively, compared to YOLOv8s models. Notably, the detection accuracy for small traffic signs improved significantly, by 6.9$\%$ and 11.7$\%$, respectively. Additionally, processor-in-the-loop experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin show that the model achieves an inference speed of 46 FPS, meeting the real-time requirements for in-vehicle applications.},

A methodology based on studies from various procedures, both from research and the industrial sector (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) &amp; Tier1), is employed. A Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was employed to guide the experimental procedures, enabling the precise determination of critical parameters, magnitudes, and their interrelationships. Most studies on characterization focus on a single aspect, idealizing or simplifying other influences and nonlinearities, which limits the analysis and does not include the complete drivetrain. An analysis of Field Oriented Control (FOC) and its performance was conducted. This included experimentally quantification of factors such as losses, inertias, phase resistances, temperatures, back electromotive force (BEMF), nominal and peak torque and power, efficiencies, inductances and magnetic flux. Correlations were established through equations or Look Up Tables (LUT), to capture the nonlinearities, determining their effects on other variables. A numerical model of the powertrain was generated and validated in AVL CRUISETM M. The prediction error for torque and power of the model is less than 3%, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the phase (id) and quadrature (iq) currents are less than 4.74% and 2.51%, respectively. The model reduces the need for experimental testing in the development of electric powertrains. The experimental procedure described in this work enables a comprehensive characterization of the drivetrain, specifically addressing the nonlinearities and associated effects such as magnetic circuit saturation, inductance variation, and temperature impact, thereby providing a more accurate representation of the SPMSM motor&#39;s behavior.},

As the number of vehicles and their interactions increase, there is a heightened need for prompt and precise risk evaluation. Traditional collision warning systems, which rely on conflict points, are limited to specific traffic scenarios and are inadequate for the dynamic demands of complex and diverse traffic environments. Additionally, current field-based risk assessment methods evaluate collision risks based only on instantaneous vehicle motion states, lacking in both timeliness and accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a novel risk assessment method. It involves constructing a vehicle-road cooperative environment using a distributed digital twins system and employs a multi-agent multi-modal trajectory prediction algorithm to forecast future vehicle motion states. By leveraging predictive multi-dimensional kinematic features, the proposed method dynamically generates future driving risk fields, effectively assesses collision risks in complex traffic scenarios by modeling multi-source collision risks within future traffic scenes. Extensive simulation results and analyses reveal that DPDRF significantly improves the average Pre-Collision Warning Time (PCWT) by 2.53 times compared to DDRPF and by 1.81 times compared to DSF. Furthermore, DPDRF reduces the average Pre-Collision Warning Error (PCWE) by 79% relative to PRF.},

Among them, the rate matching and interleaving hardware module occupies a significant portion of power consumption in the baseband chip, so it is of great significance to design a low power rate matching and interleaving hardware. The interleavers used in 4G LTE and 5G NR/ 6G have not been merged into a single architecture. It is possible to use the same hardware for different communication standards to reduce hardware resources and power consumption. This paper studies the rate matching and block interleaving of turbo codes, convolutional codes, polar codes, and LDPC codes used in 4G LTE and 5G NR/ 6G communication links. With regard to the different algorithms for these four types of encoding, the sharing design is carried out on the hardware structure. In this experiment, according to the proposed storage and interleaving sharing scheme for hardware design and hardware implementation, the memory area of 0.1 μm2 and power consumption overhead of 4.33 mW are obtained based on the SMIC 28 nm process and the operating frequency of 50 MHZ. This achieves the maximum hardware reuse of four encoding schemes in the downlink communication link of 4G LTE and 5G NR/ 6G, and reduces power consumption.},

Given the segmentation strategy&#39;s demand for rapid convergence, the algorithm ensures convergence within a prescribed time. Using the Lyapunov method, it is shown that all three subproblems can be solved within any user-prescribed time, independent of the system&#39;s initial states or topology. To further exploit the independence of prescribed-time convergence from system states, the algorithm eliminates the reliance on system topology information in parameter settings by introducing adaptive parameters in place of traditional fixed ones, thus enabling fully distributed control.

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet (UV) communication has garnered considerable attention as a method utilizing UV particle scattering for signal transmission. However, the significant path loss due to scattering presents challenges in maintaining signal quality in dynamic communication scenarios. Increasing the emitted signal power is not a viable solution due to safety regulations on radiated energy. Therefore, adaptive power control mechanisms are essential. In this paper, we develop a radiation model for UV LED arrays and propose a power optimization method tailored for UV LED arrays in linear communication links. This method accounts for variables such as communication distance, the number of active LEDs, and the transmit power of each LED, integrating both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components into the receiver power calculation. We formulate an optimization problem with constraints on bit error rate (BER) and control parameters, aiming to minimize transmit power and beam coverage area. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to solve this problem. The results indicate that the model we proposed is able to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 3.05dB to 4.06dB, thereby reducing the transmit power requirements. With BER constraints, the proposed power control strategy ensures energy stabilization across a broad range, with the maximum energy overshoot during distance variations being 41.22%. Compared to power control methods in visible light communication (VLC) systems, the method proposed in this paper is more aligned with the channel characteristics of UV communication. Building on traditional constant-power UV communication systems, the method proposed in this paper can reduce the transmit power by up to 84.24%.},

  abstract     = {To design a reliable communication system leveraging millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technology-gaining popularity for its capacity to deliver multi-gigabit-per-second data rates-it is essential to consider the site-specific nature of mm-wave propagation. Conventional site-general stochastic channel models often fail to reproduce channel responses in specific usage scenarios or environments accurately. To enable high-precision channel simulation that captures site-specific characteristics, this paper proposes a channel modeling framework leveraging the widely accepted 3GPP map-based hybrid channel modeling approach and provides a detailed methodology for applying it to real-world scenarios with practical examples. First, an extensive measurement campaign was conducted in typical urban macro and micro cellular environments using an in-house dual-band (24/60 GHz) double-directional channel sounder. The mm-wave channel behavior was then characterized, with a focus on differences between the two frequencies. Following this, site-specific large-scale and small-scale channel properties were parameterized. As a critical component for enhancing prediction accuracy, this paper introduces an exponential decay model for the power-delay characteristics of non-line-of-sight clusters, which are often significantly overestimated by deterministic prediction tools. Finally, using the in-house channel model simulator (CPSQDSIM) developed for grid-wise channel data (PathGridData) generation, a marked improvement in prediction accuracy over the existing 3GPP map-based channel model was demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is one promising approach for the future wireless system with high-mobility users. This paper proposed a channel estimation for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS system with high delay resolution in high-mobility environment. Shifts of the path indices and path appearance/disappearance are studied in this work. Due to the high mobility of the user and high delay resolution, the studied system can be more sensitive to index shift of paths. Considering the fractional components in OTFS channel, only the significant CSI elements are processed with minimum performance loss. A Deep Learning supported 3-phase scheme is developed. An auto-encoder (AE) is first deployed for compressed channel features, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) based scheme that provides a rough channel prediction. The indices of significant elements in the predicted channel are then extracted using the decoder function of the AE process. Finally, the values of the significant elements are reconstructed via the Least Squares based method. Analysis is provided on erroneous path predictions, i.e., missing existing paths or detecting non-existent paths. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3-phase scheme can outperform the existing channel prediction schemes with a much better accuracy and lower bit error rate in high-mobility use cases.},
