Our goal is to learn an optimal multi-UAV centralized control policy that will enable UAVs to find the illumination areas in urban environments through curiosity-driven exploration and harvest energy to continue providing communication services to users. First, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-UAV centralized control strategy to maximize the accumulated communication service score. In the proposed framework, curiosity can act as an internal incentive signal, allowing UAVs to explore the environment without any prior knowledge. Second, a two-phase exploring protocol is proposed for practical implementation. Compared to the baseline method, our proposed method can achieve a significantly higher accumulated communication service score in the exploitation-intensive phase. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain accurate service paths over the baseline method and handle the exploration-exploitation tradeoff well.},

  abstract     = {In physical human–robot interaction (pHRI), the interaction profiles, such as impedance and interaction force are greatly influenced by the operator&#39;s muscle activities, impedance and interaction force between the robot and the operator. Actually, parameters of interaction profiles are easy to be measured, such as position, velocity, acceleration, and muscle activities. However, the impedance cannot be directly measured. In some areas, it is difficult to capture the force information, especially where the force sensor is hard to be attached on the robots. In this sense, it is worth developing a feasible and simple solution to recognize the impedance parameters by exploring the potential relationship among the above mentioned interaction profiles. To this end, a framework of impedance recognition based on different time-based weight membership functions with broad learning system (TWMF-BLS) is developed for stable/unstable pHRI. Specifically, a linear weight membership function and a nonlinear weight membership function are proposed for stable and unstable pHRI by using the hybrid features for estimating the interaction force. And then the human arm impedance can be estimated without a biological model or a robot&#39;s model. Experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

First, regarding the issue of user emotional reactions in mining topics. In this article, we quantify the affective influence among users by considering user behaviors as continuous conversations through conversation-level sentiment analysis and the proximity centrality of social networks. Second, considering that user behavior is influenced by multidimensional cognition, this article proposes a method based on S(Sensibility) R(Rationality) 2vec to simulate the dialectical relationship between sensibility and rationality in the user decision-making process. Finally, considering the cooperative and competitive relationship among derived topics, this article uses evolutionary game theory to analyze the topic life cycle and quantify its impact on user behavior by time discretization method. Accordingly, we propose a CG-back-propagation (BP) model incorporating a BP neural network to efficiently simulate the nonlinear relationship of user behavior. Experiments show that the model can not only effectively tap the influence of multidimensional cognition on users’ retweeting behavior, but also effectively perceive the propagation dynamics of derived topics.},

  abstract     = {Since sudden and recurrent epileptic seizures seriously affect people&#39;s lives, computer-aided automatic seizure detection is crucial for precise diagnosis and prompt treatment. A novel seizure detection algorithm named channel selection-based temporal convolutional network (CS-TCN) was proposed in this article. First, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were segmented into 2-s intervals and features were extracted from both the time and frequency domains. Then, the expanded fisher score channel selection method was employed to select channels that contribute the most to seizure detection. Finally, the features from selected EEG channels were fed into the TCN to capture inherent temporal dependencies of EEG signals and detect seizure events. Children Hospital Boston and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) and Siena datasets were used to verify the detection performance of the CS-TCN algorithm, achieving sensitivities of 98.56% and 98.88%, and specificities of 99.80% and 99.88% in samplewise analysis, respectively. In eventwise analysis, the algorithm achieved sensitivities of 97.57% and 95.00%, with delays of 6.91 and 18.62 s, and FDR/h of 0.11 and 0.39, respectively. These results surpassed state-of-the-art few-channel algorithms for both datasets. CS-TCN algorithm offers excellent performance while simplifying model complexity and computational requirements, thus showcasing its potential for facilitating seizure detection in home environments.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) has significant advantages in terms of reliability and accuracy. However, individual differences in EEG limit the ability of sentiment classifiers to generalize across subjects. Furthermore, due to the nonstationarity of EEG, subject signals can vary with time, an important challenge for temporal emotion recognition. Several emotion recognition methods have been developed that consider the alignment of conditional distributions, but do not balance the weights of conditional and marginal distributions. In this article, we propose a novel approach to generalize emotion recognition models across individuals and time, i.e., global and local associative domain adaptation (GLADA). The proposed method consists of three parts: 1) deep neural networks are used to extract deep features from emotional EEG data; 2) considering that marginal and conditional distributions between domains can contribute to adaptation differently, a method that combines coarse-grained adversarial adaptation and fine-grained adversarial adaptation is used to narrow the domain distance of the joint distribution in the EEG data between subjects (i.e., reduce intersubject variability), and the weights of the marginal and conditional distributions are automatically balanced using dynamic balancing factors; and 3) domain adaptation is used to accelerate model convergence. Using GLADA, subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is improved by reducing the influence of the subject’s personal information on EEG emotion. Experimental results demonstrate that the GLADA model effectively addresses the domain transfer problem, resulting in improved performance across multiple EEG emotion recognition tasks.},

  abstract     = {Emotion plays an important role in human life. In recent years, memristor-based emotion circuits have been proposed extensively, but few circuits simulate the neural circuity that generates specific emotions in the limbic system. In this article, a memristor-based circuit of brain-like fear generalization is proposed. It is described from two dimensions of perception and higher cognition, respectively, both of which are realized by simulating the limbic system of human brain. The main difference between these two dimensions lies in the circuit design of the hippocampus module. Moreover, the memory enhancement effect caused by fear is one of the reasons for the phenomenon of fear generalization. That is, high arousal of fear leads to enhanced memory. Herein, the memristor-based circuit associated with different emotional arousal and memory is designed. The simulation results in SPICE show that the circuit is able to implement the brain-like fear generalization and the emotional memory under different arousal. The circuit design of these neural networks may provide some references for the field of brain-like robots.},

Despite its undeniable relevance, the underlying process governing the relationship between unpleasant sound events, and the annoyance they may cause has not been systematically studied yet. In this context, this work focuses on the disturbance caused by interfloor sound events, i.e., the audio signals transmitted through the floors of a building. Activities such as walking, running, using household appliances or other daily actions generate sounds that can be heard by those on an adjacent floor. To this end, we implemented a suitable dataset including diverse interfloor sound events annotated according to the perceived disturbance. Subsequently, we propose a framework able to quantify similarities exhibited by interfloor sound events starting from standardized time-frequency representations, which are processed by a Siamese neural network composed of a series of convolutional layers. Such similarities are then employed by a $k$-medoids regression scheme making disturbance predictions based on interfloor sound events with neighboring latent representations. After thorough experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of such a framework and its superiority over popular regression algorithms. Last but not least, the proposed solution offers interpretable predictions, which may be meaningfully utilized by human experts.},

  abstract     = {Event cameras have unique advantages in object detection, capturing asynchronous events without continuous frames. They excel in dynamic range, low latency, and high-speed motion scenarios, with lower power consumption. However, aggregating event data into image frames leads to information loss and reduced detection performance. Applying traditional neural networks to event camera outputs is challenging due to event data&#39;s distinct characteristics. In this study, we present a novel spiking neural networks (SNNs)-based object detection model, the spiking vision transformer (SpikingViT) to address these issues. First, we design a dedicated event data converting module that effectively captures the unique characteristics of event data, mitigating the risk of information loss while preserving its spatiotemporal features. Second, we introduce SpikingViT, a novel object detection model that leverages SNNs capable of extracting spatiotemporal information among events data. SpikingViT combines the advantages of SNNs and transformer models, incorporating mechanisms such as attention and residual voltage memory to further enhance detection performance. Extensive experiments have substantiated the remarkable proficiency of SpikingViT in event-based object detection, positioning it as a formidable contender. Our proposed approach adeptly retains spatiotemporal information inherent in event data, leading to a substantial enhancement in detection performance.},

  abstract     = {The acoustic startle reflex (ASR) relies on the sensorimotor system and is affected by aging, sex, and psychopathology. ASR can be modulated by the prepulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm, which achieves the inhibition of reactivity to a startling stimulus (pulse) following a weak prepulse stimulus. Additionally, neurophysiological studies have found that brain activity is characterized by irregular patterns with high complexity, which however reduces with age. Our study investigated the relationship between prestartle nonlinear dynamics and PPI in healthy children versus adults. Fifty-six individuals took part in the experiment: 31 children and adolescents and 25 adults. Participants heard 51 pairs of tones (prepulse and startle) with a time difference of 30 to 500 ms. Subsequently, we assessed neural complexity by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) during the prestartle period and assessed PPI by analyzing the poststartle event-related potentials (ERPs). Results showed higher neural complexity for children compared to adults, in line with previous research showing reduced complexity in the physiological signals in aging. As expected, PPI (as reflected in the P50 and P200 components) was enhanced in adults compared to children, potentially due to the maturation of the ASR for the former. Interestingly, prestartle complexity was correlated with the P50 component in children only, but not in adults, potentially due to the different stage of sensorimotor maturation between age groups. Overall, our study offers novel contributions for investigating brain dynamics, linking nonlinear with linear measures. Our findings are consistent with the loss of neural complexity in aging, and suggest differentiated links between nonlinear and linear metrics in children and adults.},

  abstract     = {The NMDA receptor (NMDAR), as a ubiquitous type of synapse in neural systems of the brain, presents slow dynamics to modulate neural spiking activity. For the cerebellum, NMDARs have been suggested for contributing complex spikes in Purkinje cells (PCs) as a mechanism for cognitive activity, learning, and memory. Recent experimental studies are debating the role of NMDAR in PC dendritic input, yet it remains unclear how the distribution of NMDARs in PC dendrites can affect their neural spiking coding properties. In this work, a detailed multiple-compartment PC model was used to study how slow-scale NMDARs together with fast-scale AMPA, regulate neural coding. We find that NMDARs act as a band-pass filter, increasing the excitability of PC firing under low-frequency input while reducing it under high frequency. This effect is positively related to the strength of NMDARs. For a response sequence containing a large number of regular and irregular spiking patterns, NMDARs reduce the overall regularity under high-frequency input while increasing the local regularity under low-frequency. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of NMDA receptors during high-frequency stimulation is associated with a reduced conductance of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel. Taken together, our results suggest that NMDAR plays an important role in the regulation of neural coding strategies by utilizing its complex dendritic structure.},

  abstract     = {Object recognition and object identification are complex cognitive processes where information is integrated and processed by an extensive network of brain areas. However, although object recognition and object identification are similar, they are considered separate functions in the brain. Interestingly, the difference between object recognition and object identification has still not been characterized in a way that brain–computer interface (BCI) applications can detect or use. Hence, in this study, we investigated neural features during object recognition and identification tasks through functional brain connectivity. We conducted an experiment involving 25 participants to explore these neural features. Participants completed two tasks: an object recognition task, where they determined whether a target object belonged to a specified category, and an object identification task, where they identified the target object among four displayed images. Our aim was to discover reliable features that could distinguish between object recognition and identification. The results demonstrate a significant difference between object recognition and identification in the participation coefficient (PC) and clustering coefficient (CC) of delta activity in the visual and temporal regions of the brain. Further analysis at the category level shows that this coefficient differs for different categories of objects. Utilizing these discovered features for binary classification, the accuracy for the animal category reached 80.28%. The accuracy for flower and vehicle categories also improved when combining the PC and CC, although no improvement was observed for the food category. Overall, what we have found is a feature that might be able to be used to differentiate between object recognition and identification within a BCI object recognition system. Further, it may help BCI object recognition systems to determine a user’s intentions when selecting an object.},

The features, such as differential entropy (DE), dispersion entropy (DispEn), permutation entropy (PE), spectral entropy (SE), and distribution entropy (DistEn), are extracted from MIMFs. The binary atom search optimization (BASO) technique is employed to reduce the dimension of the feature space. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and ensemble bagged tree (EBT) classifiers are used to recognize different human emotions using the features of EEG signals. The results demonstrate that the LGBM classifier has achieved the highest average accuracy of 99.50% and 98.79%, respectively, using multichannel EEG signals from the GAMEEMO and DREAMER databases for cross-subject emotion recognition (ER). Compared to other multivariate signal decomposition algorithms, the MvFIF-based method has demonstrated higher accuracy in recognizing emotions using multichannel EEG signals. The proposed (MvFIF+DE+BASO+LGBM) technique outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in ER using EEG signals.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of brain activity into text using electroencephalography (EEG) has gained significant traction in recent years. Many researchers are working to develop new models to decode EEG signals into text form. Although this area has shown promising developments, it still faces numerous challenges that necessitate further improvement. It is important to outline this area&#39;s recent developments and future research directions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of technology, guide future research efforts, and enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of EEG-to-text systems. In this review article, we thoroughly summarize the progress in EEG-to-text conversion. First, we talk about how EEG-to-text technology has grown and what problems the field still faces. Second, we discuss existing techniques used in this field. This includes methods for collecting EEG data, the steps to process these signals, and the development of systems capable of translating these signals into coherent text. We conclude with potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for enhanced accuracy, reduced system constraints, and the exploration of novel applications across varied sectors. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to contribute to developing more accessible and effective brain–computer interface (BCI) technology for a broader user base.},

  abstract     = {Mental workload (MWL) assessment is crucial in information systems (IS), impacting task performance, user experience, and system effectiveness. Deep learning offers promising techniques for MWL classification using electroencephalography (EEG), which monitors cognitive states dynamically and unobtrusively. Our research explores deep learning&#39;s potential and challenges in EEG-based MWL classification, focusing on training inputs, cross-validation methods, and classification problem types. We identify five types of EEG-based MWL classification: within-subject, cross subject, cross session, cross task, and combined cross task and cross subject. Success depends on managing dataset uniqueness, session and task variability, and artifact removal. Despite the potential, real-world applications are limited. Enhancements are necessary for self-reporting methods, universal preprocessing standards, and MWL assessment accuracy. Specifically, inaccuracies are inflated when data are shuffled before splitting to train and test sets, disrupting EEG signals’ temporal sequence. In contrast, methods such as the time-series cross validation and leave-session-out approach better preserve temporal integrity, offering more accurate model performance evaluations. Utilizing deep learning for EEG-based MWL assessment could significantly improve IS functionality and adaptability in real time based on user cognitive states.},

Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to significant improvements in this domain. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review that covers the application of DL methods for decoding imagined speech via EEG. In this article, we survey SI and DL literature to address critical questions regarding preferred paradigms, preprocessing necessity, optimal input formulations, and current trends in DL-based techniques. Specifically, we first search major databases across science and engineering disciplines for relevant studies. Then, we analyze the DL-based techniques applied in SI decoding from five main perspectives: dataset, preprocessing, input formulation, DL architecture, and performance evaluation. Moreover, we summarize the key findings of this work and propose a set of practical recommendations. Finally, we highlight the practical challenges of DL-based imagined speech decoding and suggest future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Sensorimotor integration (SMI) is a complex process that allows humans to perceive and interact with their environment. Any impairment in SMI may impact the day-to-day functioning of humans, particularly evident in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). SMI is critical to accurate perception and modulation of motor outputs. Therefore, understanding the associated neural pathways and mathematical underpinnings is crucial. In this article, a systematic review of the proposed neural and computational models associated with SMI is performed. While the neural models discuss the neural architecture and regions, the computational models explore the mathematical or computational mechanisms involved in SMI. The article then explores how PD may impair SMI, reviewing studies that discuss deficits in the perception of various modalities, pointing to an SMI impairment. This helps in understanding the nature of SMI deficits in PD. Overall, the review offers comprehensive insights into the basis of SMI and the effect of PD on SMI, enabling clinicians to better understand the SMI mechanisms and facilitate the development of targeted therapies to mitigate SMI deficits in PD.},
