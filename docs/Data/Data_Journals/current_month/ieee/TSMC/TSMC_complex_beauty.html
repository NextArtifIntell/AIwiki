  abstract     = {This article concentrates on the event-triggered control problem for interconnected nonlinear systems under hybrid stochastic faults. Unlike existing results, our work considers both, sensor stochastic faults and process stochastic faults, which are referred to as hybrid stochastic faults. First, under hybrid stochastic faults, an observer is constructed to estimate all states, which converts the process stochastic faults into a processable form. Second, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the estimated states to reduce their update frequency. To deal with the problem that the triggered estimated states are nondifferentiable, a continuous controller with continuous estimated states is developed, and the event-triggered controller with triggered estimated states is established accordingly. By the use of Lyapunov stability theory, it can be rigorously shown that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded in probability. The proposed approach is illustrated with the simulation of two interconnected pendulums.},

  abstract     = {This article extends the problem of safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) to the platooning of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such multivehicle systems, SOTIF objectives are particularly challenging, since new issues arise due to the presence of interactions that propagate and intensify the effects and the risk connected to faults/failures/uncertainties, triggered by any platoon member and external conditions. To tackle and solve the SOTIF-oriented platoon control problem, we propose a robust and resilient decentralized control protocol, based on distributed observer which exploits the information shared via the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication network. The approach allows maintaining acceptable SOTIF performance in adversarial conditions, mitigating the effects of the unreasonable risks originated from sensors/actuators performance limitations/faults and disturbances. The uniformly ultimate bounded (UUB) stability and the input-to-state string stability (ISSS) of the platoon dynamics are analytically proved via the Lyapunov theory. Feasible linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained as stability conditions, whose solution allows adapting the distributed control/observer gains according to leader-tracking performance and robustness margins. A detailed analysis via the vehicular co-simulation platform mixed traffic simulator (MiTraS) corroborates the theoretical derivations and shows the achievement of the SOTIF platoon goals for a set of nontrivial and uncertain driving scenarios.},

Especially, a modified more general event-triggered function is proposed. After the Zeno behavior is eliminated by the contradiction, several stabilized conditions are established to guarantee the input-to-state stability and exponential stability in the mean square and almost surely exponential stability of CHSMNs, where studying in the complex domain and no splitting real and imaginary parts. Subsequently, we analyze the lower bound of the event-triggered intervals for E-TC in the sense of mathematical expectation.

In addition, a tailored SMC law that ensures the system’s trajectory reaches and maintains a preset sliding surface over a specified finite time is applied. To address the challenges of communication load, a novel multizone probabilistic dynamic event-triggered protocol is introduced, leveraging the time-varying nature of transmission delays and incorporating two adjustable internal dynamic variables. The establishment of sufficient conditions for ensuring the stochastic finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is achieved through an effective Lyapunov functional methodology.

  abstract     = {Exploring the structure information is crucial for data clustering task, particularly for the sceneries of incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) when some views are missing. However, almost all of the existing graph-based IMVC methods either introduce the Laplacian constraint with fixed graphs or simply fuse the graphs of all views, which are vulnerable to the quality of the constructed graphs. To address this issue, we propose a new graph-based method, called confident local structure-aware incomplete multiview spectral clustering. Different from existing works, our method seeks to adaptively uncover the inherent similarity structure among the available instances in each view and learn the optimal consensus graph within a unified learning framework. Moreover, to mitigate the adverse effects of imbalance information across incomplete views and improve the quality of consensus graph, we further impose some adaptive weights on the consensus graph learning model w.r.t. each view and introduce some confident structure graphs to explore the most confident similarity information in the model. In contrast to existing works, our approach simultaneously takes into account the pairwise similarity information and neighbor group-based confident structure information. This dual consideration makes our method more effective in achieving the optimal consensus graph and delivering superior IMVC performance. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our method effectively learns a high-quality and clustering-friendly graph from incomplete multiview data, and it outperforms many state-of-the-art IMVC methods in terms of clustering performance.},

However, these methods often necessitate large model sizes, leading to substantial computational and storage resource requirements during training and inference. Unfortunately, existing research has not yet provided a lightweight solution to address this issue. This work aims to develop a generic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing lifelong DRL methods to facilitate their achievement of lightweight models while also yielding higher returns. While sparse training (ST) methods have been extensively used in the DRL community to achieve lightweight models, they exacerbate the issue of catastrophic forgetting and compromise generalization when applied in lifelong DRL. To improve generalization, we develop a gradient optimization method that leverages sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) to smooth the gradient surface of the model without introducing excessive computational complexity. In addition, to alleviate catastrophic forgetting and promote model convergence, we introduce a priority-based approach that samples effective past experiences from the replay buffer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 90% sparsity in five representative lifelong DRL methods while achieving higher episode return and average return (up to 34% improvement) across all episodes compared to the dense models.},

During real-time information exchange among agents, communication failures between agents occur randomly, which may result in each possible network topology occurring with a certain probability, and its sojourn time is also stochastic. This necessitates the consideration of a more general switching signal to describe the stochastic switching phenomenon of networks. In pursuit of this goal, a semi-Markov chain is introduced to characterize the switching signal of stochastic interaction networks, whose sojourn time distribution allows for arbitrary continuous-time distribution and depends on the current and next state. Additionally, this article delves into the impact of two distinct types of DoS attacks on MASs. The first type involves random DoS attacks, which are also modeled by a semi-Markov chain to capture the stochastic nature of attack durations. The second type is deterministic DoS attacks, characterized by their frequency and duration. The proposed new stochastic analysis method, based on the law of large numbers, is used to analyze the ASC for MASs featuring SMSNs under the DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by evaluating the results obtained from two illustrative numerical examples.},

Hence, a novel modeling approach is proposed for constructing CBRBS in the aim of providing a better XAI, in which a joint optimization model is proposed first to describe the mathematical model of parameter and structure optimization, and the corresponding algorithm is further designed to automatically achieve the joint optimization of CBRBS. Afterward, a domain-based calculation method of synthesis factor is proposed to develop a new rule synthesis method for CBRBS, which not only achieves the reduction of inefficient and inconsistent rules but also takes into account interpretability and generalization ability. In experimental analysis, the proposed modeling approach is employed to construct CBRBS for handling rice taste assessment and benchmark classification problems. The comparison results show that the proposed approach makes it possible for CBRBS to achieve a good balance between model complexity and inference accuracy. More importantly, the resulting CBRBS has better accuracy and lower complexity than some existing rule-based systems and classical classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Industrial robots inevitably incur kinematic errors in the advanced manufacturing and assembly processes, resulting in the severe reduction of the absolute positioning accuracy (APA). Kinematic calibration (KC) is well-known as a vital technique in APA-promoting tasks. However, existing KC models generally adopt a single distance-oriented Loss, e.g., an $L_{2}$ norm-oriented one that neglects the featured $L_{p}$ norms. In response to this critical issue, this study presents an Adaptive p-norms-oriented Kinematic Calibration (ApKC) model on the basis of threefold ideas: 1) studying the effects of diversified $L_{p}$ norms on the industrial robot calibration performance; 2) combining multiple $L_{p}$ norms to obtain the aggregated loss with the hybrid effects by different norms; and 3) implementing the weight adaptation on the norm components of the aggregated loss, and rigorously prove its ensemble capability benefiting the calibration performance. Afterwards, a novel Newton interpolated Adaptive Differential Evolution (NADE) algorithm is further proposed to optimize the ApKC model. Empirical studies on an HRS JR680 industrial robot demonstrate that the achieved ApKC-NADE calibrator can significantly reduce the robot’s maximum positioning error from 4.610 to 0.856 mm. It can vigorously support the high-accuracy application of industrial robots.},

Specifically, this research investigates a neural network structure determined by the mechanical characteristics of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool. We explore a method to generate training trajectories that fill the designated feature space or repeatedly pass through hidden layer nodes, ensuring that deterministic learning achieves a sufficient PE level. Then, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on a three-axis CNC machine tool using actual machining trajectories. The experimental results consistently confirmed that the generated training trajectories endow the RBF neural network with more feature information than random NURBS trajectories. Additionally, the tracking error and contour error of the CNC machine tool were significantly reduced.},

  abstract     = {In a two-crane cooperative lift process, unreasonable load distribution on the two cranes may cause one of the cranes to overload, which may cause a dangerous overturn accident. Therefore, the load distribution should be taken as a constraint to yield a safe path for a cooperative lift. Besides, the load distribution on the two cranes varies with the changing postures of the cranes. However, the explicit relationship between the load distribution and the postures has not been reported. Therefore, this article first presents a relationship model between the postures of the two cranes and the load distribution on them. Next, a new path-planning method based on reinforcement learning is explained, which utilizes the load constraint as the optimization object in the cooperative two-crane lift. Simulation results show that the new method yields a short lift path with reasonable load distribution.},

  abstract     = {Secure resource management (SRM) within a cloud computing environment is a critical yet infrequently studied research topic. This article provides a comprehensive survey and comparative performance evaluation of potential cyber threat countermeasure strategies that address security challenges during cloud workload execution and resource management. Cybersecurity is explored specifically in the context of cloud resource management, with an emphasis on identifying the associated challenges. The cyber threat countermeasure methods are categorized into three classes: defensive strategies, mitigating strategies, and hybrid strategies. The existing countermeasure strategies belonging to each class are thoroughly discussed and compared. In addition to conceptual and theoretical analysis, the leading countermeasure strategies within these categories are implemented on a common platform and examined using two real-world virtual machine (VM) data traces. Based on this comprehensive study and performance evaluation, this article discusses the tradeoffs among these countermeasure strategies and their utility, providing imperative concluding remarks on the holistic study of cloud cyber threat countermeasures and SRM. Furthermore, the study suggests future methodologies that could effectively address the emerging challenges of secure cloud resource management.},

First, novel dynamic control policies (DCPs) are developed for NZSGs by introducing controls into feedback, and an augmented system with augmented performance indices is constructed to derive the DCPs. Then, we theoretically analyze the effect of the DCPs on the control stability and performance indices, and the optimality of PNZSG is proven to be equivalent to the optimality of the original NZSGs. Subsequently, an IRL technique is employed to achieve the developed PNZSG method, and we show that no prior knowledge of the dynamics of NZSGs is needed to deploy the developed PNZSG method because of the augmented system and performance indices. Finally, numerical examples, including cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of a vehicular platoon, demonstrate the correctness of the developed PNZSG method.

The innovation lies in the proposed distributed event-triggered solution methodology, including a distance-minimization algorithm to find the decision closest to the ideal point from the Pareto front, and a weighting coefficients optimization algorithm to allocate the importance of each objective at a predefined time. The distributed solution framework maintains the autonomy of each LA, and the event-triggered communication mechanism saves communication resources.

An adaptive fuzzy practical fixed-time MASs consistency control algorithm is proposed by combining these techniques with backstepping control.

  abstract     = {In recent years, pretrained language-image models (PLIMs) have delivered advances in video captioning. However, existing PLIMs primarily focus on extracting global feature representations from still images and text sequences, while neglecting fine-grained semantic alignment and temporal variations between vision and text pairs. To this end, we propose a global-local alignment module and a temporal parsing module to reflect the detailed correspondence and temporal perception between the two modalities, respectively. In particular, the global-local alignment module enables cross-modal registration at two levels, i.e., the sentence-video level and the word-frame level, to obtain mixed-granularity semantic video features. The temporal parsing module is a dedicated self-attention structure that highlights temporal order cues along video frames, compensating for the limited temporal capacity of PLIMs. In addition, an adaptive two-stage gating structure is designed to leverage the linguistic predictions further. The linguistic information derived from the first stage prediction is dynamically routed through an adaptive decision gate, allowing for quality assessment of whether the information should proceed to the second stage. This structure can effectively reduce the computational burden for easy samples and further improve the accuracy of the prediction results. The experimental results obtained on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, with improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

In the classic ILC framework, three key steps are often involved: 1) making necessary hypotheses over ILC systems, 2) designing the ILC algorithms, and 3) establishing convergence conditions. However, a basic trackability problem is neglected: whether there exist some inputs that drive the ILC system such that the output is identical to the specified trajectory from beginning to end. This article is targeted at addressing the trackability problem and the related ILC design and analysis issues for continuous-time linear systems subject to vector relative degrees. The frequency-domain criteria are developed to determine the trackability of the given trajectory. In addition, the ILC design and analysis are proposed by utilizing a frequency-domain method, which establishes a close connection between the achievement of the perfect tracking tasks in ILC and the trackability of the given trajectory.

To achieve this, this article investigates the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem in the topside separation system. To recover control performance against actuator faults while reducing disturbance sensitivity, the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem is formulated for the topside separation system and is expressed as a two-player differential game problem. A Nash equilibrium solution to the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control problem is derived by solving the game algebraic Riccati equation (GARE). Considering the tailor-made property and difficulty in full-state sensing in industry, an output feedback reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to implement the fault-tolerant $ H_{\infty } $ control method without the need for system dynamics.

Meanwhile, considering unmodeled dynamics and nonaffine inputs, we propose an innovative finite-time fuzzy prescribed performance switching tracking algorithm to achieve tracking goal. For realizing the requirements of performance, the algorithm converts the tracking error to a new state by means of a coordinate transformation via the tangent function. In addition, the universal approximation capacity of the fuzzy-logic system is utilized to estimate the unknown nonlinear term effectively. On this basis, the designed adaptive dynamic event-triggered controller can not only ensure that all the signals for the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability but also guarantee that the tracking error will converge to a predetermined small neighborhood. Meanwhile, different piecewise functions are added into the controller to characterize prescribed performance and avoid singularity problems, respectively.

  abstract     = {Identifying the diffusion origin within networks is critically important for controlling the spread of information, diseases, or other contagions. In this work, we study how to recognize the diffusion source based on limited observational knowledge. To date, the applicability of existing methods is often challenged when dealing with large-scale networks. To improve the scalability, we here develop a community-based source localization (CSL) model by splitting the network into several clusters from the community perspective. In addition, we study an issue that has received less attention but is rather important, i.e., observer deployment. Specifically, we categorize three types of observers and propose a two-stage placement strategy to enhance the accuracy of localization. Our findings suggest that the optimized deployed observers tend to situate at key positions and have higher betweenness compared to non-observer nodes. Based on the information obtained from deployed observers, we further develop five different strategies to locate the community where the source belongs, and our study shows that the diffusion often occurs within a small number of communities so that the search scope can be effectively refined. We validate our method through simulations on various networks, and the experimental results demonstrate the excellent efficacy and efficiency of CSL in early source localization.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical modelling of visual perception in two dimensions is described. Although perception is ubiquitously mentioned in literature and it is used in various contexts, its explicit measurable presentation has not yet been given beyond verbal descriptions. In this seminal work the visual perception is explicitly defined for clarity. Based on this definition, it is treated as a mathematical entity in the form of probability in a particular circular region. Theoretically, human vision is expressed in advanced probabilistic terms and the enigmatic relation between vision and perception is mathematically formulated. Here, the perception concerns a special range of interest, coined as vision circle, where percepts describe the vision act of human as the retinal ophthalmic sensing. Perceptual intelligence quotient (PIQ) is introduced, that it is subject to measurement. The results of the theoretical considerations are shown to be closely matching the common visual perception experiences as well as the reported visual perception studies, including the variation of peripheral acuity. Two eye-tracking experiments demonstrate that saccadic movement behavior of human is reasonably matching the prediction based on the novel perception theory. The work demystifies the visual perception and understanding its role in sciences. As to the cybernetics, perception plays an important role in the control of complex, integrated processing systems, which are interfaced by indispensable man-machine control systems. In these systems, the role of perception is critical, referring to the hazard situations. The implications of the study are investigated and explained in two such cybernetics applications, too.},

Load torque is first modeled as a mismatched disturbance, where its estimation via a disturbance observer is drawn to construct an error system. Then, optimal speed regulation problem for PMSM is equivalently transformed into an optimal control problem for the error system. Given the presence of model variable couplings, an adaptive dynamic programming method is adopted to derive the optimal controller, where a critic neural network (NN) and an actor NN are used to approximate the cost function and the optimal controller, respectively. Notably, this article addresses the simultaneous occurrence of disturbances and actuator faults within the optimal control framework by designing separate treatments. Eventually, a composite controller, fulfilling optimality, robustness and safety constraints, is presented with rigorous proof via Lyapunov method. The proposed method is substantiated through both comparative numerical examples and experimental validation on a PMSM platform.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel visionary policy iteration (VPI) framework is proposed to address the continuous-action reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In VPI, a visionary Q-function is constructed by incorporating the successor state into the standard Q-function. Due to the introduction of the successor state, the proposed visionary Q-function captures information about state transitions within the Markov decision process (MDP), thereby providing a forward-looking perspective that enables a more accurate and foresighted evaluation of potential action outcomes. The relationship between the visionary Q-function and the standard Q-function is analyzed. Subsequently, both the policy evaluation and policy improvement rules in VPI are designed based on the proposed visionary Q-function. The convergence proof for VPI is provided, ensuring that the iterative policy sequence in VPI will converge to the optimal policy. By combining the VPI framework with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, a visionary TD3 (VTD3) algorithm is developed. The evaluation of VTD3 is performed on multiple continuous-action control tasks from Mujoco and OpenAI Gym platforms. The results of comparative experiments demonstrate that VTD3 can achieve more competitive performance than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL approaches. Additionally, the experimental results indicate that VPI enhances decision-making capability, reduces Q-function estimation bias, and improves sample efficiency, thereby boosting the performance of existing RL algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The aim of RGB-D Co-salient object detection (RGB-D Co-SOD) is to locate the most prominent objects within a provided collection of correlated RGB and depth images. The development of the Transformer has resulted in significant advancements in RGB-D Co-SOD. However, existing methods overlook the considerable computational and parametric costs associated with using the Transformer. Although compact models are computationally efficient, they suffer from performance degradation, which limits their practical applicability. This is because the reduction of model parameters weakens their feature representation capability. To bridge the performance gap between compact and complex models, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation (KD) network, HKDNet-S*, to perform the RGB-D Co-SOD task. This method incorporates positive-negative logits approximation KD to guide the student network (HKDNet-S) in effectively learning the interrelationships among samples with multiple attributes by considering both positive and negative logits. HKDNet-S* primarily consists of the group cosaliency semantic exploration module and the positive and negative logits approximation KD method. Specifically, we employ a trained RGB-D Co-SOD model as a teacher model (HKDNet-T) to train the HKDNet-S with a limited number of participants using KD. Through extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets (RGBD CoSal1k, RGBD CoSal150, and RGBD CoSeg183), we demonstrate that HKDNet-S* achieves superior accuracy while utilizing fewer parameters in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The opinions of experts often exhibit initial variance in group decision-making process due to the differences in background, knowledge, stance, and other influential factors. Thus, an incentive mechanism is critical to motivate experts to adjust individuals’ opinions and achieve a consensus solution. The incentive mechanism is usually costly and included in the consensus reaching process (CRP), and its effect relies on the behavior interaction between the moderator and experts. Within the Stackelberg game framework, we present the maximum-experts and minimum-cost consensus models with multiple incentives and cost budget. First, from a two-side perspective of the moderator and experts, a consensus model with maximum-return modification and maximum-experts feedback (MRMECM) is built to pursue the maximum number of consensus experts under an established cost budget, where the incentive mechanism is realized with the allocation of unit return to each return-driven expert. Then, a double incentive mechanism (DIM) is designed with the modification and shared return incentives. Subsequently, the MRMECM with DIM is constructed to improve the utilization efficiency of cost budget. Finally, the DIM module is integrated into the maximum-return modification and minimum-cost feedback consensus model (MRMCCM), which aims to minimize the consensus cost in the feedback mechanism. All the proposed consensus models are built as bi-level programming models in a unified Stackelberg game framework. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the best-response update strategy with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to solve the equilibrium solutions. Consequently, several experimental studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models.},

In this article, we propose a predictive sliding control (PSC) algorithm that uses model predictive control (MPC) to determine the optimal SMP. The input to MPC is the SMC law with a sliding manifold variable parameter. In addition, the stability and robustness of the control system are analyzed in detail.

First, the optimal controllers with the auxiliary compensation term are constructed by utilizing the online approximation of the modified performance index function and RL actor-critic structure. The designed controller can deal with unknown structure impacts and avoid model identification. Besides, in designing the prescribed-time scale function, the introduced constant term not only prevents singularity but also allows flexible setting of constraint regions. The proposed scheme is theoretically verified to satisfy the Bellman optimality principle and ensure the tracking error converges to the desired zone within the prescribed time. Finally, the practicability of the designed control scheme is further demonstrated by the 2-link FJ robot simulation example.},

To handle this problem, a stochastic distributed algorithm based on the clipped distributed strategy and the dual averaging strategy is proposed. Of particular interest follows that we study the high probability convergence of the stochastic distributed algorithm under the assumption that the stochastic gradient follows a heavy-tailed distribution. Heavy-tailed distributions often causes extreme values, which bring difficulties in achieving the high probability convergence.

  abstract     = {A recursive minimum upper bound estimator (UBE) is proposed in this article for stochastic systems with colored measurement noise (CMN) in the presence of generalized unknown disturbance (UD), which is motivated by noncooperative target tracking in the environment of continuous external interference. The CMN causes system noises to be correlated in time dimension, and the UD makes online calculation of estimate error covariance intractable, both of which give rise to deterioration of classical Kalman-like filtering and smoothing. By considering that constructing the upper bound of estimate error covariance requires looser conditions than directly calculating the theoretical covariance, an UBE is first defined, to obtain the filtered estimate and smoothed estimate together. Then, based on the reconstructed measurement model containing multiple state vectors due to measurement differencing to whiten system noises, the recursive structure of the defined UBE is derived in the case of CMN (CUBE) by introducing a free parameter to be optimized, and the existence condition of CUBE is also discussed. Finally, the minimum UBE with CMN, i.e., CMUBE, is presented by pursuing the minimum upper bound of estimate error covariance online through parameter optimization, in order to further suppress the peak of estimate errors. The advantages of estimation accuracy of the proposed CMUBE over Kalman filter (KF)/smoother, KF with CMN and minimum upper bound filter (MUBF) are demonstrated by an example of noncooperative target tracking in persistent interference environment, in terms of filtering versus smoothing, different values of the initial estimate error covariance and the positive-definite matrix setting a priori, sensor accuracies and different levels of UD.},

To tackle this, we propose a simple yet effective approach called deep discriminative handcrafted feature regression (DDHFR) to explore intrinsic information and select improved discriminative features in few-shot data by mining knowledge from classical handcrafted features. To explore intrinsic information, we design several deep handcrafted feature regression (DHFR) modules and plugged them separately into different layers of the backbone to use feature engineering knowledge for feature learning optimization at different granularities. To achieve discriminative feature selection, we incorporate an auxiliary classifier (AC) into each DHFR module to enhance the acquisition of discriminative information. Furthermore, we employed self-distillation to boost ability of ACs ot be classified. Experimental results in three backbones on three datasets show that DDHFR can generally improve the performance of existing FSL methods. On average, it improves the recognition accuracy by 1.16% in two common few-shot settings.},

  abstract     = {In this work, via proposing a novel $\tan $ -type asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (ABLF), we developed a command filtered adaptive fault tolerant control scheme for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with predefined-time asymmetric and time-varying output constraints. First, such a class of constraints under interest is more practical. Unlike most of the existing constraints that need to be addressed at the moment of inception, the initial value requirement of the constrained object in this work is released. A predefined setting time can be installed in advance through the implementation of a shifting function embedded within the proposed ABLF. Second, the problem of unknown actuator faults is considered where the actuator faults can be both multiplicative and additive. Third, by combining the command filter and backstepping techniques, a twice-transformation design method is presented to construct the desired controller, under which the errors between the virtual control laws and the outputs of the command filters can be compensated thoroughly. Aside from avoiding the “explosion of complexity” issue, the designed controller also achieves the requisite tracking performance. Meanwhile, under such controller, the effect of the actuator faults can be estimated. Finally, the validity of the given scheme is evaluated through the use of a practice example.},

As a nonscaling-based method with structural adaptation is utilized, the proposed control scheme is able to regulate all the states to zero well before the prescribed-time, yet in the presence of time-varying and mismatched structural uncertainties, substantially reducing the numerical computational complexity induced by scaling-based methods.

Both additive and multiplicative feedback gain perturbations with randomly occurring manners are considered during the controller design to improve its tolerance of inaccurate controller implementation. The mode information that is partially available to the controller is incorporated into the design. With the help of the fuzzy-logic method, fuzzy resilient output-feedback controllers are established to cope with the gain perturbations and immeasurable system states. Then, by developing a novel switching model, relaxed conditions compared with the existing results are obtained which guarantee the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of NMSNSs. Based on the FTB analysis, a fuzzy design algorithm is proposed via a new separation approach to obtain the controller gains. Eventually, simulations are conducted via a multimode robotic arm system to validate the achieved results.},

To better understand the effect of power-law activating patterns, we study the two-person-two-strategy evolutionary game dynamics, demonstrate the absorbability of strategies, and obtain the critical cooperation conditions for prisoner’s dilemmas in homogeneous networks without mutation.

This article aims to address the control performance optimization problem of flight control system in the presence of an incompletely known aircraft model and real-time flight data. First, the longitudinal aircraft dynamic model is formulated, followed by the establishment of two typical disturbance models, including periodic and constant disturbances.

Moreover, the gradient-based performance optimization strategy is proposed to mitigate the performance degradation induced by disturbances, using the online monitored actuator and sensor data of flight control system. By developing tools from optimization theory, the convergence and optimality of gradient-based performance optimization method are analyzed comprehensively.

While most existing methods for debunking rumors consider a solitary debunker, they overlook that rumor-mongering and debunking are interdependent and confrontational behaviors. In reality, a debunker must consider the impact of rumor-mongering behavior when making decisions. Moreover, a single rumor-debunking strategy is ineffective in addressing the complexity of the rumor environment in networks. Therefore, this article proposes a hybrid rumor-debunking approach that combines truth dissemination and regulatory measures based on the differential game theory under adversarial behaviors of rumor-mongering and debunking. Toward this end, we first establish a rumor propagation model using node-based modeling techniques that can be applied to any network structure. Next, we mathematically describe and analyze the processes of rumor-mongering and debunking. Finally, we validate the theoretical results of the proposed method through various comparative experiments, including comparisons with a random strategy, a uniform strategy, and single strategy models on real-world datasets collected from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Furthermore, we harness two actual rumor events to estimate parameters and predict rumor propagation, thereby affirming the veracity and effectiveness of our rumor propagation model.},

Subsequently, a channel attention mechanism (CAM) is introduced to prioritize focus on pertinent convolutional channels to enhance the network’s effectiveness and discriminative capacity. Furthermore, the Transformer is employed to establish dependencies among distinct features to enhance fault diagnosis accuracy. Lastly, the input data is classified for fault diagnosis.

  abstract     = {Complete coverage path planning (CCPP) is a trending research area in floor cleaning robotics. CCPP is often approached as an optimization problem, typically solved by considering factors, such as power consumption and time as key objectives. In recent years, the safety of cleaning robots has become a major concern, which can critically limit the performance and lifetime of the robots. However, so far, optimizing safety has rarely been addressed in CCPP. Most of the path-planning algorithms in literature tend to identify and avoid the hazards detected by the robot’s perception. However, these systems can limit the area coverage of the robot or pose a risk of failing when the robot is near a hazard. Therefore, this article proposes a novel CCPP method with the awareness of risk levels for a robot to minimize possible hazards to the robot during a coverage task. The proposed CCPP strategy uses reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain a safety-ensured path plan that evaluates and when necessary, avoid the hazardous components in their environment in real time. Furthermore, the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method has been adopted to classify the hazards identified in the environment of the robot and suitably modified to evaluate the risk levels. These risk levels are used in the reward architecture of the RL. Thus, the robot can cross the low-risk hazardous environments if it is necessary to obtain complete coverage. Experimental results showed a noticeable reduction in overall risk faced by a robot compared to the existing methods, while also effectively achieving complete coverage.},

This work proposes a method for multitarget task allocation and path planning for AAV swarms, addressing the challenges of locating and tracking multiple wildlife with very high frequency (VHF) radio tags while avoiding potential disturbances to the wildlife. Our approach proposes a layered framework for the multi-AAV multitarget wildlife tracking problem: 1) the state estimation layer performs fast receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) signal acquisition and employs the particle filtering algorithm to localize targets’ positions; 2) the task assignment layer uses a quadratic allocation method for AAVs’ real-time target allocation, starting with reasonable initial target sets via mixed-integer programming and efficiently readjusting targets based on real-time environment; and 3) the motion planning layer introduces an optimization-based approach to generate smooth and executable trajectories that can simultaneously ensure desired safe distances from objects of interest.

  abstract     = {For the input-delayed stochastic systems with the states and input quantization, the adaptive stabilization problem is investigated in this article. The whole control scheme design process can be divided into three steps. First, the traditional adaptive neural control scheme is developed for the controlled system. Next, the effective control scheme is proposed for the system with the quantized states. Finally, the adaptive neural control method is developed for the considered system with the states and input quantization. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is applied to approximate the unknown terms online, and the Pade approximation method is introduced to deal with the input-delayed problems. The adaptive neural fault control strategy is presented to address sensor faults and the discontinuity due to the quantized states. Under the constructed controllers, all the closed-loop signals remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in mean square. The effectiveness and superiority of the presented control schemes are verified by some simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Sliding mode control (SMC) is considered an efficacious scheme for quadrotor control. However, the control performance of the existing SMC schemes depends on initial states and multiple parameters, and the robustness needs to be improved. To address these issues, a novel predefined-time robust SMC framework based on two zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) schemes, referred to as ZND-based predefined-time robust SMC (ZNDPRSMC) framework, is developed to facilitate position and attitude tracking of a quadrotor under bounded disturbances. Initially, a nonsingular sliding mode surface (SMS) is formulated by incorporating a general ZND along with a differentiable predefined-time activation function. Following this, an approaching law is introduced by utilizing a variable-parameter noise-tolerant ZND and a novel dynamic adaptive parameter. The nonsingular SMS and the approaching law are then combined to construct a nonsingular predefined-time robust controller. The theoretical proofs provided ascertain the predefined-time convergence of the closed-loop system utilizing ZNDPRSMC and its robustness against bounded disturbances. Finally, two trajectory tracking examples of the quadrotor are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the ZNDPRSMC framework.},

  abstract     = {In our daily lives, emotions are extremely important. However, predicting and regulating emotion is still a critical problem to be solved in the research of the human-computer interaction (HCI). In this study, we explore this problem using a regulation method. A novel multimodal affective computing algorithm is proposed and implemented in an emotion regulation system. The selection of music stimuli and the modeling of dynamic emotions are done using emotional Markov chains. This regulation system can monitor the user’s emotion and play music, selected by the regulation policy until the user can maintain the desired emotion. Our system was verified by two experiments. In the first experiment, by predicting the participants’ affective states, we tested the precision of our multimodal affective computing system. In the second experiment, we tested the regulation algorithm embedded in a closed-loop regulation system by comparing it with playing music without feedback. The results suggest that participants can regulate and maintain the desired affective state by using the emotion regulation system.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the inappropriateness of the recently-developed fully interpretable Takagi-Sugeno–Kang fuzzy systems (FIMG-TSK) for high-dimensional classification tasks, which is caused by their unreliable Gaussian mixture models and their very lengthy fuzzy rules on all the original features, this study attempts to develop a stacked ensemble of extremely interpretable first-order TSK fuzzy classifiers (SEXI-TSK-FC) comprising extremely interpretable FIMG-TSK-based classifiers. SEXI-TSK-FC has structural and algorithmic novelties. In the structural sense, to guarantee enhanced generalizability and short fuzzy rules, the proposed XI-TSK is created as each subclassifier on a subset of the original features. Then it stacks each successive subclassifier on both the outputs and the important features selected, which are from the incorrectly classified dataset by the previous subclassifier. After that, SEXI-TSK-FC linearly aggregates all the outputs of its subclassifiers with a one-step calculation to enhance classification accuracy while preserving extreme interpretability. In the algorithmic sense, each short fuzzy rule of the XI-TSK subclassifier is determined using the proposed fuzzy feature selection and clustering algorithm to select the subset of all the original features and simultaneously fix the antecedent and consequent of each rule. After that, the rule weights in each subclassifier are trained quickly with strong generalizability using the proposed Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension minimization-based learning. Experimental results on 12 benchmark datasets demonstrate the power of the proposed classifier SEXI-TSK-FC on high-dimensional data in testing accuracy, training time, and extreme interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Amid the global push for sustainable development, rising market demands have necessitated a multiregional, multiobjective, and flexible production model. Against this backdrop, this article investigates the multiobjective distributed flow shop group scheduling problem by formulating a mathematical model and introducing an advanced memetic algorithm integrated with reinforcement learning (RLMA). The RLMA involves a novel cooperative crossover operation in conjunction with the nature of the coupled problems to extensively explore the solution space. Additionally, the Sarsa algorithm enhanced with eligibility traces guides the selection of optimal schemes during the local enhancement phase. To ensure a balance between convergence and diversity, a solution selection strategy based on penalty-based boundary intersection decomposition is utilized. Furthermore, the increasing-efficiency and reducing-consumption strategies integrating a rapid evaluation mechanism are designed by dynamically changing the machine speed to balance economic and sustainability metrics. Comprehensive numerical experiments and comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed RLMA surpasses existing state-of-the-art algorithms in addressing this complex problem.},

  abstract     = {Current methods of multiperson pose estimation (MPPE) typically treat the human detection and association of joints separately. They introduce complex hand-crafted pose-processes like RoI cropping, NMS and grouping or rely on dense representations to preserve the spatial features. In this article, we dive a deeper thought into this task and propose a simpler and effective framework, termed SparsePose, which can directly predict multiperson joint coordinates from the full image without any post-processes and dense representations. In SparsePose, the full-body instances are decoupled by exploring spatial-aware feature learning (SFL) without box and classification supervision. For improving the quality of instance map, the instance contrastive constraint (ICC) and center correction (CC) strategy are proposed to make the instance-wise spatial feature more discriminative. Importantly, we propose a visibility-guided weighting mechanism to enable model be confident to the visible joint predictions and insensitive to the occlusions or partial bodies. In general, SparsePose is conceptually simpler and plays favorably against the existing counterparts on three benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},
