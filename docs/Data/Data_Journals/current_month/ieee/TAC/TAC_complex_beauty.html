  abstract     = {In this article, switching model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for a perturbed max-plus linear system with a reference signal. The lack of stability guarantee for MPC brings difficulties in reducing tracking errors caused by perturbations in the perturbed max-plus linear system. To reduce tracking errors, the perturbed max-plus linear system is partitioned into a switching max-plus linear system by a permutation matrix. Based on a local maximum terminal set, each mode of the switching max-plus linear system is assigned with an optimal control problem to track the reference signal. Minimum dwell-time is designed to ensure the feasibility of the switching MPC and the stability of the switching max-plus linear system via Hausdorff metric analyses and $\infty$-norm hypercube invariance. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness and superiority of the switching MPC for a perturbed max-plus linear system.},

One of the optimization algorithms is developed based on a multistage structural framework and another is based on a single-stage one. Contrary to the necessary customization of multistage structures in the prescribed-time distributed optimization, this study bridges the gap on the single-stage structured prescribed-time ZGS algorithm. Different from the existing multistage algorithms, the proposed optimization algorithms are proven to converge to the optimal solution within a prescribed-time under more mild conditions. Besides, for the first time, a singularity-free prescribed-time distributed optimization algorithm based on time-varying scaling function is proposed. Furthermore, the robustness of the singularity-free algorithm in rejecting external disturbances is also analyzed. The simulation involving a rendezvous formation problem is elaborated to demonstrate the singularity-free prescribed-time convergence and enhanced robustness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the intricate challenge of decentralized output-feedback control for stochastic non-triangular nonlinear interconnected systems with unknown time-varying sensor sensitivity in a dynamic event-triggered context. The presence of stochastic disturbances, non-triangular structural uncertainties, and evolving sensor sensitivity distinguishes this problem of global asymptotic stability from conventional event-triggered control scenarios. Existing event-triggered control approaches with static event conditions encounter difficulties in simultaneously ensuring zero tracking/stabilization error and preventing the occurrence of Zeno behavior. In this work, we develop a novel solution to address this complex issue. First, we establish a linear relationship between the state vector of each interconnected subsystem and two error vectors through a unique coordinate transformation. This transformation effectively handles the complexities introduced by non-triangular structural uncertainties. Second, we introduce a decentralized dynamic event-triggered output-feedback control strategy, which involves a state observer and a decentralized output-feedback controller. Unlike conventional event-triggered control methods with static event conditions, this strategy formulates a modified clock-based dynamic triggering mechanism by introducing an auxiliary variable that evolves based on predicted plant state values, while utilizing a clock variable to guarantee the existence of a positive lower bound on inter-execution times. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis confirms the global asymptotic stability in probability of the closed-loop system, with the states and the output of each local subsystem converging to the equilibrium at the origin in probability. In addition, the existence of a minimal dwell-time between triggering instants is guaranteed. Finally, we substantiate the advantages and efficiency of the proposed algorithm through comprehensive numerical simulations.},

In a recent paper, it is shown that under some stringent conditions, a linear continuous-time gain-scheduled output feedback controller can be designed to provide closed-loop exponential stability; however, the conditions are hard to check, few examples are provided and all of the examples are stable. The goal of this article is to construct two large families of single-input single-output second-order systems, which satisfy these constraints while admitting wide ranges of parameter variation. The classes constructed include unstable and nonminimum phase systems, and consequently, this work facilitates the design of exponentially stabilizing LPV controllers for systems that are difficult to control.},

Furthermore, a set-membership filter-based DO is developed, and its completeness is proven; thus, our proposed DO is bounded if and only if bounded DOs exist. We also prove that the proposed DO has the capability to achieve the worst-case optimality, which can provide a benchmark for the design of DOs.

The main finding is that the convergence to the performance of the centralized Kalman filter and mean-square boundedness of the estimation error are not lost despite an increase in the number of consensus steps. Simulations show that the total communication overhead is reduced without performance degradation with respect to the original distributed filter, where nodes exchange local state estimates.},

A main novelty of the proposed algorithm is the introduction of a scale factor into the gradient tracking scheme to suppress the consensus error. By the estimate sequence approach, the dynamics of the error due to the unbalance of directed networks is analyzed and it is shown that a sublinear convergence rate can be achieved with a vanishing step size.

In this article, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder, and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system&#39;s state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. In addition, the proposed privacy-preserving scheme is also proven to satisfy differential privacy. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs.

Control-barrier-function (CBF)-based control has shown its promising potential and power in delivering formal safe property of dynamic nonlinear systems. The presence of disturbances, whether from matched or unmatched channels, negatively impacts CBF-based control, leading to violations of formal safety guarantees and degraded control performance. In this article, a new safety-critical disturbance rejection control approach is proposed for nonlinear systems subject to unmatched disturbances. Owing to the naturally intractable mismatching condition, the disturbances and their high order derivatives could generate considerable negative impacts on not only the high order CBF but also the control Lyapunov function. To this end, an observer-based disturbance rejection CBF is proposed, delivering a new robust adaptive mechanism to deal with the disturbances. It is shown that by fully exploiting the disturbance estimates and adequately quantifying the impacts of estimation errors, the proposed approach provides attractive properties like formal robust safety guarantee and nominal control performance recovery under unmatched disturbances. Simulation results of path following of a drone suffering wind disturbances verify the benefits of the proposed solution in collision avoidance and retaining nominal safety performance.},

In engineering practice, this assumption can be overly strict. A more common scenario involves the initial state varying randomly from cycle to cycle. In this article, we propose an optimally selected cycle-based ILC scheme to address the issue of randomly varying initial states. Our approach involves selecting an optimal cycle for iterative learning by evaluating both the potential impact of initial state variations and the tracking performance of historical cycles. By extending the learning mechanism of ILC from learning from the previous cycle to learning from the past optimally selected cycle, our scheme ensures improvement after each iteration of learning. In addition, our scheme has been adapted to accommodate uncertain systems with greater generality. The feasibility and convergence properties of our scheme are investigated through theoretical analysis.

The nonlinearity of fractional power term and tracking error accumulation along the time axis introduce considerable challenges in convergence analysis and convergence rate estimation. Thus, a novel analysis method is proposed for nonlinear recursion with perturbation where the convergence is established as per nonlinear tracking-error dynamics. The limits of the tracking errors are demonstrated independent of the system matrices. The relationship between the convergence limit and initial tracking error is examined. Moreover, the local and global convergence rates are provided. The proposed approach exhibits an advantage in terms of the convergence rate compared with PTUR and FTUR.

The analysis exploits properties of the optimal value function, as well as a detectability property of the system with respect to the stage cost, to construct a Lyapunov function for the stochastic linear quadratic regulator problem.},

The drift and diffusion terms in the dynamics involve the states, the controls, and their conditional expectations. We investigate the stabilizability and convergence of the RL algorithm using a Lyapunov recursion. Instead of solving a pair of coupled Riccati equations, the RL technique focuses on strengthening an auxiliary function and the cost functional as the objective functions and updating the new policy to compute the optimal control via state trajectories.

  abstract     = {This note proposes a novel output-feedback event-triggered control method for nonlinear uncertain strict-feedback systems. It incorporates dual asynchronous triggering mechanisms for both the system&#39;s output and control input, utilizing a specifically designed adaptive filtering method. The first mechanism aims to reduce the burden on sensor to controller communication, while the second determines when the controller needs to be updated. Particularly, an adaptive neural state observer, reliant on the filtered version of sampled output, is designed to estimate the system&#39;s states. Then, differentiable virtual controls are formulated using the estimated states within the framework of the dynamic surface control. Hence, the proposed approach reduces the number of triggering mechanisms and required communication channels compared to existing results. By using the online approximation technique with adaptation schemes, the unknown nonlinearities are approximated without the need for global Lipschitz and linear growth conditions, as well as without encountering overparameterization issue. Finally, the closed-loop stability is analyzed, and proofs for the avoidance of Zeno behavior are provided.},

This article proposes two $\epsilon$-differentially private distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms for aggregative games under directed communication graphs with row- and column-stochastic adjacency matrices, respectively. By utilizing the diameters of players&#39; strategy sets, Laplacian noise free from the uniformly upper bound information of gradients is proposed to achieve $\epsilon$-differential privacy and guarantee the algorithms being fully distributed. To avoid the noise accumulating in the estimate of the aggregate strategy, a noise deduction mechanism is employed to ensure the accuracy of the algorithms. The tradeoff between accuracy and privacy level is investigated. Simulation examples and comparisons with existing result are carried out to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms and theorems.},

  abstract     = {Distributed computing is fundamental to multiagent systems, with solving distributed linear equations as a typical example. In this article, we study distributed solvers for network linear equations over a network with node-to-node communication messages compressed as scalar values. Our key idea lies in a dimension compression scheme that includes a dimension-compressing vector and a data unfolding step. The compression vector applies to individual node states as an inner product to generate a real-valued message for node communication. In the unfolding step, such scalar message is then plotted along the subspace generated by the compression vector for the local computations. We first present a compressed consensus flow that relies only on such scalarized communication, and show that linear convergence can be achieved with well excited signals for the compression vector. We then employ such a compressed consensus flow as a fundamental consensus subroutine to develop distributed continuous-time and discrete-time solvers for network linear equations, and prove their linear convergence properties under scalar node communications. With scalar communications, a direct benefit would be the reduced node-to-node communication channel burden for distributed computing. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the established theoretical results.},

In this work, we propose the first projection-free OCO algorithm admitting time-varying linear constraints and convex generalized inequalities: the online interior-point method for time-varying equality constraints (OIPM-TEC). We derive simultaneous sublinear dynamic regret and constraint violation bounds for OIPM-TEC under standard assumptions. For applications where a given tolerance around optima is accepted, we employ an alternative OCO performance metric—the epsilon-regret—and a more computationally efficient algorithm, the epsilon-OIPM-TEC that possesses sublinear bounds under this metric. Finally, we showcase the performance of these two algorithms on an online OPF problem and compare them to another OCO algorithm from the literature.},

This article concentrates on the examination of error dynamics in affine group systems when exposed to external disturbances or random noises. To this end, we first characterize linear group systems equivalently by homomorphism of its transition flow and linearity of its Lie algebra. Next, we investigate linear group systems that are spread by a Brownian motion in tangent spaces. We show that the Itô stochastic differential equation in the Lie algebra space has a linear drift component and an additional “pinning” term. We apply these findings in analyzing error dynamics, a specific linear group system, with smooth disturbances and random noises. The error dynamics is expressed in the group and the Lie algebra. An explicit and accurate derivation of error dynamics is provided for a concrete example of $SE_{2}(3)$, which plays a vital role in inertial-based navigation and other robotics applications.},

Conversely, the pursuers endeavor to capture the evader before it reaches one of the target areas. To construct the barrier, we first divide the two-lifeline differential game into two subgames: one pursuer and one evader with two lifelines; the other pursuer and evader with two lifelines. We construct the reachable region of the evader using the Cartesian oval. Then, we employ a geometric method to obtain the barrier of each subgame and analyze the optimal strategies of the pursuers and the evader in each area.

  abstract     = {The optimal filtering problem for general nonlinear and continuous state-observation systems attracts lots of attention in the control theory. The essence of optimal filtering requires solving the Duncan–Mortensen–Zakai (DMZ) equation in a computationally feasible way. Under the pioneering work of Yau-Yau filtering, the DMZ equation is reduced to a pathwise computation of a forward Kolmogorov equation with time-varying initial conditions, which is very challenging. To overcome the computational difficulty, in this article, we proposed a new efficient filtering algorithm consisting of a forward Kolmogorov equation solver based on a physics-informed neural network and a probability density approximator based on generalized Legendre polynomials. By utilizing the advanced deep learning method and classical Galerkin approximation, our developed algorithm not only maintains the high accuracy of the spectral method but also removes massive computational loads in the offline part. Furthermore, the convergence of our method is proved. Numerical experiments have been carried out to verify the feasibility of the new method. Regarding accuracy and efficacy, the newly proposed deep generalized Legendre–Galerkin algorithm outperforms other popular suboptimal methods including the extended Kalman filter and particle filter.},

  abstract     = {The optimal transmission scheduling over packet length-dependent lossy networks is investigated. A set of sensors observe some linear time-invariant systems, and obtain their local state estimates using Kalman filters independently. The local state estimates are encoded in a data packet, which is sent to a remote estimator over packet length-dependent lossy networks, i.e., the packet arrival probability is exponentially decreasing with the packet length. The tradeoff arises between the packet arrival probability and the data size. To improve the remote estimation performance, one needs to design a transmission scheduling policy to determine how many as well as which sensors transmit data at each time instant, which is formulated here as a Markov decision process (MDP) model. There exists an optimal stationary policy for the MDP model, which is verified to possess a threshold structure. Based on this, a structure-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to approximate the MDP&#39;s optimal policy. Some simulation examples are given to verify the optimal policy&#39;s structure, and illustrate the performance of the proposed structure-aware reinforcement learning algorithm.},

A parabolic PDE system on space–time scales is constructed for the first time. This article focuses on global exponential stabilization (GES) of a linear parabolic PDE systems on space–time scales by using point-based collocated and noncollocated observations. First, we give the definitions of space–time scales, which contain four cases: continuous time and continuous space, continuous time and discrete space, discrete time and continuous space, and discrete time and discrete space. Wirtinger inequality on space scales is demonstrated, which provides mathematically analytical technique for PDE systems on space–time scales. Second, point-based collocated stabilization control strategy is developed for parabolic PDE systems on space–time scales. Third, considering the fact that sensors and actuators are always placed at different locations, a noncollocated point-based feedback controller is designed by using the observer estimation states. Different from the existing literature, the spatial domain does not need to be divided again according to the actuator and sensor locations. By using the Lyapunov function method, calculus on space–time scales, integration by parts, and Wirtinger inequality on space scales, sufficient criteria are developed such that the closed-loop systems can achieve GES. Finally, numerical simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the developed point-based controllers.},

One of the central challenges tackled in this study pertains to the efficient resolution of these infinite-dimensional TBLMIs. Exploiting the structured nature of such problems, we introduce a consistent truncation method that effectively reduces the problem to a finite-dimensional convex optimization problem. By consistent, we mean that the solution to this finite-dimensional problem allows to closely approximate the infinite-dimensional solution with arbitrary precision. Furthermore, we establish a link between the harmonic framework and the time domain setting, emphasizing the advantages over periodic differential LMIs. We illustrate that our proposed framework is not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable to solving $H_{2}$ and $H_\infty$ harmonic control design problems. To enable this, we extend the definitions of $H_{2}$ and $H_\infty$ norms into the harmonic space, leveraging the concepts of the harmonic transfer function and the average trace operator for Toeplitz block operators.

  abstract     = {Distributed online learning is gaining increased traction due to its unique ability to process large-scale datasets and streaming data. To address the growing public awareness and concern about privacy protection, plenty of algorithms have been proposed to enable differential privacy in distributed online optimization and learning. However, these algorithms often face the dilemma of trading learning accuracy for privacy. By exploiting the unique characteristics of online learning, this article proposes an approach that tackles the dilemma and ensures both differential privacy and learning accuracy in distributed online learning. More specifically, while ensuring a diminishing expected instantaneous regret, the approach can simultaneously ensure a finite cumulative privacy budget, even in the infinite time horizon. To cater for the fully distributed setting, we adopt the local differential-privacy framework, which avoids the reliance on a trusted data curator that is required in the classic “centralized” (global) differential-privacy framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that successfully ensures both rigorous local differential privacy and learning accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using machine learning tasks, including logistic regression on the the “mushrooms” datasets and convolutional neural network-based image classification on the “MNIST” and “CIFAR-10” datasets.},

The global cost function is allocated to multiple agents, each of which computes its local stochastic gradients and communicates with its neighbors to solve the global problem. Stochastic gradient methods enable low computational complexity, while they are hard and slow to converge due to the variance caused by random sampling. To construct a convergent distributed stochastic projection-free algorithm, this article incorporates variance reduction and gradient tracking techniques in the Frank–Wolfe (FW) update. We develop a novel sampling rule for the variance reduction technique to reduce the variance introduced by stochastic gradients. Complete and rigorous proofs show that the proposed distributed projection-free algorithm converges with a sublinear convergence rate and enjoys superior complexity guarantees for both convex and nonconvex objective functions.

  abstract     = {The problem of reconciling a prior probability law on paths with data was introduced by Schrödinger in 1931 and 1932. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schrödinger&#39;s bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schrödinger&#39;s paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schrödinger&#39;s dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.},

  abstract     = {Calculating fixed points of a nonlinear function is a central problem in many areas of science and engineering with applications ranging from the study of dynamical systems to optimization and game theory. Fixed-point iteration methods provide a simple way to calculate the fixed point of nonexpansive mappings and they have been studied extensively. Emerging applications, however, necessitate the study of fixed-point calculation under various perturbations. For instance, in the data-driven identification of dynamical systems, the learning is typically erroneous, which in turn impacts the subsequent fixed calculations, which itself is an essential step for control. Motivated by such settings, in this work, we establish a general mathematical modeling framework for the study of inexact fixed-point iteration (FPI) algorithms. In doing so, we leverage and extend the recent advances in the stochastic optimization literature to derive new methods and convergence analysis results. In particular, adopting this view enables us to present a unified mathematical model to study the impact of inexact computations in both expansive and nonexpansive scenarios, a new technical approach for the analysis of inexact FPI methods, and a new inexact FPI method, which under certain assumptions, enjoys a faster convergence rate than traditional FPI algorithms in the expansive case.},

In this article, a relaxed Lyapunov-like condition for forward completeness is presented for finite-dimensional systems defined on open sets that does not require boundedness of the Lyapunov-like function along the solutions of the system but an exponential growth condition. The corresponding condition is then exploited for the design of autonomous 2-D movement, with focus on lane-free cruise controllers for automated vehicles described by the bicycle kinematic model. The derived feedback laws (cruise controllers) are decentralized and can account for collision avoidance, roads of variable width, on-ramps and off-ramps as well as different desired speed for each vehicle.},

The proposed detection methods can distinguish system fault and replay attack, handle both input and output data replay, maintain certain control performance, and be implemented conveniently and efficiently. First, the replay attack effect on the residual is derived and analyzed. The residual change induced by replay attack is characterized explicitly, and the detection performance analysis based on two different test statistics is given. Second, based on the replay attack effect characterization, targeted passive and active designs for detection performance enhancement are proposed. Regarding the passive design, four optimization schemes regarding different cost functions are proposed with optimal parity matrix solutions, and the unified solution to the passive optimization schemes is obtained; the active design is enabled by a marginally stable filter so as to enlarge the replay attack effect on the residual for detection. Simulations and comparison studies are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The constraint is important since most physical systems cannot switch rapidly between different modes and its presence also eliminates the problem of chattering solutions by construction. We investigate the topology of the optimization space and show that it lacks structure to define local minima. A framework is developed for defining optimal solutions as stationary points of optimality functions and an optimality function is proposed for characterizing the necessary conditions for optimality. The challenges posed by dwell time constraints to algorithmic implementation are addressed by exploring the geometric properties of the so-called mode insertion gradient, and a technique is developed for rapidly updating of the mode sequence. The algorithm&#39;s convergence to an optimal solution is proved and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the algorithm&#39;s efficacy.},

Further, a class of matrix operations induced by fairly common $n$-port network connections is examined. The intrinsic phase properties of networks under such connections are preserved. Concretely, a scalable phase-preserving criterion is proposed, which involves only the phase properties of individual subnetworks, under the matrix operations featured by connections. This criterion ensures that the phase range of the integrated network can be verified effectively and that the scalability of the analyses can be maintained. In addition, the inverse operations of the considered connections, that is, network subtractions with correspondences are examined. With the known phase ranges of the integrated network and one of its subnetworks, the maximal allowable phase range of the remaining subnetwork can also be determined explicitly in a unified form for all types of subtractions.

Events in the system can be protected to verify the identity of the user, and a user who successfully executes/passes a protected event gains some authorization. Our purpose is to design an event-protecting policy such that any user, either legal or unauthorized, who visits a secret state must have an authorization that satisfies the requirement of confidentiality of the state. We consider the criteria of optimality on protecting policies as to protecting policies with a minimum degree of disturbance to legal users&#39; normal operations. To this aim, we use Moore machines to model the dynamics of the clearance level of users when using the system. Then, we develop an auxiliary data structure called the generalized secret automaton, based on which we propose a method to design a protecting policy using the classical supervisory control theory. The minimally disruptive protecting policy is then represented by an automaton called the secret enforcer whose state size is polynomial both in the number of the plant states and the number of secret states in the plant.},

Two algorithms involving inclusive neighbor information and neighbor information are introduced to accomplish attack isolation. By exploring the mechanism of attack collusion, it is found that both the number of subsystems&#39; one-hop neighbors and the size of cycles in the graph play significant roles in attack isolation. Besides, it is interesting to note that their impacts on attack isolation can be mutually compensated. Then, the worst attack collusion cases for the proposed algorithms under different cycle sizes are developed, based on which, several equivalent sufficient yet sharp graph conditions for the isolation of false data injection attacks and covert attacks are, respectively, provided with the notion of $(r,s)$-isolability. It is revealed that the inclusive neighbor information-based algorithm is more effective for isolating false data injection attacks. In contrast, the neighbor information-based algorithm is more suitable for isolating covert attacks. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The local gradient information of each player, essential in implementing algorithms for finding game solutions, is all too often unavailable. In this article, we focus on designing solution algorithms for multiplayer games using bandit feedback, i.e., the only available feedback at each player&#39;s disposal is the realized objective values. To tackle the issue of large variances in the existing bandit learning algorithms with a single oracle call, we propose two algorithms by integrating the residual feedback scheme into single-call extragradient methods. Subsequently, we show that the actual sequences of play can converge almost surely to a critical point if the game is pseudomonotone plus and characterize the convergence rate to the critical point when the game is strongly pseudomonotone. The ergodic convergence rates of the generated sequences in monotone games are also investigated as a supplement. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithms is further verified via numerical examples.},

In particular, to our knowledge, CEDAS enjoys so far the shortest transient time (with respect to the graph specifics) for achieving the convergence rate of centralized SGD, which behaves as $\mathcal {O}(n{C^{3}}/(1-\lambda _{2})^{2})$ under smooth strongly convex objective functions and $\mathcal {O}(n^{3}{C^{6}}/(1-\lambda _{2})^{4})$ under smooth nonconvex objective functions, where $(1-\lambda _{2})$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix, and $C&amp;gt;0$ is the compression-related parameter.

The players then simultaneously allocate their remaining real-time resources, which can be randomized, in a decisive final stage. Our main contributions provide complete characterizations of the optimal reinforcement strategies and resulting equilibrium payoffs in these multistage General Lotto games.

Each subsystem in the network performs its local updates by using the information received from its neighbors, be it possibly outdated. The communication delays with respect to different neighbors are assumed to be arbitrary but bounded. The objective function consists of a twice differentiable coupling term and an aggregated private term. The private function of each subsystem is the sum of two possibly nonsmooth terms, one of which is composed of a linear mapping. We propose a primal-dual fixed point algorithm framework based on the adapted metric for two scenarios where the coupling among subsystems is only enacted by the global objective function and enforced both by the global objective function and the linear mapping. The adapted metric method utilizes an adequate quadratic approximation of the global objective function as the updating step-size to exploit the second-order information. Under some mild assumptions, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is rigorously analyzed based on the quasi-Fejér monotonicity. The numerical simulation verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Distributed stochastic nonconvex optimization problems have recently received attention due to the growing interest of signal processing, computer vision, and natural language processing communities in applications deployed over distributed learning systems (e.g., federated learning). We study the setting where the data is distributed across the nodes of a time-varying directed network, a topology suitable for modeling dynamic networks experiencing communication delays and straggler effects. The network nodes, which can access only their local objectives and query a stochastic first-order oracle to obtain gradient estimates, collaborate to minimize a global objective function by exchanging messages with their neighbors. We propose an algorithm, novel to this setting, that leverages stochastic gradient descent with momentum and gradient tracking to solve distributed nonconvex optimization problems over time-varying networks. To analyze the algorithm, we tackle the challenges that arise when analyzing dynamic network systems that communicate gradient acceleration components. We prove that the algorithm&#39;s oracle complexity is $\mathcal {O}(1/\epsilon ^{1.5})$, and that under Polyak-$\text{L}$ojasiewicz condition the algorithm converges linearly to a steady error state. The proposed scheme is tested on several learning tasks: a nonconvex logistic regression experiment on the MNIST dataset, an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and an NLP classification test on the IMDB dataset. We further present numerical simulations with an objective that satisfies the PL condition. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework compared to the existing related methods.},

  abstract     = {We propose an adversarial, time-varying test-synthesis procedure for safety-critical systems without requiring specific knowledge of the underlying controller steering the system. Specifically, our approach codifies the system objective as a timed reach-avoid specification. Then, by coupling control barrier functions with this class of specifications, we construct an instantaneous difficulty metric whose minimizer corresponds to the most difficult test at that system state. By defining tests as the minimizer of this difficulty metric over the space of allowable tests, we provably identify realizable and maximally difficult tests of system behavior. Finally, we develop this test-synthesis procedure for both continuous and discrete-time systems and showcase our test-synthesis procedure on simulated and hardware examples.},

  abstract     = {Networked multiagent systems often communicate information over low-power shared wireless networks in unlicensed spectrum, which are prone to denial-of-service attacks. An instance of this scenario is considered: multiple pairs of agents, each pair consisting of a transmitting sensor and a receiver acting as an estimator, communicate strategically over shared communication networks in the presence of a jammer who may launch a denial-of-service attack in the form of packet collisions. Using the so-called coordinator approach, we cast this problem as a zero-sum game between the coordinator, who jointly optimizes the transmission and estimation policies, and a jammer, who optimizes its probability of performing an attack. We consider two cases: point-to-point channels and large-scale networks with a countably infinite number of sensor–receiver pairs. When the jammer proactively attacks the channel, we find that this game is nonconvex from the coordinator&#39;s perspective. However, we construct a saddle point equilibrium solution for any multivariate Gaussian input distribution for the observations despite the lack of convexity. In the case where the jammer is reactive, we obtain a customized algorithm based on sequential convex optimization, which converges swiftly to first-order Nash equilibria. Interestingly, we discovered that when the jammer is reactive, it is often optimal to block the channel even when it knows that the channel is idle to create ambiguity at the receiver.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the security issue of malicious attackers degrading remote estimation by injecting false data into sensors in cyber-physical systems. The typical attacks involve initially proposing a parameterized pattern, such as a linear one, then optimizing parameters according to system performance. The parameterized model limits the destructivity because it cannot cover all patterns. To overcome this, we investigate a generalized deception attack model with an unparameterized form. The resulting optimal attack patterns are nonlinear and discontinuous but can be analytically formalized. As a consideration of optimality, we consider two scenarios for attacks: the myopic scenario, focusing on current system time-step performance, and the nonmyopic one, considering both pregiven system time-step and steady-state performance. A suboptimal attack with explicit pattern and estimation error is also proposed to reduce computational load. The conditions for the equivalence of different optimal attack models are provided. Moreover, we summarize typical stealthiness constraints and improve the proposed attacks on them. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A nonparametric learning solution framework is proposed for the global nonlinear robust output regulation problem. We first extend the assumption that the steady-state generator is linear in the exogenous signal to the more relaxed assumption that it is polynomial in the exogenous signal. In addition, a nonparametric learning framework is proposed to eliminate the construction of an explicit regressor, as required in the adaptive method, which can potentially simplify the implementation and reduce the computational complexity of existing methods. With the help of the proposed framework, the robust nonlinear output regulation problem can be converted into a robust nonadaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral input-to-state stable inverse dynamics. Moreover, a dynamic gain approach can adaptively raise the gain to a sufficiently large constant to achieve stabilization without requiring any a priori knowledge of the uncertainties appearing in the dynamics of the exosystem and the system. Furthermore, we apply the nonparametric learning framework to globally reconstruct and estimate multiple sinusoidal signals with unknown frequencies without the need for adaptive parametric techniques. An explicit nonlinear mapping can directly provide the estimated parameters, which will exponentially converge to the unknown frequencies. Finally, a feedforward control design is proposed to solve the linear output regulation problem using the nonparametric learning framework. Two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Linear systems admit the exploitation of this duality via the formulation of an explicit dual system, which is controllable iff the original system is observable and vice versa. While in the context of linear systems the duality is understood well and facilitates the conversion of controller and observer design schemes, there are a number of interesting and complex intricacies when it comes to nonlinear systems. This article aims to extend the geometric relationship between the controllable subspace of a linear system and the unobservable subspace of its dual to the realm of nonlinear systems on smooth manifolds. To this end, we prove the local existence of a dynamic system that can, in a geometric sense, be considered dual to the original one.},

  abstract     = {The discrete-time, infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is studied with the objective of establishing a unified perspective on the problem by relying simultaneously on Dynamic Programming and the discrete Minimum Principle. While it is well known that the two strategies independently yield the optimal solution, it is shown here that their combination provides much deeper insights on the nature of the optimal solution and on the strategies by means of which it can be computed. More precisely, the optimal cost, captured by the matrix P, and the feedback gain matrix K are jointly related via the observability matrix of the underlying state/costate (Hamiltonian) dynamics when the state alone is measured. Such an abstract property is then instrumental for deriving alternative characterizations of the optimal solution. First, an algebraic equation, referred to as the policy algebraic equation, is established in the variable K alone and with dimension typically much smaller than the size of the classic ARE arising in discrete-time LQR, although comprising polynomial equations of higher degree. This equation permits the direct construction of the optimal feedback gain (i.e., the actor) without the need for the simultaneous computation of the optimal cost (i.e., the critic). The structure of the policy algebraic equation naturally lends itself to an iterative approach towards its solution, which is restricted to the space of policies alone and which does not require the explicit solution of any intermediate (linear) equation at each step. Furthermore, as a consequence of the above properties, it is possible to derive a Riccati equation in P, although with coefficients defined by polynomial functions of K, with the property that the constant and quadratic terms are symmetric and sign-definite. This aspect is remarkably different from the classic ARE associated to the discrete-time LQR and more akin to the continuous-time counterpart.},
