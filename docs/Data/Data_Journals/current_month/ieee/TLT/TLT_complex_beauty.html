  abstract     = {Cultural differences can impact how learning is delivered in higher education. Past studies have overlooked the impacts of specific cultures on learning and technology integration, and therefore, this article explores aspects of culture and resource implications for technology-enabled learning. The study collected data from students, lecturers, and university administrators at the University of Papua New Guinea via questionnaire (n = 58), focus group (n = 15), and interview (n = 2). Descriptive statistics of questionnaire responses supplemented by conventional content analysis of interview and focus group responses revealed perceptions of higher education and teaching in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Often, learning technologies are adopted without careful consideration of the users’ requirements, especially their cultural influences, which sometimes hinder the effective implementation of chosen technologies for learning. This article discusses the key findings related to technology limitations, cultural influences, communication issues, and other challenges unique to PNG. It highlights that students and lecturers are keen to embrace technology in teaching and learning; however, institutional constraints hinder the successful implementation of technology that would allow them to advance learning. This, coupled with cultural influences such as traditional customs, practices, and belief systems, also affects how Western education is delivered. The article concludes with recommendations for implementing culturally sensitive learning management systems that can accommodate infrastructure and social challenges.},

  abstract     = {In an online learning environment, both instruction and assessments take place virtually where students are primarily responsible for managing their own learning. This requires a high level of self-regulation from students. Many online students, however, lack self-regulation skills and are ill-prepared for autonomous learning, which can cause students to feel disengaged from online activities. In addition, students tend to feel isolated during online activities due to limited social interaction. To address these challenges, this study explores the use of chatbots to facilitate students’ self-regulated learning strategies and promote social presence to alleviate their feelings of isolation. Using a two-phase mixed-methods design, this study evaluates students’ behavioral engagement, perceived self-regulated learning strategies, and social presence in chatbot-supported online learning. In the first phase (Stage I Study), 39 students engaged in a goal-setting chatbot activity that employed the SMART framework and social presence indicators. The findings served as the basis for improving the chatbot design in the second phase (Stage II Study), in which 25 students interacted with the revised chatbot, focusing on goal-setting, help-seeking, self-evaluation, and social interaction with instructor&#39;s presence. The results show that the students in both studies had positive online learning experiences with the chatbots. Follow-up interviews with students and instructors provide valuable insights and suggestions for refining the chatbot design, such as chatbots for ongoing monitoring of self-regulation habits and personalized social interaction. Drawing from the evidence, we discuss a set of chatbot design principles that support students’ self-regulated learning and social presence in online settings.},

  abstract     = {RoblockLLy is an educational robotics simulator designed for primary and secondary school students, whose goal is to increase their interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In the particular case of computer science, it allows developing computational thinking skills. It has been designed with ease of use in mind. This free tool is available through a web browser and does not need a complex installation or specific hardware requirements, allowing educational robotics to be introduced to a wide range of users by working on practical projects that will help them understand key concepts of robotics and programming. The effectiveness of RoblockLLy has been validated based on motivation, usability, and user experience criteria. The tool was validated with 212 secondary school students (12–16 years old). Specifically, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, usability with the System Usability Scale, and user experience with the User Experience Questionnaire. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that students perceived RoblockLLy as a novel and interesting tool. The ratings for usability were predominantly positive, although a few students indicated a preference for expert assistance. The overall rating of the user experience was positive as well, yet notable differences in attitudes toward motivation and usability were observed between genders.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict students&#39; future performances based on their former exercises and additional information in educational settings. KT has received significant attention since it facilitates personalized experiences in educational situations. Simultaneously, the autoregressive (AR) modeling on the sequence of former exercises has been proven effective for this task. One of the primary challenges in AR modeling for KT is effectively representing the anterior (preresponse) and posterior (postresponse) states of learners across exercises. Existing methods often employ complex model architectures to update learner states using question and response records. In this study, we propose a novel perspective on KT task by treating it as a generative process, consistent with the principles of AR models. We demonstrate that knowledge states can be directly represented through AR encodings on a question–response alternate sequence, where model generate the most probable representation in hidden state space by analyzing history interactions. This approach underpins our framework, termed alternate autoregressive KT (AAKT). In addition, we incorporate supplementary educational information, such as question-related skills, into our framework through an auxiliary task, and include extra exercise details, such as response time, as additional inputs. Our proposed framework is implemented using advanced AR technologies from Natural Language Generation for both training and prediction. Empirical evaluations on four real-world KT datasets indicate that AAKT consistently outperforms all baseline models in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, and root mean square error. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies and visualized analysis validate the effectiveness of key components in AAKT.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces the development process of social presence-enabled augmented reality (SPEAR) tool, an innovative augmented reality (AR) based learning application tailored for online engineering education. SPEAR focuses on a learning module of structural beam-bending, empowering users to seamlessly integrate 3-D virtual beams into their real-world environment, using the AR Foundation framework within the Unity game engine. Learners can explore structural mechanics by manipulating loads and positions. SPEAR leverages a custom C# script based on the finite element method to offer a real-time simulation of beam deformation, accompanied by visualizations of the moment/shear diagrams and bending stresses. In addition, the integration of a cloud-based voice chat feature, photon unity networking 2, enhances social presence, fostering collaborative learning. Usability testing conducted with extended reality developers and structural engineers, utilizing the system usability scale, confirmed SPEAR&#39;s user-friendliness and intuitive interface. Results indicate high levels of participant satisfaction, validating its design and functionality. This study contributes to the field by highlighting SPEAR&#39;s pedagogical potential to enhance online engineering education through immersive AR experiences and social interaction. It offers a promising avenue for improving student engagement, comprehension, and performance. In addition, SPEAR facilitates future research into new learning theories and materials design strategies. Its versatility makes it a valuable tool for innovative online education approaches, potentially revolutionizing the learning experiences for students worldwide.},
