  abstract     = {3D occupancy perception holds a pivotal role in recent vision-centric autonomous driving systems by converting surround-view images into integrated geometric and semantic representations within dense 3D grids. Nevertheless, current models still encounter two main challenges: modeling depth accurately in the 2D-3D view transformation stage, and overcoming the lack of generalizability issues due to sparse LiDAR supervision. To address these issues, this paper presents GEOcc, a Geometric-Enhanced Occupancy network tailored for vision-only surround-view perception. Our approach is three-fold: 1) Integration of explicit lift-based depth prediction and implicit projection-based transformers for depth modeling, enhancing the density and robustness of view transformation. 2) Utilization of mask-based encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained semantic predictions; 3) Adoption of context-aware self-training loss functions in the pertaining stage to complement LiDAR supervision, involving the re-rendering of 2D depth maps from 3D occupancy features and leveraging image reconstruction loss to obtain denser depth supervision besides sparse LiDAR ground-truths. Our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with the least image resolution needed and the most weightless image backbone compared with current models, marking an improvement of 3.3% due to our proposed contributions. Comprehensive experimentation also demonstrates the consistent superiority of our method over baselines and alternative approaches.

  abstract     = {Flight safety incidents, such as hard landings and tail strike risks, represent critical concerns during the landing phase. Although Quick Access Recorder (QAR) systems collect extensive multivariate flight data, previous studies have faced challenges in effectively modeling the complex interdependencies between flight parameters, which has limited their ability to predict multiple safety incidents simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, named MDGNN, to capture hidden spatio-temporal dependencies and predict both hard landing and tail strike risk incidents. Specifically, we employ temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to extract both localized representations and long-term temporal trends from multivariate flight data, ensuring the standardization of flight parameters across varying frequencies. Additionally, we are the first to construct a dynamic graph to model temporal relationships, applying a dynamic graph neural network and a temporal convolution module to accurately capture intricate spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on 37,904 Airbus A320 flight samples demonstrate that the MDGNN model surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a case study visualizing key flight parameters highlights the model’s ability to reveal the root causes of safety exceedances, offering valuable insights for flight safety analysis.},

The presence of dynamic objects incurs camera motion estimation errors, motion blur, and occlusions, which induce significant challenges for network training. To address these issues, we introduce EDS-Depth, a self-supervised learning framework, that improves monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes. Firstly, we propose a novel TCE (Temporal Continuity Enhancement) strategy to reduce camera motion estimation errors and motion blur caused by dynamic objects. Video frames are interpolated to generate more continuous frames in order to smooth dynamic changes and enrich motion details. Secondly, we design a novel IPDM (Iterative Pseudo Depth Masking) module to address inaccurate object motion and occlusions in dynamic scenes. The module integrates multiple optical flows from different frames for triangulation, generating optimal depth as pseudo-supervision labels in dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EDS-Depth, which surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods, particularly in dynamic scenes.},

The final dataset includes forty variables related to pedestrian characteristics, environmental circumstances, and vehicle specifications. Pedestrian injury severity was divided into three categories: fatal, injury, and no injury. The novelty of this approach lies in the application of explainable AI (XAI), specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, to interpret the AutoML model’s predictions. This combination not only addressed the opaqueness typically associated with AI “black box” models but also illuminated the critical variables influencing pedestrian injury severity outcomes. The results revealed that the weighted ensemble model emerged as top performers, showcasing high accuracy with minimal prediction times, demonstrating the potential of ensemble methods in improving prediction outcomes by integrating the strengths of various individual models. Furthermore, the global and local explainability analyses provided by SHAP values afforded us an in-depth understanding of the variables influencing pedestrian injury severity. This dual-level explanation offered valuable insights into the complex dynamics at play, ranging from pedestrian impairment and driver condition to environmental variables like lighting and weather conditions. These findings underscore the importance of specific variables in crash outcomes, offering actionable intelligence for targeted interventions.},

This paper presents a performance-prescribed optimal control algorithm using control barrier function (CBF)-based reinforcement learning (RL) to address the above problem, which contains two key contributions. First, a special CBF-based argument term is developed and embedded into the reward function to characterize environmental feedback regarding the risk of violating constraints, which enables the controller to confine enclosing errors within declared boundaries with minimal intervention. Second, a critic-only neural network is utilized to synthesize the optimal control policy, where a novel fixed-time updating law is presented to accelerate the weight convergence to ideal values within a fixed settling time, thereby enhancing the online learning ability and further improving control performance. Theoretical outcomes related to learning convergence, safety, stability, and robustness are rigorously verified. Simulations reveal that the proposed strategy outperforms the previously designed enclosing controllers based on the non-RL and RL ways in terms of complying with prescribed safety constraints and optimizing long-term performance.},

This work studies the optimal real-time bidding strategy for an EV aggregator. Since the charging process of EVs is time-coupled, it is necessary for EV aggregators to consider future operational conditions (e.g., future EV arrivals) when deciding the current bidding strategy. However, accurately forecasting future operational conditions is challenging under the inherent uncertainties. Hence, there demands a real-time bidding strategy based solely on the up-to-date information, which is the main goal of this work. We start by developing an online optimal EV charging management algorithm for the EV aggregator via Lyapunov optimization. Based on this, an optimal real-time bidding strategy (bidding function and bounds) for the aggregator is derived. Then, an efficient yet practical algorithm is proposed to obtain the bidding strategy. It shows that the cost of the aggregator is nearly offline optimal with the proposed bidding strategy. Moreover, the wholesale electricity market clearing result aligns with the individual aggregator’s optimal charging strategy given the prices. Case studies against several benchmarks are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high line-of-sight communications have been explored as a complement to emergency communication vehicles (ECVs), particularly when ground Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is dysfunctional resulting from natural disasters. To protect the communication security and integrity of this air-ground integrated networks created in an untrusted and open wireless environment, authentication and key agreement (AKA) is an essential mechanism to establish a secure communication channel by negotiating a session key. Nonetheless, general AKA protocols are typically not ideal for time-sensitive and computing-intensive UAVs-assisted IoVs emergency rescue, in that they are unable to simultaneously satisfy efficiency and key security requirements including accountability, resilience, thresholds changeability, shares verifiability, group adaptability, and key update. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an accountable group authentication and key agreement (GAKA) protocol with changeable thresholds and verifiable shares supporting adaptive group memberships and updatable keys (i.e. SecER). To safeguard accurate rescue decisions for ground ECVs enabled by reliable collaboration among multiple UAVs, we propose a pseudonym mechanism that aims to provide accountability for UAVs. To achieve resilience and thresholds changeability, our SecER utilizes secret sharing coupled with random parameters to seamlessly transform our GAKA protocol into one running with a new threshold in one round (i.e. round-optimal), rather than two rounds. Finally, verifiable parameters and updatable keys are respectively applied to counter deception attacks caused by maliciously distributed shares and to support adaptive network topology (i.e. UAVs joining and leaving). Extensive simulations show that compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our SecER is superior in balancing security and efficiency.},

This approach quantifies the probability of positioning failure, which is the probability of the position estimator being outside a safety-region, and compares it against an application specific requirement. The design of positioning algorithms for safety-critical applications, such as automated/autonomous vehicles, should consider the dependence between parameter or state estimation and statistical hypothesis testing for model misspecifications in the evaluation of positioning safety. If this dependence is not considered, as this article shows, the conclusions drawn from the positioning safety analysis might be overly-optimistic. Therefore, this article focuses on the aforementioned dependence through a vehicle positioning scenario based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Detection, Identification, and Adaptation (DIA) method for misspecifications in the motion and measurement models. Grounded in the distributional theory for the DIA method, our positioning safety analysis utilizes the conditional probability density functions (PDFs) of the combined EKF and DIA position error, which are generally nonnormal. We compute the probability of vehicle positioning failure in two cases 1) when the dependence is considered and 2) when it is not, to quantify the over-optimism introduced by ignoring this dependence. Finally, we present our conclusions and recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Although the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been successfully applied in search and rescue operations for locating lost or damaged vehicles due to its significance in precise positioning, there are still challenges. To enhance the accuracy of localization, positioning can be done with the collaborative estimation provided by neighbouring mobile terminals as reference vehicles. Meanwhile, there are security and privacy implications associated with such an approach – e.g., potential for privacy leakage of both the positioning-related data (e.g., positions of reference vehicles, distances between reference vehicles and the target vehicle) and the estimated positions of the target vehicle. Such concerns are important to address in deployments for sensitive applications such as defense. For example, the location information of a damage vehicle on the battlefield should only be securely evaluated by search unit and be successfully decrypted by an authorized set of officers in rescue unit with the required authorization levels. Accordingly, the threshold should be flexibly allocated and changed for types of security surroundings. However, existing techniques of threshold public key homomorphic encryption approaches are not only computationally and communication intensive, but merely support a fixed pre-defined threshold. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient multilevel threshold changeable homomorphic data encapsulation mechanism (MCTh-HDEM). In MCTh-HDEM, we leverage the technique of multilevel threshold changeable secret sharing in order to support both batch encryption and lightweight matrix calculations in the encrypted domain, and also multilevel threshold changeable decryption. Then, we design a lightweight privacy-preserving vehicle positioning scheme (PPVPS), by refining our proposed MCTh-HDEM. The position of the lost and damaged target vehicle on the battlefield would be efficiently inferred by a set of reference vehicles in search unit while protecting positioning related data, and the target vehicle location can be flexibly decrypted by rescue unit. Finally, we give the formal security proofs of our proposed MCTh-HDEM and PPVPS. The performance evaluation and extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposal.},

This paper introduces a Digital Twin (DT)-based collaboration architecture for resource management in UAV swarms, connecting realistic task crowdsourcing and virtual traffic flow scheduling to achieve a complementary multi-UAV swarm allocation. We propose an intelligent dynamic task crowdsourcing scheme that manages the swarm scale and membership configuration of multiple UAV swarms based on theoretical evaluation results. The architecture constructs DTs of UAV swarms and shifts the scheduling of traffic flow paths to the virtual world, thereby sidestepping the overhead of routing configuration and network reorganisation. With the aid of a traffic flow allocation algorithm based on Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC), the virtual swarm pre-schedules traffic flows and assesses end-to-end delay theoretically, so as to achieve a collaborative deployment of sensing, computational, and communication resources within the swarm. The simulation results substantiate that our architecture can uphold a 90% achievement ratio for task requirements while keeping UAV costs comparable to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Technological advancements focus on developing comfortable and acceptable driving characteristics in autonomous vehicles. Present driving functions predominantly possess predefined parameters, and there is no universally accepted driving style for autonomous vehicles. While driving may be technically safe and the likelihood of road accidents is reduced, passengers may still feel insecure due to a mismatch in driving styles between the human and the autonomous system. Incorporating driving style preferences into automated vehicles enhances acceptance, reduces uncertainty, and poses the opportunity to expedite their adoption. Despite the increased research focus on driving styles, there remains a need for comprehensive studies investigating how variations in the driving context impact the assessment of automated driving functions. Therefore, this work evaluates lateral driving style preferences for autonomous vehicles on rural roads, considering different weather and traffic situations. A controlled study was conducted with a variety of German participants utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator. The participants experienced four different driving styles, including mimicking of their own driving behavior under two weather conditions. A notable preference for a more passive driving style became evident based on statistical analyses of participants’ responses during and after the drives. This study could not confirm the hypothesis that people prefer to be driven by mimicking their own driving behavior. Furthermore, the study illustrated that weather conditions and oncoming traffic substantially influence the perceived comfort during autonomous rides. The gathered dataset is openly accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhaselberger/idcld-subject-study-on-driving-style-preferences.},

  abstract     = {Learning-based techniques hold considerable promise in achieving human-like autonomous driving. However, one deployed policy encounters difficulties in satisfying the drivers’ diverse decision-making preferences simultaneously. Meanwhile, training personalized policies for each driver from scratch is time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a human-guided continual learning framework, wherein the human drivers could real-time take over a deployed policy when it performs unsatisfactorily, and the autonomous vehicle (AV) agent would automatically acquire human demonstrations and dynamically alter itself in accordance with personalized decision-making preference. Furthermore, a priority experience memory-enabled elastic weight consolidation (PEM-EWC) mechanism is developed to prevent the AV agent from overfitting to a limited number of human demonstrations and catastrophically forgetting its acquired fundamental driving abilities. Driver-in-the-loop simulations and real-world experiments are conducted in representative autonomous driving decision-making scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the superior equilibrium of our proposed approach in terms of driving safety, human likeness, and training efficiency, compared to other baselines, which suggests that it provides a promising solution for personalized decision-making in autonomous driving.

First, we establish the path tracking control system for the tractor-trailer truck, incorporating the hitch angle and hitch angle rate into the system state to minimize trailer sway. On this basis, an adaptive robust preview control method is developed, integrating feedforward and feedback control to improve tracking performance and robustness. The feedforward controller is designed to proactively minimize tracking errors. In the feedback control, an adaptive observer-based $H_{\infty } $ robust feedback controller is developed to limit the effects of stochastic disturbances, where an innovative preview distance model, considering variable vehicle velocity and path curvature, is applied to achieve preview control. Then, based on the $H_{\infty } $ theory, the design criterion of the proposed feedback controller is established, where bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) is transformed into linear matrix inequality (LMI) to solve the observer and controller gains. Additionally, the fuzzy algorithm is performed to enable the feedback controller to adapt to variable velocity. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a hardware-in-the-loop platform.

  abstract     = {Traffic flow imputation aims to estimate missing flow values within a traffic network. While machine learning methods have been widely applied to this challenge and outperformed conventional approaches, the current literature must explore the potential benefits of integrating network indices into traffic flow imputation. Network indices encompass attributes associated with nodes and links, such as centrality measures, which provide valuable insights into the network’s structure. This study proposes adopting network indices in addition to link features to enhance the accuracy of traffic flow imputation. Our proposed feature set incorporates network indices from the original graph and its line graph transformation, alongside inherent link features. Subsequently, we employ a correlation matrix analysis to discern relationships between features, thus excluding dependent features. We estimate missing traffic flow based on the proposed feature set by utilizing five state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods, including KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT). The results of testing our proposed method across various traffic networks with varying sizes (Sioux Falls, Anaheim, and Chicago) and under different missing rates (0.1-0.9) consistently demonstrate that each machine learning method experiences an improvement in imputation accuracy when augmented with network indices. More specifically, on the Anaheim dataset, our proposed approach improves by 8.74% with KNN, 3.26% with Random Forest, 2.69% with XGBoost, 4.88% with GCN, and 4.85% with GAT, compared to using only link properties as the feature set, in terms of PCC. Our study also includes further investigations into feature importance and computational cost analysis of network indices.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian intent prediction is critical for autonomous driving, as accurately predicting crossing intentions helps prevent collisions and ensures the safety of both pedestrians and passengers. Recent research has focused on vision-based deep neural networks for this task, but challenges remain. First, current methods suffer from low efficiency in multi-feature fusion and unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. Additionally, real-time performance is essential in practical applications, so the efficiency of the algorithm is crucial. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture, Dual-STGAT, which uses a dual-level spatio-temporal graph network to extract pedestrian pose and scene interaction features, reducing information loss and improving feature fusion efficiency. The model captures key features of pedestrian behavior and the surrounding environment through two modules: the Pedestrian Module and the Scene Module. The Pedestrian Module extracts pedestrian motion features using a spatio-temporal graph attention network, while the Scene Module models interactions between pedestrians and surrounding objects by integrating visual, semantic, and motion information through a graph network. Extensive experiments conducted on the PIE and JAAD datasets show that Dual-STGAT achieves over 90% accuracy in pedestrian crossing intention prediction, with inference latency close to 5ms, making it well-suited for large-scale production autonomous driving systems that demand both performance and computational efficiency.},

The learning-based component is trained using reinforcement learning techniques to reduce traveling time, minimize control interventions, and set the priority ratio between the AV and pedestrians.

A complex game-theory-based pedestrian model is formulated and analyzed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed velocity planning method.

However, directly applying traditional single-authority CP-ABE schemes may result in single-point performance bottleneck. Besides, the secrets of the whole system may be leaked if any node is attacked. To solve these challenging tasks, we proposed MA-CP-ABE-CRF, a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme with cryptographic reverse firewalls. The system is designed to grant vehicles fine-grained access control by encrypting data under vehicle attributes. Besides, load balancing of authorization in distributed systems is achieved based on the characteristic of multi-authority. Meanwhile, specific nodes are equipped with cryptographic reverse firewalls (CRFs) to prevent information leakage. As the first scheme with the above features for Internet of vehicles, the system achieves adaptive CPA-security and ASA-security.

In this work, the synthetic image generation model (SIGM) is proposed to generate images to synthesize rain and fog effects for testing CFs. First, to synthesize the rain blur effects on raw images, the geometric-physical fusion model is proposed based on the properties of raindrop microparticles and vehicle features. In this model, the position distribution of raindrops is determined by the geometric model part, and the image pixel effects are realized by the physical model part. Second, the atmospheric scattering model is used to synthesize the fog effect and contains two parts: an airlight estimation model to estimate airlight values and a transmittance estimation model, where the corrected image depth and fog microphysical information based on the Mie theory are used to determine the fog transmittance. Finally, SIGM is validated through real rain and fog in image quality, testing CFs with synthetic images and videos. The result absolute error sum obtained with SIGM (0.45) is smaller than that of the simulation software (0.57) and another synthetic method (0.65), and all unrecognized targets identified by SIGM match the real test results, whereas both the simulation software and another synthetic method fail to accurately test CF. The experimental results indicate that the proposed SIGM has higher authenticity and reliability than testing using the simulation platform and has higher efficiency, controllability, repeatability, and safety than testing using real vehicle.},

An advanced multi-frequency impedance measurement (MFIM) system was used to operate the IL sensors. For a passing vehicle, the impedance of every IL sensor at three different operating frequencies is computed and finally recorded at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. Each of the 12 recorded signals provides a complex-value vehicle magnetic profile (VMP).

Eight machine learning algorithms were implemented using ready-made Python3 implementations. Cross-validation accuracy was tested for five feature configurations, including slim and wide IL sensors.

The inherent stochasticity and dynamic nature in both passenger demand and drivers’ decision-making pose challenges in capturing vacant taxis movements. This study proposes a novel deep clustering framework to comprehensively uncover passenger-searching strategies from extensive trajectory data. Specifically, multiple features from vacant searching trips are extracted and analogously defined as multi-channel images, where each channel corresponds to a specific feature. A novel deep image clustering approach is then proposed, integrating a feature representation module utilizing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), a self-expression module for affinity learning, a spectral clustering module, and a classification module for self-supervision. An effective training procedure is also presented for the proposed deep clustering framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against benchmark methods. Based on the clustering results, common and specific passenger searching strategies are further revealed. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of individual’s contextual experience in explaining searching behavior and operational efficiency. Moreover, drivers cruising without clear searching strategy often exhibit lower performance, and some drivers may gamble with peers to increase their chances of picking up passengers. These results deliver important justifications for future studies and provide managerial implications to improve on-demand mobility.},

We aim to minimize VUEs’ weighted sum energy consumption by jointly optimizing VUEs’ association, data partition, computing resource allocation, power control, and bandwidth assignment under the constraints of maximum tolerant latency, maximum number of outage time slots, computation capacity at each satellite and each RSU, and maximum allowable transmission power at VUEs. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative algorithm by decomposing the original non-convex problem into several sub-problems. We efficiently solve each sub-problem by utilizing variable substitutions, the difference of convex functions algorithms, the Lagrangian dual method, and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucke conditions. Simulation results show that the introduced satellite-terrestrial integrated networks-enabled VEC scheme significantly reduces VUEs’ energy consumption compared to other schemes.},

This paper addresses the crucial need for efficient ML model training in the context of Federated Learning (FL) within vehicular networks. Recognizing the limitations imposed by the tradeoff between the high energy cost at the local level with the performance problem at the global level, we propose an innovative approach that harmonizes cost optimization with strategic model selection. Our strategy primarily focuses on optimizing energy consumption during model training and updating at the vehicle end, thereby resolving the prevalent issue of limited end-user participation in FL due to high energy demands. Additionally, we introduce an advanced model selection method, prioritizing local model uploads and adaptively allocating bandwidth to clients with more extensive training data. This method enhances the efficiency and reliability of model updates, ensuring robust global model performance. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating not only improved learning performance but also a significant reduction in energy consumption among participating clients.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled numerous inventive solutions to multiple problems, considerably facilitating our daily lives; however, UAVs frequently rely on an open wireless channel for communication, making them susceptible to cyber-physical threats. Also, UAVs cannot execute complicated cryptographic algorithms due to their limited onboard computing capabilities. Balancing high-security levels and minimum computation costs is imperative when developing a security solution for UAVs. Consequently, several proxy signature schemes have been proposed in the literature to fulfill these requirements. Nevertheless, many of these solutions face the issue of high computation costs, and some exhibit security vulnerabilities that could not be more feasible options for UAV communication. Considering these constraints in mind, in this article, we introduce an improvised certificate-based proxy signature scheme (ICPS), which leverages the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) to meet the security and efficiency requirements of UAV networks. The proposed ICPS scheme offers a range of notable features, including its ability to address key escrow and secret key distribution issues. The proposed ICPS scheme’s security hardness has been evaluated using the widely known security tool, the random oracle model (ROM), proving its resilience against known and unknown cybersecurity threats. Finally, this study conducts a performance comparison of the proposed scheme against existing schemes, emphasizing its outstanding cost-efficiency. Notably, the computation cost is measured at 5.3536 ms and the communication cost at 1120 bits, substantially lower than relevant existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) empower vehicles equipped with onboard units to exchange traffic-related messages, enhancing vehicle navigation safety and efficiency. Providing secure privacy-preserving authentication schemes for VANETs is indispensable. It ensures that only legitimate vehicles can communicate, preventing external adversaries from injecting falsifiable information that could mislead vehicles, cause accidents, or disrupt traffic flow. Simultaneously, the privacy-preserving features prevent curious adversaries from compromising vehicle privacy and tracking users. Secure centralized vehicular communication protocols, where a single entity issues certificates for all vehicles, face challenges in enabling cross-domain communications. Adoption of such centralized protocols necessitates that vehicles within each domain possess their certificate authority, restricting cross-domain communication due to inherent distrust in the certificate authorities of other domains. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Privacy-preserving Message Authentication protocol for VANET Emergency message exchange (CP-MAVE), designed to ensure message authentication, integrity, and anonymity of vehicles across different domains. In the event of misbehavior, distributed key generation centers collaborate to trace back the identity of the vehicle. To evaluate the security of our protocol, we formally prove the existential unforgeability of CP-MAVE against chosen message attacks based on the intractability of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that CP-MAVE achieves message authentication, conditional privacy preservation, and resilience against replay and modification attacks. Moreover, we model and analayze CP-MAVE using the Tamarin prover and show that CP-MAVE maintains the secrecy and the message authentication of the vehicle traffic messages. Furthermore, we evaluate CP-MAVE’s performance regarding communication overhead and computation complexity. On a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B/8GB, equipped with a 1.5 GHz 64-bit Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, CP-MAVE requires a 304-byte communication overhead and 9.4897 msec as cryptographic operation overhead. Finally, to simulate the flow of messages between entities in our protocol, we implement CP-MAVE using socket programming, resulting in an end-to-end delay of 111.05 msec.},

  abstract     = {Currently, heterogeneous driving scenarios and complex traffic conditions challenge connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to achieve accurate sensing of road conditions. Existing research on the sensing capabilities of vehicles only relys on adding more onboard sensors, which makes the driving safety unable to be guaranteed due to the installment and cost limit of various sensors. Therefore, this paper proposes an enhanced 3D sensor deployment method to break through the sensing capabilities of CAVs’ own equipment limitations. By efficiently utilizing road infrastructure, reasonable roadside sensor deployment will effectively assist CAVs to expand the sensing range and improve overall sensing accuracy. Firstly, in order to address the limitations of existing works that often rely on simplified sensor models and idealized road conditions, we propose a Bresenham-based sensor and environment model that can be used to construct realistic road environments. Secondly, a decision transformer (DT)-based method is adopted to solve the problem of optimal deployment of sensors in road environments. Our approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional static deployment methods, which often fail to consider the complexities of real-world driving conditions and the diverse factors influencing optimal sensor deployment. Finally, in order to solve the problem of DT delayed rewards, we propose a two-layer optimization method to redistribute the reward function to solve the challenge of local optimization. A large number of simulations oriented to sensing effects not only verify the effectiveness of the sensor deployment method but also ensure the reliability of sensing assistance.},

Most previous lane detection methods focus exclusively on analyzing individual images and overlook the inter-frame dynamics, while car-mounted cameras capture continuous streams amenable to leveraging intra-video context. In challenging scenes with blur, occlusion, or illumination variations, considering visible lanes from previous frames can aid current frame interpretation. To tackle above challenges, we introduce a parallel heterogeneous framework, called PHNet, for video lane detection. First, a novel router automatically analyzes multi-level features to determine the inference route of candidates with different visual cues. Then, a cross-frame attention mechanism leverages relationships between current candidates and positive embeddings from past frame to aggregate contextual cues. Unlike existing offline video lane detection methods, which face limitations in handling long video sequences and real-time video streams due to computational constraints, our proposed method operates as an online framework capable of processing clips of any length. Our method demonstrates robust lane detection through temporally association modeling and efficient online inference. The extensive experiments on public benchmark show that PHNet has superior performance versus state-of-the-art video lane detection methods.},

We introduce a synergistic methodology that combines SwAV for effective unsupervised learning and YOLO for efficient object detection, enabling the model to learn intricate feature representations of pavement surface distress.

Our experiments on the GRDDC and IRRDD datasets demonstrate that CL-PSDD achieves competitive mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of 76% and 60%, respectively, rivaling the performance of supervised methods and excelling in generalization.

The CGC module constructs a spatiotemporal graph model of the cyclist with both the behavioral and risk information. The RLG module leverages the graph representation method (GRM) to extract features and assigns risk labels using unsupervised learning. The RA module employs spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCN) to extract features from the cyclist graph. Additionally, it facilitates feature fusion through interactions between the human body and the two-wheeler and between hierarchical levels. The fused features, along with the risk labels, are used to train a classifier for the risk assessment of cyclists.

First, the road code that contains sufficient location information is designed, and the regression-based one-stage road code detection network is developed. The network can detect road code accurately and in real-time, and then road-end location information can be obtained through decoding and pose estimation. An inertial odometer is used to acquire vehicle-end location measurements. Then an Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF) is designed to correct the vehicle-end location with that of the road-end and output high-precision location information. We conducted road tests to validate the performance of the proposed positioning system.

However, existing array self-position determination methods show decrease in performance under multipath environments. To deal with this problem, we propose an array self-position determination method based on orthogonal grid matching with the spatial differencing method. Specifically, the direction of arrival (DOA) of direct path and multipath signals are respectively estimated by array spatial differencing method. The matching accuracy is enhanced by utilizing the prior information of direct path signal. After calculating correlation coefficients of different sources, estimated angles with high correlation are then classified into the same set. Then, the noise subspace of each angle set is reconstructed and the position is estimated by grid matching with the orthogonal property between the noise subspaces and the characteristic steering vectors. The matching results of redundant angle sets are removed as non-matching items, thus averting positioning deviations. The simulation results demonstrate that the computational complexity of the proposed method is comparable to that of the signal subspace fitting (SSF). Moreover, in terms of positioning precision, the proposed method outperforms multiple signal classification with enhanced spatial smoothing (ESSMUSIC), initial signal fitting (ISF), and SSF.},

Human error, often stemming from risky driving behaviors, contributes significantly to traffic crashes. Identifying and mitigating these behaviors through advanced technologies and data analysis has become an important concern in the field of traffic safety management. This study introduces an unsupervised learning algorithm for detecting risky driving behaviors on expressways within Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) environments, employing deep clustering techniques to analyze individual driving patterns from Probe Vehicle Data (PVD). Utilizing data from 116 vehicles, including buses and heavy trucks, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based autoencoder was employed to extract latent hierarchical features, facilitating the clustering of similar driving patterns. Elementary Driving Behaviors (EDBs) were identified for different vehicle types and driving statuses, serving as a foundation for detecting risky driving behaviors against the proposed criteria. The research revealed a clear positive correlation between detected risky driving behaviors and traffic crashes across the vehicle types. Furthermore, when comparing our model’s criteria with traditional safety indexes, our proposed model demonstrated stronger correlations with traffic crashes, indicating its effectiveness in expressway driving environments. This research not only introduces a novel method for identifying risky driving behaviors but also underscores the importance of tailored traffic safety interventions in enhancing C-ITS environments.},

  abstract     = {The assessment of safety performance plays a pivotal role in the development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). A common approach involves designing testing scenarios based on prior knowledge of CAVs (e.g., surrogate models), conducting tests in these scenarios, and subsequently evaluating CAVs’ safety performances. However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency. In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process. Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency. We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming. To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency. Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps. The effectiveness of our method is validated in high-dimensional overtaking scenarios, demonstrating that our approach achieves notable evaluation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can capture spatio-temporal vibration images of vehicles on expressways, which can be utilized for traffic monitoring. Compared to ubiquitously deployed cameras, DAS traffic monitoring offers advantages such as full coverage, resistance to environmental interference, low computational requirements, and cost-effectiveness. However, real-world complexities result in challenges for DAS traffic images, including low signal-to-noise ratio, signal missing, and uneven intensity. As DAS traffic applications are still in their early stages, effective solutions to these challenges are yet to be developed. This paper proposes a new deep learning method named DAS High Speed Traffic Trajectory (DAS-HTT) network, which contributes threefold: (i) Multi-Scale Context Extraction Module (MSCE) effectively enlarges the receptive field to capture long-range contextual information comprehensively; (ii) Stripe Convolution Decoder (SCD) acquires remote information along four directions, preventing irrelevant region interference in feature learning; (iii) Hierarchically Hough Transform Fusion Decoder (HHTFD) introduces the structural information of trajectory linearity, reducing the reliance on label data while enhancing trajectory continuity. We conducted experiments on an operating expressway, demonstrating that DAS-HTT outperforms existing methods across seven metrics, providing trajectories that are more consistent with ground truthes.},

  abstract     = {Commercial complex is a compositional scenario that involves pedestrians with different travel purposes such as commuting, shopping and business. Simulation of pedestrian behavior in a commercial complex is difficult due to the heterogeneity of pedestrians and different attractions from various kinds of shops. Inspired from the law of universal gravitation and the pedestrian dynamics theory, we propose an attractive potential based social force framework for pedestrian simulation in commercial complexes. Our framework consists of an attractive potential model and an attractive potential based social force model. The former model evaluates the attractive force of different types of shops towards heterogeneous pedestrians, by associating the attributes of pedestrians with the types of shops. The latter model effectively evaluates the travel direction of pedestrians by incorporating the attractive force with the social force model via a synthesis force criterion. We conduct the simulation experiment based on 600 groups of pedestrian tracking data collected in the China World Mall, Beijing, a typical commercial complex. The simulation results show that the model can effectively simulate not only the trajectory of real pedestrians, but also the behavior of entering shops. Our research significantly improves the authenticity of pedestrian simulation and provides support for travel behavior modeling of heterogeneous pedestrians in the commercial complex.},

High-resolution loop detector data and signal state records from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) offer new opportunities for traffic signal optimization at intersections. However, additional factors such as geometry, traffic volumes, Turning-Movement Counts (TMCs), and human driving behaviors complicate this task. Existing simulators (e.g., SUMO, Vissim) are computationally intensive, while machine learning models often lack lane-specific traffic flow estimation. To address these issues, we propose two computationally efficient Attentional Graph Auto-Encoder frameworks as “Digital Twins” for urban traffic intersections. Leveraging graph representations and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), our models capture lane-level traffic flow dynamics at entry and exit points while remaining agnostic to intersection topology and lane configurations. Trained on over 40,000 hours of realistic traffic simulations with affordable GPU parallelization, our framework produces fine-grained traffic flow time series. This output supports critical applications such as estimating Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), scaling to urban freeway corridors, and integrating with signal optimization frameworks for improved traffic management.},

The traffic scene is an open environment that is constantly changing, and the segmentation model needs to have the ability of domain incremental learning to maintain stable performance in the changing environment. The main challenges include the diversity of the traffic scene and the accumulation of forgetting about the previous traffic scenes. In this work, an adapter-based network model is proposed to solve the domain-incremental traffic scene segmentation task. Specifically, the domain-aware adapter (DAA) module is proposed, which divides the model parameters into domain-shared and domain-specific, so that the model can handle the information of all learned domains by dynamically expanding parameters. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, the inter-class correlation enhancement (ICE) module is proposed, which utilizes inter-class correlation to improve segmentation accuracy for single domain and knowledge transfer between domains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve promising results for retaining the competitive performance for both new and old domains.},

Therefore, in such a terminal, meticulous scheduling and coordination between quay cranes (QCs) and AGVs are core for efficient and orderly operations. However, managing the operation of QCs and AGVs is complex as numerous factors affect the operational performance, such as QC interference, vehicle congestion, and limited capacity of handover points. To address the problem, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model that explicitly considers the above realistic factors. As the model is computationally inefficient even for small-scale instances, we develop a tailored two-stage algorithm, where the first stage is branch-and-bound for QC operations and the second is column generation for AGV operations. To validate the solution quality, we compare the proposed algorithm with some benchmark methods, and the numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

These algorithms take into account several data from different sources, such as terrain databases, weather forecasts and aircraft performance models.

Several scenarios, focusing on total engine flame-out situations, are described and used to validate the framework, as well as to show its main features.

  abstract     = {Driving an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) in dynamic traffic is a critical task, as the overtaking maneuver being considered one of the most complex due to involvement of several sub-maneuvers. Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have resulted in AVs exhibiting exceptional performance in addressing overtaking-related challenges. However, the intricate nature of the overtaking presents difficulties for a RL agent to proficiently handle all its sub-maneuvers that include left lane change, right lane change and straight drive. Furthermore, the dynamic traffic restricts the RL agents to execute the sub-maneuvers at critical checkpoints involved in overtaking. To address this, we propose an approach inspired by semi-Markov options, called Dynamic Option Policy enabled Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DOP-HDRL). This innovative approach allows the selection of sub-maneuver agents using a single dynamic option policy, while employing individual DRL agents specifically trained for each sub-maneuver to perform tasks during overtaking in dynamic environments. By breaking down overtaking maneuvers into several sub-maneuvers and controlling them using a single policy, the DOP-HDRL approach reduces training time and computational load compared to classical DRL agents. Moreover, DOP-HDRL easily integrates basic traffic safety rules into overtaking maneuvers to offer more robust solutions. The DOP-HDRL approach is rigorously evaluated through multiple overtaking and non-overtaking scenarios inspired by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pre-crash scenarios in the CARLA simulator. On an average, the DOP-HDRL approach shows 100% completion rate, 14% least collision rate, 25% optimal clearance distance, and 7% more average speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

This article considers both factors and proposes GISEIA-EMM: a high-accuracy GPS-inertial state estimator for in-motion alignment based on extended magnitude matching (EMM) method. First, we use the full integral method and non-interpolation procedure to construct the vector observation, which reduces the number of outliers and improves the accuracy of outlier detection. Second, we use an error-state extended Kalman filter (ESEKF), based on an augmented state-space model where the reference vector is regarded as a state, to suppress cumulative IMU bias errors, which improves the alignment accuracy. Third, we propose an EMM method, with the non-drifted expected normalized magnitude error, to detect and eliminate outliers in GPS measurements, which makes the alignment process stable. Simulation and field test results demonstrate that GISEIA-EMM can effectively address the negative impact of the two factors.},

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a monitoring and protection scheme for IVN. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge graph-based intrusion detection methodology, referred to as KG-ID. The proposed KG-ID methodology leverages a knowledge graph to analyze CAN frame and signal features for detecting several types of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of knowledge graph technology for intrusion detection in the IVN. Subsequently, the selection of CAN signal feature, construction of in-vehicle ontology model, knowledge extraction, and robustness against various attacks are explained in detail. In addition, a series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology can accurately detect fabrication, masquerade, and fuzzy attacks. In particular, the time overhead of intrusion detection in a real vehicle supported by XPeng is only 0.031 ms for KG-ID.

  abstract     = {Semantic perception in driving scenarios plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, existing Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods often do not fully exploit their potential in understanding driving scene dynamically. These methods typically lack spatial reasoning, failing to effectively correlate image pixels with their spatial positions, leading to attention drift. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Spatial Perception Transformer (HSPFormer), which integrates monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation into a unified framework for the first time. We introduce the Spatial Depth Perception Auxiliary Network (SDPNet), a framework for multiscale feature extraction and multilayer depth map prediction to establish hierarchical spatial coherence. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Pyramid Transformer Network (HPTNet), which uses depth estimation as learnable position embeddings to form spatially correlated semantic representations and generate global contextual information. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as KITTI-360, Cityscapes, and NYU Depth V2, demonstrate that HSPFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art networks, and achieves promising performance with 66.82% top-1 mIoU on KITTI-360, 83.8% mIoU on Cityscapes, and 57.7% mIoU on NYU Depth V2, respectively.

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have become popular in the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems for their ability to mitigate increasing environmental concerns by reducing carbon footprints and conserving fossil fuels. Due to the scarcity of static charging stations, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charge sharing can facilitate the on-demand charging requirement of EVs. However, most of the V2V charge-sharing solutions are either centralized or semi-centralized, causing long waiting times, huge message overhead, and high infrastructural costs. For a large network, assigning a suitable donor EV for an acceptor EV as well as maximizing the matching cardinality in a distributed environment is a challenging problem. In this paper, the problem of V2V matching for charge sharing is mapped to the classical stable matching problem in bipartite graphs. The problem is formulated using integer linear programming that considers flexible decision making for EVs based on multiple charging criteria and constraints. However, as EVs have limited communication ranges, an EV can’t possess knowledge about the entire vehicular network. So we propose two sets of distributed heuristics under the name of Vehicle to Vehicle Distributed Charge Sharing (V2VDisCS), which yield a sub-optimal solution with lower computational and message complexities compared to existing distributed solutions. We analyze the average case matching probabilities and prove the sub-optimality of our approach. Simulation studies show that our heuristics outperform the existing distributed approaches in terms of message overhead and matching percentage. They show a comparable result for matching preference with respect to the standard centralized stable matching algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a safe learning-based eco-driving framework tailored for mixed traffic flows, which aims to optimize energy efficiency while guaranteeing system constraints during real-system operations. Even though reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of optimizing energy efficiency in intricate environments, it is challenged by safety requirements during both the training and deployment stages. The lack of safety guarantees impedes the application of RL to real-world problems. Compared with RL, model predicted control (MPC) can handle constrained dynamics systems, ensuring safe driving. However, the major challenges lie in complicated eco-driving tasks and the presence of disturbances, which pose difficulties for MPC design and constraint satisfaction. To address these limitations, the proposed framework incorporates the tube-based enhanced MPC (RMPC) to ensure the safe execution of the RL policy under disturbances, thereby improving the control robustness. RL not only optimizes the energy efficiency of the connected and automated vehicle in mixed traffic but also handles more uncertain scenarios, in which the energy consumption of the human-driven vehicle and its diverse and stochastic driving behaviors are considered in the optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an average improvement of 10.88% in holistic energy efficiency compared to the RMPC technique, while effectively preventing inter-vehicle collisions when compared to the RL algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Blended traffic, comprising autonomous buses (ABs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), is becoming increasingly common, yet the lane change decision-making for ABs remains challenging due to complex interactions with heterogeneous HDVs. To address the challenge above, this paper proposes a game theory-based harmonious decision-making (GTHD) algorithm considering nuance of driving styles of HDVs, achieving human-like performance in interactions with HDVs. Technically, a game theoretic model of the GTHD uses predictions of the opposing vehicle’s motion and the information from preplanned trajectories. Besides, a prior estimation for driving styles is obtained utilizing clustering of historical data, and refined in real time through Bayesian estimation. Then, the driving style estimation is utilized to modify the game theoretic model. The modified model provides a closer depiction of the opponent’s preferences, meanwhile adjusts self-preferences to adapt to the opponent. The efficacy of GTHD is validated using a hardware and human in loop simulator and datasets in MLC scenarios. It is shown that the GTHD achieves human-like performance with 91.50%-98.50% accuracy compared with human bus driver under different conditions, better than several lane change models based on data driven methods.

This paper introduces a novel Cost-aware Adaptive Bike Repositioning Agent (CABRA), which harnesses advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques in dock-based BSS. By analyzing demand patterns, CABRA learns adaptive repositioning strategies aimed at reducing shortages and enhancing truck route planning efficiency, significantly lowering operational costs. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of CABRA utilizing real-world data from Dublin, London, Paris, and New York. The reported results show that CABRA achieves operational efficiency that outperforms or matches very challenging baselines, obtaining a significant cost reduction.

  abstract     = {With electric vehicles (EVs) and charging facilities as a bridge, the coupling of transportation network (TN) and distribution network (DN) is getting closer, and EV charging navigation considering TN-DN convergence is a current research hotspot. In order to reduce the total cost of EV charging navigation and the impact of charging load on the grid, this paper proposes a novel bi-layer coordinated charging navigation model (Bi-CCNM). The upper layer model is to minimize the total cost of EV charging navigation. To precisely estimate travel costs, a dynamic spatio-temporal energy consumption estimation model is established, which considers the impact of dynamic traffic flow on EV travel resistance. The lower layer model aims to reduce energy exchange between the charging station (CS) and the main grid, and maximize the utilization of local renewable energy sources. To cope with the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, this paper utilizes Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology to effectively mitigate the impact of EV charging loads on the grid. To efficiently tackle the Bi-CCNM, the Joint Optimization algorithm combining Generalized Benders Decomposition and Logarithmic Barrier Function Method (JO-GBLB) is developed. Ultimately, an optimal solution can be obtained through the interaction of information between the two layers. Real-world case validates the effectiveness of the proposed the Bi-CCNM, energy consumption estimation model, and JO-GBLB algorithm. The results indicate which it provides a low-cost charging navigation solution while significantly reducing the power exchange between the CS and the main grid, effectively preventing safety issues caused by load fluctuations. Besides, the accuracy of energy consumption estimation of EVs increases by 5.1% - 6.7%.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of transportation systems is significantly influenced by the field of view (FOV) of cameras, with larger FOVs yielding more reliable performance. Conventional cameras with restricted FOV face difficulties in scenarios characterized by field-of-view shake or low-texture imaging areas, complicating feature extraction and matching tracking. Conversely, 360° panoramic cameras, which provide an expansive field of view and high pixel density, are emerging as promising alternatives. While many studies have explored motion calculation based on panoramic vision, most resort to conventional image processing methods for panoramic images, leading to inefficiencies and reduced accuracy. This article proposes a novel approach to panoramic vision motion estimation and reconstruction. The method involves projecting the panoramic image onto a fitting sphere and establishing a mapping relationship between a uniform spherical grid and the pixels of the panoramic image. This enables distortion-free mapping imaging for the entire panorama, addressing issues with matching consecutive frame images caused by distortion in the polar regions. Going beyond conventional epipolar constraints, this paper introduces a geometric constraint of epipolarity within a three-dimensional sphere and derives pose-solving equations tailored for panoramic vision, enabling motion estimation between frames. Additionally, it derives the polar arc equation of panoramic images, accelerating three-dimensional reconstruction of dense point clouds. The sliding window estimation method is used for iterative algorithm optimization, along with an optimization mechanism aligned with the panoramic camera model. Validation on public datasets and hardware experimental platforms demonstrates the proposed method’s significantly improved accuracy compared to existing optimal algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the efficiency of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems. However, existing MARL approaches primarily focus on optimizing overall traffic flow, often overlooking the issue of fairness in vehicle waiting times. Considering that there is no need to strive for the ultimate fairness, this paper models the ATSC problem as a Constrained Partially Observable Markov Game (CPOMG), where fairness is modeled as a constraint on the maximum waiting time of vehicles on lanes of intersections instead of a reward term that pursues maximization. CPOMG aims to find a cooperative control policy with optimal traffic efficiency within the constrained solution space by multiple agents. On this basis, this paper proposes a new centralized training and decentralized execution cooperative MARL method, i.e., vehicle-level fairness multi-agent proximity policy optimization (VF-MAPPO). VF-MAPPO leverages a centralized trained global Critic Network to estimate the average vehicle traffic efficiency and vehicle maximum waiting time, and an Actor Network shared by all intersections for decentralized execution, which converts the optimization problem with constraints to an unconstrained optimization objective through the Lagrange multiplier method and adopts proximity policy optimization during training. Additionally, VF-MAPPO incorporates spatial-temporal graph attention in the Critic network to efficiently extract state representations in multi-intersection environments. We qualitatively analyzed the monotonic improvement guarantee of VF-MAPPO. Extensive experimental validation across two real-world and one synthetic scenarios substantiates that VF-MAPPO enhances vehicle-level fairness and maintains average traffic efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles have become a trend as a replacement to gasoline-powered vehicles, and been promoted by worldwide policy makers as a solution to combat environmental problems and stimulate economy, whereas the lack of extreme fast charging infrastructure has become one main obstacle to broad adoption of electric vehicles. To promote the commercial success of electric vehicles, effective placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations is pivotal. While numerous studies address EV charging station placement, the integration of transportation network traffic, specifically equilibrium traffic assignment, where flows stabilize as drivers seek routes to minimize travel time, has been relatively limited. This research investigates equilibrium traffic assignment with the inclusion of extreme fast charging (XFC) stations and introduces an algorithmic solution. We assess diverse charging station placement strategies, including node-based and network-based approaches, weighing their respective advantages and drawbacks. Extensive experiments on real transportation networks of varying scales validate our algorithm and evaluate different charging station placement strategies. Many interesting findings are drawn from the study. For instance, increasing the number of XFC charging stations may not always result in reduced traffic time; the added value of extra stations beyond a certain threshold can be quite limited. The findings offer valuable insights for strategically deploying EV charging infrastructure, thus promoting electric vehicle adoption.},

This advancement has led to a widespread adoption of vehicular networks, driven by the enhanced capabilities of automobiles. However, managing mobility-aware computations, ensuring network security amidst instability, and overcoming resource constraints pose significant challenges in heterogeneous vehicular network applications within Fog computing. Moreover, the latency overhead remains a critical issue for tasks sensitive to latency and deadlines. The objective of this research is to develop a Mobility-aware Secured offloading and Scheduling (M-SOS) technique for a Dew-enabled vehicular Fog-Cloud computing system. This technique aims to address the issues outlined above by moving the computations closer to the edge of the network. Initially, a Dew-facilitated vehicular Fog network is proposed, leveraging heterogeneous computing nodes to handle diverse vehicular requests efficiently and ensuring uninterrupted services within the vehicular network. Further, task management is optimized using a Fuzzy logic that categorizes tasks based on their specific requirements and identifies the target layers for offloading. Besides, a cryptographic algorithm known as SHA-256 RSA enhances security. Moreover, a novel Linear Weight-based JAYA scheduling algorithm is introduced to assign tasks to appropriate computing nodes. The proposed algorithm surpasses the comparable algorithms by 23% in terms of AWT, 18% in terms of latency rate, 14% and 23% in terms of meeting the hard-deadline ( $H\_d$ ) and soft-deadline ( $S\_d$ ), and 35% in terms of average system cost, respectively.},

This model is based on the Generative Adversarial Networks self-supervised learning framework, which can allow to learn high-accuracy estimation without using observed passenger alighting data. To show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, a case study is conducted on the real-world datasets in Tianjin, China, Brisbane, Australia, and Panjin, China. Using the entry-only data in the Tianjin case, results show the effectiveness to estimate accurate OD flow without alighting data. The sensitivity analysis on the proportion of data loss shows that when the loss rate is less than 40%, the proposed method is still capable to provide accurate outputs. Using the ground-truth OD flow data in the Brisbane case, results show the ability to obtain the realistic estimation from flawed OD flow. The robustness analysis results also show the sufficient accuracy for bus planning and operation under various data flaw levels. Using the onboard survey data in Panjin case, the proposed method’s capability of repairing the rule-based estimation is further verified.},

By designing appropriate estimators, the equivalence between estimator auxiliary input synthesis and output feedback stabilization along the iteration axis is established. Moreover, we propose an innovative data-based output feedback stabilization framework that leverages insufficient sampled data to formulate an output feedback controller without the need of identification. To be specific, with the application of some helpful linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, the data-based synthesis of required output feedback controller is transformed into solving the equivalent LMI conditions. By employing the proposed data-based estimation strategy and partial lateral dynamics information of ground vehicles, accurate estimation of sideslip angles over the entire estimation duration can be achieved even in the presence of disturbances. Experiments on an Ackermann steering intelligent vehicle are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have garnered extensive interest for their potential in enhancing navigation safety and efficiency. To further improve their intelligence, we propose a collaborative collision avoidance decision-making approach for USVs based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Firstly, a collision risk assessment model is established using Closest Point of Approach and Quaternion Ship Domain to guide USVs to take timely and effective collision avoidance actions. Secondly, we adopt Deep Recurrent Q-Network algorithm to overcome the challenges posed by multi-ship scenarios, and the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework is employed in it to accurately establish multi-ship collaborative collision avoidance model. Moreover, to introduce a novel collaborative collision avoidance mechanism for multiple ships, we improved the network update mechanism of DRQN: by synergistically integrating the local Q value of each agent to acquire the multi-agent joint action Q value and the network parameters are subsequently updated based on the calculated global loss. Finally, we designed various experiments in a real water to validate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that this approach has the capacity to enable the ships to make effective collision avoidance actions in accordance with navigation practices and good seamanship. Comparative analysis with Deep Q-Network (DQN), DDQN, Dueling DQN, and Artificial Potential Field underscores the superior safety and rationality of the proposed approach in collision avoidance. This research offers a new perspective for the cooperative collision avoidance decision-making and has theoretical reference significance.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is the foundation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In recent, graph neural networks (GNNs) have successfully captured spatial-temporal dependencies to forecast traffic conditions by transforming traffic data in the graph domain. Nevertheless, the existing methods focus only on learning informative graph representations and fail to model informative graph structures, which hinders the capture of dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies caused by dynamic factors such as weather, accidents, and special events. In this paper, we propose a novel task-oriented Spatial Graph Structure Learning (SGSL) method, which aims to capture dynamic dependencies by jointly learning graph structures and graph representations. Compared to methods that use spectral graph representations, we exploit a learnable spatial graph to effectively model dynamic dependencies in traffic data. Moreover, we directly define graph convolutions on spatial relations to specify different edge weights when aggregating the information of spatial neighbours. Thus, the graph structure alterations, i.e., the relation changes, and the time-varying weights of relations can be encapsulated, thereby effectively representing dynamic dependencies. The gradient descent strategy is introduced to periodically learn a spatial graph through joint optimization with a newly designed deep graph learning model named GAT-nLSTM. In this manner, the intrinsic behaviours of nodes are learned to capture correlations across periods. Notably, the optimization process is performed under the traffic forecasting constraint to ensure that the learned spatial graph is specific to this task. Compared with those of state-of-the-art baselines, the experimental results obtained on real-world traffic datasets show significant improvement, which verifies the superiority of the proposed SGSL.},

To estimate the unknown system dynamics, an unknown system dynamic estimator (USDE) is designed, where the unknown system dynamic can be accurately estimated by using the input-output information, this is helpful for controller design. Then, a RL based optimal control method is developed, where the prescribed performance function (PPF) is applied, the system states can be effectively defined within a certain range. To realize the online solution for optimal control, we design a new adaptive law based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework to online learn the critic neural network (NN) weights, because of the strong convergence, the proposed learning algorithm can be effectively applied in practical industrial systems.

  abstract     = {In real-world scenes, vehicles and pedestrians on the road often exhibit consistency in their overall motion, forming the traffic flow we observe. Exploring this global collective motion consistency to aid in 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks is an under-investigated issue in existing research. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been introduced to model interactions between targets in 3D tracking problems, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing GNN based methods usually employ neighborhood-based approaches to construct graphs which are unable to fully exploit collective relations in traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a GNN based 3D MOT method which effectively utilizes the collective motion consistency in traffic flow. Collective motion is modeled with a densely connected intra-flow graph within the collective group, allowing information to flow quickly. To build the intra-flow graph, we propose an effective collinearity condition to distinguish potential collective groups from the detected objects. For reasoning on the graph, we propose a progressive serial message-passing solver which enables the network to learn complex group movement relationships based on a thorough understanding of simple neighborhood relations. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets: NuScenes and KITTI tracking benchmark. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the comprehensive performance of our proposed method which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the longitudinal control problem of an on-ramp vehicle merging into a platoon on the main road. To tackle this challenge, a finite-time model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with a specialized feedback control law is proposed. A constraint set of the state error is designed and based on this, a decision-making scheme is established to allow the on-ramp vehicle to assess the feasibility of the merging operation at the beginning under the designed MPC strategy. If the merging is feasible, the proposed MPC strategy will be applied to drive the on-ramp vehicle towards a small neighborhood around the desired state on the basis of platoon’s velocity and position within a finite time step before joining the platoon. Furthermore, asymptotic convergence towards the desired state is achieved by a co-designed feedback control law. Otherwise, the MPC strategy will not be triggered, instead an alternative method such as slowing down the on-ramp vehicle to create space and allow the vehicles on the main road to proceed ahead. Under the proposed method, the recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem is achieved at all time steps and the finite time convergence to the small neighborhood of the desired state can be proved under the MPC algorithm. An upper bound on the convergence time step is also derived, which is used to prove the effectiveness of the decision-making mechanism. In addition, the closed-loop constraints satisfaction and asymptotic stability of the on-ramp vehicle are also guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC method is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Traffic accidents remain a significant concern due to their potential severity and impact on society. The rapid and accurate detection of car damage is increasingly crucial. Manual assessment of car damage usually relies on multi-view car images taken at the scene, which can provide richer information for damage assessment. However, most car damage algorithms are based on single-view datasets, and it is hard to fully leverage the complementary information and alignment information between distant view and close-up images. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Car Damage Detection model (MVA-CDD), comprising three key modules: Feature Split (FS), Feature Fusion (FF), and Image Alignment (IA). The FS module extracts global and detailed information from distant-view and close-up images separately, which are then combined by the FF module. The IA module effectively aligns car damage information in distant-view and close-up images to correct errors and biases. Meanwhile, we created the new Car Damage Detection Multi-view dataset (CDDM), which has a significant advantage in both image quantity and diversity across categories, addressing the shortcomings of existing multi-view datasets. Our proposed MVA-CDD outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view models with the dataset. Results from ablation studies further confirm the efficiency of MVA-CDD. This study contributes to optimizing the car damage detection and claims adjudication process, leading to significant labor and material cost savings. CDDM dataset is available at https://github.com/SCUT-CCNL/CDDM.},

Our approach integrates a Multi-Relational Graph Convolution Network (MR-GCN) and a Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) to evaluate driver stress using field data from Nanjing, China. Results show that our model significantly improves driver stress classification, particularly for critical stress levels, with a 65.3% increase in balanced accuracy and a 38% rise in F-score compared to the baseline. The addition of GCAA enhances accuracy further, with an average improvement of 51.7%. This demonstrates our model’s superior ability to understand the contextual relationships within driving scenarios, making it highly effective for AVs to assess driver status in complex situations and interact more efficiently with human drivers. Furthermore, our model achieves a balance between accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for real-time assessment tasks.},

In complex driving conditions, accurate and fast lane recognition is a challenging issue. In this paper, a vision-based geometric model (VBGM) is proposed for accurate and fast lane recognition in complex conditions. The framework of the VBGM includes an image preprocessing stage and a lane recognition stage. In the image preprocessing stage, the region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the original image, and the original image is transformed into an undistorted greyscale image. In the lane recognition stage, the lane contour is first extracted using the Roberts operator. Then, to accurately and quickly recognize the lane marking, a lane recognition coordinate system (LRCS) and a rotational LRCS (R-LRCS) are constructed. The distracting contours in abnormal regions are padded based on the LRCS using a contextual frames correlation (CFC) strategy, and the midpoints of the lane contour are identified based on the R-LRCS. Finally, an adaptive-order polynomial fitting model is built to fit the lane marking according to the midpoints in the LRCS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two state-of-the-art methods are selected for comparison. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method possesses a higher recognition rate and speed for lane recognition in complex conditions.},

  abstract     = {The platoon technology is gradually applied in the intelligent transportation systems to improve the safety, efficiency, energy saving, and emission reduction of vehicles during driving. However, in contrast to the traditional ramp merging scenario that consists of individual vehicles, the existing platoons from the upstream bring new challenges to the merging problem on ramps. Without an effective coordination strategy, the unnecessary congestion and disintegration of the existing platoons will lead to an increase in driving costs and safety risk. Therefore, this paper optimizes the merging strategy of vehicle sequences involving platoons on highway ramps. A merging strategy, based on an adaptive headway threshold, is first proposed, where the comprehensive economic benefit is considered as its optimization objective while taking into account the decrements of the time, fuel, and carbon emission costs. The vehicle sequence merging is then modeled as a Markov decision process to derive the optimal threshold, where the action set includes three actions: accelerating, decelerating, and maintaining the constant cruising speed. Afterwards, the constraints are brought to the decision-making to ensure the safety of the merging process. The calculation of the action value, combining the derived optimal threshold and constraint, is then detailed. Finally, the results of the simulation are evaluated, and a comparison between the proposed strategy and other existing methods is conducted, which demonstrates that the proposed approach improves the comprehensive economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {The widespread deployment of wireless communication networks has catalyzed significant advancements in utilizing signal channs to address real-world challenges, such as vehicle trajectory reconstruction (VTR), drone trajectory planning, and network optimization. Existing methods primarily utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements for vehicle localization. However, these methods require specialized decoding receivers capable of deciphering communication protocols, leading to increased application costs. received signal strength (RSS), a measure of wireless signal strength, can be recorded by any standard communication device, thus allowing RSS-based VTR to benefit from cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the inherently noisy and sporadic nature of RSS poses significant challenges for accurately reconstructing vehicle trajectories. This paper aims to utilize RSS measurements to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network. We constrain the trajectories to comply with signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints, thereby mitigating the impact of the noisy and sporadic nature of RSS data on the accuracy of trajectory reconstruction. The primary challenge involves exploiting latent spatial-temporal correlations within the noisy and sporadic RSS data while navigating the complex road network. To overcome these challenges, we develop an hidden Markov model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that utilizes alternating optimization to search for the vehicle trajectory based on RSS measurements. This model effectively captures the spatial-temporal relationships among RSS measurements, while a road graph model ensures compliance with network pathways. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to effectively guide the proposed alternating optimization procedure, ensuring that the proposed HRE method rapidly converges to a favorable local solution. The proposed method is validated using real RSS measurements from 5G NR networks in Chengdu and Shenzhen, China. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even with limited RSS data.},

  abstract     = {Map matching is crucial to facilitating location-based services, and recent advancements in map matching have demonstrated excellent performance with high-quality data. However, the use of low-precision devices often introduces high measurement noise, and the slow update rate of maps may result in errors in digital maps. Consequently, multiple types of noise significantly impact the performance of map matching algorithms. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel multi-noise perception framework, named MPF, aiming to enhance the performance and robustness of existing map matching algorithms. The main challenge lies in detecting anomalies during map matching, identifying the root causes, and devising appropriate solutions. Firstly, we propose a matching quality assessment (MQA) method that assesses abnormal variance in matching probability. Secondly, we introduce a multiple noise discrimination (MND) mechanism to effectively differentiate between measurement noise and map errors. Thirdly, we present a missing segment generation (MSG) scheme that dynamically fills in map gaps to prevent significant detours. To validate the effectiveness of MPF, we conduct experiments using real-world taxi trajectories from four cities, covering a total distance of 79,670.6 km. MPF is compare with seven online map matching algorithms and is used to optimize their performance. The experiments show that MPF outperforms the top baselines by 15.6%-26.9% and enhances their performance by 18.7%-38.2%.},

  abstract     = {Accurate environmental perception is essential for the effective operation of autonomous vehicles. However, visual images captured in dynamic environments or adverse weather conditions often suffer from various degradations. Image restoration focuses on reconstructing clear and sharp images by eliminating undesired degradations from corrupted inputs. These degradations typically vary in size and severity, making it crucial to employ robust multi-scale representation learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Modulation (MSFM), a novel deep convolutional architecture for image restoration. MSFM modulates multi-scale features in both frequency and spatial domains to make features sharper and closer to that of clean images. Specifically, our multi-scale frequency attention module transforms features into multiple scales and then modulates each scale in the implicit frequency domain using pooling and attention. Moreover, we develop a multi-scale spatial modulation module to refine pixels with the guidance of local features. The proposed frequency and spatial modules enable MSFM to better handle degradations of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that MSFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 datasets for a range of image restoration tasks, i.e., image dehazing, image defocus/motion deblurring, and image desnowing. Furthermore, the restored images significantly improve the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles.},

To reduce the operational energy consumption of a metro line, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization model for energy-efficient train operations based on three aspects: train operation strategies at inter-stations, running time allocation within an operating cycle, and utilization of regenerative braking energy of multiple collaborative trains in the same power supply area. The first stage is based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm, which optimizes the position-speed curves at each inter-station to obtain a series of energy-saving running curves and the corresponding Pareto fronts. In the second stage, a single-objective optimization algorithm and parallel computing method are used to solve the integrated optimization model for train operations with the minimum net energy consumption as the objective function, to reduce the net energy consumption in an operating cycle. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out with data on the Beijing Yizhuang line. The results show that the proposed bi-level programming model and solution methods have a good energy-saving effect.},

To mitigate these undesirable consequences, modern railway locomotives are equipped with on-board anti-slip control systems. In this study, three different anti-slip controller models, comprising the traditional re-adhesion anti-slip controller and PID-based anti-slip controller with fixed threshold and with optimal threshold, are established. The wheel/rail rolling-slipping performances subjected to different anti-slip control algorithms under changing wheel/rail friction conditions are compared based on train-track interaction simulations. The results demonstrate that the PID-based anti-slip controller with an optimal threshold achieves the maximum utilization of wheel/rail adhesion in the presence of low-friction conditions, outperforming the other two types of anti-slip controllers. Additionally, the adoption of an anti-slip controller with a lower control threshold can effectively reduce the tread wear of locomotive wheels.

Second, the shuffle manipulation module is designed which includes slicing and shuffling to manipulate the spatial and channel features so that the information loss problem caused by conventional convolutional downsampling is overcome. Third, the adaptive connection of features at different scales using learnable parameters is proposed, and then the target features are reinforced by location and channel calibration branches.

This article proposes a privacy-preserving traffic signal control strategy based on secure multi-party computation. The design uses multiple computing servers and a secret sharing scheme to encrypt traffic data into several shares, each corresponding to a server. The servers then securely compute the green time plans, working directly on the encrypted data. The proposed method protects traffic data from curious computing servers and external eavesdroppers, preventing the adversaries from gaining the required information to launch a complex attack. Additionally, a detection and recovery procedure from false data injection attacks on green time signals is presented using secret reconstruction from different server combinations. Simulation results for various scenarios demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in maintaining data confidentiality while achieving the same performance as an unprotected control strategy, with a reasonable addition to computation time. It also depicts a significant reduction in vulnerability against falsified green time signal attacks in terms of total travel time in the network.},

  abstract     = {3D scene flow represents the 3D motion of each point in the point cloud, which is a base 3D perception task for autonomous driving, like optical flow for 2D images. As non-learning methods are often inefficient or struggled to learn accurate correspondence in complex 3D real world, recent works turn to supervised learning methods, which require ground truth labels. However, acquiring the ground truth of 3D scene flow is challenging mainly due to the lack of sensors capable of capturing point-level motion and the complexity of accurately tracking each point in real-world environments. Therefore, it is important to resort to self-supervised methods, which do not require ground truth labels. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning method of scene flow with LiDAR odometry is proposed, which enables the scene flow network can be trained directly on real-world LiDAR data without scene flow labels. In this structure, supervised odometry provides a more accurate shared cost volume for the interframe association of 3D scene flow. In addition, because static and occluded points are more suitable for using the pose transform while dynamic and non-occluded points are more suitable for using the scene flow transform, a static mask and an occlusion mask are designed to classify the states of points and a mask-weighted warp layer is proposed to transform source points in a divide-and-conquer manner. The experiments demonstrate that the divide-and-conquer strategy makes the predicted scene flow more accurate. The experiment results compared to other methods also show the application ability of our proposed method to real-world data. Our source codes are released at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/PSFNet.},

  abstract     = {In mixed-autonomy traffic environments, accurately predicting the lane change behavior of human-driven vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle decision-making. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: 1) they tend to represent the relationships between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles using parameters like relative position and speed. This approach either requires a fixed number of surrounding vehicles or introduces significant noise by relying on virtual vehicles; and 2) they often fail to fully exploit the vast amount of available vehicle trajectory data, leaving the complexities of vehicular interactions underexplored. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lane change prediction framework using Transformer-based transfer learning. Our design aims to leverage inter-vehicle interactions learned from trajectory data to improve lane-change prediction accuracy. Specifically, pre-trained trajectory prediction models are used to adapt dynamically to the varying number of surrounding vehicles and to capture interaction context from large sets of trajectory data. We then refine the Transformer model to integrate this context and predict the target vehicle’s lane change intentions. The Transformer encoder transforms trajectory interaction context into a lane-change-oriented context using aggregated multi-head attention. The Transformer decoder, in turn, utilizes this context alongside the target vehicle’s states through relation-aware multi-head attention to forecast lane change behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness.},

To meet the ever-increasing charging demands of EVs, an efficient dynamic spatio-temporal allocation strategy of charging stations (CSs) is necessary. With newly allocated CSs, additional distributed generators (DGs) are required to compensate for the load increase. Given a budget to be allocated over a certain time horizon, we formulate the joint spatio-temporal CSs and DGs planning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. During each planning period, the allocation strategy aims at minimizing the total power generation costs and CSs/DGs installation costs while satisfying budgetary and power constraints and ensuring a minimum level for the charging requests satisfaction rate. In this regard, we first predict the future power demand of EVs using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Then, using the power demand forecast, we obtain the optimal number and locations of CSs and DGs at each time stage using reinforcement learning. A case study of the proposed allocation strategy over 6 time stages for the 2000-bus power grid of Texas coupled with 720 initially existing CSs is presented to illustrate the performance of the planning strategy.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating the position and attitude of vehicles is essential for intelligent transportation systems. The GNSS/INS integrated system offers precise navigation information. However, the system’s positioning errors may accumulate rapidly in challenging GNSS signal conditions. Odometer (ODO) and nonholonomic constraints (NHC) are commonly employed to mitigate the rapid accumulation of INS errors. Compensating for the mounting angles of INS and the scale factor of the odometer is necessary to fully exploit the potential of ODO/NHC. However, many studies employ Kalman filters with small mounting angle assumption, which limits their applicability for large mounting angles in practice. To accurately estimate the mounting angle of INS with any installation attitude, we propose a new algorithm called Fast Estimation of Mounting Angle and Scale Factor (FEMASF). FEMASF employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain a closed-form solution for the parameters. It also incorporates an enhanced Sage-Husa scheme, enhancing overall estimation accuracy by reducing the weight of outlier data through a forgetting factor. Extensive simulation experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FEMASF algorithm outperforms filter-based methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for large mounting angles. Specifically, for the −90° mounting angle, FEMASF achieves 0.45° angle error, while the velocity-based Kalman filter (VKF) fails to converge and the position-based Kalman filter (PKF) yields about 4° error. Furthermore, neither VKF nor PKF converges for the 120° mounting angle, whereas FEMASF exhibits only about 3.2° estimation error.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle detection at night is a crucial task in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Due to the complex lighting environment, vehicle detection at night remains a challenging task. Headlights and taillights are essential cues to identify vehicles at night. However, existing methods struggle to effectively utilize the light information of the vehicle. This paper proposes a novel highlight-guided framework to identify vehicles, named HighlightNet, by utilizing both the illumination data from the vehicle lights and the reflective properties of vehicles. The framework combines vehicle detection and highlight area recognition via dual-branch joint learning. To ensure that both branches focus on the highlighted regions, Feature Similarity Awareness Attention (FSAA) is introduced to capture the common attention regions of different branches. Highlight Region Perception (HRP) is proposed to exclude streetlights and other reflective illuminations from the FSAA output, which generates a mask map capable of differentiating the foreground from the background of highlighted areas. It improves the allocation of feature weights and adaptively modifies the distribution within the dual-branch configuration. Furthermore, to address the severe pixel imbalance between the highlighted area and the background, Adaptive Spatial Balance (ASB) loss is introduced to allocate the attention towards prospective vehicle regions while diminishing the emphasis on background regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the BDD100K-Night dataset and a newly acquired dataset specifically designed for nighttime surveillance, called the NightVehicle dataset, demonstrate that HighlightNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for nighttime vehicle detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenges faced by 6G-enabled vehicular networks (V-Nets), including increasing road traffic, ultra-reliable and low latency communication, high data rates, and energy efficiency. The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is proposed as a solution to configure the propagation channel in a smart radio environment by adjusting phase shifts. However, designing IRS-assisted V-Nets that achieve ultra-reliability in dynamic and noisy communication is challenging due to the passive nature of the IRS and the limitations of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision (CV) enabled IRS framework for V-Nets, which combines a convolutional neural network and CV techniques. The framework utilizes real-time visual information to estimate and configure optimal beamforming for IRS-assisted V-Nets. Adapting to real-time network dynamics and intelligently guiding signals, the CV-IRS framework improves prediction accuracy to 95%, an achievable maximum rate of 11.2 bps/Hz with 100 IRS elements, and resource allocation efficiency of 88% with 10 vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the CV-IRS framework over benchmark schemes, making it a promising approach for the efficient configuration of IRS-assisted 6G V-Nets.},

However, with the introduction of AAVs, new challenges such as trajectory design and AAV-user association occur. In this paper, we consider a caching AAV-assisted wireless network and formulate a user fairness problem by jointly optimizing AAV-user association, trajectory design, and bandwidth allocation of the AAVs, which is mixed-integer and non-convex. In order to find solutions, we decompose the original problem into three subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm based on block alternating descent and successive convex approximation methods. In addition, computational complexity is analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, compared to benchmark algorithms.},

This paper proposes an image-guided depth completion algorithm to address this issue. The method uses the edges of the color image as prior constraints to construct an image topography map as an intermediate representation and performs nonlinear adaptive reconstruction based on the image content to adjust the position and scale of the pixel-weighted neighborhood. This approach avoids incorporating depth information with different distributions when estimating missing values, resulting in a full-resolution dense depth map with sharp edges. We conducted a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art models on the KITTI and MidAir datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm has better performance and robustness in terms of completion accuracy. We also analyzed the impact of sparsity on the algorithm’s performance and its ability to recover fine structures in dense depth results and demonstrated the reconstruction results for sparse data in real-world scenarios.},

The past research on driving style classification mostly focused on identifying the driving patterns using the kinematic feature magnitudes. The variation in the instantaneous driving decisions termed as “driving volatility” is not explored in the context of performance assessment. In this regard, the present study proposes a methodology to explore the driving styles of Indian drivers, using both the magnitude and variation exhibited in the short-term driving decisions. The real-time driving profiles of 47 professional car drivers were collected and segmented into maneuvers based on the respective driving regimes. The performance features representative of each maneuver are extracted, defining 12 measures of driving volatility. The K-means clustering was performed on the event dataset at two-levels, which resulted in four patterns of driving styles under acceleration and braking regimes. The results showed that, a driver can exhibit speedy and aggressive maneuvers in a stable as well as in a highly volatile pattern. The generated driving style profiles at individual-level highlight the behavioral changes in drivers pertained to external influencing factors, and helps to identify the aberrations performed in each trip.},

While this approach protects personal privacy, it makes it difficult for researchers and planners to identify the same traveler from different databases and to construct complete multi-modal trips, which greatly reduces the value of data. To address this challenge, this paper develops TBLink, a method to match individual travelers between different modes. The underlying idea is that if a traveler makes a transfer, the spatiotemporal signatures of the previous and next trips will be similar and must satisfy certain conditions. When this pattern occurs for two travelers in the two datasets repeatedly, we can infer that the two travelers are actually the same person. The matching of travelers is regarded as a stable matching problem, and the Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to solve the problem. TBLink is demonstrated using metro and bus trip data from Chengdu City between January and March 2021. The results show that the precision, recall, and recovery rate of user matching are 80.83%, 92.82%, and 10.56% respectively, and the matching is more reliable as the dataset increases. Sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of several model parameters on the matching performance.},

Traditional traffic flow prediction models often face limitations in quality and structure, leading to increased training costs and inefficiencies, due to data scarcity and centralized training modes that compromise data privacy. To address these issues, we propose a model called 2MGTCN, which combines Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for Cross-city Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP). Our 2MGTCN model utilizes federated transfer learning (FTL) to transfer the model from the source to the target domain, mitigating data scarcity. It also incorporates GCN and TCN to capture both spatial and temporal information, enhancing cross-city adaptability. Additionally, Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods are applied to capture road relationships, and a Federated Parameter Aggregation based on Spatial Similarity (FPASS) algorithm is proposed for ensuring effective parameter aggregation by considering spatial similarity. Simulation results show that our 2MGTCN algorithm outperforms traditional TFP models in both centralized and distributed training modes, ensuring higher accuracy and better privacy protection.},

Furthermore, the study applied Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to analyze the electroencephalogram (EEG) features of tower crane operators. Evaluation and comparison using the traditional wet electrode and the new semi-dry electrode to extract the EEG features show that the performance of the novel semi-dry electrode closely approximates that of the traditional wet electrode, effectively tracking alterations in the cognitive fatigue indicators among tower crane drivers during prefabricated building construction.

  abstract     = {Transportation systems often exhibit uncertainty, dynamics, and nonlinearity, making them highly susceptible to perturbations. Overhead crane systems, being a crucial mode of transportation, find wide application in engineering practice. This paper proposes a compound control strategy for underactuated overhead crane systems, combining a deep reinforcement learning controller with a novel observer-based disturbance compensation algorithm. The aim is to suppress model uncertainties and external disturbances. Initially, an equivalent state variable is constructed to stabilize the overhead crane system, simplifying controller design. Subsequently, the model uncertainties and external disturbances are treated as generalized disturbances and incorporated as a new state. This state is estimated and compensated through a super-twisting extended state observer (STESO) with finite-time convergence. Lyapunov-based analysis demonstrates that the established state observer can reduce the residual estimate error to zero. Moreover, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a form of deep reinforcement learning, is employed to effectively eliminate tracking errors. The proposed scheme enables the underactuated system to achieve satisfactory performance, with adaptive control effort suited to different control states and disturbances. Simulation and hardware experiments are conducted, comparing the proposed control strategy with traditional methods, to illustrate its effectiveness and robustness.},

This is especially true when considering accident scenarios, in which the dynamics can be affected by both high-frequency events, such as in high-sides, marked by rapid variations of the characteristics signals, and low-frequency events, such as in side slips, which exhibit slower and monotonic change in the same quantities. Therefore, designing an effective automatic eCall system for this type of vehicle is particularly challenging, while at the same time, it can significantly increase safety in dangerous situations. This paper proposed a novel approach for detecting falls of two-wheeled vehicles that avoids missed detections while minimizing the number of false alarms, which would heavily undermine its usability. We show, based on extensive analysis of a wide range of experimental data, why and how the proposed approach allows us to overcome the limitations of the existing proposal, ensuring a consistent detection of the wide range of falls that can happen on two-wheelers, also providing a detailed comparison with the scientific literature.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, enormous investments in Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) have distinctly advanced ADS technologies. Despite promises made by several high profile auto-makers, it has however become clear that the challenges involved for deploying ADS have been drastically underestimated. Contrary to previous generations of automotive systems, common design, development, verification and validation methods for safety critical systems do not suffice to cope with the increased complexity and operational uncertainties of an ADS. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide an understanding of existing methods for providing safety evidence and, most importantly, identifying the associated challenges and gaps pertaining to the use of each method. To this end, we have performed a literature review, articulated around four categories of methods: design techniques, verification and validation methods, run-time risk assessment, and run-time (self-)adaptation. We have identified and present eight challenges, collectively distinguishing ADSs from safety critical systems in general, and discuss the reviewed methods in the light of these eight challenges. For all reviewed methods, the uncertainties of the operational environment and the allocation of responsibility for the driving task on the ADS stand-out as the most difficult challenges to address. Finally, a set of research gaps is identified, and grouped into five major themes: 1) completeness of provided safety evidence, 2) improvements and analysis needs, 3) safe collection of closed loop data and accounting for tactical responsibility on the part of the ADS, 4) integration of AI/ML-based components, and 5) scalability of the approaches with respect to the complexity of the ADS.},

At the same time, these technological advances raise notable concerns about the effects that uncertainty in critical TCS parameters (such as train position and speed) may have on dependability-related attributes. Recently, various approaches have been proposed to characterize such effects through quantitative measures, leveraging formal stochastic modeling and evaluation of the TCS behavior. In this paper, we illustrate the results of a systematic review of the literature on quantitative evaluation of dependability-related attributes of TCSs under uncertainty on vital parameters. Specifically, we have finally selected 42 relevant papers, published between 2011 and 2023, that succeed in giving, through an empirical perspective and classification, a comprehensive view of current research and practice in quantitative dependability assessment of TCSs.},

  abstract     = {Flight delay is a fundamental problem present in the global aviation system. Delay-inducing disruptions are caused by various reasons, including increased global connectivity / dependency, weather phenomena, and limited infrastructure resources. Given the excessive amount of time and money lost due to delays in aircraft operations, the prediction of flight delays has become an active research topic in recent years. Particularly, the existence of code repositories for standardized machine learning applications as well as the available data on this subject, has led to an increasing number of papers, usually comparing the performance of different new and existing delay prediction techniques. In this study, we review the contributions of papers to delay prediction in recent years. Based on a six-step comparison framework, covering many aspects, starting with data collection / processing, including, e.g., model and feature selection, and ending with evaluation, integration of various technologies, and reproducibility considerations, we find that although the current studies have put forward effective concerns, there are still some challenges in the field of delay prediction. We elaborate on how to overcome this stage by discussing a set of research directions, which hopefully help other researchers to perform better future studies and help to reduce the impact of delays on air transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are essential components of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Vehicular Social Networks (VSN). As the number of connected vehicles continues to grow, the importance of ensuring security and privacy within VANETs becomes paramount. Robust authentication protocols are essential to safeguard vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, given the vulnerability of the open wireless communication medium in VANETs to interception and manipulation. While researchers are actively developing authentication and privacy schemes to secure message exchanges, existing solutions have not fully satisfied all the security and privacy requirements, thereby fueling ongoing research in this field. A significant challenge in this context is balancing the conflicting goals of privacy—protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access—and traceability—ensuring accountability by identifying malicious actors. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of VANETs, covering their key components, prevalent attack types, and the security and privacy prerequisites essential for effective authentication and privacy mechanisms. Specifically, the paper delves into the realm of identity-based authentication schemes within VANETs, subjecting them to rigorous evaluation based on security, privacy, and scalability. The primary objective is to empower the research community to design and implement efficient and secure authentication schemes, minimizing communication and computational overhead while ensuring resilience against a multitude of potential attacks.},

  abstract     = {Digital twin (DT) technology, which creates virtual representations of physical systems to optimize their life-cycle, has drawn significant attention across various industries. The automotive and aviation industries have been pioneers in adopting DTs for enhanced efficiency, predictive maintenance, and real-time decision-making. However, the maritime industry, crucial to global trade and logistics, has lagged in DT implementation. This paper aims to bridge this gap by systematically surveying DT applications in the automotive and aviation industries and exploring how this knowledge can be transferred to the maritime industry. By analyzing existing literature, identifying key trends, and summarizing best practices, a comprehensive roadmap is provided for maritime industry adoption of DT technology. The surveyed papers are selected systematically following the PRISMA statement and categorized based on characteristics such as single vs. multiple systems, modeling methods (model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid), and life-cycle phases. We introduce DT models using a five-dimensional framework and analyze their characteristics in terms of research object, subsystem application, and modeling method. Additionally, DT applications from a product life-cycle perspective, covering design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance phases are examined. Knowledge transfer from the automotive and aviation industries to the maritime industry is summarized. In the automotive industry, DTs enhance vehicle efficiency and safety, particularly for autonomous and electric vehicles. Aviation DT research focuses on predictive maintenance, pilot training, and real-time monitoring to improve operational efficiency and safety. The maritime industry faces data challenges and operational complexity but has significant potential for DTs to enhance ship performance, safety, and predictive maintenance.},
