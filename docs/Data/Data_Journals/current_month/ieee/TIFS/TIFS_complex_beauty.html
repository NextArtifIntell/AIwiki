  abstract     = {Authentication is an important security issue for multi-access edge computing (MEC). To restrict user access from untrusted devices, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy has been proposed to authenticate users and devices simultaneously. However, when integrating BYOD policy into MEC authentication to improve security, issues of efficient binding and user-device conditional anonymity have not been well supported. To address these issues, we propose Bring Your Device Group (BYDG) policy by constructing efficient and privacy-preserving user-device authentication. Our core idea is to use key sequences generated by PUFs-based key derivation functions (KDFs) to not only construct efficient binding relationships, but also achieve conditional anonymity for device groups. Specifically, a flexible and secure binding method is first developed by leveraging Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to bind user with device groups. Each device’s CRT modulus is derived from the key sequence to construct many-to-many user-device binding relationships, which are managed in the form of on-chain Pedersen Commitment. Moreover, we design an identity anonymizing and tracing method for device groups. The key sequence is regarded as traceable device pseudo-identities, and then inserted into the cuckoo filter to reduce the on-chain storage overhead and mitigate malicious login attempts with low costs. Based on above two methods, the combination of Pedersen Commitment and Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge is used to achieve user-device authentication with conditional anonymity. The security analysis was presented to demonstrate important security properties. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented to conduct performance evaluation and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {The continuous evolution of malware is posing a serious threat to personal privacy, enterprise data security, and global network infrastructure. For example, attackers can use phishing emails, botnets, etc. to induce victims to execute malware for nefarious purposes such as stealing sensitive information. Therefore, it is significant to develop effective and efficient methods to detect malware. Towards this, most state-of-the-art methods are focused on learning-based method. In order to adapt to the characteristics of sample scarcity and dynamic evolution of malware detection tasks, few-shot class incremental learning has been proposed as an efficient pairwise solution. Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: 1) Catastrophic Forgetting: the erosion of existing knowledge by newly acquired knowledge during incremental learning. 2) Decision boundary confusion: after continuous multiple incremental sessions, the discriminative ability of the classification model is weakened. To address the above challenges, we propose a new Malware detection framework based on Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning, MalFSCIL, which utilizes a decoupled training strategy combined with a variational autocoder to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and designs a dynamic boundary delineation method based on class prototyping to achieve accurate delineation of incremental decision boundaries. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in malware detection and classification with high classification accuracy with open-source dataset and Internal enterprise dataset.},

  abstract     = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) allows two mutually distrusting parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing any additional information, and has found numerous applications. A part of applications require labeled PSI in the unbalanced setting, where a server holds a label for each item in a set that is much larger than the set held by a client, and the client obtains the intersection and the corresponding labels. In this paper, we present a new concretely efficient labeled PSI protocol in the unbalanced setting, without using computation-heavy homomorphic encryption. Our protocol is based on Distributed Point Function (DPF) with hardware acceleration from fixed-key AES-NI, and has communication complexity linear in the size of a small set of the client and sublinear in the size of a large set of the server. Our protocol exploits two Oblivious Pesudorandom Function (OPRF) protocols, based on Diffle-Hellman PRFs or block ciphers, to achieve a trade-off between computation and communication. Our implementation demonstrates that our protocol outperforms the previous labeled and unbalanced PSI protocols. In particular, for two sets with respective $2^{24}$ and 1 items, where each item has a 32-byte label, our protocol takes 1.19 seconds for an end-to-end performance, resulting in $26 \times $ improvement compared to the state-of-the-art protocol by Cong et al. (CCS 2021). In terms of the cost of the one-time initialization, we speed up the computations more than $325\times $ in the above comparison.},
