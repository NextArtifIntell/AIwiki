  abstract     = {To leverage peer influence and increase population behavioral changes, behavioral interventions often rely on peer-based strategies. A common study design that assesses such strategies is the egocentric-network randomized trial (ENRT), where index participants receive a behavioral training and are encouraged to disseminate information to their peers. Under this design, a crucial estimand of interest is the Average Spillover Effect (ASpE), which measures the impact of the intervention on participants who do not receive it, but whose outcomes may be affected by others who do. The assessment of the ASpE relies on assumptions about, and correct measurement of, interference sets within which individuals may influence one another’s outcomes. It can be challenging to properly specify interference sets, such as networks in ENRTs, and when mismeasured, intervention effects estimated by existing methods will be biased. In studies where social networks play an important role in disease transmission or behavior change, correcting ASpE estimates for bias due to network misclassification is critical for accurately evaluating the full impact of interventions. We combined measurement error and causal inference methods to bias-correct the ASpE estimate for network misclassification in ENRTs, when surrogate networks are recorded in place of true ones, and validation data that relate the misclassified to the true networks are available. We investigated finite sample properties of our methods in an extensive simulation study and illustrated our methods in the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 037 study.},

  abstract     = {The transitional phase of menopause induces significant hormonal fluctuations, exerting a profound influence on the long-term well-being of women. In an extensive longitudinal investigation of women’s health during mid-life and beyond, known as the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), hormonal biomarkers are repeatedly assessed, following an asynchronous schedule compared to other error-prone covariates, such as physical and cardiovascular measurements. We conduct a subgroup analysis of the SWAN data employing a semiparametric mixture regression model, which allows us to explore how the relationship between hormonal responses and other time-varying or time-invariant covariates varies across subgroups. To address the challenges posed by asynchronous scheduling and measurement errors, we model the time-varying covariate trajectories as functional data with reduced-rank Karhunen–Loéve expansions, where splines are employed to capture the mean and eigenfunctions. Treating the latent subgroup membership and the functional principal component (FPC) scores as missing data, we propose an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to effectively fit the joint model, combining the mixture regression for the hormonal response and the FPC model for the asynchronous, time-varying covariates. In addition, we explore data-driven methods to determine the optimal number of subgroups within the population. Through our comprehensive analysis of the SWAN data, we unveil a crucial subgroup structure within the aging female population, shedding light on important distinctions and patterns among women undergoing menopause.},

  abstract     = {Recurrent events are common in clinical, healthcare, social, and behavioral studies, yet methods for dynamic risk prediction of these events are limited. To overcome some long-standing challenges in analyzing censored recurrent event data, a recent regression analysis framework constructs a censored longitudinal dataset consisting of times to the first recurrent event in multiple pre-specified follow-up windows of length τ (XMT models). Traditional regression models struggle with nonlinear and multiway interactions, with success depending on the skill of the statistical programmer. With a staggering number of potential predictors being generated from genetic, -omic, and electronic health records sources, machine learning approaches such as the random forest regression are growing in popularity, as they can nonparametrically incorporate information from many predictors with nonlinear and multiway interactions involved in prediction. In this article, we (i) develop a random forest approach for dynamically predicting probabilities of remaining event-free during a subsequent τ -duration follow-up period from a reconstructed censored longitudinal data set, (ii) modify the XMT regression approach to predict these same probabilities, subject to the limitations that traditional regression models typically have, and (iii) demonstrate how to incorporate patient-specific history of recurrent events for prediction in settings where this information may be partially missing. We show the increased ability of our random forest algorithm for predicting the probability of remaining event-free over a τ -duration follow-up window when compared to our modified XMT method for prediction in settings where association between predictors and recurrent event outcomes is complex in nature. We also show the importance of incorporating past recurrent event history in prediction algorithms when event times are correlated within a subject. The proposed random forest algorithm is demonstrated using recurrent exacerbation data from the trial of Azithromycin for the Prevention of Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.},

  abstract     = {Label-free bottom-up proteomics using mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography has long been established as one of the most popular high-throughput analysis workflows for proteome characterization. However, it produces data hindered by complex and heterogeneous missing values, which imputation has long remained problematic. To cope with this, we introduce Pirat, an algorithm that harnesses this challenge using an original likelihood maximization strategy. Notably, it models the instrument limit by learning a global censoring mechanism from the data available. Moreover, it estimates the covariance matrix between enzymatic cleavage products (ie peptides or precursor ions), while offering a natural way to integrate complementary transcriptomic information when multi-omic assays are available. Our benchmarking on several datasets covering a variety of experimental designs (number of samples, acquisition mode, missingness patterns, etc.) and using a variety of metrics (differential analysis ground truth or imputation errors) shows that Pirat outperforms all pre-existing imputation methods. Beyond the interest of Pirat as an imputation tool, these results pinpoint the need for a paradigm change in proteomics imputation, as most pre-existing strategies could be boosted by incorporating similar models to account for the instrument censorship or for the correlation structures, either grounded to the analytical pipeline or arising from a multi-omic approach.},

  abstract     = {Randomized controlled trials evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of a marker frequently collect information on baseline covariates in addition to information on the marker and the reference standard. However, standard estimators of sensitivity and specificity do not use data on baseline covariates and restrict the analysis to data from participants with a positive reference standard in the intervention arm being evaluated. Covariate-adjusted estimators for marginal treatment effects have been developed and been advocated for by regulatory agencies because they can improve power compared to unadjusted estimators. Despite this, similar covariate-adjusted estimators for marginal sensitivity and specificity have not yet been developed. In this manuscript, we address this gap by developing covariate-adjusted estimators for marginal sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test that leverage baseline covariate information. The estimators also use data from all participants, not just participants with a positive reference standard in the intervention arm being evaluated. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimators and evaluate the finite sample properties of the estimators using simulations and by analyzing data on lung cancer screening.},

Causal estimands and assumptions are discussed under this presentation. With a covariance matrix as the mediator, a low-rank representation is introduced and parametric mediation models are considered under the structural equation modeling framework. Assuming Gaussian random errors, likelihood-based estimators are introduced to simultaneously identify the low-rank representation and causal parameters. An efficient computational algorithm is proposed and asymptotic properties of the estimators are investigated. Via simulation studies, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated. Applying to a resting-state fMRI study, a brain network is identified within which functional connectivity mediates the sex difference in the performance of a motor task.},
