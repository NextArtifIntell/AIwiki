  abstract     = {The rapid growth in the speed and convenience of information dissemination has made copyright infringement increasingly common. Blockchain technology solves pain points such as difficulties in traditional copyright registration, easy infringement, and difficulties in confirming and safeguarding rights. It also realises the decentralised management of copyright, network-wide tracking and monitoring, trusted certificate deposits, among others. However, the efficient original authentication of works and the function of blockchain to create copyright trading channels in the field of copyright are often ignored. This paper designed a self-adaptive learning similarity detection fusion strategy to protect the copyright of original digital works, namely SAAChain, and built a platform for releasing and storing original works based on non-fungible tokens. SAAChain first measures the similarity of a work based on adaptive learning to realise the originality authentication of works. Secondly, the works are stored on the InterPlanetary File System as NFTs, along with copyright information. Finally, a smart contract based on Ethereum and ERC-721 is designed to realise the free circulation of digital rights while simultaneously constructing an efficient and convenient digital rights protection system. Experiments show that the accuracy of the fusion strategy for adaptive work similarity detection can reach above 97%, which meets the requirements of work originality verification. Because of the storage mode of the platform, the system has good performance in terms of response speed and storage efficiency. The entire process provides a full-process and transparent transaction platform for all parties and guarantees the copyright ownership of works as well as the non-tampering and traceability of copyright information.},
