  abstract     = {One of the archetypal examples of active flows is a busy concourse crossed by people moving in different directions according to their personal destinations. When the crowd is isotropic—comprising individuals moving in all different directions—the collective motion is disordered. In contrast, if it is possible to identify two dominant directions of motion, for example in a corridor, the crowd spontaneously organizes into contraflowing lanes or stripes. In this article, we characterize the physics of the transition between these two distinct phases by using a synergy of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and stylized experiments. We develop a hydrodynamic theory for collisional flows of heterogeneous populations, and we analyze the stability of the disordered configuration. We identify an order–disorder transition occurring as population heterogeneity exceeds a theoretical threshold determined by the collision avoidance maneuvers of the crowd. Our prediction for the onset of pedestrian ordering is consistent with results of agent-based simulations and controlled experiments with human crowds.},

  abstract     = {Pollinators are critical for food production and ecosystem function. Although native pollinators are thought to be declining, the evidence is limited. This first, taxonomically diverse assessment for mainland North America north of Mexico reveals that 22.6% (20.6 to 29.6%) of the 1,579 species in the best-studied vertebrate and insect pollinator groups have elevated risk of extinction. All three pollinating bat species are at risk and bees are the insect group most at risk (best estimate, 34.7% of 472 species assessed, range 30.3 to 43.0%). Substantial numbers of butterflies (19.5% of 632 species, range 19.1 to 21.0%) and moths (16.1% of 142 species, range 15.5 to 19.0%) are also at risk, with flower flies (14.7% of 295 species, range 11.5 to 32.9%), beetles (12.5% of 18 species, range 11.1 to 22.2%), and hummingbirds (0% of 17 species) more secure. At-risk pollinators are concentrated where diversity is highest, in the southwestern United States. Threats to pollinators vary geographically: climate change in the West and North, agriculture in the Great Plains, and pollution, agriculture, and urban development in the East. Woodland, shrubland/chaparral, and grassland habitats support the greatest numbers of at-risk pollinators. Strategies for improving pollinator habitat are increasingly available, and this study identifies species, habitats, and threats most in need of conservation actions at state, provincial, territorial, national, and continental levels.},

  abstract     = {A well-functioning society requires well-functioning institutions that ensure prosperity, fair distribution of wealth, social participation, security, and informative media. Such institutions are built on a foundation of trust. However, while trust is essential for economic success and good governance, interconnected mechanisms inherent in weakly governed market economies tend to undermine the very trust on which such success depends. These mechanisms include the intrinsic tendency for inequality to grow, media to boost perceived unfairness, and self-interest to gain rewards at the expense of others. These mechanisms, if left unchecked, allow wealth concentration to result in state capture where institutions facilitate further wealth concentration instead of the promoting the common good. As a result, people may become alienated and untrusting of fellow citizens and of institutions. Several democracies now experience such dynamics, the United States being a prime example. We discuss ways in which well-functioning democracies can design institutions to help avoid this social trap, and the much harder challenge of escaping the trap once in it. Successful cases such as the ability of Scandinavian democracies to maintain high-trust, and the US progressive era in the early 20th century provide instructive examples.},

  abstract     = {The search for an answer to Bernstein’s degrees of freedom problem has propelled a large portion of research studies in human motor control over the past six decades. Different theories have been developed to explain how humans might use their incredibly complex neuro-musculo-skeletal system with astonishing ease. Among these theories, motor synergies appeared as one possible explanation. In this work, the authors investigate the nature and role of synergies and propose a theoretical framework, namely the “expansion hypothesis,” to answer Bernstein’s problem. The expansion hypothesis is articulated in three propositions: mechanical, developmental, and behavioral. Each proposition addresses a different question on the nature of synergies: i) How many synergies can humans have? ii) How do we learn and develop synergies? iii) How do we use synergies? An example numerical simulation is presented and analyzed to clarify the hypothesis propositions. The expansion hypothesis is contextualized with respect to the existing literature on motor synergies both in healthy and impaired individuals, as well as other prominent theories in human motor control and development. The expansion hypothesis provides a framework to better comprehend and explain the nature, use, and evolution of human motor skills.},

  abstract     = {Silicon-induced responses play a key role in plant defense against herbivory, though the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. In this study, we examined how mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) affect tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) defense against an invasive and highly destructive lepidopteran herbivore, the tomato pinworm (TPW), Phthorimaea absoluta . In tomato plants supplemented with MSN, prior exposure to TPW oviposition shifted subsequent egg-laying from a preference for leaves to an even distribution between stems and leaves. This shift was not observed in nonsilicon-supplemented plants. Prolonged oviposition triggered pigmentation in the basal cells of type I glandular trichomes on the stems of silicon-supplemented plants. Chemical analysis by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the pigmented trichome was rich in soluble sugars (sucrose and l -arabinose) and waxes, dominated by the saturated hydrocarbon tetracosane. Bioassays with the crude extract of the pigmented trichome and a three-component sugar–wax blend replicated the oviposition and caterpillar response observed with the pigmented trichome, while individual components produced variable effects. While l -arabinose alone replicated the oviposition effects of the three-component sugar–wax blend, sucrose increased oviposition and caterpillar feeding and survival, while l -arabinose and tetracosane caused the highest caterpillar mortality. Additionally, these treatments altered caterpillar gut microbiota composition and influenced frass volatiles, which attracted the TPW natural enemies, Nesidiocoris tenuis (predator) and Neochrysocharis formosa (parasitoid). Our findings suggest that silicon supplementation increases tomato defense against TPW through oviposition-induced responses, which promotes recruitment of natural enemies.},

Emerging evidence suggests these lipid second messengers may be present in membranes beyond the plasma membrane, yet their spatial regulation within other membrane compartments is not well understood. To dissect the spatial regulation of specific 3-PI species, we developed genetically encodable biosensors with selectivity for PIP 3 or PI(3,4)P 2 . Using these biosensors, we showed that PIP 3 significantly accumulated at the lysosome upon growth factor stimulation, in contrast to the conventional view that PIP 3 is exclusively present in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we showed that lysosomal PIP 3 originates from the plasma membrane and relies on dynamin-dependent endocytosis for lipid internalization. Thus, PIP 3 can exploit dynamic trafficking pathways to access subcellular compartments and regulate signaling in a spatially selective manner.},

  abstract     = {Dengue, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), presents a significant public health challenge with limited effective treatments. NITD-688 is a potent panserotype DENV inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical trials. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Here, we present the molecular details of how NITD-688 inhibits DENV. NITD-688 binds directly to the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) with nanomolar affinities across all four DENV serotypes and specifically disrupts the interaction between NS4B and nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) without significantly changing the interactions between NS4B and other viral or host proteins. NS4B mutations that confer resistance to NITD-688 reduce both NITD-688 binding to NS4B and disruption of the NS4B/NS3 interaction. Specifically, NITD-688 blocks the interaction of NS3 with a cytosolic loop within NS4B. This inhibits the formation of new NS4B/NS3 complexes and disrupts preexisting complexes in vitro and DENV-infected cells, ultimately inhibiting viral replication. Consistent with this mechanism, NITD-688 retains greater potency in cellular assays with delayed treatment compared to JNJ-1802, another NS4B inhibitor that has been studied in Phase II clinical trials. Together, these findings provide critical insights into the mechanism of action of NITD-688, facilitating the development of novel flavivirus NS4B inhibitors and informing future clinical interventions against DENV.},

  abstract     = {We investigated the role of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in myelin regeneration in the brain. TREM2 is a receptor that activates microglia, which are crucial for clearing myelin debris and promoting remyelination. Previous studies in a mouse model of demyelination induced by the copper-chelating agent Cuprizone (CPZ) have shown that stimulation of TREM2 with a monoclonal antibody reduces demyelination, while deleting the Trem2 gene in mice impairs remyelination. Here, we blocked TREM2 function acutely with an antibody during both the demyelination and remyelination phases of the CPZ model and analyzed the impact of the antibody treatment on myelination and gene expression in single cells. We found that blocking TREM2 depleted a distinct population of microglia with high expression of the transcription factor MAFB during remyelination. The loss of these MAFB-high microglia was linked to impaired generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Importantly, we identified MAFB + microglia in acute and acute-chronic brain lesions from individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), but not in inactive lesions. We conclude that TREM2 is essential for maintaining a population of MAFB-high microglia that is associated with myelin repair.

  abstract     = {There is considerable interest in the targeted degradation of proteins implicated in human disease. The use of sequence-specific proteases for this purpose is severely limited by the difficulty in engineering the numerous enzyme–substrate interactions required to yield highly selective proteases while maintaining catalytic activity. Herein, we report a strategy to evolve a protease for the programmed degradation of α-Synuclein, a presynaptic protein closely linked to Parkinson’s disease. Our structure-guided evolution campaign uses the protease from botulinum neurotoxin and showcases the stepwise change of specificity from its native substrate SNAP25 to the selective degradation of α-Synuclein. The protease’s selectivity is further demonstrated in human cells where near complete degradation of overexpressed human α-Synuclein is observed with no significant effects on cell proliferation. This stepwise strategy may serve as a general approach to evolve highly selective proteases targeting dysregulated proteins.},

We show that an allosteric coupling between the ligand PTH and the C-terminal helix α5 of the Gα subunit controls the stability of the PTH1R complex with the specific G protein, G s or G q . Single-cell-level experiments further validate the G protein–selective effects of the PTH binding pose by demonstrating the differential, G protein–dependent residence times and affinity of this ligand at the PTH1R binding site. The findings deepen our understanding of the selective coupling of PTH1R to G s or G q and how it relates to the stability and kinetics of ligand binding.

The antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is crucial for numerous cancers, yet it presents challenges for selective targeting by traditional inhibitors. In this study, we identified a macrocyclic peptide, 5L1, that strongly binds to MCL1, with a dissociation constant ( K D ) of 7.1 nM. This peptide shows the potential to specifically inhibit the function of MCL1, and demonstrates effective antitumor activity against several blood tumor cell lines with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values for cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated 5L1 in the range of 0.6 to 3 μM. Structural analysis revealed that it functions similarly to molecular glue, capable of binding to two MCL1 molecules simultaneously and inducing their homodimerization. This unique mechanism of action distinguishes it from traditional small-molecule MCL1 inhibitors, underscoring the potential of macrocyclic peptides functioning as molecular glues. Moreover, it inspires the development of highly selective inhibitors targeting MCL1 and other related targets with this glue-like mechanism.},

Different from the mitochondrial and bacterial enzymes, F 1 F O from photosynthetic organisms have evolved diverse structural and mechanistic details to adapt to the light-dependent reactions. Although complete structure of chloroplast F 1 F O has been reported, no high-resolution structure of an F 1 F O from photosynthetic bacteria has been available. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of an intact and functionally competent F 1 F O from Chloroflexus aurantiacus ( Ca F 1 F O ), a filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium from the earliest branch of photosynthetic organisms. The structures of Ca F 1 F O in its ADP-free and ADP-bound forms for three rotational states reveal a previously unrecognized architecture of ATP synthases. A pair of peripheral stalks connect to the Ca F 1 head through a dimer of δ-subunits, and associate with two membrane-embedded a-subunits that are asymmetrically positioned outside and clamp Ca F O ’s c 10 -ring. The two a-subunits constitute two proton inlets on the periplasmic side and two proton outlets on the cytoplasmic side, endowing Ca F 1 F O with unique proton translocation pathways that allow more protons being translocated relative to single a-subunit F 1 F O . Our findings deepen understanding of the architecture and proton translocation mechanisms of F 1 F O synthases and suggest innovative strategies for modulating their activities by altering the number of a-subunit.},

  abstract     = {Several influential theories have proposed that interoceptive signals, sent from the body to the brain, contribute to neural processes that coordinate complex behaviors. We altered the physiological state of the body using compounds that have minimal effect on the brain and evaluated their effect on decision making in rhesus monkeys. We used glycopyrrolate, a nonspecific muscarinic (parasympathetic) antagonist, and isoproterenol, a beta-1/2 (sympathetic) agonist, to create a sympathetic-dominated state in the periphery, that was indexed by increased heart rate. Rhesus monkeys were trained on two variants of an approach-avoidance conflict task. The tasks offered a choice between enduring mildly aversive stimuli in exchange for a steady flow of rewards, or canceling the aversive stimuli, forgoing the rewards. The latency to interrupt the aversive stimuli was used as a measure of monkeys’ tolerance for contact with a hot but not painful stimulus or airflow directed at their muzzle. Both drugs reduced tolerance for the aversive stimuli. To determine whether the drug-induced autonomic state reduced the subjective value of the reward, we tested the effects of glycopyrrolate on a food preference task. Food preference was unaltered, suggesting that the sympathetic dominated state in the periphery selectively reduces tolerance for aversive stimuli without altering reward-seeking behaviors. As the drugs used are expected to have little or no direct effect on the brain, the observed biases in decision making are likely induced by interoceptive afferents that signal to the brain the physiological state of the body.},

  abstract     = {Glucose is the preferred carbon source of most studied microorganisms. However, we now report that glucose loses preferred status when the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium experiences cytoplasmic magnesium (Mg 2+ ) starvation. We establish that this infection-relevant stress drastically reduces synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the allosteric activator of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), master regulator of carbon utilization. The resulting reduction in cAMP concentration, which is independent of carbon source, decreases transcription of CRP-cAMP-activated carbon utilization genes, hinders carbon source uptake, and restricts metabolism, rendering wild-type bacteria phenotypically CRP − . A cAMP-independent allele of CRP overcame the transcriptional, uptake, and metabolic restrictions caused by cytoplasmic Mg 2+ starvation and significantly increased transcription of the glucose uptake gene when S. Typhimurium was inside murine macrophages. The reduced preference for glucose exhibited by S. Typhimurium inside macrophages reflects that transcription of the glucose uptake gene requires higher amounts of active CRP-cAMP than transcription of uptake genes for preferred carbon sources, such as gluconate and glycerol. By reducing CRP-cAMP activity, low cytoplasmic Mg 2+ alters carbon source preference, adjusting metabolism and growth.},

Here, we introduce a synthetic model designed to measure friction forces between biomimetic membranes and substrates. The model consists of a vesicle with precisely controlled properties, fabricated via microfluidics, encapsulating a single ferromagnetic particle that is magnetically driven to rotate. The rotation of the particle generates a confined rotational flow, setting the vesicle membrane into motion. By adjusting the magnetic field frequency and vesicle size, the rotation frequency of the vesicle can be finely controlled, resulting in a rolling vesicle that functions as an effective tribological tool across a wide frequency range. At low frequencies, molecular contact between the membrane and substrate dominates frictional interactions, which enables determination of the contact friction coefficient. At higher frequencies, lubrication becomes predominant, causing the vesicles to slip rather than roll. Adjusting membrane fluidity and incorporating specific ligand–receptor interactions within this model will enable detailed studies of frictional forces in more complex biomimetic systems, providing key insights into the mechanisms of cell movement and mechanotransduction.},

Embedding magnetic nanoparticles into a thin matrix of elastic material enables high flexibility while exploiting the magnetic response of the individual particles. However, in the ultrathin limit of such nanocomposite materials, the particles become too small to sustain a permanent dipole moment. This implies that now large magnetic field gradients are required for actuation, which are difficult to achieve with externally applied fields. Here, we demonstrate through experiment and simulation that monolayer sheets of close-packed paramagnetic nanoparticles in a uniform applied field can generate large local field gradients through particle interactions. As a result, a strong collective magnetization is obtained that leads to large deflections of freestanding sheets already in moderate applied fields. Exploiting the vector nature of the applied field, we furthermore find that it is possible to induce more complex curvature and twist the sheets. Finally, we show that paramagnetic nanoparticle monolayers applied as coatings can generate sufficient force to deflect strips of nonmagnetic material that is several orders of magnitude thicker.},

In healthy mice, the circadian clock factor BMAL1 is required for skeletal muscle function and metabolism. However, the importance of muscle BMAL1 in the development of metabolic diseases, such as diet-induced obesity (DIO), remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that skeletal muscle–specific BMAL1-deficient mice exhibit worsened glucose tolerance upon high-fat diet feeding, despite no evidence of increased weight gain. Metabolite profiling from Bmal1 -deficient muscles revealed impaired glucose utilization specifically at early steps in glycolysis that dictate the switch between anabolic and catabolic glucose fate. We provide evidence that this is due to abnormal control of the nutrient stress–responsive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Genetic HIF1α stabilization in muscle Bmal1 -deficient mice restores glucose tolerance and expression of 217/736 dysregulated genes during DIO, including glycolytic enzymes. Together, these data indicate that during DIO, skeletal muscle BMAL1 is an important regulator of HIF-driven glycolysis and metabolic flexibility, which influences the development of high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance.},

  abstract     = {Stimulant drugs that boost dopamine, like methylphenidate (MP), enhance attention and are effective treatments for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Yet there is large individual variation in attentional capacity and response to MP. It is unclear whether this variation is driven by individual differences in relative density of dopamine receptor subtypes, magnitude of dopamine increases induced by MP, or both. Here, we extensively characterized the brain dopamine system with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (including striatal dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor availability and MP-induced dopamine increases) and measured attention task-evoked fMRI brain activity in two separate sessions (placebo and 60 mg oral MP; single-blind, counterbalanced) in 37 healthy adults. A network of lateral frontoparietal and visual cortices was sensitive to increasing attentional (and working memory) load, whose activity positively correlated with performance across individuals (partial r = 0.474, P = 0.008; controlling for age). MP-induced change in activity within this network correlated with MP-induced change in performance (partial r = 0.686, P &lt; 0.001). The ratio of D1-to-D2/3 receptors in dorsomedial caudate positively correlated with baseline attentional network activity and negatively correlated with MP-induced changes in activity (all pFWE &lt; 0.02). MP-induced changes in attentional load network activity mediated the association between D1-to-D2/3 ratio and MP-induced improvements in performance (mediation estimate = 23.20 [95%CI: −153.67 −81.79], P = 0.004). MP attention-boosting effects were not linked to the magnitude of striatal dopamine increases, but rather showed dependence on an individual’s baseline receptor density. Individuals with lower D1-to-D2/3 ratios tended to have lower frontoparietal activity during sustained attention and experienced greater improvement in brain function and task performance with MP.},

  abstract     = {Myelodysplastic syndromes and other cancers are often associated with mutations in the U2 snRNP protein SF3B1. Common SF3B1 mutations, including K700E, disrupt SF3B1 interaction with the protein SUGP1 and induce aberrant activation of alternative 3′ splice sites (ss), presumably resulting from aberrant U2/branch site (BS) recognition by the mutant spliceosome. Here, we apply a method of U2 IP-seq to profile BS binding across the transcriptome of K562 leukemia cells carrying the SF3B1 K700E mutation. For alternative 3′ ss activated by K700E, we identify their associated BSs and show that they are indeed shifted from the WT sites. Unexpectedly, we also identify thousands of additional changes in BS binding in the mutant cells that do not alter splicing. These new BSs are usually very close to the natural sites, occur upstream or downstream, and either exhibit stronger base-pairing potential with U2 snRNA or are adjacent to stronger polypyrimidine tracts than the WT sites. The widespread imprecision in BS recognition induced by K700E with limited changes in 3′ ss selection expands the physiological consequences of this oncogenic mutation.},

  abstract     = {F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7) is a tumor suppressor that targets various oncoproteins for degradation, but its role in modulating cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment remains elusive. Here, we report that FBXW7 expression is gradually downregulated in CAFs during the progression of human pancreatic and lung cancers. Mechanically, FBXW7 inhibits histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (KMT2) methyltransferase activity via retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (RbBP5) binding, whereas FBXW7 depletion abrogates the binding to activate KMT2, leading to increased H3K4 methylations and global upregulation of gene expression. Activation of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway triggers the secretion of cytokines and chemokines to promote migration, invasion, and sphere formation of lung cancer cells. Coinjection of Fbxw7-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts with cancer cells enhances in vivo tumor growth, demonstrating a paracrine effect. Hypoxia downregulates CAF FBXW7 via ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) to increase H3K4 methylation, whereas conditioned media from hypoxia-exposed CAFs promotes migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, highlighting FBXW7’s tumor-suppressing role through KMT2 inactivation.},

  abstract     = {Recent findings show that stereotyped movement sequences (habits) need the cortex in the learning phase, but after learning, the cortex can be inactivated, and the movement still be performed flawlessly. The motor program is dependent on the sensorimotor part of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and on synaptic plasticity in the thalamostriatal synapses. New findings from several laboratories have revealed a highly precise spatially interactive organization within the basal ganglia [DLS, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and the thalamostriatal parafascicular nucleus (PF)] and with precise input from the cortex. The DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop is subdivided into many parallel loops. I now propose that these parallel loops can act to reinforce the activity of the different striatal projection neurons in the DLS that take part and that the synaptic transmission in DLS becomes potentiated each time the motor sequence is performed successfully, if rewarded through a dopamine burst. It is argued that after learning the DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop can operate in isolation.},

  abstract     = {The origin of eukaryotes represents one of the most significant events in evolution since it allowed the posterior emergence of multicellular organisms. Yet, it remains unclear how existing regulatory mechanisms of gene activity were transformed to allow this increase in complexity. Here, we address this question by analyzing the length distribution of proteins and their corresponding genes for 6,519 species across the tree of life. We find a scale-invariant relationship between gene mean length and variance maintained across the entire evolutionary history. Using a simple model, we show that this scale-invariant relationship naturally originates through a simple multiplicative process of gene growth. During the first phase of this process, corresponding to prokaryotes, protein length follows gene growth. At the onset of the eukaryotic cell, however, mean protein length stabilizes around 500 amino acids. While genes continued growing at the same rate as before, this growth primarily involved noncoding sequences that complemented proteins in regulating gene activity. Our analysis indicates that this shift at the origin of the eukaryotic cell was due to an algorithmic phase transition equivalent to that of certain search algorithms triggered by the constraints in finding increasingly larger proteins.},

Impaired TYK2 signaling within the central nervous system (CNS) may impart the protective effects of TYK2 P1104A allele in MS. We deployed brain-penetrant TYK2 inhibitors (cTYK2i) alongside the peripherally restricted TYK2 inhibitor (pTYK2i; BMS-986165) to untangle the contributions of central TYK2 inhibition in diverse models of neuroinflammation. While pTYK2i had little impact, cTYK2i reduced clinical score, lymphoid cell infiltration, and cytokines/chemokines in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Microglial activation was attenuated in cTYK2i-treated EAE spinal cords and circulating neurofilament light (NfL) was reduced in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, cTYK2i was protective in an antibody-mediated mouse model of primary progressive MS (PPMS). Finally, we demonstrate TYK2 inhibition has a robust impact on a unique subset of activated astrocytes termed Interferon-Responsive-Reactive-Astrocytes (IRRA). The data presented herein identify a key role for CNS TYK2 signaling in regulating neuroinflammation and solidify TYK2 as a potential therapeutic target for MS.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is intricately influencing the accumulation of neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) in human food webs, potentially leading to uneven exposure risks across regions. Here, we reveal that climate change will elevate MeHg risks in China, with implications for regional inequalities in Asia through a climate-mercury-food-health nexus. Using a compiled fish mercury dataset from 13,000 samples and machine learning, we find that freshwater wild fish—an essential component of the Asian diet—is an underappreciated MeHg source. Specifically, MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish are 2.9 to 6.2 times higher than in freshwater farmed fish and 1.7 times higher than in marine wild fish. Individual climate factors influence MeHg accumulation differently, while their combined effects significantly increase MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish. Under SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 by 2031 to 2060, national average MeHg concentrations in freshwater wild fish are projected to increase by about 60%, adding a maximum annual economic loss of US$18 million (2022 USD) from intelligence quotient decrements in Chinese newborns. This loss may vary regionally within China and among Asian countries, disproportionately affecting less developed areas. Coordinating climate action with mercury emission reduction strategies could mitigate these overlooked regional risks, reduce regional inequalities in food safety, and ultimately contribute to sustainable development.},

  abstract     = {Neurons display unique shapes and establish intricate networks, which may differ between sexes. In complex organisms, studying sex differences in structure and function of individual neurons is difficult. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites and males present an exceptional model for studying neuronal morphogenesis in a simple, sexually dimorphic system. We focus on the polymodal sensory bilateral neuron pair PVD, which forms a complex but stereotypic dendritic tree composed of multiple subunits that resemble candelabra. PVD is well studied in hermaphrodites, but not in males. We show here that during larval development, male PVD extends a similar architecture to the hermaphrodite utilizing the sexually shared Menorin patterning mechanism. In early adulthood, however, male PVD develops a unique extension into the copulatory tail structure. Alongside established tail ray neurons RnA and RnB, we show PVD is a third, previously unrecognized, neuron within the tail rays. Unlike RnA and RnB, PVD extends anterogradely, branches and turns within the ray hypodermis, and is nonciliated. This PVD sexually dimorphic arborization is absent in mutant backgrounds which perturb the Menorin guidance complex. SAX-7/L1CAM, a hypodermal component of this complex, shows a male-specific expression pattern which precedes PVD extension, and its presence allows PVD to enter the tail rays. Further, our results reveal that genetically altered arborization or ablation of the PVD results in male mating behavioral defects, particularly as males turn around the hermaphrodite. These results uncover an adult-stage sexual dimorphism of dendritic branching and a function for PVD in male sexual behavior.},

  abstract     = {Neuropeptide signaling systems are key regulators of physiological and behavioral processes in animals. However, the evolutionary history of some neuropeptides originally discovered in vertebrates is unknown. The peptide bombesin (BN) was first isolated from the skin of the toad Bombina bombina and subsequently BN-related neuropeptides have been identified in other chordates, including gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB) in mammals, and a GRP-like peptide in the cephalochordate Branchiostoma japonicum . However, BN-type neuropeptides have hitherto not been identified in any nonchordate animals. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of a BN-type neuropeptide signaling system in an echinoderm—the starfish Asterias rubens . BN-type precursor proteins were identified in several echinoderm species based on their amino acid sequences and gene structures, and the mature structure of the A. rubens BN-type neuropeptide ArBN was determined using mass spectrometry. A protein related to vertebrate GRP/NMB-type G protein–coupled receptors was identified experimentally as the receptor for ArBN in A. rubens . Analysis of the distribution of the ArBN precursor in A. rubens using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed a widespread pattern of expression in the central nervous system, digestive system, and locomotory organs. Moreover, effects of ArBN in A. rubens included contraction and retraction of the evertible stomach and inhibition of feeding behavior. Our findings show that the evolutionary history of BN-type neuropeptide signaling can be traced back to the deuterostome common ancestor of echinoderms and chordates. Furthermore, an ancient role of BN-type neuropeptides as regulators of feeding behavior has been revealed.},

While CpG frequency alone is insufficient to predict ZAP-regulation, we developed an algorithm using experimentally determined compositional features to predict which endogenous mRNAs may be ZAP-regulated. Using ZAP-knockout mice, we demonstrate that levels of many host mRNAs that are algorithmically predicted ZAP targets are indeed increased when ZAP is absent. ZAP is interferon-inducible, and we also identify genes that are downregulated by ZAP during an innate immune response. Many ZAP-regulated gene products are extracellular matrix or of nucleosome components, whose ZAP-mediated control is conserved in human cells. Overall, we provide a tool for the prediction of ZAP target genes and reveal host mRNAs that are ZAP-regulated.},

When the sensory input is ambiguous, perceptual judgments can be biased by prior expectations shaped by environmental regularities. These effects are examples of Bayesian inference, a reasoning method in which prior knowledge is leveraged to optimize uncertain decisions. However, it is not known how decision-making circuits combine sensory signals and prior expectations to form a perceptual decision. Here, we study neural population activity in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys trained to report perceptual judgments of ambiguous visual stimuli under two different stimulus distributions. We isolate the component of the neural population response that represents the formation of the perceptual decision (the decision variable, DV), and find that its dynamical evolution reflects the integration of sensory signals and prior expectations. Prior expectations impact the DV’s trajectory both before and during stimulus presentation such that DV trajectories with a smaller dynamic range result in more biased and less sensitive perceptual decisions. We show that these results resemble a specific variant of Bayesian inference known as approximate hierarchical inference. Our findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which prefrontal circuits can execute Bayesian inference.},

Embolism reversal, or “refilling,” is a hypothesized adaptive process in which xylem functionality is rapidly and sustainably restored. This study investigated xylem embolism refilling during recovery from severe drought stress using entirely noninvasive measurements of the same plants. These results were considered in relation to functional traits to address long-standing gaps in understanding the consequences of severe drought stress. Leaf and stem xylem embolism as well as transpiration, photosynthesis, and stem water potential were characterized nondestructively on intact barnyard grass plants during an acute drought event. Plants were rewatered and returned to growth conditions for 10 d, during which time recovery of stem xylem embolism and transpiration were monitored. Leaf xylem embolism and declines in leaf gas exchange occurred mostly between −1.0 MPa and −2.0 MPa, whereas stem xylem embolism occurred mostly between −3.0 MPa and −4.0 MPa. In all measured plants, which included embolism levels up to 88%, stem xylem embolism reversed completely within 24 h after rewatering, and this refilling supported recovery of transpiration and growth after plants were returned to growth conditions. This study provides direct evidence of complete and functional stem xylem refilling. These results present a clear need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and the adaptive significance of this phenomenon as well as its prevalence in nature.},

  abstract     = {Designing the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) is critical for stable, fast-charging, low-temperature Li-ion batteries. Fostering a “fluorinated interphase,” SEI enriched with LiF, has become a popular design strategy. Although LiF possesses low Li-ion conductivity, many studies have reported favorable battery performance with fluorinated SEIs. Such a contradiction suggests that optimizing SEI must extend beyond chemical composition design to consider spatial distributions of different chemical species. In this work, we demonstrate that the impact of a fluorinated SEI on battery performance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Sufficiently passivating the anode surface without impeding Li-ion transport is key. We reveal that a fluorinated SEI containing excessive and dense LiF severely impedes Li-ion transport. In contrast, a fluorinated SEI with well-dispersed LiF (i.e., small LiF aggregates well mixed with other SEI components) is advantageous, presumably due to the enhanced Li-ion transport across heterointerfaces between LiF and other SEI components. An electrolyte, 1 M LiPF 6 in 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2MeTHF), yields a fluorinated SEI with dispersed LiF. This electrolyte allows anodes of graphite, μSi/graphite composite, and pure Si to all deliver a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% and excellent rate capability at low temperatures. Pouch cells containing layered cathodes also demonstrate impressive cycling stability over 1,000 cycles and exceptional rate capability down to −20 °C. Through experiments and theoretical modeling, we have identified a balanced SEI-based approach that achieves stable, fast-charging, low-temperature Li-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of infant mortality. We analyzed de novo mutations (DNMs) and very rare transmitted/unphased damaging variants in 248 prespecified genes in 11,555 CHD probands. The results identified 60 genes with a significant burden of heterozygous damaging variants. Variants in these genes accounted for CHD in 10.1% of probands with similar contributions from de novo and transmitted variants in parent–offspring trios that showed incomplete penetrance. DNMs in these genes accounted for 58% of the signal from DNMs. Thirty-three genes were linked to a single CHD subtype while 12 genes were associated with 2 to 4 subtypes. Seven genes were only associated with isolated CHD, while 37 were associated with 1 or more extracardiac abnormalities. Genes selectively expressed in the cardiomyocyte lineage were associated with isolated CHD, while those widely expressed in the brain were also associated with neurodevelopmental delay (NDD). Missense variants introducing or removing cysteines in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of NOTCH1 were enriched in tetralogy of Fallot and conotruncal defects, unlike the broader CHD spectrum seen with loss of function variants. Transmitted damaging missense variants in MYH6 were enriched in multiple CHD phenotypes and account for ~1% of all probands. Probands with characteristic mutations causing syndromic CHD were frequently not diagnosed clinically, often due to missing cardinal phenotypes. CHD genes that were positively or negatively associated with development of NDD suggest clinical value of genetic testing. These findings expand the understanding of CHD genetics and support the use of molecular diagnostics in CHD.},

  abstract     = {Diversification of plant hydraulic architecture and stomatal function coincides with radical changes in the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 400 my. Due to shared stomatal anatomy with the earliest land plants, bryophyte stomatal behavior may provide insights into the evolution of stomatal function, but significant uncertainty remains due to technical limitations of measuring guard cell turgor pressure in situ. Here, we introduce a method for monitoring cell turgor pressure by nucleating microbubbles within the guard cells of intact plant tissue and then examining microbubble growth and dissolution dynamics. First, we show that maximum microbubble radius decreases with increasing pressure as the pressure of the surrounding fluid constrains its growth according to a modified version of the Epstein–Plesset equation. We then apply this method to monitor turgor pressure in dark- vs. light-acclimated guard cells across bryophyte taxa with stomata, where their role in gas-exchange remains ambiguous, and in vascular plants with well-documented light-dependent turgor modulation. Our findings show no light-activated change in turgor in bryophyte guard cells, with pressures not significantly different than neighboring epidermal cells. In contrast, vascular plants show distinct pressure modulation in response to light that drives reversible changes in stomatal aperture. Complete guard cell turgor loss had no effect on bryophyte stomatal aperture but resulted in partial or complete closure in vascular plants. These results suggest that despite conserved stomatal morphology, the sampled bryophytes lack dynamic control over guard cell turgor that is critical for sustaining photosynthesis and inhibiting desiccation.},

  abstract     = {Symmetry properties of the order parameter are among the most fundamental characteristics of a superconductor. UTe 2 , which was found to feature an exceedingly large upper critical field and striking reentrant behavior at low temperatures, is widely believed to possess a spin-triplet pairing symmetry. However, unambiguous evidence for such a pairing symmetry is still lacking, especially at zero and low magnetic fields. The presence of an inversion crystalline symmetry in UTe 2 requires that, if it is indeed a spin-triplet superconductor, the order parameter must be of odd parity. We report here phase-sensitive measurements of the symmetry of the orbital part of the order parameter using the Josephson effect. The selection rule in the orientation dependence of the Josephson coupling between In, an s -wave superconductor, and UTe 2 suggests strongly that UTe 2 possesses the odd-parity pairing state of B 1 u symmetry near zero magnetic field, making it a spin-triplet superconductor. We also report the apparent formation of Andreev surface bound states on the (1−10) surface of UTe 2 .},

In a nationally representative sample of U.S. religious leaders ( N = 1,600), the majority of which were of a Christian faith, we find that nearly 90% believe in anthropogenic climate change to some degree. From this 90%, a total of 60% believe humans play a major role and an additional 30% believe they play a role, but a more minor one. Yet roughly half have never discussed it with their congregation, and only a quarter have mentioned it more than once or twice. In a sample of Christian Americans representative of the proportions of major national denominations ( N = 987), we find that Christians underestimate the prevalence of their leaders who believe in climate change by 39 to 45 percentage points. Conversely, having a religious leader who talks about climate change predicts greater willingness to discuss it with fellow churchgoers and attend climate events. In an experimental intervention on another sample matching major Christian American denomination ( N = 959), we find that providing the actual consensus level of religious leaders’ belief in climate change reduces congregants’ misperception of religious leaders, increases their perception that other church members believe in and are open to discussing climate change, and leads Christians to believe that taking climate action is consistent with their church’s values while voting for politicians who will not take climate action is not.},

  abstract     = {Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been achieved in various cytomimetic (protocell) models, but controlling molecular condensation using noninert crowders to systematically alter protocell function remains challenging. Intracellular ATP levels influence protein–protein interactions, and dysregulation of ATP can alter cellular crowding dynamics, thereby disrupting the normal formation or dissolution of condensates. Here, we develop a membranized protocell model capable of endogenous LLPS and liquid–gel-like phase separation through precise manipulation of intermolecular interactions within semipermeable polysaccharide-based microcapsules (polysaccharidosomes, P-somes), prepared using microtemplate-guided assembly. We demonstrate that intraprotocellular diffusion-mediated LLPS can be extended into the liquid–gel-like domain by the uptake of the biologically active crowder ATP, resulting in a range of modalities dependent on the fine-tuning of molecular condensation. Endogenous enzyme activity in these crowded polysaccharidosomes is enhanced compared to free enzymes in solution, though this enhancement diminishes at higher levels of intraprotocellular condensation. Additionally, increased molecular crowding inhibits intraprotocell DNA strand displacement reactions. Our findings introduce an expedient and optimized approach to the batch construction of membranized protocell models with controllable molecular crowding and functional diversity. Our mix–incubate–wash protocol for inducing endogenous LLPS in membranized protocells offers potential applications in microreactor technology, environmental sensing, and the delivery and sustained release of therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {Mass extinctions are rare but catastrophic events that profoundly disrupt biodiversity. Widely accepted consequences of mass extinctions, such as biodiversity loss and the appearance of temporary “disaster taxa,” imply that species–area relationships (SARs, or how biodiversity scales with area) should change dramatically across these events: Specifically, both the slope (the rate of accumulation of new species with increasing area) and intercept (the density of species at local scales) of the power–law relationship should decrease. However, these hypotheses have not been tested, and the contribution of variation in the SAR to diversity dynamics in deep time has been neglected. We use fossil data to quantify nested SARs in North American terrestrial tetrapods through the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction (Campanian–Ypresian). We show that SARs vary substantially through time and among groups. In the pre-extinction interval (Maastrichtian), unusually shallow SAR slopes (indicating low beta diversity or provinciality) drive low total regional diversity in dinosaurs, mammals, and other tetrapods. In the immediate postextinction interval (Danian), the explosive diversification of mammals drove high regional diversity via a large increase in SAR slope (indicating higher beta diversity or provinciality), and only a limited increase in SAR intercept. This contradicts the expectation that postextinction biotas should be regionally homogenized by the spread of disaster taxa and impoverished by diversity loss. This early postextinction increase in SAR slope was followed in the Thanetian–Selandian ( ∼ 4.4. myr later) by increases in the intercept, indicating that diversity dynamics at local and regional scales did not change in synchrony.},

Specifically, we partnered with the nonprofit educational platform Zearn Math to compare the impact of 15 different interventions with a reminder-only megastudy control condition. All 16 conditions entailed weekly emails delivered to teachers over 4-wk in the fall of 2021. The best-performing intervention, which encouraged teachers to log into Zearn Math for an updated report on how their students were doing that week, produced a 5.06% increase in students’ math progress (3.30% after accounting for the winner’s curse). In exploratory analyses, teachers who received any behaviorally informed email nudge (vs. a reminder-only megastudy control) saw their students’ math progress boosted by an average of 1.89% during the 4-wk intervention period; emails referencing personalized data (i.e., classroom-specific statistics) outperformed emails that did not by 2.26%. While small in size, these intervention effects were consistent across school socioeconomic status and school type (public, private, etc.) and, further, persisted in the 8-wk post-intervention period.

Dominant-negative mutations of KCNJ2 encoding the Kir2.1 potassium channel subunit are found in 60% of ATS families. As with most channelopathies, episodic attacks in ATS are frequently triggered by environmental stresses: exercise for periodic paralysis or stress with adrenergic stimulation for arrhythmia. Fluctuations in K + , either low or high, are potent triggers for attacks of weakness in other variants of periodic paralysis (hypokalemic periodic paralysis or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis). For ATS, the [K + ] dependence is less clear; with reports describing weakness in high-K + or low-K + . Patient trials with controlled K + challenges are not possible, due to arrhythmias. We have developed two mouse models (genetic and pharmacologic) with reduced Kir currents, to address the question of K + -sensitive loss of force. These animal models and computational simulations both show K + -dependent weakness occurs only when Kir current is &lt;30% of wildtype. As the Kir deficit becomes more severe, the phenotype shifts from high-K + -induced weakness to a combination where either high-K + or low-K + triggers weakness. A K + channel agonist, retigabine, protects muscle from K + -sensitive weakness in our mouse models of the skeletal muscle involvement in ATS.},

  abstract     = {Phase separation is one possible mechanism governing the selective cellular enrichment of biomolecular constituents for processes such as transcriptional activation, mRNA regulation, and immune signaling. Phase separation is mediated by multivalent interactions of macromolecules including intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs). Despite considerable advances in experiments, theory, and simulations, the prediction of the thermodynamics of IDR phase behavior remains challenging. We combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and active learning to develop a fast and accurate machine learning model to predict the free energy and saturation concentration for phase separation directly from sequence. We validate the model using computational and previously measured experimental data, as well as new experimental data for six proteins. We apply our model to all 27,663 IDRs of chain length up to 800 residues in the human proteome and find that 1,420 of these (5%) are predicted to undergo homotypic phase separation with transfer free energies &lt; −2 k B T . We use our model to understand the relationship between single-chain compaction and phase separation and find that changes from charge- to hydrophobicity-mediated interactions can break the symmetry between intra- and intermolecular interactions. We also provide proof of principle for how the model can be used in force field refinement. Our work refines and quantifies the established rules governing the connection between sequence features and phase-separation propensities, and our prediction models will be useful for interpreting and designing cellular experiments on the role of phase separation, and for the design of IDRs with specific phase-separation propensities.},

  abstract     = {In native extracellular matrices (ECM), cells utilize matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade and remodel their microenvironment. Accordingly, synthetic matrices have been engineered to permit MMP-mediated cleavage, facilitating cell spreading, migration, and interactions. However, the interplay between matrix degradability and mechanical properties remains underexplored. We hypothesized that MMP activity induces immediate mechanical alterations in the ECM, which are subsequently detected by cells. We observed that both fibrillar collagen and synthetic degradable matrices exhibit enhanced stress relaxation following MMP exposure. Cells responded to these variations in relaxation by modulating their spreading and focal adhesions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that stress relaxation and cell spreading can be precisely controlled through the rational design of matrix degradability. These findings establish a fundamental link between matrix degradability and stress relaxation, with potential implications for a broad spectrum of biological applications.},

  abstract     = {The visual system can process diverse stimuli and make the decision to execute appropriate behaviors, but it remains unclear where and how this transformation takes place. Innate visually evoked behaviors such as hunting, freezing, and escape are thought to be deeply conserved, and have been described in a range of species from insects to humans. We found that zebrafish larvae would respond to predator-like visual stimuli with immobility and bradycardia, both hallmarks of freezing, in a head-fixed behavioral paradigm. We then imaged the zebrafish visual system while larvae responded to different visual stimuli with hunting, freezing, and escape behaviors and systematically identified visually driven neurons and behaviorally correlated sensorimotor neurons. Our analyses indicate that within the optic tectum, broadly tuned sensory neurons are functionally correlated with sensorimotor neurons which respond specifically during one behavior, indicating that it contains suitable information for sensorimotor transformation. We also identified sensorimotor neurons in four other areas downstream of the tectum, and these neurons are also specific for one behavior, indicating that the segregation of the pathways continues in other areas. While our findings shed light on how sensorimotor neurons may integrate visual inputs, further investigation will be required to determine how sensorimotor neurons in different regions interact and where the decision to behave is made.},

Intravital monitoring of bacterial translocation, however, is not yet feasible, which greatly hinders us from comprehending this spatially and temporally dynamic process. Here we report an in vivo fluorogenic labeling method, which enables in situ imaging of mouse gut microbiota and real-time tracking of the translocated bacteria. By mimicking the peptidoglycan stem peptide in bacteria, a tetrapeptide probe composed of alternating D- and L-amino acids and separately equipped with a fluorophore and a quencher on the N- and C-terminal amino acid, is designed. Because of its resistance to host proteases, it can be directly used in gavage and achieves fluorogenic labeling of the microbiota in the gut via the functioning of the L,D-transpeptidases of the labeled bacteria. Using intravital two-photon microscopy, we then successfully visualize the translocation of gut bacteria into the bloodstream and liver in obesity mouse models. This technique can help further exploration into the spatiotemporal activities of gut microbiota in vivo, and be valuable in investigating the less understood pathogenicity of bacterial translocation in many severe diseases.},

In modern life, however, the sounds of voices are often determined not only by intrinsic qualities (such as vocal anatomy) but also by extrinsic properties (such as videoconferencing microphone quality). Here, we show that such superficial auditory properties can have surprisingly deep consequences for higher-level social judgments. Listeners heard short narrated passages (e.g., from job application essays) and then made various judgments about the speakers. Critically, the recordings were modified to simulate different microphone qualities, while carefully equating listeners’ comprehension of the words. Though the manipulations carried no implications about the speakers themselves, common disfluent auditory signals (as in “tinny” speech) led to decreased judgments of intelligence, hireability, credibility, and romantic desirability. These effects were robust across speaker gender and accent, and they occurred for both human and clearly artificial (computer-synthesized) speech. Thus, just as judgments from written text are influenced by factors such as font fluency, judgments from speech are not only based on its content but also biased by the superficial vehicle through which it is delivered. Such effects may become more relevant as daily communication via videoconferencing becomes increasingly widespread.},

  abstract     = {Interferons (IFNs, types I-III) have pleiotropic functions in promoting antiviral and antitumor responses, as well as in modulating inflammation. Dissecting the signaling mechanisms elicited by different IFNs is therefore critical to understand their phenotypes. Here, we use mass spectrometry to investigate the early temporal dynamics of cellular protein phosphorylation in a human lung epithelial cell-line as it responds to stimulation with IFNα2, IFNβ, IFNω, IFNγ, or IFNλ1, representing all IFN types. We report an atlas of over 700 common or unique phosphorylation events reprogrammed by these different IFNs, revealing both previously known and uncharacterized modifications. While the proteins differentially phosphorylated following IFN stimulation have diverse roles, there is an enrichment of factors involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and RNA splicing. Functional screening and mechanistic studies identify that several proteins modified in response to IFNs contribute to host antiviral responses, either directly or by supporting IFN-stimulated gene or protein production. Among these, phosphorylation of PLEKHG3 at serine-1081 creates a phospho-regulated binding motif for the docking of 14-3-3 proteins, and together these factors contribute to coordinating efficient IFN-stimulated gene expression independent of early Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. Our findings map the global phosphorylation landscapes regulated by IFN types I, II, and III, and provide a key resource to explore their functional consequences.},

  abstract     = {The Twomey effect brightens clouds by increasing aerosol concentrations, which activates more droplets and decreases cloud supersaturation in response to more competition for water vapor. To quantify this competition response, we used marine low cloud observations in clean and smoky conditions at Ascension Island in the tropical South Atlantic during the Layered Aerosol Smoke Interactions with Cloud (LASIC) campaign. These observations show similar increases in droplet number for increased accumulation-mode particles from surface-based and satellite cloud retrievals, demonstrating the importance of below-cloud aerosol measurements for retrieving aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) in clean and smoky aerosol conditions. Four methods for estimating cloud supersaturation from aerosol–cloud measurements were compared, with cloud scene-based and parcel-based methods showing sufficient variability for a strong dependence on both aerosol accumulation number concentration and cloud-base updraft velocities. Decomposing aerosol-related changes in cloud albedo and optical depth shows the calculated competition response accounts for dampening the activation response by 12 to 35%, explaining the diminished Twomey effect at high aerosol concentrations observed for smoky conditions at LASIC and previously around the world. This result was consistent for independent supersaturation retrievals by cloud scene-based droplet number and cloud condensation nuclei and parcel-based multimode size-resolving Lagrangian methods. Translating aerosol effects to local radiative forcing with clean conditions as a proxy for preindustrial and smoky conditions for present-day showed that the competition response reduces cooling from the Twomey radiative forcing by 12 to 35%, providing an essential process-specific constraint for improving the representation of aerosol competition in climate model simulation of indirect aerosol forcing.},

  abstract     = {Why are jellyfish round? Animals get their shapes as they develop. After development, however, how animals keep their shapes is less understood. Moon jellies respond to perturbations to body shape, such as being halved or quartered, by reorganizing existing body parts and regaining radial symmetry, i.e., their round shape. The robust recovery of radial symmetry led us to investigate, in this study, how being round is encoded. We tested perturbing shape by grafting body sections in varying configurations. Testing these perturbations confirms the moon jellies’ ability to recover their round shape from many perturbations. However, in response to some perturbations, the jellies can also adopt other stable body shapes, such as oval, quadrilateral, and triangular. Thus, although the jellies are characterized by a radially symmetrical body plan, perturbations can lead to them recovering to bilateral shapes. Employing mathematical modeling, we find that interactions between forces from muscle contractions and viscoelastic tissues can explain the recovery to different shapes. A stable body shape is achieved when the mechanical forces are locally balanced, regardless of symmetry. Consistent with the model prediction that stable shape is the outcome of balancing mechanical forces, modulating the mechanical parameter in the system, i.e., the muscle contraction rate, can produce shape-shifting. Maintaining shapes dynamically as the balance of mechanical forces may enable the animals to readily adapt to changing physical environments.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental problem in machine learning is to understand how neural networks make accurate predictions, while seemingly bypassing the curse of dimensionality. A possible explanation is that common training algorithms for neural networks implicitly perform dimensionality reduction—a process called feature learning. Recent work [A. Radhakrishnan, D. Beaglehole, P. Pandit, M. Belkin, Science 383 , 1461–1467 (2024).] posited that the effects of feature learning can be elicited from a classical statistical estimator called the average gradient outer product (AGOP). The authors proposed Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) as an algorithm that explicitly performs feature learning by alternating between 1) reweighting the feature vectors by the AGOP and 2) learning the prediction function in the transformed space. In this work, we develop theoretical guarantees for how RFM performs dimensionality reduction by focusing on the class of overparameterized problems arising in sparse linear regression and low-rank matrix recovery. Specifically, we show that RFM restricted to linear models (lin-RFM) reduces to a variant of the well-studied Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm. Furthermore, our results connect feature learning in neural networks and classical sparse recovery algorithms and shed light on how neural networks recover low rank structure from data. In addition, we provide an implementation of lin-RFM that scales to matrices with millions of missing entries. Our implementation is faster than the standard IRLS algorithms since it avoids forming singular value decompositions. It also outperforms deep linear networks for sparse linear regression and low-rank matrix completion.},

  abstract     = {The origin of birds represents a pivotal transition in vertebrate evolution, marked by significant changes in both brain size and feeding biomechanics. The evolution of the avian skull involved dramatic modifications, such as a segmented palate and the development of powered cranial kinesis in neognath birds. Powered kinesis, the ability to move parts of the skull independently, is considered a key innovation behind the dietary diversity and evolutionary success of birds. However, the processes driving the emergence of avian kinesis have remained unclear until recently. By analyzing data from Mesozoic birds, including reinterpretations of palate homology, 3D jaw muscle biomechanics, and linkage analysis, researchers have quantified changes in muscle forces and their effects on palate mechanics during the transition from theropods to birds. As the neurocranium expanded in non-avian theropods, temporal muscles shifted to more rostrocaudal positions in birds, aiding in the segmentation of the pterygoid. This musculoskeletal transformation increased fore-aft muscle force in neognaths, enabling powered cranial kinesis. A critical change was the separation of the epipterygoid ossification from the braincase, leading to the breakdown of primitive kinematic linkages and the development of a new basicranial joint, which allowed for greater cranial flexibility. These findings shed light on how the neurosensory and feeding systems coevolved during bird origins and offer new methods for identifying cranial kinesis in extinct vertebrates.},

Our results indicated that the PVH dopaminergic neurons were critical for extending the food consumption phase and involved in the development of obesity through epigenetic mechanisms. These neurons synchronized with proopiomelanocortin neurons during consumption, were stimulated by proopiomelanocortin activation, and projected to the lateral habenula (LHb), where dopamine receptor D2 was involved in the increase in food consumption. In addition, upregulated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in PVH was associated with obesity and indispensable for obesity induction in mice lacking Dnmt3a .

We apply this measure to all vetted mitigation scenarios assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report and two scenarios that model current policies and pledges, using an illustrative equal per capita allocation of a remaining 1.5 °C carbon budget starting in 1990. The resulting regional carbon debt estimates inform i) the scale and pace of regional carbon drawdown obligations necessary to address budget exceedance and ii) relative regional responsibilities for increased lifetime exposure to extreme heatwaves across age cohorts due to budget exceedance.

We then test user-based and algorithm-based interventions to counter the “narrow search effect” and promote belief updating. Studies 1 to 5 show that users’ prior beliefs influence the direction of the search terms, thereby generating narrow search results that limit belief updating. This effect persists across various domains (e.g., beliefs related to coronavirus, nuclear energy, gas prices, crime rates, bitcoin, caffeine, and general food or beverage health concerns; Studies 1a to 1b, 2a to 2g, 3, 4), platforms (e.g., Google—Studies 1a to 1b, 2a to 2g, 4, 5; ChatGPT, Study 3), and extends to consequential choices (Study 5).

  abstract     = {The hierarchical view of the ventral object recognition pathway is primarily based on feedforward mechanisms, starting from a fixed basis set of object primitives and ending on a representation of whole objects in the inferotemporal cortex. Here, we provide a different view. Rather than being a fixed “labeled line” for a specific feature, neurons are continually changing their stimulus selectivities on a moment-to-moment basis, as dictated by top–down influences of object expectation and perceptual task. Here, we also derive the selectivity for stimulus features from an ethologically curated stimulus set, based on a delayed match-to-sample task, that finds components that are informative for object recognition in addition to full objects, though the top–down effects were seen for both informative and uninformative components. Cortical areas responding to these stimuli were identified with functional MRI in order to guide placement of chronically implanted electrode arrays.},

  abstract     = {AI systems have attained superhuman performance across various domains. If the hidden knowledge encoded in these highly capable systems can be leveraged, human knowledge and performance can be advanced. Yet, this internal knowledge is difficult to extract. Due to the vast space of possible internal representations, searching for meaningful new conceptual knowledge can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Here, we introduce a method that extracts new chess concepts from AlphaZero, an AI system that mastered chess via self-play without human supervision. Our method excavates vectors that represent concepts from AlphaZero’s internal representations using convex optimization, and filters the concepts based on teachability (whether the concept is transferable to another AI agent) and novelty (whether the concept contains information not present in human chess games). These steps ensure that the discovered concepts are useful and meaningful. For the resulting set of concepts, prototypes (chess puzzle–solution pairs) are presented to experts for final validation. In a preliminary human study, four top chess grandmasters (all former or current world chess champions) were evaluated on their ability to solve concept prototype positions. All grandmasters showed improvement after the learning phase, suggesting that the concepts are at the frontier of human understanding. Despite the small scale, our result is a proof of concept demonstrating the possibility of leveraging knowledge from a highly capable AI system to advance the frontier of human knowledge; a development that could bear profound implications and shape how we interact with AI systems across many applications.},

  abstract     = {We find evidence of belief in belief —intuitive preferences for religious belief over atheism, even among atheist participants—across eight comparatively secular countries. Religion is a cross-cultural human universal, yet explicit markers of religiosity have rapidly waned in large parts of the world in recent decades. We explored whether intuitive religious influence lingers, even among nonbelievers in largely secular societies. We adapted a classic experimental philosophy task to test for this intuitive belief in belief among people in eight comparatively nonreligious countries: Canada, China, Czechia, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam (total N = 3,804). Our analyses revealed strong evidence that 1) people intuitively favor religious belief over atheism and that 2) this pattern was not moderated by participants’ own self-reported atheism. Indeed, 3) even atheists in relatively secular societies intuitively prefer belief to atheism. These inferences were robust across different analytic strategies and across other measures of individual differences in religiosity and religious instruction. Although explicit religious belief has rapidly declined in these countries, it is possible that belief in belief may still persist. These results speak to the complex psychological and cultural dynamics of secularization.},

  abstract     = {Antibiotic resistance, especially in multidrug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, remains a worldwide problem. Combination antimicrobial therapies may be an important strategy to overcome resistance and broaden the spectrum of existing antibiotics. However, this strategy is limited by the ability to efficiently screen large combinatorial chemical spaces. Here, we deployed a high-throughput combinatorial screening platform, DropArray, to evaluate the interactions of over 30,000 compounds with up to 22 antibiotics and 6 strains of gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, totaling to over 1.3 million unique strain-antibiotic-compound combinations. In this dataset, compounds more frequently exhibited synergy with known antibiotics than single-agent activity. We identified a compound, P2-56, and developed a more potent analog, P2-56-3, which potentiated rifampin (RIF) against antibiotic-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae . Using phenotypic assays, we showed P2-56-3 disrupts the outer membrane of A. baumannii . To identify pathways involved in the mechanism of synergy between P2-56-3 and RIF, we performed genetic screens in A. baumannii . CRISPRi-induced partial depletion of lipooligosaccharide transport genes ( lptA - D , lptFG ) resulted in hypersensitivity to P2-56-3/RIF treatment, demonstrating the genetic dependency of P2-56-3 activity and RIF sensitization on lpt genes in A. baumannii. Consistent with outer membrane homeostasis being an important determinant of P2-56-3/RIF tolerance, knockout of maintenance of lipid asymmetry complex genes and overexpression of certain resistance-nodulation-division efflux pumps—a phenotype associated with multidrug-resistance—resulted in hypersensitivity to P2-56-3. These findings demonstrate the immense scale of phenotypic antibiotic combination screens using DropArray and the potential for such approaches to discover new small molecule synergies against multidrug-resistant ESKAPE strains.},

  abstract     = {The amino acid sequence of the tryptophan-rich sensory proteins (TSPO) is substantially conserved throughout all kingdoms of life. Human mitochondrial TSPO1 ( Hs TSPO1) binds to porphyrins and steroids, although its interactions with these molecules remains unknown. Hs TSPO1 is associated with numerous physiological and pathological disorders, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we disclose the finding of human mitochondrial TSPO as a cholesterol-dependent protoporphyrin IX oxygenase. The results of our biochemical characterization are consistent with structural data and evolutionary analysis. The dependence of Hs TSPO1 activity on cholesterol may be the result of the coevolution of this membrane protein with the membrane system. Our study provides a molecular foundation for comprehending the various roles played by mitochondrial TSPO in normal physiological and pathological situations.},
