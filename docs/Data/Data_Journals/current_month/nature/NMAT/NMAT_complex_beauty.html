Here we provide in vivo evidence showing that endogenous electric fields drive the directed collective cell migration of an embryonic stem cell population—the cephalic neural crest of Xenopus laevis. We demonstrate that the voltage-sensitive phosphatase 1 is a key component of the molecular mechanism, enabling neural crest cells to specifically transduce electric fields into a directional cue in vivo. Finally, we propose that endogenous electric fields are mechanically established by the convergent extension movements of the ectoderm, which generate a membrane tension gradient that opens stretch-activated ion channels. Overall, these findings establish a role for electrotaxis in tissue morphogenesis, highlighting the functions of endogenous bioelectrical stimuli in non-neural contexts. Electric fields guide collective cell migration in developing embryos of Xenopus laevis via a voltage-sensitive phosphatase.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between the microscopic structure and topology of a material and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental challenge across a wide range of systems. Here we investigate the viscoelasticity of DNA nanostar hydrogels—a model system for physical networks with limited valence—by coupling rheology measurements, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations. We discover that these networks display a large degree of interpenetration and that loops within the network are topologically linked, forming a percolating network-within-network structure. Below the overlapping concentration, the fraction of branching points and the pore size determine the high-frequency elasticity of these physical gels. At higher concentrations, we discover that this elastic response is dictated by the abundance of topological links between looped motifs in the gel. Our findings highlight the emergence of ‘topological elasticity’ as a previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming liquids and gels and inform the design of topologically controllable material behaviours. Experiments and simulations of DNA nanostar hydrogels reveal that microscopic topology determines macroscale elasticity in amorphous networks.},

However, increasing the active layer thickness typically leads to a marked drop in the power conversion efficiency. Here we developed an organic semiconductor regulator, called AT-β2O, to tune the crystallization sequence of the components in active layers. When adding AT-β2O in the donor (D18-Cl) and acceptor (N3) blend, N3 crystallizes behind D18-Cl, and this phenomenon is different from the co-crystallization observed in binary D18-Cl:N3 blends. This manipulation of crystallization dynamics is favourable to form bulk-heterojunction-gradient vertical phase separation in the active layer accompanied by the high crystallinity of the acceptor and balanced charge carrier mobilities in thick films. The resultant single-junction organic solar cells exhibited a certified power conversion efficiency of over 20%, as well as demonstrated exceptional adaptability across the active layer thicknesses (100–400 nm) and remarkable universality. Such breakthroughs enable large-area modules with a certified power conversion efficiency of 18.04%. An organic regulator that can tune the crystallization sequence of active layer components has been described, achieving a certified efficiency of over 20% in single-junction organic solar cells, demonstrating remarkable tolerance for active layer thickness of 100–400 nm.},

  abstract     = {The rational design of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with both high crystallinity and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is of crucial importance for achieving high-efficiency and low-energy-loss organic solar cells (OSCs). However, increasing the crystallinity of an NFA tends to decrease its PLQY, which results in a high non-radiative energy loss in OSCs. Here we demonstrate that the crystallinity and PLQY of NFAs can be fine-tuned by asymmetrically adapting the branching position of alkyl chains on the thiophene unit of the L8-BO acceptor. It was found that L8-BO-C4, with 2-butyloctyl on one side and 4-butyldecyl on the other side, can simultaneously achieve high crystallinity and PLQY. A high efficiency of 20.42% (certified as 20.1%) with an open-circuit voltage of 0.894 V and a fill factor of 81.6% is achieved for the single-junction OSC. This work reveals how important the strategy of shifting the alkyl chain branching position is in developing high-performance NFAs for efficient OSCs. Design strategies for non-fullerene acceptors are important for achieving high-efficiency organic solar cells. Here the authors design asymmetrically branched alkyl chains on the thiophene unit of the L8-BO acceptor to achieve high crystallinity and photoluminescence quantum yield, yielding over 20% efficiency in single-junction organic solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Precious metals such as Pt are favoured as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their excellent catalytic activity. However, the scarcity and high cost of precious metals have prompted researchers to explore cheaper alternatives such as Cu. Nevertheless, Cu shows poor catalytic performance due to weak binding with intermediates. Here the catalytic activity of pure Cu is activated via electroreduction-driven modification of the local structure, achieving a HER catalytic performance superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts for working current densities greater than 100 mA cm−2 in acid electrolyte. Activation involved two steps. First, polycrystalline Cu2O nanoparticles were prepared via pulsed laser ablation, resulting in grain boundaries within the Cu2O particles as observed using electron microscopy. Next, the Cu2O particles were electroreduced to pure Cu, inducing the formation of distorted nanotwins and edge dislocations. These local structures induce high lattice strain and decrease the Cu coordination number, enhancing the interaction between Cu and intermediates—as calculated using density functional theory—leading to the excellent catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst. Our observations show that low-cost pure Cu can be a promising HER catalyst for large-scale industrial applications. Low-cost Cu catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can transform industrial water electrolysis, but pure Cu typically exhibits a negligible HER. Here, combining pulsed laser ablation and subsequent electroreduction, Cu nanotwins form that enable the HER at an overpotential of 301 mV, with 125 h of stable operation at a current density of 500 mA cm−2.},

  abstract     = {All-solid-state lithium metal batteries promise high levels of safety and energy density, but their practical realization is limited by low Li reversibility, limited cell loading and demand for high-temperature and high-pressure operation, stemming from solid-state electrolyte (SSE) low-voltage reduction and high-voltage decomposition, and from lithium dendrite growth. Here we concurrently address these challenges by reporting that a family of reductive electrophiles gain electrons and cations from metal–nucleophile materials (here a Li sulfide SSE) upon contact to undergo electrochemical reduction and form interphase layers (named solid reductive-electrophile interphase) on material surfaces. The solid reductive-electrophile interphase is electron blocking and lithiophobic, prevents SSE reduction, suppresses Li dendrites and supports high-voltage cathodes. Consequently, a reductive-electrophile-treated SSE exhibits high critical capacity and Li reversibility at the anode, and enables Li(1% Mg)/SSE/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 all-solid-state lithium metal batteries to achieve a high coulombic efficiency (&amp;gt;99.9%), long cycle life (~10,000 h) and high loading (&amp;gt;7 mAh cm−2) at 30 °C and 2.5 MPa. This concept also extends to cathodes of other materials (for example, metal oxides), boosting the high-nickel cathode’s cycle life and expanding the operational voltage up to 4.5 V. Such solid reductive-electrophile interphase tailoring of material surfaces holds promise to accelerate all-solid-state lithium metal battery commercialization and offer solutions for a wide range of materials. Solid-state electrolyte reduction and Li dendrite growth limit the stability of all-solid-state Li metal batteries. Here the authors show that reductive electrophiles gain electrons and metal cations from metal–nucleophile materials on contact, allowing the electrochemical formation of a dense, electron-blocking film that improves the stability of both the anode and high-voltage cathode.},

Yet, visualizing spin-wave dynamics at nanoscale and microwave frequencies remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of spin-sensitive, time-resolved microscopy. Here we report a breakthrough in imaging dipole-exchange spin waves in a ferromagnetic film owing to the development of laser-free ultrafast Lorentz electron microscopy, which is equipped with a microwave-mediated electron pulser for high spatiotemporal resolution. Using topological spin textures, we captured the emission, propagation, reflection and interference of spin waves from spin anti-vortices under radio-frequency excitations. Remarkably, we show that spin-wave generation is closely tied to the oscillatory motion of specific magnetic domain walls, providing the missing link between wave emission and wall dynamics near magnetic singularities. This work opens new possibilities in magnonics, offering a nanoscopic view of spin dynamics via transmission electron microscopy and enabling controlled excitation via radio-frequency fields for exploring non-equilibrium states in magnetic and multiferroic systems. A laser-free ultrafast Lorentz electron microscope has been developed, integrating a microwave-based electron pulser to achieve high spatiotemporal imaging of spin-wave dynamics in a topologically textured thin-film permalloy.},

However, unlike the remote epitaxial growth of three-dimensional bulk crystals, the growth of two-dimensional material heterostructures across atomic layers has been limited due to the weak vdW interaction. Here we report the double-sided epitaxy of vdW layered materials through atomic membranes. We grow vdW topological insulators Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 by molecular-beam epitaxy on both surfaces of atomically thin graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, which serve as suspended two-dimensional vdW substrate layers. Both homo- and hetero-double-sided vdW topological insulator tunnel junctions are fabricated, with the atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride acting as a crystal-momentum-conserving tunnelling barrier with abrupt and epitaxial interfaces. By performing field-angle-dependent magneto-tunnelling spectroscopy on these devices, we reveal the energy–momentum–spin resonance of massless Dirac electrons tunnelling between helical Landau levels developed in the topological surface states at the interfaces. Double-sided epitaxy of van der Waals materials through atomic membranes is demonstrated, enabling electrons to resonantly tunnel between aligned topological insulator surfaces with the conservation of energy, momentum and spin helicity.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals magnets has greatly expanded our ability to create and control nanoscale quantum phases. A unique capability emerges when a two-dimensional magnet is also a semiconductor that features tightly bound excitons with large oscillator strengths that fundamentally determine the optical response and are tunable with magnetic fields. Here we report a previously unidentified type of optical excitation—a magnetic surface exciton—enabled by the antiferromagnetic spin correlations that confine excitons to the surface of CrSBr. Magnetic surface excitons exhibit stronger Coulomb attraction, leading to a higher binding energy than excitons confined in bulk layers, and profoundly alter the optical response of few-layer crystals. Distinct magnetic confinement of surface and bulk excitons is established by layer- and temperature-dependent exciton reflection spectroscopy and corroborated by ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations. By quenching interlayer excitonic interactions, the antiferromagnetic order of CrSBr strictly confines the bound electron–hole pairs within the same layer, regardless of the total number of layers. Our work unveils unique confined excitons in a layered antiferromagnet, highlighting magnetic interactions as a vital approach for nanoscale quantum confinement, from few layers to the bulk limit. The emergence of magnetically confined surface excitons enabled by antiferromagnetic spin correlations is reported, which leads to the confinement of excitons to the surface of layered antiferromagnet CrSBr.},

  abstract     = {Many surprising properties of quantum materials result from Coulomb correlations defining electronic quasiparticles and their interaction chains. In van der Waals layered crystals, enhanced correlations have been tailored in reduced dimensions, enabling excitons with giant binding energies and emergent phases including ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and multiferroic orders. Yet, correlation design has primarily relied on structural engineering. Here we present quantitative experiment–theory proof that excitonic correlations can be switched through magnetic order. By probing internal Rydberg-like transitions of excitons in the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr, we reveal their binding energy and a dramatic anisotropy of their quasi-one-dimensional orbitals manifesting in strong fine-structure splitting. We switch the internal structure from strongly bound, monolayer-localized states to weakly bound, interlayer-delocalized states by pushing the system from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phases. Our analysis connects this transition to the exciton’s spin-controlled effective quantum confinement, supported by the exciton’s dynamics. In future applications, excitons or even condensates may be interfaced with spintronics; extrinsically switchable Coulomb correlations could shape phase transitions on demand. The antiferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition in a two-dimensional semiconducting magnet, CrSBr, induces an exciton confinement transition from a strongly bound quasi-one-dimensional state to a weakly bound interlayer-delocalized state.},

  abstract     = {Creating chirality in achiral graphene and other two-dimensional materials has attracted broad scientific interest due to their potential application in advanced optics, electronics and spintronics. However, investigations into their optical activities and related chiro-electronic properties are constrained by experimental challenges, particularly in the precise control over the chirality of these materials. Here a universal wax-aided immersion method is developed to yield graphene rolls with controllable chiral angles, and the method can be generalized in other two-dimensional materials for high-yield fabrication. The left-handed and right-handed rolls exhibit optical activity and excellent spin selectivity effects with a spin polarization over 90% at room temperature. The discovery of tunable chirality-induced spin selectivity in tailored roll-shaped allotropes, achievable only through precise control of chirality, distinguishes itself from other carbon materials or existing chiral materials. Our Dirac fermion model shows that the electrons moving predominately along one side of the chiral roll develop a preferred spin polarization, and the rolling-chirality-induced spin selectivity is a result of this finite spin selectivity effect. Our method opens up opportunities for endowing achiral two-dimensional materials with tunable chirality, and may enable the emergence of quantum behaviours and room-temperature spintronic technologies. A wax-aided immersion methodology is developed to yield graphene rolls with tunable chiral angles; these graphene rolls exhibit promising chiral electronic properties beyond those of other carbon allotropes.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals materials display rich structural polymorphs with distinct physical properties. An atomistic understanding of the phase-transition dynamics, propagation pathway and associated evolution of physical properties is essential for capturing their potential in practical technologies. However, direct visualization of the rapid phase-transition process is fundamentally challenging due to the inherent trade-offs among atomic resolution, field of view and imaging frame rate. Here we exploit a controllable current-driven phase transition and utilize in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy to visualize dynamic atomic rearrangements during the 2H-α to 2H-β transition in layered In2Se3. We identify a unique intralayer-splitting (unzipping) and interlayer-reconstruction (zipping) pathway, driven by an energy-cascading mechanism through which bond formation across the van der Waals gap facilitates bond cleavage in the covalent layers. We also observe current-direction-dependent asymmetric phase-transition propagation and attribute it to a temperature profile induced by the Peltier effect at the heterophase interface. These findings provide insights that are essential for designing tailored structural phase transitions in advanced technologies. Current-driven dynamic atomic rearrangements in layered In2Se3 are visualized. The authors identify an intralayer ‘unzipping’ and interlayer ‘zipping’ phase-transition pathway in which bond formation across the van der Waals gaps drives bond cleavage within covalent layers.},

  abstract     = {Deformation twinning, a phenomenon primarily documented within metallic systems, has remained essentially unexplored in covalent materials due to the formidable challenges posed by their inherent extreme hardness and brittleness. Here, by employing a five-degree-of-freedom nano-manipulation stage inside a transmission electron microscope, we reveal a loading-specific twinning criterion for cubic boron nitride and successfully activate extensive deformation twinning with substantial improvements in mechanical properties in &amp;lt;100&amp;gt;-oriented cubic boron nitride submicrometre pillars at room temperature. Beyond cubic boron nitride, this criterion is also proven widely applicable across a spectrum of covalent materials. Investigations on the twinning dynamics at the atomic level in cubic boron nitride suggest a continuous-transition-mediated pathway. These findings substantially advance our comprehension of twinning mechanisms in covalent face-centred cubic materials, and herald a promising avenue for microstructural engineering aimed at enhancing the strength and toughness of these materials in their applications. Deformation twinning, a key deformation mechanism that is rarely explored in superhard materials, is shown to be activated in cubic boron nitride and other cubic covalent materials under a loading-specific twinning criterion.},

Despite the utility and importance of this property in regard to scientific and engineering applications, the atomic-scale location of the force that returns an object to its original shape remains elusive in molecular crystals. Here we use a series of density functional theory calculations to locate precisely where the energy is stored when single crystals of three molecular materials are placed under elastic stress. We show for each material that different intermolecular interactions are responsible for the restoring force under both expansive and compressive strain. These findings provide insight into the elastic behaviour of crystalline materials that is needed for more efficient design of flexible technologies and future smart devices. Elasticity is ubiquitous in everyday life, but the molecular origin of the restoring force remains elusive. Here the authors use a series of density functional theory calculations to understand how interaction energies change as a result of the bending of molecular crystals.},

  abstract     = {Molecules are the building blocks of all of nature’s functional components, serving as the machinery that captures, stores and releases energy or converts it into useful work. However, molecules interact with each other over extremely short distances, which hinders the spread of energy across molecular systems. Conversely, photons are inert, but they are fast and can traverse large distances very efficiently. Using optical resonators, these distinct entities can be mixed with each other, opening a path to new architectures that benefit from both the active nature of molecules and the long-range transport obtained by the coupling with light. In this Review, we present the physics underlying the enhancement of energy transfer and energy transport in molecular systems, and highlight the experimental and theoretical advances in this field over the past decade. Finally, we identify several key questions and theoretical challenges that remain to be resolved via future research.
