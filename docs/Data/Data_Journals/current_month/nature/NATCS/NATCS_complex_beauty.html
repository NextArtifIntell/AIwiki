  abstract     = {Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is an evolving field aimed at discerning crystal structures with minimal prior information. Despite the success of various CSP algorithms, their practical applicability remains circumscribed, particularly for large and complex systems. Here, to address this challenge, we show an evolutionary structure generator within the MAGUS (Machine Learning and Graph Theory Assisted Universal Structure Searcher) framework, inspired by the symmetry principle. This generator extracts both global and local features of explored crystal structures using group and graph theory. By integrating an on-the-fly space group miner and fragment reorganizer, augmented by symmetry-kept mutation, our approach generates higher-quality initial structures, reducing the computational costs of CSP tasks. Benchmarking tests show up to fourfold performance improvements. The method also proves valid in complex phosphorus allotrope systems. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the diamond–silicon (111)-(7 × 7) surface system, identifying up to 42 metastable structures within an 18 meV Å−2 energy range, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in navigating challenging search spaces. This study presents a symmetry principle-biased crystal structure prediction scheme within the MAGUS framework, achieving up to a fourfold performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) bear promise as a fast and accurate material modeling paradigm for evaluation, analysis and design. Their vast number of trainable parameters necessitates a wealth of data to achieve accuracy and mitigate overfitting. However, experimental measurements are often limited and costly to obtain in sufficient quantities for fine-tuning. To this end, here we present a physics-based training pipeline that tackles the pathology of data scarcity. The core enabler is a physics-based modeling framework that generates a multitude of synthetic data to align the LLM to a physically consistent initial state before fine-tuning. Our framework features a two-phase training strategy: utilizing the large-in-amount but less accurate synthetic data for supervised pretraining, and fine-tuning the phase-1 model with limited experimental data. We empirically demonstrate that supervised pretraining is vital to obtaining accurate fine-tuned LLMs, via the lens of learning polymer flammability metrics where cone calorimeter data are sparse. A physics-based training pipeline is developed to help tackle the challenges of data scarcity. The framework aligns large language models to a physically consistent initial state that is fine-tuned for learning polymer properties.},

  abstract     = {Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra contain key information about molecular chirality by discriminating the absolute configurations of chiral molecules, which is crucial in asymmetric organic synthesis and the drug industry. However, existing predictive approaches lack the consideration of ECD spectra owing to the data scarcity and the limited interpretability to achieve trustworthy prediction. Here we establish a large-scale dataset for chiral molecular ECD spectra and propose ECDFormer for accurate and interpretable ECD spectrum prediction. ECDFormer decomposes ECD spectra into peak entities, uses the QFormer architecture to learn peak properties and renders peaks into spectra. Compared with spectrum sequence prediction methods, our decoupled peak prediction approach substantially enhances both accuracy and efficiency, improving the peak symbol accuracy from 37.3% to 72.7% and decreasing the time cost from an average of 4.6 central processing unit hours to 1.5 s. Moreover, ECDFormer demonstrated its ability to capture molecular orbital information directly from spectral data using the explainable peak-decoupling approach. Furthermore, ECDFormer proved to be equally proficient at predicting various types of spectrum, including infrared and mass spectroscopies, highlighting its substantial generalization capabilities. A large-scale electronic circular dichroism spectrum dataset is proposed and the ECDFormer framework is developed to achieve accurate and interpretable ECD spectrum prediction for natural products.},

  abstract     = {Despite the mounting demand for generative population models, their limited generalizability to underrepresented demographic groups hinders widespread adoption in real-world applications. Here we propose a diversity-aware population modeling framework that can guide targeted strategies in public health and education, by estimating subgroup-level effects and stratifying predictions to capture sociodemographic variability. We leverage Bayesian multilevel regression and post-stratification to systematically quantify inter-individual differences in the relationship between socioeconomic status and cognitive development. Post-stratification enhanced the interpretability of model predictions across underrepresented groups by incorporating US Census data to gain additional insights into smaller subgroups in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. This ensured that predictions were not skewed by overly heterogeneous or homogeneous representations. Our analyses underscore the importance of combining Bayesian multilevel modeling with post-stratification to validate reliability and provide a more holistic explanation of sociodemographic disparities in our diversity-aware population modeling framework. The study proposes a diversity-aware population modeling framework that can guide targeted strategies in public health, using Bayesian multilevel regression and post-stratification to quantify sociodemographic disparities in cognitive development.},

DySPred accurately predicts toxicity risks across diverse demographic cohorts and cancer types, demonstrating resilience in small-sample scenarios and revealing toxicity trends over time. Furthermore, DySPred consistently aligns the toxicity-safety profiles of small-molecule antineoplastic agents with their drug-induced transcriptional alterations. Our study provides a versatile methodology for population-level profiling of ICI-induced toxicities, enabling proactive toxicity monitoring and timely tailoring of treatment and intervention strategies in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy.

However, experimental methods to identify HEPs are often costly, time consuming and labor intensive. In addition, existing computational methods predict HEPs only at the cell line level, but HEPs vary across living human, cell line and animal models. Here we develop a sequence-based deep learning model, Protein Importance Calculator (PIC), by fine-tuning a pretrained protein language model. PIC not only substantially outperforms existing methods for predicting HEPs but also provides comprehensive prediction results across three levels: human, cell line and mouse. Furthermore, we define the protein essential score, derived from PIC, to quantify human protein essentiality and validate its effectiveness by a series of biological analyses. We also demonstrate the biomedical value of the protein essential score by identifying potential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer and quantifying the essentiality of 617,462 human microproteins. This study introduces the Protein Importance Calculator (PIC), a deep learning model designed to predict human essential proteins (HEPs) crucial for survival and development. Unlike conventional methods, PIC offers a comprehensive assessment of HEPs across three levels: humans, cell lines and mice.},
