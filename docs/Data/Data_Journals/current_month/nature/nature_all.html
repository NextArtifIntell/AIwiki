  abstract     = {Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is an evolving field aimed at discerning crystal structures with minimal prior information. Despite the success of various CSP algorithms, their practical applicability remains circumscribed, particularly for large and complex systems. Here, to address this challenge, we show an evolutionary structure generator within the MAGUS (Machine Learning and Graph Theory Assisted Universal Structure Searcher) framework, inspired by the symmetry principle. This generator extracts both global and local features of explored crystal structures using group and graph theory. By integrating an on-the-fly space group miner and fragment reorganizer, augmented by symmetry-kept mutation, our approach generates higher-quality initial structures, reducing the computational costs of CSP tasks. Benchmarking tests show up to fourfold performance improvements. The method also proves valid in complex phosphorus allotrope systems. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the diamond–silicon (111)-(7 × 7) surface system, identifying up to 42 metastable structures within an 18 meV Å−2 energy range, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in navigating challenging search spaces. This study presents a symmetry principle-biased crystal structure prediction scheme within the MAGUS framework, achieving up to a fourfold performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) bear promise as a fast and accurate material modeling paradigm for evaluation, analysis and design. Their vast number of trainable parameters necessitates a wealth of data to achieve accuracy and mitigate overfitting. However, experimental measurements are often limited and costly to obtain in sufficient quantities for fine-tuning. To this end, here we present a physics-based training pipeline that tackles the pathology of data scarcity. The core enabler is a physics-based modeling framework that generates a multitude of synthetic data to align the LLM to a physically consistent initial state before fine-tuning. Our framework features a two-phase training strategy: utilizing the large-in-amount but less accurate synthetic data for supervised pretraining, and fine-tuning the phase-1 model with limited experimental data. We empirically demonstrate that supervised pretraining is vital to obtaining accurate fine-tuned LLMs, via the lens of learning polymer flammability metrics where cone calorimeter data are sparse. A physics-based training pipeline is developed to help tackle the challenges of data scarcity. The framework aligns large language models to a physically consistent initial state that is fine-tuned for learning polymer properties.},

  abstract     = {Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra contain key information about molecular chirality by discriminating the absolute configurations of chiral molecules, which is crucial in asymmetric organic synthesis and the drug industry. However, existing predictive approaches lack the consideration of ECD spectra owing to the data scarcity and the limited interpretability to achieve trustworthy prediction. Here we establish a large-scale dataset for chiral molecular ECD spectra and propose ECDFormer for accurate and interpretable ECD spectrum prediction. ECDFormer decomposes ECD spectra into peak entities, uses the QFormer architecture to learn peak properties and renders peaks into spectra. Compared with spectrum sequence prediction methods, our decoupled peak prediction approach substantially enhances both accuracy and efficiency, improving the peak symbol accuracy from 37.3% to 72.7% and decreasing the time cost from an average of 4.6 central processing unit hours to 1.5 s. Moreover, ECDFormer demonstrated its ability to capture molecular orbital information directly from spectral data using the explainable peak-decoupling approach. Furthermore, ECDFormer proved to be equally proficient at predicting various types of spectrum, including infrared and mass spectroscopies, highlighting its substantial generalization capabilities. A large-scale electronic circular dichroism spectrum dataset is proposed and the ECDFormer framework is developed to achieve accurate and interpretable ECD spectrum prediction for natural products.},

  abstract     = {Despite the mounting demand for generative population models, their limited generalizability to underrepresented demographic groups hinders widespread adoption in real-world applications. Here we propose a diversity-aware population modeling framework that can guide targeted strategies in public health and education, by estimating subgroup-level effects and stratifying predictions to capture sociodemographic variability. We leverage Bayesian multilevel regression and post-stratification to systematically quantify inter-individual differences in the relationship between socioeconomic status and cognitive development. Post-stratification enhanced the interpretability of model predictions across underrepresented groups by incorporating US Census data to gain additional insights into smaller subgroups in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. This ensured that predictions were not skewed by overly heterogeneous or homogeneous representations. Our analyses underscore the importance of combining Bayesian multilevel modeling with post-stratification to validate reliability and provide a more holistic explanation of sociodemographic disparities in our diversity-aware population modeling framework.

However, experimental methods to identify HEPs are often costly, time consuming and labor intensive. In addition, existing computational methods predict HEPs only at the cell line level, but HEPs vary across living human, cell line and animal models. Here we develop a sequence-based deep learning model, Protein Importance Calculator (PIC), by fine-tuning a pretrained protein language model. PIC not only substantially outperforms existing methods for predicting HEPs but also provides comprehensive prediction results across three levels: human, cell line and mouse. Furthermore, we define the protein essential score, derived from PIC, to quantify human protein essentiality and validate its effectiveness by a series of biological analyses. We also demonstrate the biomedical value of the protein essential score by identifying potential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer and quantifying the essentiality of 617,462 human microproteins. This study introduces the Protein Importance Calculator (PIC), a deep learning model designed to predict human essential proteins (HEPs) crucial for survival and development. Unlike conventional methods, PIC offers a comprehensive assessment of HEPs across three levels: humans, cell lines and mice.},

By implementing semistructured interviews with 25 biodiversity finance key informants and three focus groups across Europe, we explore opportunities and challenges for upscaling private investment in nature. Opportunities arise from macroeconomic and regulatory changes, along with various technological and financial innovations and growing professional experience. However, persistent barriers to upscaling include the ongoing lack of highly profitable investment opportunities and the multitude of risks facing investors, including political, ecological and reputational risks influencing supply and demand of investment opportunities. Public policy plays the foundational role in creating and hindering these mechanisms. Public policy can create nature markets and investment opportunities, meanwhile agricultural subsidies and poor coordination between public funding sources undermine the supply of return-seeking investment opportunities. Investors demand derisking investments from uncertainties; in part caused by political uncertainty. These markets require profound state intervention to enable upscaling whilst achieving positive ecological outcomes; private investment will probably not upscale without major public policy change and public investment. Semistructured interviews and focus groups with experts in biodiversity finance in Europe identify opportunities and barriers to upscaling private investment in biodiversity, and emphasize that public policy is the key to enabling progression.},

  abstract     = {Forest gains and losses may have unequal effects on forest resilience, particularly given their distinct temporal dynamics. Here, we quantify the sensitivities of boreal forest resilience to forest cover gain and loss using a resilience indicator derived from the temporal autocorrelation (TAC) of the kernel normalized difference vegetation index from 2000 to 2020. Our findings unveil pronounced asymmetric sensitivities, with stronger sensitivity to forest loss (−4.26 ± 0.14 × 10−3; TAC increase per 1% forest cover loss) than to forest gain (−1.65 ± 0.12 × 10−3; TAC decrease per 1% forest cover gain). Locally, ~73% of the boreal forest exhibits negative sensitivity, indicating enhanced resilience with forest cover gain and vice versa, especially in intact forests compared to managed ones. This sensitivity is affected by various trajectories in forest cover change, stemming primarily from temporal asynchrony in the recovery rates of various ecosystem functions. The observed asymmetry underscores the importance of prioritizing forest conservation over reactive management strategies following losses, ultimately contributing to more sustainable forest management practices. Boreal forests have been experiencing both gains and losses in recent decades. Here, the authors show that boreal forest resilience is more sensitive to forest cover losses than to gains, indicating that functional declines due to forest loss outpace improvements following forest recovery.},

  abstract     = {Global agreements to reduce the extinction risk of migratory species depend critically on intersecting migratory connectivity—the linking of individuals between regions in different seasons—and spatial patterns of environmental change. Here we integrate movement data from &amp;gt;329,000 migratory birds of 112 species to develop a parameter representing exposure to global change: multispecies migratory connectivity. We then combine exposure with projected climate and land-cover changes as a measure of hazard and species conservation assessment scores as a metric of vulnerability to estimate the relative risk of migratory bird population declines across the Western Hemisphere. Multispecies migratory connectivity (exposure) is the strongest driver of risk relative to hazard and vulnerability, indicating the importance of synthesizing connectivity across species to comprehensively assess risk. Connections between breeding regions in Canada and non-breeding regions in South America are at the greatest risk, which underscores the particular susceptibility of long-distance migrants. Over half (54%) of the connections categorized as very high risk include breeding regions in the eastern United States. This three-part framework serves as an ecological risk assessment designed specifically for migratory species, providing both decision support for global biodiversity conservation and opportunities for intergovernmental collaboration to sustain migratory bird populations year-round. On the basis of data from &amp;gt;329,000 migratory birds, this study presents multispecies migratory connectivity as a parameter representing exposure to global change and shows that connections between breeding regions in Canada and non-breeding regions in South America are at greatest risk from global change.},

  abstract     = {Colonization of a novel habitat is often followed by phenotypic diversification in the wake of ecological opportunity. However, some habitats should be inherently more constraining than others if the challenges of that environment offer few evolutionary solutions. We examined this push-and-pull on macroevolutionary diversification following habitat transitions in the anglerfishes (Lophiiformes). We constructed a phylogeny with extensive sampling (1,092 loci and ~38% of species), combined with three-dimensional phenotypic data from museum specimens. We used these datasets to examine the tempo and mode of phenotypic diversification. The deep-sea pelagic anglerfishes originated from a benthic ancestor and shortly after experienced rapid lineage diversification rates. This transition incurred shifts towards larger jaws, smaller eyes and a more laterally compressed body plan. Despite these directional trends, this lineage still evolved high phenotypic disparity in body, skull and jaw shapes. In particular, bathypelagic anglerfishes show high variability in body elongation, while benthic anglerfishes are constrained around optimal shapes. Within this radiation, phenotypic evolution was concentrated among recently diverged lineages, notably those that deviated from the archetypical globose body plan. Taken together, these results demonstrate that spectacular evolutionary radiations can unfold even within environments with few ecological resources and demanding physiological challenges. Based on phylogenomic and geometric morphometric analyses of 132 anglerfish species, the authors infer a Cretaceous origin of the clade and show that bathypelagic anglerfish are undergoing rapid phenotypic diversification despite inhabiting a relatively homogeneous deep-sea habitat.},

  abstract     = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is highly prevalent in nature. Several hypotheses aim to explain its evolution including sexual selection, differential equilibrium and ecological niche divergence. Disentangling the causal mechanism behind the evolution of SSD is challenging, as selection arising from multiple pressures on fitness may act simultaneously to generate observed patterns. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to study the evolution of SSD across tetrapods globally. We estimate directional changes in body size evolution, and compare the number, phylogenetic position and magnitude of size changes between sexes. We find evidence that directional changes in size associated with SSD are typically more common in males—even in lineages where females are larger. However, underlying mechanisms differ among lineages—whereas SSD in amphibians becomes more male-biased with greater increases in male size and mammalian SSD becomes more female-biased with greater decreases in male size. Thus, differing mechanisms of directional body size evolution across sexes are essential to explain observed SSD patterns. A phylogenetic comparative analysis of male and female body size across tetrapods globally shows that directional change in size is usually greater in males but reveals different underlying mechanisms among lineages.},

  abstract     = {Sex chromosomes are a fundamental aspect of sex-biased biology, but the extent to which homologous X–Y gene pairs (‘the gametologs’) contribute to sex-biased phenotypes remains hotly debated. Although these genes tend to exhibit large sex differences in expression throughout the body (XX females can express both X members, and XY males can express one X and one Y member), there is conflicting evidence regarding the degree of functional divergence between the X and Y members. Here we develop and apply co-expression fingerprint analysis to characterize functional divergence between the X and Y members of 17 gametolog gene pairs across &amp;gt;40 human tissues. Gametolog pairs exhibit functional divergence between the sexes that is driven by divergence between the X versus Y members (assayed in males), and this within-pair divergence is greatest among pairs with evolutionarily distant X and Y members. These patterns reflect that X versus Y gametologs show coordinated patterns of asymmetric coupling with large sets of autosomal genes, which are enriched for functional pathways and gene sets implicated in sex-biased biology and disease. Our findings suggest that the X versus Y gametologs have diverged in function and prioritize specific gametolog pairs for future targeted experimental studies. Based on co-expression fingerprint analysis between homologous genes in the X and Y chromosomes (gametolog pairs) across &amp;gt;40 human tissues, the authors suggest that X and Y gametologs have diverged in function.},

Climate change is intensifying disturbances, posing risks to ecosystem services. To assess those risks, we develop a flexible, functional trait-based approach to quantify ecological, ecosystem service and economic impacts from disturbance regimes. Our broadly applicable approach integrates knowledge from disturbance ecology and ecosystem service valuation, and we highlight the pitfalls of using either perspective in isolation. We demonstrate our approach by quantifying impacts to timber and recreational enjoyment from extreme windstorms in a midlatitude forest. While we predict large potential losses to these services under historical and future disturbance regimes, common ecological metrics of compositional and biomass stability are inadequate for predicting these impacts. We then provide a roadmap for applying our approach across different social-ecological systems, illustrating the approach for crop pollination, flood hazard mitigation and cultural values from coral reefs—which all face intensifying disturbances. This study highlights and provides tools to address the pressing need to consider disturbances in future ecosystem service assessments. A generalizable, functional-trait-based approach for quantifying the effects of disturbances to ecosystem services and economic outcomes, including under climate change, highlights the need for incorporating disturbances in ecosystem services assessments.},

  abstract     = {Accounting for the cost of repairing the degradation of Earth’s biosphere is critical to guide conservation and sustainable development decisions. Yet the costs of repairing nature through the recovery of a continental suite of threatened species across their range have never been calculated. We estimated the cost of in situ recovery of nationally listed terrestrial and freshwater threatened species (n = 1,657) across the megadiverse continent of Australia by combining the spatially explicit costs of all strategies required to address species-specific threats. Individual species recovery required up to 12 strategies (mean 2.3), predominantly habitat retention and restoration, and the management of fire and invasive species. The estimated costs of maximizing threatened species recovery across Australia varied from AU$0–$12,626 per ha, depending on the species, threats and context of each location. The total cost of implementing all strategies to recover threatened species in their in situ habitat across Australia summed to an estimated AU$583 billion per year, with management of invasive weeds making up 81% of the total cost. This figure, at 25% of Australia’s GDP, does not represent a realistic biodiversity conservation budget, but needs to be accounted for when weighing up decisions that lead to further costly degradation of Australia’s natural heritage. An estimated AU$583 billion per year cost of in situ recovery of terrestrial and freshwater species in Australia, including through habitat restoration and retention and management of invasive species, is not an expected conservation budget, but exemplifies the severe cost of nature declines.},

NBSAPS are an integral feature of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) framework and signatory nations were requested to submit revised NBSAPs before the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP-16) incorporating the GBF goals and targets. Here we review NBSAPs of the 36 nations that submitted before COP-16 and assess their commitments to implementing target 2 (the 30% restoration target) and target 3 (the 30 × 30 protection target). By first breaking these targets into their constituent elements and assessing the detailed wording of each NBSAP we discover that no nation has created a plan that meets all the requirements—and overall ambitions—of these two targets. With 5 years remaining until the intended realization of the GBF, countries will need to increase both their ambition and action if the biodiversity crisis of the Earth is to be abated. Analysis of the 36 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans that were submitted to the Convention on Biological Diversity by 21 October 2024 reveal that no nation has yet created a plan that meets all elements of targets 2 and 3 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.},

  abstract     = {The outcomes of ecological invasions may depend on either characteristics of the invading species or attributes of the resident community. Here we use a combination of experiments and theory to show that the interplay between dynamics, interaction strength and diversity determine the invasion outcome in microbial communities. We find that the communities with fluctuating species abundances are more invasible and diverse than stable communities, leading to a positive diversity–invasibility relationship among communities assembled in the same environment. As predicted by theory, increasing interspecies interaction strength and species pool size leads to a decrease of invasion probability in our experiment. Our results show a positive correspondence between invasibility and survival fraction of resident species across all conditions. Communities composed of strongly interacting species can exhibit an emergent priority effect in which invader species are less likely to colonize than species in the original pool. However, if an invasion is successful, its ecological effects on the resident community are greater when interspecies interactions are strong. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the diversity–invasibility debate by showing that invasibility and invasion effect are emergent properties of interacting species, which can be predicted by simple community-level features. Predicting invasion outcomes in microbial communities is challenging. Here the authors demonstrate that these outcomes in both theoretical and experimental microbial communities can be predicted based on community dynamics, diversity and species interactions.},

Factors expected to boost resilience include prior exposure to the same disturbance and dispersal from undisturbed patches. Here we set up an in vitro system to test the effect of disturbance pre-exposure and dispersal represented by community mixing. We performed a serial passage experiment on a 23-species bacterial model community, varying pre-exposure history and dispersal rate between three metacommunity patches subjected to different levels of disturbance by the antibiotic streptomycin. As expected, pre-exposure caused evolution of resistance, which prevented decrease in species abundance. The more abundant the pre-exposed species had been in the undisturbed community, the less the entire community changed. Pre-exposure of the most dominant species also decreased abundance change in off-target species. In the absence of pre-exposure, increasing dispersal rates caused increasing spread of the disturbance across the metacommunity. However, pre-exposure kept the metacommunity close to the undisturbed state regardless of dispersal rate. Our findings demonstrate that pre-exposure is an important modifier of ecological resilience in a metacommunity setting. Community resilience to stress is affected by factors such as pre-exposure to the same stress and intercommunity dispersal. The authors show that pre-exposing the most dominant members of a 23-species bacterial community to different levels of antibiotic stress leads to rapid evolution of resistance that improves metacommunity resilience even under high levels of dispersal.},

However, the growth seasonality of below-ground woody organs, such as coarse roots, has been largely overlooked. Here we use tree monitoring data and pot experiments involving saplings to examine the late-season xylem development of stem and coarse roots with leaf phenology in four common deciduous tree species in Western Europe. Coarse-roots wood growth continued throughout the winter whereas stem wood growth halted in autumn, regardless of the tree species, experimental setting or location. Our results do not indicate a clear temperature constraint on below-ground wood growth, even during prolonged periods with soil temperatures lower than 3 °C. The continuous differentiation of xylem root cells in autumn and winter suggests that the non-growing season does not exist sensu stricto for all woody organs of angiosperm deciduous tree species of the temperate zone. Our findings hold implications for understanding tree functioning, in particular the seasonal wood formation, the environmental controls of tree growth and the carbon reserves dynamics. As wood growth in deciduous tree stems halts during winter, it has been assumed that wood growth in coarse roots follows the same pattern. This study on the growth of stem and coarse roots of four European tree species challenges the assumption of winter halt in below-ground wood growth of temperate deciduous trees.},

Here we draw upon a range of fields to discuss unique potential applications in which generative AI could accelerate the field of ecology, including augmenting data-scarce datasets, extending observations of ecological patterns and increasing the accessibility of ecological data. We also highlight key challenges, risks and considerations when using generative AI within ecology, such as privacy risks, model biases and environmental effects. Ultimately, the future of generative AI in ecology lies in the development of robust interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and computer scientists. Such partnerships will be important for embedding ecological knowledge within AI, leading to more ecologically meaningful and relevant models. This will be critical for leveraging the power of generative AI to drive ecological insights into species across the globe.

  abstract     = {Recently, many artificial intelligence (AI)-powered protein–ligand docking and scoring methods have been developed, demonstrating impressive speed and accuracy. However, these methods often neglected the physical plausibility of the docked complexes and their efficacy in virtual screening (VS) projects. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark analysis of four AI-powered and four physics-based docking tools and two AI-enhanced rescoring methods. We initially constructed the TrueDecoy set, a dataset on which the redocking experiments revealed that KarmaDock and CarsiDock surpassed all physics-based tools in docking accuracy, whereas all physics-based tools notably outperformed AI-based methods in structural rationality. The low physical plausibility of docked structures generated by the top AI method, CarsiDock, mainly stems from insufficient intermolecular validity. The VS results on the TrueDecoy set highlight the effectiveness of RTMScore as a rescore function, and Glide-based methods achieved the highest enrichment factors among all docking tools. Furthermore, we created the RandomDecoy set, a dataset that more closely resembles real-world VS scenarios, where AI-based tools obviously outperformed Glide. Additionally, we found that the employed ligand-based postprocessing methods had a weak or even negative impact on optimizing the conformations of docked complexes and enhancing VS performance. Finally, we proposed a hierarchical VS strategy that could efficiently and accurately enrich active molecules in large-scale VS projects. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based docking and scoring methods demonstrate considerable potential for virtual drug screening. Gu et al. go further by assessing the structural rationality of AI-predicted complex conformations from various sources.},

Learning on graph models has drawn special attention as they can substantially reduce drug repurposing costs and time commitment. However, many current approaches require high-demand additional information besides DTIs that complicates their evaluation process and usability. Additionally, structural differences in the learning architecture of current models hinder their fair benchmarking. In this work, we first perform an in-depth evaluation of current DTI datasets and prediction models through a robust benchmarking process and show that DTI methods based on transductive models lack generalization and lead to inflated performance when traditionally evaluated, making them unsuitable for drug repurposing. We then propose a biologically driven strategy for negative-edge subsampling and uncovered previously unknown interactions via in vitro validation, missed by traditional subsampling. Finally, we provide a toolbox from all generated resources, crucial for fair benchmarking and robust model design. The authors address the challenge of predicting drug–target interactions, which is crucial for drug repurposing, by introducing a robust benchmarking framework. Using a biologically driven strategy, they uncover previously unknown interactions.},

This transformation is mirrored by the evolution of robotic systems, where the ability to leverage vision to simulate and predict their own dynamics marks a leap towards autonomy and self-awareness. Humans utilize vision to record experiences and internally simulate potential actions. For example, we can imagine that, if we stand up and raise our arms, the body will form a ‘T’ shape without physical movement. Similarly, simulation allows robots to plan and predict the outcomes of potential actions without execution. Here we introduce a self-supervised learning framework to enable robots to model and predict their morphology, kinematics and motor control using only brief raw video data, eliminating the need for extensive real-world data collection and kinematic priors. By observing their own movements, akin to humans watching their reflection in a mirror, robots learn an ability to simulate themselves and predict their spatial motion for various tasks. Our results demonstrate that this self-learned simulation not only enables accurate motion planning but also allows the robot to detect abnormalities and recover from damage. Motion planning for a robot generally requires full knowledge of its structure. Here Hu and colleagues present a method for inferring the structure of a robot from visual information.},

  abstract     = {The interpretability of machine learning models has gained increasing attention, particularly in scientific domains where high precision and accountability are crucial. This research focuses on distinguishing between two critical data patterns—sensitive patterns (model related) and decisive patterns (task related)—which are commonly used as model interpretations but often lead to confusion. Specifically, this study compares the effectiveness of two main streams of interpretation methods: post-hoc methods and self-interpretable methods, in detecting these patterns. Recently, geometric deep learning (GDL) has shown superior predictive performance in various scientific applications, creating an urgent need for principled interpretation methods. Here, therefore, we conduct our study using several representative GDL applications as case studies. We evaluate 13 interpretation methods applied to 3 major GDL backbone models, using 4 scientific datasets to assess how well these methods identify sensitive and decisive patterns. Our findings indicate that post-hoc methods tend to provide interpretations better aligned with sensitive patterns, whereas certain self-interpretable methods exhibit strong and stable performance in detecting decisive patterns. Moreover, our study offers valuable insights into improving the reliability of these interpretation methods. For example, ensembling post-hoc interpretations from multiple models trained on the same task can effectively uncover the task’s decisive patterns. Interpreting decisions made by machine learning systems remains difficult. Here Zhu et al. test interpretability methods on their ability to identify model-related and task-related patterns.},

These process requirements necessitate robot systems that provide a level of performance fitting the process. In this work, we introduce the tree of robots as a taxonomy to bridge the gap between morphological classification and process-based performance. It classifies robots based on their fitness to perform, for example, physical interaction processes. Using 11 industrial manipulators, we constructed the first part of the tree of robots based on a carefully deduced set of metrics reflecting fundamental robot capabilities for various industrial physical interaction processes. Through significance analysis, we identified substantial differences between the systems, grouping them via an expectation-maximization algorithm to create a fitness-based robot classification that is open for contributions and accessible. It is challenging to compare how well robots perform a task, as the evaluation depends on the process and skills required. It is proposed to group robots into a taxonomy based on their performance on a set of embodied skill benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the chemical structure of promising drug candidates through systematic modifications to improve potency and physiochemical properties is a vital step in the drug discovery pipeline. In contrast to the well-established de novo generation schemes, computational methods specifically tailored for lead optimization remain largely underexplored. Prior models are often limited to addressing specific subtasks, such as generating two-dimensional molecular structures, while neglecting crucial protein–ligand interactions in three-dimensional space. To overcome these challenges, we propose Delete (Deep lead optimization enveloped in protein pocket), a one-stop solution for lead optimization by combining generative artificial intelligence and structure-based approaches. Our model can handle all subtasks of lead optimization through a unified deleting (masking) strategy, and it accounts for intricate pocket–ligand interactions through an equivariant network design. Statistical assessments and retrospective studies across individual subtasks demonstrate that Delete has an outstanding ability to craft molecules with superior protein-binding energy and reasonable drug-likeness using given fragments or atoms. Subsequently, we utilize Delete to design inhibitors targeting the previously identified LTK protein. Among the ligands designed by Delete, CA-B-1 is successfully validated as a potent (1.36 nM) and selective inhibitor by in vitro and in vivo experiments. This work represents a successful implementation of the powerful structure-based lead optimization model, Delete, for rapid and controllable rational drug design. Chen et al. present a deep learning-based lead optimization model that combines generative artificial intelligence with structure-based approaches. The method is successfully applied to the design of drug-like molecules targeting the recently identified LTK protein target with high potency and selectivity.},

These systems are adept at numerous complex tasks including creative writing, storytelling, translation, question-answering, summarization and computer code generation. Although LLMs have seen initial applications in natural sciences, their potential for driving scientific discovery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce LLM4SD, a framework designed to harness LLMs for driving scientific discovery in molecular property prediction by synthesizing knowledge from literature and inferring knowledge from scientific data. LLMs synthesize knowledge by extracting established information from scientific literature, such as molecular weight being key to predicting solubility. For inference, LLMs identify patterns in molecular data, particularly in Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System-encoded structures, such as halogen-containing molecules being more likely to cross the blood–brain barrier. This information is presented as interpretable knowledge, enabling the transformation of molecules into feature vectors. By using these features with interpretable models such as random forest, LLM4SD can outperform the current state of the art across a range of benchmark tasks for predicting molecular properties. We foresee it providing interpretable and potentially new insights, aiding scientific discovery in molecular property prediction. Zheng et al. developed LLM4SD, a framework using large language models to predict molecular properties. The method leverages the ability of large language models to synthesize knowledge from literature and to reason about scientific data with domain expertise.},

  abstract     = {A main challenge for artificial intelligence in scientific research is ensuring access to sufficient, high-quality data for the development of impactful models. Despite the abundance of public data, the most valuable knowledge often remains embedded within confidential corporate data silos. Although industries are increasingly open to sharing non-competitive insights, such collaboration is often constrained by the confidentiality of the underlying data. Federated learning makes it possible to share knowledge without compromising data privacy, but it has notable limitations. Here, we introduce FLuID (federated learning using information distillation), a data-centric application of federated distillation tailored to drug discovery aiming to preserve data privacy. We validate FLuID in two experiments, first involving public data simulating a virtual consortium and second in a real-world research collaboration between eight pharmaceutical companies. Although the alignment of the models with the partner specific domain remains challenging, the data-driven nature of FLuID offers several avenues to mitigate domain shift. FLuID fosters knowledge sharing among pharmaceutical organizations, paving the way for a new generation of models with enhanced performance and an expanded applicability domain in biological activity predictions. FLuID enables privacy-preserving knowledge sharing in drug discovery using knowledge distillation. The results show that the approach expands applicability domains and fosters collaboration across organizations without compromising data privacy or security.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised learning has become an essential building block of artifical intelligence systems. The representations it produces, for example, in foundation models, are critical to a wide variety of downstream applications. It is therefore important to carefully examine unsupervised models to ensure not only that they produce accurate predictions on the available data but also that these accurate predictions do not arise from a Clever Hans (CH) effect. Here, using specially developed explainable artifical intelligence techniques and applying them to popular representation learning and anomaly detection models for image data, we show that CH effects are widespread in unsupervised learning. In particular, through use cases on medical and industrial inspection data, we demonstrate that CH effects systematically lead to significant performance loss of downstream models under plausible dataset shifts or reweighting of different data subgroups. Our empirical findings are enriched by theoretical insights, which point to inductive biases in the unsupervised learning machine as a primary source of CH effects. Overall, our work sheds light on unexplored risks associated with practical applications of unsupervised learning and suggests ways to systematically mitigate CH effects, thereby making unsupervised learning more robust. Building on recent explainable AI techniques, this Article highlights the pervasiveness of Clever Hans effects in unsupervised learning and the substantial risks associated with these effects in terms of the prediction accuracy on new data.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) are increasing in capability and popularity, propelling their application in new domains—including as replacements for human participants in computational social science, user testing, annotation tasks and so on. In many settings, researchers seek to distribute their surveys to a sample of participants that are representative of the underlying human population of interest. This means that to be a suitable replacement, LLMs will need to be able to capture the influence of positionality (that is, the relevance of social identities like gender and race). However, we show that there are two inherent limitations in the way current LLMs are trained that prevent this. We argue analytically for why LLMs are likely to both misportray and flatten the representations of demographic groups, and then empirically show this on four LLMs through a series of human studies with 3,200 participants across 16 demographic identities. We also discuss a third limitation about how identity prompts can essentialize identities. Throughout, we connect each limitation to a pernicious history of epistemic injustice against the value of lived experiences that explains why replacement is harmful for marginalized demographic groups. Overall, we urge caution in use cases in which LLMs are intended to replace human participants whose identities are relevant to the task at hand. At the same time, in cases where the benefits of LLM replacement are determined to outweigh the harms (for example, engaging human participants may cause them harm, or the goal is to supplement rather than fully replace), we empirically demonstrate that our inference-time techniques reduce—but do not remove—these harms. Large language models are being considered to simulate responses from participants of different backgrounds in computational social science experiments. Here it is shown that this practice can misportray and flatten demographic groups in distinctively harmful ways.},

  abstract     = {Quadrupedal animals show remarkable capabilities in traversing diverse terrains and display a range of behaviours and gait patterns. Achieving similar performance by exploiting the natural dynamics of the system is a key goal for robotics researchers. Here we show a bioinspired approach to the design of quadrupeds that seeks to exploit the body and the passive properties of the robot while maintaining active controllability on the system through minimal actuation. Utilizing an end-to-end computational design pipeline, neuromechanical couplings recorded in biological quadrupeds are translated into motor synergies, allowing minimal actuation to control the full structure via multijoint compliant mechanical couplings. Using this approach, we develop PAWS, a passive automata with synergies. By leveraging the principles of motor synergies, the design incorporates variable stiffness, anatomical insights and self-organization to simplify control while maximizing its capabilities. The resulting synergy-based quadruped requires only four actuators and exhibits emergent, animal-like dynamical responses, including passive robustness to environmental perturbations and a wide range of actuated behaviours. The finding contributes to the development of machine physical intelligence and provides robots with more efficient and natural-looking robotic locomotion by combining synergistic actuation, compliant body properties and embodied compensatory strategies. Stella, Achkar and colleagues present a bio-inspired quadruped robot that uses passive dynamics, motor synergies, variable stiffness and self-organization to achieve robust, adaptive, animal-like movement with just four actuators.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers is circuit optimization. Focusing on the most expensive gates in fault-tolerant quantum computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count optimization, that is, minimizing the number of T gates needed to implement a given circuit. To achieve this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship between optimizing the T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which substantially reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks (even when compared without using gadgets). Remarkably, it discovers an efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba’s method for multiplication in finite fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best human-designed solutions for relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor’s algorithm and for quantum chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating that it can save hundreds of hours of research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way. Ruiz and colleagues introduce AlphaTensor-Quantum, a deep reinforcement learning method for optimizing quantum circuits. It outperforms existing methods and is capable of finding the best human-designed solutions for relevant quantum computations in a fully automated way.},

Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the consistency model outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of the computational cost and maintains high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.

We survey open questions in genomics amenable to the use of gLMs, and motivate the use of gLMs and the transformer architecture for these problems. We discuss the potential of gLMs for modelling the genome using unsupervised pretraining tasks, specifically focusing on the power of zero- and few-shot learning. We explore the strengths and limitations of the transformer architecture, as well as the strengths and limitations of current gLMs more broadly. Additionally, we contemplate the future of genomic modelling beyond the transformer architecture, based on current trends in research.

  abstract     = {Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been identified, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorA–ZorB (ZorAB) complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defence using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics and functional studies. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan-binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components ZorC and ZorD, finding that they have DNA-binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated after sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate the degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defence system. Zorya uses a membrane-anchored H+-driven rotary motor ZorAB to sense phage invasion and to recruit the intracellular effectors ZorC and ZorD that execute anti-phage defence.},

  abstract     = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) disrupt the continuity of the genome, with consequences for malignant transformation. Massive DNA damage can elicit a cellular checkpoint response that prevents cell proliferation1,2. However, how highly aggressive cancer cells, which can tolerate widespread DNA damage, respond to DSBs alongside continuous chromosome duplication is unknown. Here we show that DSBs induce a local genome maintenance mechanism that inhibits replication initiation in DSB-containing topologically associating domains (TADs) without affecting DNA synthesis at other genomic locations. This process is facilitated by mediators of replication and DSBs (MRDs). In normal and cancer cells, MRDs include the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex and the WEE1 kinase, which actively dislodges the TIMELESS–TIPIN complex from replication origins adjacent to DSBs and prevents initiation of DNA synthesis at DSB-containing TADs. Dysregulation of MRDs, or disruption of 3D chromatin architecture by dissolving TADs, results in inadvertent replication in damaged chromatin and increased DNA damage in cancer cells. We propose that the intact MRD cascade precedes DSB repair to prevent genomic instability, which is otherwise observed when replication is forced, or when genome architecture is challenged, in the presence of DSBs3–5. These observations reveal a previously unknown vulnerability in the DNA replication machinery that may be exploited to therapeutically target cancer cells. DNA double-strand breaks induce local genome maintenance and inhibition of replication initiation at nearby topologically associating domains without affecting global DNA synthesis.},

  abstract     = {The breakdown of cellulose is one of the most important reactions in nature1,2 and is central to biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals3. However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion4. Here, by mining the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance5–7. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy. A metalloenzyme capable of oxidatively cleaving cellulose, found in a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, could enable sustainable biofuel production.},

  abstract     = {The complex life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum involves several major differentiation stages, each requiring strict control of gene expression. Fundamental changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications during life cycle progression suggest a central role for these mechanisms in regulating the transcriptional program of malaria parasite development1–6. P. falciparum chromatin is distinct from other eukaryotes, with an extraordinarily high AT content (&amp;gt;80%)7 and highly divergent histones resulting in atypical DNA packaging properties8. Moreover, the chromatin remodellers that are critical for shaping chromatin structure are not conserved and are unexplored in P. falciparum. Here we identify P. falciparum Snf2L (PfSnf2L, encoded by PF3D7_1104200) as an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vitro. Our results demonstrate that PfSnf2L is essential, regulating both asexual development and sexual differentiation. PfSnf2L globally controls just-in-time transcription by spatiotemporally determining nucleosome positioning at the promoters of stage-specific genes. The unique sequence and functional properties of PfSnf2L led to the identification of an inhibitor that specifically kills P. falciparum and phenocopies the loss of correct gene expression timing. The inhibitor represents a new class of antimalarial transmission-blocking drugs, inhibiting gametocyte formation. Plasmodium falciparum Snf2L is an ISWI-related ATPase that actively repositions P. falciparum nucleosomes in vivo.},

  abstract     = {High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the leading cause of brain cancer-related death. HGGs include clinically, anatomically and molecularly distinct subtypes that stratify into diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), such as H3K27M-altered diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and hemispheric HGGs, such as IDH wild-type glioblastoma. Neuronal activity drives glioma progression through paracrine signalling1,2 and neuron-to-glioma synapses3–6. Glutamatergic AMPA receptor-dependent synapses between neurons and glioma cells have been demonstrated in paediatric3 and adult4 high-grade gliomas, and early work has suggested heterogeneous glioma GABAergic responses7. However, neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by neurotransmitters other than glutamate remain understudied. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, in vivo optogenetics and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, we identified functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses mediated by GABAA receptors in DMGs. GABAergic input has a depolarizing effect on DMG cells due to NKCC1 chloride transporter function and consequently elevated intracellular chloride concentration in DMG malignant cells. As membrane depolarization increases glioma proliferation3,6, we found that the activity of GABAergic interneurons promotes DMG proliferation in vivo. The benzodiazepine lorazepam enhances GABA-mediated signalling, increases glioma proliferation and growth, and shortens survival in DMG patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models. By contrast, only minimal&amp;nbsp;depolarizing GABAergic currents were found in hemispheric HGGs and lorazepam did not influence the growth rate of hemispheric glioblastoma xenografts. Together, these findings uncover growth-promoting GABAergic synaptic communication between GABAergic neurons and H3K27M-altered DMG cells, underscoring a tumour subtype-specific mechanism of brain cancer neurophysiology. Functional, tumour-promoting GABAergic neuron-to-glioma synapses in diffuse midline gliomas are identified.},

  abstract     = {Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancers1,2. We tracked the phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. Following osimertinib and NPV treatment, loss of the ex19del mutation was identified in a progressing small-cell-transformed liver metastasis. Circulating tumour DNA analyses tracking 467 somatic variants revealed the presence of this EGFR wild-type clone before vaccination and its expansion during osimertinib/NPV therapy. Despite systemic T cell reactivity to the vaccine-targeted ex19del neoantigen, the NPV failed to halt disease progression. The liver metastasis lost vaccine-targeted neoantigens through chromosomal instability and exhibited a hostile microenvironment, characterized by limited immune infiltration, low CXCL9 and elevated M2 macrophage levels. Neoantigens arising post-WGD were more likely to be absent in the progressing liver metastasis than those occurring pre-WGD, suggesting that prioritizing pre-WGD neoantigens may improve vaccine design. Data from the TRACERx 421 cohort3 provide evidence that pre-WGD mutations better represent clonal variants, and owing to their presence at multiple copy numbers, are less likely to be lost in metastatic transition. These data highlight the power of phylogenetic disease tracking and functional T cell profiling to understand mechanisms of immune escape during combination therapies. We show the evolution of a case of EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with a combination of erlotinib, osimertinib, radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine targeting somatic mutations, including EGFR exon 19 deletion.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental challenge for cancer vaccines is to generate long-lived functional T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Here we find that mRNA–lipoplex vaccines against somatic mutation-derived neoantigens may solve this challenge in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal cancer with few mutations. At an extended 3.2-year median follow-up from a phase 1 trial of surgery, atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitory antibody), autogene cevumeran1 (individualized neoantigen vaccine with backbone-optimized uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles) and modified (m) FOLFIRINOX (chemotherapy) in patients with PDAC, we find that responders with vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8) have prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS; median not reached) compared with non-responders without vaccine-induced T cells (n = 8; median RFS 13.4 months; P  =  0.007). In responders, autogene cevumeran induces CD8+ T cell clones with an average estimated lifespan of 7.7 years (range 1.5 to roughly 100 years), with approximately 20% of clones having latent multi-decade lifespans that may outlive hosts. Eighty-six percent&amp;nbsp;of clones per patient persist at substantial frequencies approximately 3 years post-vaccination, including clones with high avidity to PDAC neoepitopes. Using PhenoTrack, a novel computational strategy to trace single T cell phenotypes, we uncover that vaccine-induced clones are undetectable in pre-vaccination tissues, and assume a cytotoxic, tissue-resident memory-like T cell state up to three years post-vaccination with preserved neoantigen-specific effector function. Two responders recurred and evidenced fewer vaccine-induced T cells. Furthermore, recurrent PDACs were pruned of vaccine-targeted cancer clones. Thus, in PDAC, autogene cevumeran induces de novo CD8+ T cells with multiyear longevity, substantial magnitude and durable effector functions that may delay PDAC recurrence. Adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines may thus solve a pivotal obstacle for cancer vaccination.

  abstract     = {For decades, antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I&amp;nbsp;for T cell-mediated immunity has been considered the primary function of proteasome-derived peptides1,2. However, whether the products of proteasomal degradation play additional parts in mounting immune responses remains unknown. Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of defence against invading pathogens before the adaptive immune system responds. Although the protective function of antimicrobial peptides across numerous tissues is well established, the cellular mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Here we uncover a role for proteasomes in the constitutive and bacterial-induced generation of defence peptides that impede bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo by disrupting bacterial membranes. In silico prediction of proteome-wide proteasomal cleavage identified hundreds of thousands of potential proteasome-derived defence peptides with cationic properties that may be generated en route to degradation to act as a first line of defence. Furthermore, bacterial infection induces changes in proteasome composition and function, including PSME3 recruitment and increased tryptic-like cleavage, enhancing antimicrobial activity. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into the role of proteasomes in cell-autonomous innate immunity, our study suggests that proteasome-cleaved peptides may have previously overlooked functions downstream of degradation. From a translational standpoint, identifying proteasome-derived defence peptides could provide an untapped source of natural antibiotics for biotechnological applications and therapeutic interventions in infectious diseases and immunocompromised conditions. Proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins&amp;nbsp;generate defence peptides constitutively and in response to bacterial infection.&amp;nbsp;Such peptides might provide a source of natural antibiotics that could lead to biotechnology applications and therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved over short timescales, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants such as Alpha and Delta1–3. The arrival of the Omicron variant marked a major shift, introducing numerous extra mutations in the spike gene compared with earlier variants1,2. These evolutionary changes have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on immune evasion, disease severity and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments1,3. In this epidemiological study, we identified two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron versus pre-Omicron eras. Before Omicron, natural infection provided strong and durable protection against reinfection, with minimal waning over time. However, during the Omicron era, protection was robust only for those recently infected, declining rapidly over time and diminishing within a year. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by a dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution, leading to contrasting reinfection patterns before and after Omicron’s first wave. This shift in patterns suggests a change in evolutionary pressures, with intrinsic transmissibility driving adaptation pre-Omicron and immune escape becoming dominant post-Omicron, underscoring the need for periodic vaccine updates to sustain immunity. Two distinct patterns in the protective effect of natural infection against reinfection in the Omicron variant versus pre-Omicron eras show that SARS-CoV-2 immune protection is shaped by dynamic interaction between host immunity and viral evolution.},

Residents of nursing homes are at increased risk of pathogen colonization and infection owing to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and fungi. Nursing homes act as reservoirs, amplifiers and disseminators of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare networks and across geographical regions2. Here we investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging, multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home. Coupling&amp;nbsp;strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report skin&amp;nbsp;colonization and clonal spread of C. auris on the skin of nursing home residents and&amp;nbsp;throughout a metropolitan region. We also report that&amp;nbsp;most Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Entobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens and other high-priority pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii) are shared in a nursing home. Integrating microbiome and clinical microbiology data, we detect carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on residents identified as carriers of these genes. We analyse publicly available shotgun metagenomic samples (stool and skin) collected from residents with varying medical conditions living in seven other nursing homes and provide additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing. Taken together, our data suggest that skin is a reservoir for colonization by C. auris and ESKAPE pathogens and their associated antimicrobial-resistance genes.

  abstract     = {Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved behaviour that controls social hierarchies and protects valuable resources. In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling1. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)—an extended olfactory structure—was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COAplEsr1) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COAplEsr1 cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COAplEsr1 projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COAplEsr1 cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour. The posterolateral cortical amygdala and other connected brain regions have a key role in mediating the transition from investigative to aggressive behaviour in male mice.},

  abstract     = {Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are elements of a neural map of self position1–5. For these cells to benefit navigation, their representation must be dynamically related to the surrounding locations2. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal’s path has been described for place cells, in which the sequence of spikes in each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal’s current location towards upcoming locations6–8. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms when the animal approaches the choice point9,10, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials10. However, to bridge the animal’s path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats that in individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal’s location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps are accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells that have putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive grid × direction cells. Sweeps extend into never-visited locations that&amp;nbsp;are inaccessible to the animal. Sweeps persist during REM sleep. The sweep directions can be explained by an algorithm that maximizes the cumulative coverage of the surrounding manifold space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left–right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal–hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient ‘look around’ mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path. A study in rats proposes a mechanism for how the brain maps the surrounding environment, including places it has never seen, by alternating left and right forward sweeps in successive theta cycles.},

  abstract     = {The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is highly specialized to protect the brain from harmful circulating factors in the blood and maintain brain homeostasis1,2. The brain endothelial glycocalyx layer, a carbohydrate-rich meshwork composed primarily of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids that coats the BBB lumen, is a key structural component of the BBB3,4. This layer forms the first interface between the blood and brain vasculature, yet little is known about its composition and roles in supporting BBB function in homeostatic and diseased states. Here we find that the brain endothelial glycocalyx is highly dysregulated during ageing and neurodegenerative disease. We identify significant perturbation in an underexplored class of densely O-glycosylated proteins known as mucin-domain glycoproteins. We demonstrate that ageing- and disease-associated aberrations in brain endothelial mucin-domain glycoproteins lead to dysregulated BBB function and, in severe cases, brain haemorrhaging in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that we can improve BBB function and reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in aged mice by restoring core 1 mucin-type O-glycans to the brain endothelium using adeno-associated viruses. Cumulatively, our findings provide a detailed compositional and structural mapping of the ageing brain endothelial glycocalyx layer and reveal important consequences of ageing- and disease-associated glycocalyx dysregulation on BBB integrity and brain health. Disruption of mucin-domain glycoprotein expression and function in the endothelial glycocalyx are associated with ageing and Alzheimer’s disease, leading to dysregulated blood–brain barrier function.},

  abstract     = {Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind1. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities2,3. Here we focus on the ‘racial excellence gap’—the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves4,5. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically&amp;nbsp;ages 8–9) to high school (typically&amp;nbsp;ages 14–18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student’s socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality6 had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the ‘racial glass ceiling’. Data from Michigan, USA, systematically document that comparatively fewer students from racial minorities excel in maths and reading, and that this gap grows as students progress through school.},

  abstract     = {Bipolar disorder is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease1. Despite high heritability (60–80%), the majority of the underlying genetic determinants remain unknown2. We analysed data from participants of European, East Asian, African American and Latino ancestries (n = 158,036 cases with bipolar disorder, 2.8 million controls), combining clinical, community and self-reported samples. We identified 298 genome-wide significant loci in the multi-ancestry meta-analysis, a fourfold increase over previous findings3, and identified an ancestry-specific association in the East Asian cohort. Integrating results from fine-mapping and other variant-to-gene mapping approaches identified 36 credible genes in the aetiology of bipolar disorder. Genes prioritized through fine-mapping were enriched for ultra-rare damaging missense and protein-truncating variations in cases with bipolar disorder4, highlighting convergence of common and rare variant signals. We report differences in the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder&amp;nbsp;depending on the source of patient ascertainment and on bipolar disorder subtype (type I or type II). Several analyses implicate specific cell types in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, including GABAergic interneurons and medium spiny neurons. Together, these analyses provide additional insights into the genetic architecture and biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder. Using multi-ancestry genome-wide association study and fine-mapping, 298 loci and 36 credible genes are identified in the aetiology of bipolar disorder.},

  abstract     = {Rates of lineage diversification vary considerably across the tree of life, often as&amp;nbsp;a result of evolutionary innovations1–5. Although the ability to produce new traits can vary between clades and may drive ecological transitions6–9, the impact of differences in the pace at which innovations evolve at macroevolutionary scales has been overlooked. Complex teeth are one innovation that contributed to the evolutionary success of major vertebrate lineages10–12. Here we show that evolutionary lability of tooth complexity, but not complexity itself, spurs rapid diversification across ray-finned fishes. Speciation rates are five times higher when transitions between simple and complex teeth occur rapidly. We find that African cichlids are unique among all fishes; they are dominated by lineages that transition between simple and complex teeth at unparalleled rates. This innovation interacted with the ecological versatility of complex teeth to spur rapid adaptive radiations in lakes Malawi, Victoria and Barombi Mbo. The marked effect on diversification stems from the tight association of tooth complexity with microhabitat and diet. Our results show that phylogenetic variation in how innovations evolve can have a stronger effect on patterns of diversification than the innovation itself. Investigating the impact of innovations from this new perspective will probably implicate more traits in causing heterogeneous diversification rates across the tree of life. A study shows that the rapid diversification of cichlids in African lakes is driven by their ability to evolve between having simple or complex teeth.},

  abstract     = {Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates, yet their resilience to rising temperatures remains poorly understood1,2. This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased3, compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we&amp;nbsp;used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features. A 4 °C global temperature increase&amp;nbsp;would push 7.5% of amphibian species beyond their physiological limits.},

  abstract     = {Frictional interfaces are found in systems ranging from biological joints to earthquake faults. When and how these interfaces slide is a fundamental problem in geosciences and engineering1–20. It is believed that there exists a threshold shear force, called static friction, below which the interface is stationary4,10, despite many studies suggesting that this concept is outdated1,21–28. By contrast, rate-and-state friction formulations1,26,27 predict that interfaces are always sliding29, but this feature is often considered an artefact that calls for modifications30. Here we show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads, with a driving force that is notably below the classically defined static friction for which creep is known to occur9,27–29, are sliding, but with diminishingly small rates down to 10−12 m s−1. Our precise measurements directly at the interface are enabled by digital image correlation18,31,32. This behaviour contradicts classical models of friction but confirms the prediction of rate-and-state friction1,26,27. The diminishing slip rates of nominally stationary interfaces reflect interface healing, which would manifest itself in higher peak friction in subsequent slip events15,27,33, such as earthquakes and landslides, substantially modifying their nucleation and propagation and hence their hazard3,12,13,34. Digital image correlation measurements show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads are sliding at extremely small rates, confirming the predictions of rate-and-state friction formulations.},

The nearly global extent and unprecedented intensity of this event prompted questions about how exceptional it was and whether climate models can represent such record-shattering jumps in surface ocean temperatures2. Here we construct observation-based synthetic time series to show that a jump in global sea surface temperatures that breaks the previous record by at least 0.25 °C is a 1-in-512-year event under the current long-term warming trend (1-in-205-year to 1-in-1,185-year event; 95% confidence interval). Without a global warming trend, such an event would have been practically impossible. Using 270 simulations from a wide range of fully coupled climate models, we show that these models successfully simulate such record-shattering jumps in global ocean surface temperatures, underpinning the models’ usefulness in understanding the characteristics, drivers and consequences of such events. These model simulations suggest that the record-shattering jump in surface ocean temperatures in 2023–2024 was an extreme event after which surface ocean temperatures are expected to revert to the expected long-term warming trend. Observations and climate models suggest that the global sea surface temperature jump in 2023–2024 was not unexpected and would have been&amp;nbsp;nearly impossible without anthropogenic warming.},

  abstract     = {Active systems composed of energy-generating microscopic constituents are a promising platform to create autonomous functional materials1–16 that can, for example, locomote through complex and unpredictable environments. Yet coaxing these energy sources into useful mechanical work has proved challenging. Here we engineer active solids based on centimetre-scale building blocks that perform adaptive locomotion. These prototypes exhibit a non-variational form of elasticity characterized by odd moduli8,12,17, whose magnitude we predict from microscopics using coarse-grained theories and which we validate experimentally. When interacting with an external environment, these active solids spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, which naturally lead to locomotion such as rolling and crawling. The robustness of the locomotion is rooted in an emergent feedback loop between the active solid and the environment, which is mediated by elastic deformations and stresses. As a result, our active solids are able to accelerate, adjust their gaits and locomote through a variety of terrains with a similar performance to more complex control strategies implemented by neural networks. Our work establishes active solids as a bridge between materials and robots and suggests decentralized strategies to control the nonlinear dynamics of biological systems8,18–22, soft materials5,6,9,11,12,23–25 and driven nanomechanical devices7,26–30.

  abstract     = {Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs)1,2. Yet, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibres. This has motivated the development of amplifiers operating beyond the erbium gain window. Pioneering work on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs)3,4 using intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity. OPAs offer high gain, can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers and exhibit unidirectional operation. However, power requirements for highly nonlinear fibres3,5–8 or bulk waveguides9,10 have impeded their adoption. By contrast, OPAs based on integrated photonic circuits offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth11,12. We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide13–15 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and attain up to 35 dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimetres long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimetres. Fibre-to-fibre net gain exceeding 10 dB across an ultra-broad bandwidth of approximately 140 nm (that is, 17 THz) is achieved, with a threefold increase in the gain window compared with C-band EDFAs. We further demonstrate a high dynamic range for input signals, spanning six orders of magnitude, while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify coherent communication signals. This marks, to our knowledge, the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a photonic chip, opening up new capabilities for next-generation integrated photonics. An optical parametric amplifier based on integrated photonic circuits fabricated using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide demonstrates improved bandwidth and gain performance over state-of-the-art erbium-doped fibre amplifiers while maintaining a low noise figure.},

Si3N4 is the pre-eminent material for photonic integration and also exhibits the lowest waveguide loss (which is essential for integrated quantum circuits). However, being amorphous, silicon nitride lacks an intrinsic χ(2), which limits its role in photonic quantum devices. We enabled SPDC in Si3N4 by combining strong light-field enhancement inside a high optical Q-factor microcavity with an optically induced space-charge field. We present narrowband photon pairs with a high spectral brightness. The quantum nature of the down-converted photon pairs is verified through coincidence measurements. This light source, based on Si3N4 integrated photonics technology, unlocks new avenues for quantum systems on a chip.

  abstract     = {Phonon polaritons are quasiparticles resulting from the coherent coupling of photons with optical phonons in polar dielectrics1. Owing to their exceptional ability to confine electric fields to deep-subwavelength scales with low loss, they are uniquely poised to enable a suite of applications beyond the reach of conventional photonics, such as subdiffraction imaging2 and near-field energy transfer3–5. The conventional approach to exciting phonon polaritons through optical methods, however, involves costly light sources along with near-field schemes6,7, and generally leads to low excitation efficiency owing to substantial momentum mismatch between phonon polaritons and free-space photons. Here we demonstrate that under proper conditions, phonon polaritons can be excited all-electrically by drifting charge carriers. Specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures, by electrically driving charge carriers in ultrahigh-mobility graphene out of equilibrium, we observe bright electroluminescence of hBN’s hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared frequencies, which shows a temperature and carrier density dependence distinct from black-body thermal emission. Moreover, the carrier density dependence of the HPhP electroluminescence spectra reveals that HPhP electroluminescence can arise from both interband transition and intraband Cherenkov radiation8 of charge carriers in graphene. The HPhP electroluminescence offers avenues for realizing electrically pumped mid-infrared and terahertz phonon-polariton light sources. All-electrical excitation of the hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride by drifting charge carriers in nearby graphene results in electroluminescence at mid-infrared frequencies.},

In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared emission of confined light–matter excitations called phonon polaritons3,4, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) present hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light–matter coupling5,6. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors7,8. However, as HPhPs are locally confined, they are inaccessible in the far field, and as such, any hint of electroluminescence has been based on indirect electronic signatures and has yet to be confirmed by direct observation. Here we demonstrate far-field mid-infrared (wavelength approximately 6.5 μm) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed by far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy owing to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The resulting radiative flux is quantified by mid-infrared pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is also shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process. Far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy reveals both the electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons of hexagonal boron nitride excited by strongly biased graphene, and the associated radiative energy transfer through the material.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-hot Jupiters, an extreme class of planets not found in our Solar System, provide a unique window into atmospheric processes. The extreme temperature contrasts between their day and night sides pose a fundamental climate puzzle: how is energy distributed? To address this, we must observe the three-dimensional structure of these atmospheres, particularly their vertical circulation patterns that can serve as a testbed for advanced global circulation models, for example, in ref. 1. Here we show a notable shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter: a unilateral flow from the hot star-facing side to the cooler space-facing side of the planet sits below an equatorial super-rotational jet stream. By resolving the vertical structure of atmospheric dynamics, we move beyond integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere, enabling more accurate identification of flow patterns and allowing for a more nuanced comparison to models. Global circulation models based on first principles struggle to replicate the observed circulation pattern2 underscoring a critical gap between theoretical understanding of atmospheric flows and observational evidence. This work serves as a testbed to develop more comprehensive models applicable beyond our Solar System as we prepare for the next generation of giant telescopes. Ultra-hot Jupiters provide a unique window into atmospheric processes and this in-depth study enables integrated global snapshots of the atmosphere and more accurate identification of flow patterns, thus allowing for better comparison to models.},

  abstract     = {Cosmic reionization began when ultraviolet (UV) radiation produced in the first galaxies began illuminating the cold, neutral gas that filled the primordial Universe1,2. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have shown that surprisingly UV-bright galaxies were in place beyond redshift z = 14, when the Universe was less than 300 Myr old3–5. Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-α (Ly-α), the principal hydrogen transition6–9. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES10) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveals a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly-α, as well as a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EWLy-α &amp;gt; 40 Å (rest frame), previously only seen at z &amp;lt; 9&amp;nbsp;where the intervening intergalactic medium becomes increasingly ionized11. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly-α emission indicates that the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionizing photons. This suggests that massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus have created an early reionized region to prevent complete extinction of Ly-α, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang. Spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey of a galaxy at redshift 13 shows a singular, bright emission line identified as Lyman-α, suggesting the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang.},

  abstract     = {Accurately interpreting medical images and generating insightful narrative reports is indispensable for patient care but places heavy burdens on clinical experts. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in an area that we refer to as multimodal generative medical image interpretation (GenMI), create opportunities to automate parts of this complex process. In this Perspective, we synthesize progress and challenges in developing AI systems for generation of medical reports from images. We focus extensively on radiology as a domain with enormous reporting needs and research efforts. In addition to analysing the strengths and applications of new models for medical report generation, we advocate for a novel paradigm to deploy GenMI in a manner that empowers clinicians and their patients. Initial research suggests that GenMI could one day match human expert performance in generating reports across disciplines, such as radiology, pathology and dermatology. However, formidable obstacles remain in validating model accuracy, ensuring transparency and eliciting nuanced impressions. If carefully implemented, GenMI could meaningfully assist clinicians in improving quality of care, enhancing medical education, reducing workloads, expanding specialty access and providing real-time expertise. Overall, we highlight opportunities alongside key challenges for developing multimodal generative AI that complements human experts for reliable medical report writing. This Perspective describes how recent advances in artificial intelligence could be used to automate medical image interpretation&amp;nbsp;to complement human expertise and empower physicians and patients.},

  abstract     = {As Earth warms, regional climate signals are accumulating. Some signals, for example, land warming more than the ocean and the Arctic warming the most, were expected and successfully predicted. Underlying this success was the application of physical laws under the assumption that large and small spatial scales are well separated. This established what we call the standard approach, climate science’s dominant paradigm. With additional warming, however, discrepancies between real-world signals and expectations based on this standard approach are piling up, especially at regional scales. At the same time, disruptive computational approaches are advancing new&amp;nbsp;paradigms. Philosophers of science characterize situations where accumulating discrepancies (anomalies) and disruptions lead to a loss of confidence in the dominant paradigm as a ‘crisis’. Here we articulate what we consider to be the dominant paradigm, or standard approach, and the discrepancies and disruptions that have emerged in recent years. The policy implications of a purported crisis are discussed, as well as paths forward, crisis or no crisis. These paths include using signals to test assumptions and processes driving a warming Earth&amp;nbsp;for the first time, developing testable hypotheses, and revitalizing conceptual thinking by filling gaps across climate-system components and spatial scales. The standard approach of&amp;nbsp;climate science is showing signs of a crisis owing to the emergence of discrepancies and disruptions in recent years; this Perspective discusses the policy implications and the paths forward.},

  abstract     = {The γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues enables Ca2+-mediated membrane assembly of protein complexes that support broad physiological functions, including haemostasis, calcium homeostasis, immune response and endocrine regulation1–4. Modulating γ-carboxylation levels provides prevalent treatments for haemorrhagic and thromboembolic diseases5. This unique post-translational modification requires vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to drive highly demanding reactions6 catalysed by the membrane-integrated γ-carboxylase (VKGC). Here, to decipher the underlying mechanisms, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VKGC in unbound form, with KH2 and four haemostatic and non-haemostatic proteins possessing propeptides and glutamate-rich domains in different carboxylation states. VKGC recognizes substrate proteins through knob-and-hole interactions with propeptides, thereby bringing tethered glutamate-containing segments for processive carboxylation within a large chamber that provides steric control. Propeptide binding also triggers a global conformational change to signal VKGC activation. Through sequential deprotonation and KH2 epoxidation, VKGC generates a free hydroxide ion as an exceptionally strong base that is required to deprotonate the γ-carbon of glutamate for CO2 addition. The diffusion of this superbase—protected and guided by a sealed hydrophobic tunnel—elegantly resolves the challenge of coupling KH2 epoxidation to γ-carboxylation across the membrane interface. These structural insights and extensive functional experiments advance membrane enzymology and propel the development of treatments for γ-carboxylation disorders. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal the mechanisms underlying multiple-substrate specificity, coupling of epoxidation with carboxylation and allosteric motions during VKGC catalysis, offering potential strategies for targeting haemostatic and non-haemostatic disorders associated with defects in γ-carboxylation.},

This protein catalyses the oxidation of VK hydroquinone to convert specific glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate residues in VK-dependent proteins (VDPs), which are involved in various essential biological processes and diseases1–3. However, the working mechanism of GGCX remains unclear. Here we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human GGCX: in the apo state, bound to osteocalcin (a VDP) and bound to VK. The propeptide of the VDP binds to the lumenal domain of GGCX, which stabilizes transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of GGCX to create the VK-binding pocket. After binding of VK, residue Lys218 in GGCX mediates the oxidation of VK hydroxyquinone, which leads to the deprotonation of glutamate residues and the construction of γ-carboxyglutamate residues. Our structural observations and results from binding and cell&amp;nbsp;biological assays and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol molecule interacts with the transmembrane helices of GGCX to regulate its protein levels in cells. Together, these results establish a link between cholesterol metabolism and VK-dependent pathways.

Although the function of Spo11 has been known for 27 years, previous efforts to reconstitute DSB formation in vitro have been unsuccessful. Here we biochemically characterize the mouse SPO11–TOP6BL protein complex, and show that this complex cleaves DNA and covalently attaches to the 5′ terminus of DNA breaks in vitro. Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation. However, the activity of the SPO11 complex is ATP-independent. We also present evidence that the mouse SPO11 complex is biochemically distinct from the ancestral topoisomerase VI. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for understanding the first steps of meiotic recombination. The in vitro characterization of a key event in the early stages of meiosis—the induction of double-strand DNA breaks by the SPO11–TOP6BL complex—provides insight into the catalytic mechanism and evolution of SPO11.},

  abstract     = {SPO11 initiates meiotic recombination through the induction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1,2, but this catalytic activity has never been reconstituted in vitro3,4. Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.

  abstract     = {Meiotic recombination starts with SPO11 generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1. SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic2 and gametocidal3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks4—how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage5. In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation. Reconstitution of recombinantly expressed SPO11–TOP6BL complex recapitulates its DNA cleavage function and together with structural modelling and biochemical experiments, provides insights into the regulation and mechanism of SPO11 activity.},

Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress. We find that, in mice, although the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses.},

  abstract     = {Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types1,2; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness3. Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells4,5. Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle6. Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential. Electrical excitability in neuroendocrine SCLC cells promotes tumour progression through action potential firing, increasing ATP demand and oxidative phosphorylation dependency, whereas non-neuroendocrine cells provide metabolic support, driving a tumour-autonomous cycle that enhances tumorigenesis and metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that&amp;nbsp;accumulate progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies4. Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment&amp;nbsp;and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline&amp;nbsp;to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy. As proof of principle, an analysis using a suite of human-aligned&amp;nbsp;immunocompetent mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma identifies a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, which acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.},

  abstract     = {Although cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for anti-tumour immunity, they are frequently dysfunctional in tumours1. Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo.

  abstract     = {The development of animal models is crucial for studying and treating mitochondrial diseases. Here we optimized adenine and cytosine deaminases to reduce off-target effects on the transcriptome and the mitochondrial genome, improving the accuracy and efficiency of our newly developed mitochondrial base editors (mitoBEs)1. Using these upgraded mitoBEs (version 2 (v2)), we targeted 70 mouse mitochondrial DNA mutations analogous to human pathogenic variants2, establishing a foundation for mitochondrial disease mouse models. Circular RNA-encoded mitoBEs v2 achieved up to 82% editing efficiency in mice without detectable off-target effects in the nuclear genome. The edited mitochondrial DNA persisted across various tissues and was maternally inherited, resulting in F1 generation mice with mutation loads as high as 100% and some mice exhibiting editing only at the target site. By optimizing the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)&amp;nbsp;binding site, we developed a single-base-editing mouse model for the mt-Nd5 A12784G mutation. Phenotypic evaluations led to the creation of mouse models for the mt-Atp6 T8591C and mt-Nd5 A12784G mutations, exhibiting phenotypes corresponding to the reduced heart rate seen in Leigh syndrome and the vision loss characteristic of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, respectively. Moreover, the mt-Atp6 T8591C mutation proved to be more deleterious than mt-Nd5 A12784G, affecting embryonic development and rapidly diminishing through successive generations. These upgraded mitoBEs offer a highly efficient and precise strategy for constructing mitochondrial disease models, laying a foundation for further research in this field. A study reports optimized mitochondrial base editors with reduced off-target effects to facilitate the generation of mouse models of human mitochondrial diseases.},

  abstract     = {Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) and pyrin domains are important facilitators of inflammasome activity and pyroptosis1. Following pathogen recognition by nucleotide binding-domain, leucine-rich, repeat-containing (NLR)&amp;nbsp;proteins, CARDs recruit and activate caspases, which, in turn, activate gasdermin pore-forming proteins to induce pyroptotic cell death2. Here we show that CARD domains are present in defence systems that protect bacteria against phage. The bacterial CARD domain is essential for protease-mediated activation of certain bacterial gasdermins, which promote cell death once phage infection is recognized. We further show that multiple anti-phage defence systems use CARD domains to activate a variety of cell death effectors, and that CARD domains mediate protein–protein interactions in these systems. We find that these systems are triggered by a conserved immune-evasion protein used by phages to overcome the bacterial defence system RexAB3, demonstrating that phage proteins inhibiting one defence system can activate another. Our results suggest that CARD domains represent an ancient component of innate immune systems conserved from bacteria to humans, and that CARD-dependent activation of gasdermins is shared in organisms across the tree of life.

  abstract     = {Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning&amp;nbsp;(RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4–9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL. D1- and D2-expressing striatal neurons encode separate parts of a learned reward distribution, paralleling modern approaches in machine learning.},

  abstract     = {The hypothalamus is a brain region that plays a key role in coordinating fundamental biological functions1. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies2,3. Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the ‘HYPOMAP’. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as&amp;nbsp;based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that&amp;nbsp;291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these (MC4R, PCSK1, POMC, CALCR, BSN and CORO1A) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders. HYPOMAP integrates single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data to create a comprehensive spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus.},

  abstract     = {Human recombination maps are a valuable resource for association and linkage studies and crucial for many inferences of population history and natural selection. Existing maps1–5 are based solely on cross-over (CO) recombination, omitting non-cross-overs (NCOs)—the more common form of recombination6—owing to the difficulty in detecting them. Using whole-genome sequence data in families, we estimate the number of NCOs transmitted from parent to offspring and derive complete, sex-specific recombination maps including both NCOs and COs. Mothers have fewer but longer NCOs than fathers, and oocytes accumulate NCOs in a non-regulated fashion with maternal age. Recombination, primarily NCO, is responsible for 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 1.3–2.3) and 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.0–13.6) of paternal and maternal de novo mutations, respectively, and may drive the increase in de novo mutations with maternal age. NCOs are substantially more prominent than COs in centromeres, possibly to avoid large-scale genomic changes that may cause aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate that NCOs highlight to a much greater extent than COs the differences in the meiotic process between the sexes, in which maternal NCOs may reflect the safeguarding of oocytes from infancy until ovulation. Complete human recombination maps are presented that enable exploration of both cross-over and non-cross-over events during meiosis, with the potential to provide insight into the causes of aneuploidies and pregnancy loss.},

  abstract     = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is widespread across eukaryotes and can promote adaptive evolution1–4. However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5–7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation. In the Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment, diploid yeast evolve to be tetraploid under selection for larger multicellular size, revealing how whole-genome duplication can arise due to its immediate benefits, persist under selection, and fuel long-term innovations via aneuploidy.},

  abstract     = {How new structures emerge during evolution has long fascinated biologists. An example is how the diminutive bones of the mammalian middle ear arose from ancestral fish jawbones1. By contrast, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear, another mammalian innovation, remains a mystery, partly because it is supported by non-mineralized elastic cartilage, which is rarely recovered in fossils. Whether the outer ear arose de novo or through the reuse of ancestral developmental programs has remained unknown. Here we show that the outer ear shares gene regulatory programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians for both its initial outgrowth and the later development of the elastic cartilage. Comparative single-nucleus multiomics of the human outer ear and zebrafish gills reveals conserved gene expression and putative enhancers enriched for common transcription factor binding motifs. This is reflected by the transgenic activity of human outer-ear enhancers in gills, and of fish gill enhancers in the outer ear. Furthermore, single-cell multiomics of the cartilaginous book gills of horseshoe crabs reveals a&amp;nbsp;developmental program shared with the distal-less homeobox (DLX)-mediated gill program of vertebrates, with a book-gill distal-less enhancer driving expression in zebrafish gills. We propose that elements of an invertebrate gill program were reutilized in vertebrates to generate first gills and then the outer ear. A study on the evolutionary origin of the mammalian outer ear finds that it shares genetic programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians, indicating that elements of an ancestral gill have been reused.},

Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P &amp;lt; 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths.

  abstract     = {Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy&amp;nbsp;rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers. Long-term increases in heavy daily and hourly precipitation in Austria from different climatic mechanisms emphasize the need for flood management adaptation, especially in smaller catchments affected by the increased hourly rainfall.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2–4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary&amp;nbsp;from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10. Our assessment of a 27-country weather station dataset in the Mediterranean region revealed long-term stability in precipitation over 150 years, along with substantial short-term variability on annual to decadal scales driven by atmospheric circulation; these findings align with the precipitation trends seen in&amp;nbsp;CMIP6 models.},

  abstract     = {Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate1. Data about these rates are scarce2, and this limits insight into the relative contributions of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Here we present an early Holocene sea-level curve based on 88 sea-level data points (13.7–6.2 thousand years ago (ka)) from the North Sea (Doggerland3,4). After removing the pattern of regional glacial isostatic adjustment caused by the melting of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, the residual sea-level signal highlights two phases of accelerated sea-level rise. Meltwater sourced from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets drove these two phases, peaking around 10.3 ka and 8.3 ka with rates between 8 mm yr−1 and 9 mm yr−1. Our results also show that global mean sea-level rise between 11 ka and 3 ka amounted to 37.7 m (2σ range, 29.3–42.2 m), reconciling the mismatch that existed between estimates of global mean sea-level rise based on ice-sheet reconstructions and previously limited early Holocene sea-level data. With its broad spatiotemporal coverage, the North Sea dataset provides critical constraints on the patterns and rates of the late-stage deglaciation of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets, improving our understanding of the Earth-system response to climate change. An early Holocene sea-level curve based on data from the North Sea reveals two phases of accelerated sea-level rise owing to meltwater from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets.},

  abstract     = {The Antarctic ozone ‘hole’ was discovered in 1985 (ref. 1) and man-made ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are its primary cause2. Following reductions of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol3, signs of ozone recovery have been reported, based largely on observations and broad yet compelling model–data comparisons4. Although such approaches are highly valuable, they do not provide rigorous statistical detection of the temporal and spatial structure of Antarctic ozone recovery in the presence of internal climate variability. Here we apply pattern-based detection and attribution methods as used in climate-change studies5–11 to separate anthropogenically forced ozone responses from internal variability, relying on trend pattern information as a function of month and height. The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns. Pattern-based detection and attribution methods that make use of trend pattern information as a function of month and height provide evidence that reduction of ozone-depleting substances has resulted in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery.},

These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3–8. However, achieving high enthalpy is&amp;nbsp;challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9–11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest. High-enthalpy elastic metamaterials constructed from freely rotatable chiral metacells have high stiffness, large recoverable strain and improved buckling strength.},

  abstract     = {The electroluminescence performance of heavy-metal-free blue quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) is much lower than that of state-of-the-art cadmium-based counterparts. Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs. By suppressing compositional heterogeneities in cadmium-free quantum dots, environmentally friendly pure-blue-light-emitting diodes with enhanced efficiencies, lifetimes and spectral purity are achieved, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue quantum-dot light-emitting diodes.},

Generative models accelerate&amp;nbsp;materials design by directly generating new materials given desired property constraints, but current methods have a low success rate in proposing stable crystals or can satisfy only&amp;nbsp;a limited set of property constraints4–11. Here we present MatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared with previous generative models4,12, structures produced by MatterGen are more than twice as likely to be new and stable, and more than ten times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, new materials with desired chemistry, symmetry and mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20% of our target. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of abilities of MatterGen represent an important advancement towards creating a foundational generative model for materials design.

Floating&amp;nbsp;point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13–15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16–22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error. This layer-granular/kernel-granular flexibility allows simultaneous optimization within the two-dimensional design space at the hardware level. The proposed hardware achieved high energy efficiency (40.91 TFLOPS W−1 for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and 28.63 TFLOPS W−1 for MobileNet-v2 with ImageNet), low accuracy degradation (&amp;lt;0.45% for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and for MobilNet-v2 with ImageNet) and rapid&amp;nbsp;wakeup-to-response time (373.52 μs).

So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, here we introduce TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. We demonstrate TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems. TextGrad empowers scientists and engineers to easily develop impactful generative AI systems.

Intuitively, disorder is considered detrimental, requiring efforts to mitigate its effects in conventional topological photonics6–9. We propose a counter-intuitive approach that exploits a real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase10,11, without disrupting the momentum-space singularity originating from bound states in the continuum12. This methodology allows flat optical devices to encode spatial information or even extra topological charge in real space while preserving the topology of bound states in the continuum in momentum space with inherent alignment. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous and independent generation of a real-space broadband vortex or a holographic image alongside resonant momentum-space vortex beams with a narrow bandwidth, which cannot be achieved with conventional methods. Such engineered disorder contributes to vast intrinsic freedoms without adding extra dimensions or compromising the optical flatness13,14. Our findings of real–momentum duality not only lay the foundation for disorder engineering in topological photonics but also open new avenues for optical wavefront shaping, encryption and communications. A real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder is used to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase while preserving momentum-space topology.},

By directly investigating evolutionary dynamics in real time, these approaches have provided unparallelled insights into the complex interplay between evolutionary process and pattern. These approaches can reveal oscillations, stochastic fluctuations and systematic trends that unfold over extended periods, expose critical time lags between environmental shifts and population responses, and illuminate how subtle effects may accumulate into significant evolutionary patterns. Long-term studies can also reveal otherwise cryptic trends that unfold over extended periods, and offer the potential for serendipity: observing rare events that spur new evolutionary hypotheses and research directions. Despite the challenges of conducting long-term research, exacerbated by modern funding landscapes favouring short-term projects, the contributions of long-term studies to evolutionary biology are indispensable. This is particularly true in our rapidly changing, human-dominated world, where such studies offer a crucial window into how environmental changes and altered species interactions shape evolutionary trajectories. In this Review article, we showcase the groundbreaking discoveries of long-term evolutionary studies, underscoring their crucial role in advancing our understanding of the complex nature of evolution across multiple systems and timescales.

  abstract     = {Molecular recognition events between proteins drive biological processes in living systems1. However, higher levels of mechanistic regulation have emerged, in which protein–protein interactions are conditioned to small molecules2–5. Despite recent advances, computational tools for the design of new chemically induced protein interactions have remained a challenging task for the field6,7. Here we present a computational strategy for the design of proteins that target neosurfaces, that is, surfaces arising from protein–ligand complexes. To develop this strategy, we leveraged a geometric deep learning approach based on learned molecular surface representations8,9 and experimentally validated binders against three drug-bound protein complexes: Bcl2–venetoclax, DB3–progesterone and PDF1–actinonin. All binders demonstrated high affinities and accurate specificities, as assessed by mutational and structural characterization. Remarkably, surface fingerprints previously trained only on proteins could be applied to neosurfaces induced by interactions with small molecules, providing a powerful demonstration of generalizability that is uncommon in other deep learning approaches. We anticipate that such designed chemically induced protein interactions will have the potential to expand the sensing repertoire and the assembly of new synthetic pathways in engineered cells for innovative drug-controlled cell-based therapies10. A computational deep learning approach is used to design synthetic proteins that target the neosurfaces formed by protein–ligand interactions, with applications in the development of new therapeutic modalities such as molecular glues&amp;nbsp;or cell-based therapies.},

  abstract     = {The genetic code is conserved across all domains of life, yet exceptions have revealed variations in codon assignments and associated translation factors1–3. Inspired by this natural malleability, synthetic approaches have demonstrated whole-genome replacement of synonymous codons to construct genomically recoded organisms (GROs)4,5 with alternative genetic codes. However, no efforts have fully leveraged translation factor plasticity and codon degeneracy to compress translation function to a single codon and assess the possibility of a non-degenerate code. Here we describe construction and characterization of Ochre, a GRO that fully compresses a translational function into a single codon. We replaced 1,195 TGA stop codons with the synonymous TAA in ∆TAG Escherichia coli C321.∆A4. We then engineered release factor 2 (RF2) and tRNATrp to mitigate native UGA recognition, translationally isolating four codons for non-degenerate functions. Ochre thus utilizes UAA as the sole stop codon, with UGG encoding tryptophan and UAG and UGA reassigned for multi-site incorporation of two distinct non-standard amino acids into single proteins with more than 99% accuracy. Ochre fully compresses degenerate stop codons into a single codon and represents an important step toward a 64-codon non-degenerate code that will enable precise production of multi-functional synthetic proteins with unnatural encoded chemistries and broad utility in biotechnology and biotherapeutics. Ochre, a strain of Escherichia coli engineered to have a single stop codon, enables reassignment of four codons for non-degenerate functions, such as incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins.},

  abstract     = {Cardiomyocytes can be implanted to remuscularize the failing heart1–7. Challenges include sufficient cardiomyocyte retention for a sustainable therapeutic impact without intolerable side effects, such as arrhythmia and tumour growth. We investigated the hypothesis that epicardial engineered heart muscle (EHM) allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells structurally and functionally remuscularize the chronically failing heart without limiting side effects in rhesus macaques. After confirmation of in vitro and in vivo (nude rat model) equivalence of the newly developed rhesus macaque EHM model with a previously established Good Manufacturing Practice-compatible human EHM formulation8, long-term retention (up to 6 months) and dose-dependent enhancement of the target heart wall by EHM grafts constructed from 40 to 200 million cardiomyocytes/stromal cells were demonstrated in macaques with and without myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. In the heart failure model, evidence for EHM allograft-enhanced target heart wall contractility and ejection fraction, which are measures for local and global heart support, was obtained. Histopathological and gadolinium-based&amp;nbsp;perfusion magnetic resonance imaging analyses confirmed cell retention and functional vascularization. Arrhythmia and tumour growth were not observed. The obtained feasibility, safety and efficacy data provided the pivotal underpinnings for the approval of a first-in-human clinical trial on tissue-engineered heart repair. Our clinical data confirmed remuscularization by EHM implantation in a patient with advanced heart failure. Epicardial engineered heart muscle allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes can safely and effectively remuscularize chronically failing hearts in rhesus macaques, leading to improved cardiac function and paving the way for human clinical trials.},

  abstract     = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein1,2. Utrophin (UTRN), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD, is upregulated in some DMD patients3–5. To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMDPTC minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD, aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMDΔE52 patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation6–8 plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMDPTC patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via&amp;nbsp;transcriptional adaptation.&amp;nbsp; Transcriptional adaptation upregulates UTRN in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, as supported by several lines of evidence, including the use of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of the DMD gene.},

  abstract     = {Tissue-resident memory CD8 T (TRM) cells provide protection from infection at barrier sites. In the small intestine, TRM cells are found in at least two distinct subpopulations: one with higher expression of effector molecules and another with greater memory potential1. However, the origins of this diversity remain unknown. Here we proposed that distinct tissue niches drive the&amp;nbsp;phenotypic heterogeneity&amp;nbsp;of TRM cells. To test this, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics of human samples, a mouse model of acute systemic viral infection and a newly established strategy for pooled optically encoded gene perturbations to profile the locations, interactions and transcriptomes of pathogen-specific TRM cell differentiation at single-transcript resolution. We developed computational approaches to capture cellular locations along three anatomical axes of the small intestine and to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of cell types and gene expression. Our study reveals that the regionalized signalling of the intestinal architecture supports two distinct TRM cell states: differentiated TRM cells and progenitor-like TRM cells, located in the upper villus and lower villus, respectively. This diversity is mediated by distinct ligand–receptor activities, cytokine gradients and specialized cellular contacts. Blocking TGFβ or CXCL9 and CXCL10 sensing by antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed a model consistent with anatomically&amp;nbsp;delineated, early fate specification. Ultimately, our framework for the study of tissue immune networks reveals that T cell location and functional state are fundamentally intertwined. Profiling of the location and transcriptome of tissue-resident memory&amp;nbsp;CD8 T cell formation at single-transcript resolution&amp;nbsp;finds regionalized signalling as the basis of immune diversity in the intestine and provides a&amp;nbsp;conceptual framework for the study of tissue immune networks.},

  abstract     = {Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) can generate circulating immune responses against predicted neoantigens1–6. However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient’s tumour and result in clinical activity are largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest for patients who have tumours with a low mutational burden. Here we conducted a phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02950766) to test a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage III or IV) with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine. At a median follow-up of 40.2 months after surgery, none of the 9 participants enrolled in the study had a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T cell immune responses against the PCV antigens, including to RCC driver mutations in VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, KDM5C and PIK3CA. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T cell clones. Moreover, T cell reactivity against autologous tumours was detected in seven out of nine patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations and can induce antitumour immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all nine vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCVs as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC. A phase I trial of a neoantigen-targeting personalized cancer vaccine led to durable and polyfunctional T cell responses and&amp;nbsp;antitumour recognition, and was associated with no recurrence in patients with high-risk clear cell renal cell carcinoma.},

  abstract     = {T cell-based immunotherapies hold promise in treating cancer by leveraging the immune system’s recognition of cancer-specific antigens1. However, their efficacy is limited in tumours with few somatic mutations and substantial intratumoural heterogeneity2–4. Here we introduce a previously uncharacterized class of tumour-wide public neoantigens originating from RNA splicing aberrations in diverse cancer types. We identified T cell receptor clones capable of recognizing and targeting neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing in GNAS and RPL22. In cases with multi-site biopsies, we detected the tumour-wide expression of the GNAS neojunction in glioma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer and liver cancer. These neoantigens are endogenously generated and presented by tumour cells under physiologic conditions and are sufficient to trigger cancer cell eradication by neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells.

  abstract     = {Bacteriophages use diverse mechanisms to evade antiphage defence systems. ΦKZ-like jumbo phages assemble a proteinaceous, nucleus-like compartment that excludes antagonistic host nucleases and also internalizes DNA replication and transcription machinery1–4. The phage factors required for protein import and the mechanisms of selectivity remain unknown, however. Here we uncover an import system comprising proteins highly conserved across nucleus-forming phages, together with additional cargo-specific contributors. Using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins, we determine that the importation of five different phage nuclear-localized proteins requires distinct interfaces of the same factor, Imp1 (gp69). Imp1 localizes early to the nascent phage nucleus and forms discrete puncta in the mature phage nuclear periphery, probably in complex with direct interactor Imp6 (gp67), a conserved protein encoded in the same locus. The import of certain proteins, including a host topoisomerase, additionally requires Imp3 (gp59), a&amp;nbsp;conserved factor necessary for proper Imp1 function. Three additional non-conserved phage proteins (Imp2&amp;nbsp;and Imp4/Imp5) are required for the import of two queried nuclear cargos (nuclear-localized protein 1 and host topoisomerase, respectively), perhaps acting as specific adaptors. We therefore propose a core import system that includes Imp1, Imp3 and Imp6, with multiple interfaces of&amp;nbsp;Imp1 licensing transport through a protein lattice. This study uncovers a highly conserved jumbo phage protein, Imp1, that possesses multiple interfaces to license protein import into a proteinaceous nucleus-like compartment, using a genetic selection that forces the phage to decrease or abolish the import of specific proteins.},

  abstract     = {Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors1. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers2,3, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)4. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1–SAG101–NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1–SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its&amp;nbsp;recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1–SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.

  abstract     = {Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity1. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. 2,3). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane4,5. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E5,6. We report structures of AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1–AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1–AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1–AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR. In plant immunity, sensor NLR resistosomes can generate heterotrimer complexes comprising the helper NLR NRG1, and investigation of cryo-EM structures shows the mechanisms of these heterotrimers in immune activation and&amp;nbsp;suppression.},

  abstract     = {Numerous studies support the role of dopamine in modulating aggression1,2, but the exact neural mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can bidirectionally modulate aggression in male mice in an experience-dependent manner. Although VTA dopaminergic cells strongly influence aggression in novice aggressors, they become ineffective in expert aggressors. Furthermore, eliminating dopamine synthesis in the VTA prevents the emergence of aggression in naive mice but leaves aggression intact in expert aggressors. VTA dopamine modulates aggression through the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), a region known for aggression control. Dopamine enables the flow of information from the hippocampus to the dLS by weakening local inhibition in novice aggressors. In expert aggressors, dLS local inhibition naturally weakens, and the ability of dopamine to modulate dLS cells diminishes. Overall, these results reveal a sophisticated role of dopamine in the rise of aggression in adult male mice. Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area have a role in modulating aggression in adult male mice, and this effect of dopamine depends strongly on fighting experience.},

  abstract     = {The ability to flexibly switch our responses to external stimuli according to contextual information is critical for successful interactions with a complex world. Context-dependent computations are necessary across many domains1–3, yet their neural implementations remain poorly understood. Here we developed a novel behavioural task in rats to study context-dependent selection and accumulation of evidence for decision-making4–6. Under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, we first show mathematically that this computation can be supported by three dynamical solutions and that all networks performing the task implement a combination of these solutions. These solutions can be identified and tested directly with experimental data. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modelling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these solutions, suggesting that different individuals could use different combinations. To study variability across individual subjects, we developed automated, high-throughput methods to train rats on our task and trained many subjects using these methods. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioural analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. Our theory further predicts a specific link between behavioural and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. In summary, our results provide an experimentally supported theoretical framework to analyse individual variability in biological and artificial systems that perform flexible decision-making tasks, open the door to cellular-resolution studies of individual variability in higher cognition, and provide insights into neural mechanisms of context-dependent computation more generally. Behavioural experiments to study decision-making in response to context-dependent accumulation of evidence provide testable models that are consistent with the heterogeneity in neural signatures among rats that perform well in trials.},

  abstract     = {The human genome contains millions of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) with cell-type-specific activities that shape both health and many disease states1. However, we lack a functional understanding of the sequence features that control the activity and cell-type-specific features of these cCREs. Here we used lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays (lentiMPRAs) to test the regulatory activity of more than 680,000 sequences, representing an extensive set of annotated cCREs among three cell types (HepG2, K562 and WTC11), and found that 41.7% of these sequences were active. By testing sequences in both orientations, we find promoters to have strand-orientation biases and their 200-nucleotide cores to function as non-cell-type-specific ‘on switches’ that provide similar expression levels to their associated gene. By contrast, enhancers have weaker orientation biases, but increased tissue-specific characteristics. Utilizing our lentiMPRA data, we develop sequence-based models to predict cCRE function and variant effects with high accuracy, delineate regulatory motifs and model their combinatorial effects. Testing a lentiMPRA library encompassing 60,000 cCREs in all three cell types further identified factors that determine cell-type specificity. Collectively, our work provides an extensive catalogue of functional CREs in three widely used cell lines and showcases how large-scale functional measurements can be used to dissect regulatory grammar. Lentivirus-based reporter assays for 680,000 regulatory sequences from three cell lines&amp;nbsp;coupled to machine-learning models lead to insights into the grammar of cis-regulatory elements.},

  abstract     = {Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research1,2, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have&amp;nbsp;fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.

  abstract     = {Online platforms are rife with racial discrimination1, but current interventions focus on employers2,3 rather than customers. We propose a customer-facing solution: changing to a two-point rating scale (dichotomization). Compared with the ubiquitous five-star scale, we argue that dichotomization reduces modern racial discrimination by focusing evaluators on the distinction between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ performance, thereby reducing how personal beliefs shape customer assessments. Study 1 is a quasi-natural experiment on a home-services labour platform (n = 69,971) in which the company exogenously changed from a five-star scale to a dichotomous scale (thumbs up or thumbs down). Dichotomization eliminated customers’ racial discrimination whereby non-white workers received lower ratings and earned 91 cents for each US dollar paid to white workers for the same work. A pre-registered experiment (study 2, n = 652) found that the equalizing effect of dichotomization is most prevalent among evaluators holding modern racist beliefs. Further experiments (study 3, n = 1,435; study 4, n = 528) provide evidence of the proposed mechanism, and eight supplementary studies support measurement and design choices. Our research offers a promising intervention for reducing customers’ subtle racial discrimination in a large section of the economy and contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on evaluation processes and racial inequality. Changing from a five-point scale to a two-point scale for rating workers reduces racial discrimination by making customers focus on whether the work was good or bad instead of their own personal biases.},

So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries2. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries. An analysis of global deforestation linked to consumption of products in the supply chains of large economies finds greater losses for vertebrate species’ ranges outside these countries than in them.},

  abstract     = {Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change1. Their melting leads to increased local geohazards2, and impacts marine3 and terrestrial4,5 ecosystems, regional freshwater resources6, and both global water and energy cycles7,8. Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present9,10 and future11–13 sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series14–16. Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet17. Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments14–16 at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles12,16,18, which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century11,12,18. An intercomparison exercise reassesses mass loss from glaciers worldwide based on the main in situ and satellite methods from 2000 to 2023; the results are consistent with previous assessments and provide a refined and comprehensive observational baseline for future impact and modelling studies.},

  abstract     = {Nucleophilic aromatic substitutions (SNAr) are among the most widely used processes in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries1–4, allowing convergent assembly of complex molecules through C–C and C–X (X = O, N, S) bond formation. SNAr reactions are typically carried out using forcing conditions, involving polar aprotic solvents, stoichiometric bases and elevated temperatures, which do not allow for control over reaction selectivity. Despite the importance of SNAr chemistry, there are only a handful of selective catalytic methods reported that rely on small organic hydrogen-bonding or phase-transfer catalysts5–11. Here we establish a biocatalytic approach to stereoselective SNAr chemistry by uncovering promiscuous SNAr activity in a designed enzyme featuring an activated arginine12. This activity was optimized over successive rounds of directed evolution to afford an engineered biocatalyst, SNAr1.3, that is 160-fold more efficient than the parent and promotes the coupling of electron-deficient arenes with carbon nucleophiles with near-perfect stereocontrol (&amp;gt;99% enantiomeric excess (e.e.)). SNAr1.3 can operate at a rate of 0.15 s−1, perform more than 4,000 turnovers and can accept a broad range of electrophilic and nucleophilic coupling partners, including those that allow construction of challenging 1,1-diaryl quaternary stereocentres. Biochemical, structural and computational studies provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of SNAr1.3, including the emergence of a halide binding pocket shaped by key catalytic residues Arg124 and Asp125. This study brings a landmark synthetic reaction into the realm of biocatalysis to provide an efficient and versatile platform for catalytic SNAr chemistry. A biocatalytic approach to enantioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) was achieved through laboratory evolution of highly efficient and selective SNArase biocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Methane, the main component of natural and shale gas, is a significant carbon source for chemical synthesis. The direct partial oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates under mild conditions1–3 is an attractive pathway, but the inertness of the molecule makes it challenging to achieve simultaneously high conversion and high selectivity towards a single target product. This difficulty is amplified when aiming for more valuable products that require C–C coupling4,5. Whereas selective partial methane oxidation processes1–3,6–9 have thus typically generated C1 oxygenates6,7, recent reports have documented photocatalytic methane conversion to the C2 oxygenate ethanol with low conversions but good-to-high selectivities4,5,8–12. Here we show that the intramolecular junction photocatalyst covalent triazine-based framework-1 with alternating benzene and triazine motifs13,14 drives methane coupling and oxidation to ethanol with a high selectivity and significantly improved conversion. The heterojunction architecture not only enables efficient and long-lived separation of charges after their generation, but also preferential adsorption of H2O and O2 to the triazine and benzene units, respectively. This dual-site feature separates C–C coupling to form ethane intermediates from the sites where •OH radicals are formed, thereby avoiding over-oxidation. When loaded with Pt to further&amp;nbsp;boost performance, the molecular heterojunction photocatalyst generates ethanol in a packed-bed flow reactor with greatly&amp;nbsp;improved conversion that results in an apparent quantum efficiency of 9.4%. We anticipate that further developing the ‘intramolecular junction’ approach will deliver efficient and selective catalysts for C–C coupling, pertaining, but not limited, to methane conversion to C2+ chemicals. Mechanistic insights into a photocatalyst with an intramolecular junction and two different active sites could inspire further exploration of ‘intramolecular heterojunctions’ as the basis of selective and stable photocatalysts for C–H activation and&amp;nbsp;C–C coupling.},

  abstract     = {Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1–5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl−, Br−) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6–14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start–shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst’s passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP–Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm−2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr−1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity. Construction of a phosphate passivation layer on the surface of a cathode to withstand fluctuating operation in alkaline seawater is proposed following understanding the mechanism behind the dynamic evolution and degradation of cathode in intermittent electrolysis.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) metals are appealing for many emergent phenomena and have recently attracted research interests1–9. Unlike the widely studied 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, 2D metals are extremely challenging to achieve, because they are thermodynamically unstable1,10. Here we develop a vdW squeezing method to realize diverse 2D metals (including Bi, Ga, In, Sn and Pb) at the ångström thickness limit. The achieved 2D metals are stabilized from a complete encapsulation between two MoS2 monolayers and present non-bonded interfaces, enabling access to their intrinsic properties. Transport and Raman measurements on monolayer Bi show excellent physical properties, for example, new phonon mode, enhanced electrical conductivity, notable field effect and large nonlinear Hall conductivity. Our work establishes an effective route for implementing 2D metals, alloys and other 2D non-vdW materials, potentially outlining a bright vision for a broad portfolio of emerging quantum, electronic and photonic devices. Melting and squeezing pure metals between two sapphires covered in molybdenum disulfide produces diverse two-dimensional metals at the ångström thickness limit.},

  abstract     = {Nanoribbons, nanometre-wide strips of a two-dimensional material, are a unique system in condensed matter. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times1,2, quantum confinement3 and topologically protected states4,5 can emerge. An exciting prospect for this material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge, a key property for spin-based electronics such as (low-energy) non-volatile transistors6. Here we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). We demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs show macroscopic magnetic properties arising from their edge, with internal fields of roughly 240 to 850 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at sub-1-T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that on photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funnelled to a state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a fascinating system for studying the interplay between magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics. Phosphorene nanoribbons demonstrate extraordinary magnetic properties, ranging from large internal fields in films to macroscopic alignment in solution, which can be coupled to photoexcitations that localize to the magnetic edge of these ribbons.},

  abstract     = {Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics1–6. Experimental efforts so far have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials—typically amorphous metals—and semiconducting quantum Hall7–11 or quantum anomalous Hall12,13 systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes14–17. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials in which the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling ν = −1 as well as a superconducting state at ν ≈ −3.5 at zero magnetic field. Gate voltage can also be used to actuate non-volatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state18, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at ν = 2/3 (ref. 19)—also stable at zero magnetic field—enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers20–22, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket20–24, while leaving the topology of the ν = −1 quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low disorder limit. Rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts gate-tunable superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall states, and thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a fractional Chern insulator at zero magnetic field, paving the way for new hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states.},

  abstract     = {A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter in which its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organization. The existence of the supersolid phase of matter was speculated more than 50 years ago1–4. However, only recently has there been convincing experimental evidence, mainly using ultracold atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) coupled to electromagnetic fields. There, various guises of the supersolid were created using atoms coupled to high-finesse cavities5,6, with large magnetic dipole moments7–13, and spin–orbit-coupled, two-component systems showing stripe phases14–16. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context based on exciton–polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound state in the continuum (BiC) with exceptionally low losses, realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a precision of several parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to also measure the local coherence of the supersolid. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum. Experimental evidence is presented for a new implementation of supersolidity in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide, demonstrating the breaking of translational symmetry with exceptionally low losses.},

Integrated quantum photonics that enables on-chip encoding, processing and detection of quantum light states offers a promising platform for the generation and manipulation of large-scale entangled states4,5. Generating entanglement between qubits encoded in discrete variables within single photons is challenging, owing to the difficulty of making single photons interact on photonic chips6–11. Devices that operate with continuous variables are more promising, as they enable the deterministic generation and entanglement of qumodes, in which information is encoded in light quadratures. Demonstrations so far have been limited to entanglement between two qumodes12–20. Here we report the deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip. The chip delivers a quantum microcomb that produces multimode squeezed-vacuum optical frequency combs below the threshold. We verify the inseparability of our eight-mode state and demonstrate supermode multipartite entanglement over hundreds of megahertz sideband frequencies through violation of the van Loock–Furusawa criteria. By measuring the full matrices of nullifier correlations with sufficiently low off-diagonal noises, we characterize multipartite entanglement structures, which are approximate to the expected cluster-type structures for finite squeezing. This work shows the potential of continuous-variable integrated photonic quantum devices for facilitating quantum computing, networking and sensing. Deterministic generation of a continuous-variable eight-mode entanglement on an integrated optical chip is reported.},

Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications4–6 and functionalities7–12 on quantum processors have been performed in ad hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here we report on the design and implementation of an architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the capability of the architecture to execute applications in high-level software by implementing it as a quantum network operating system—QNodeOS—and executing test programs, including a delegated computation from a client to a server13 on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond14,15. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware by multitasking different applications. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an extra driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single 40Ca+ atom16. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in quantum network programming and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society.

  abstract     = {Argonaute proteins are categorized into AGO and PIWI clades. Across most animal species, AGO-clade proteins are widely expressed in various cell types, and&amp;nbsp;regulate normal gene expression1. By contrast, PIWI-clade proteins predominantly function during gametogenesis to suppress transposons and ensure fertility1,2. Both clades use nucleic acid guides for target recognition by means of base pairing, crucial for initiating target silencing, often through direct cleavage. AGO-clade proteins use a narrow channel to secure a tight guide–target interaction3. By contrast, PIWI proteins feature a wider channel that potentially allows mismatches during pairing, broadening target silencing capability4,5. However, the mechanism of PIWI-mediated target cleavage remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that after target binding, PIWI proteins undergo a conformational change from an ‘open’ state&amp;nbsp;to a ‘locked’ state, facilitating base pairing and enhancing target cleavage efficiency. This transition involves narrowing of the binding channel and repositioning of the PIWI-interacting RNA–target duplex towards the MID-PIWI lobe, establishing extensive contacts for duplex stabilization. During this transition, we also identify an intermediate ‘comma-shaped’ conformation, which might recruit GTSF1, a known auxiliary protein that&amp;nbsp;enhances PIWI cleavage activity6. GTSF1 facilitates the transition to the locked state by linking the PIWI domain to the RNA duplex, thereby expediting the conformational change critical for efficient target cleavage. These findings explain the molecular mechanisms underlying PIWI–PIWI-interacting&amp;nbsp;RNA complex function in target RNA cleavage, providing insights into how dynamic conformational changes from PIWI proteins coordinate cofactors to safeguard gametogenesis.

  abstract     = {Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein–protein interactions to drive aberrant function1,2. As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma3, the most common embryonal brain tumour in children4. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST5. However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3–neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4–HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein–protein interactions. We show that gain-of-function cancer mutations in the KBTBD4 E3 ligase promote neodegradation of substrates via a shape-complementarity-based mechanism, which converges with the mechanism of action of the UM171 molecular glue degrader and can be blocked by HDAC1/2 inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {UM171 is a potent agonist of ex vivo human haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal1. By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1–CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition2,3. However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3–neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST–HDAC1/2–KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base&amp;nbsp;editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1. By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.

  abstract     = {Snakebite envenoming remains a devastating and neglected tropical disease, claiming over 100,000 lives annually and causing severe complications and long-lasting disabilities for many more1,2. Three-finger toxins (3FTx) are highly toxic components of elapid snake venoms that can cause diverse pathologies, including severe tissue damage3 and inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in life-threatening neurotoxicity4. At present, the only available treatments for snakebites consist of polyclonal antibodies derived from the plasma of immunized animals, which have high cost and limited efficacy against 3FTxs5–7. Here we used deep learning methods to de novo design proteins to bind short-chain and long-chain α-neurotoxins and cytotoxins from the 3FTx family. With limited experimental screening, we obtained protein designs with remarkable thermal stability, high binding affinity and near-atomic-level agreement with the computational models. The designed proteins effectively neutralized all three 3FTx subfamilies in vitro and protected mice from a lethal neurotoxin challenge. Such potent, stable and readily manufacturable toxin-neutralizing proteins could provide the basis for safer, cost-effective and widely accessible next-generation antivenom therapeutics. Beyond snakebite, our results highlight how computational design could help democratize therapeutic discovery, particularly in resource-limited settings, by substantially reducing costs and resource requirements for the development of therapies for neglected tropical diseases. Deep learning methods have been used to design proteins that can neutralize the effects of three-finger toxins found in snake venom, which could lead to the development of safer and more accessible antivenom treatments.},

  abstract     = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) show potential to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in humans1. However, there are limited data on the antibody concentrations required to prevent infection. Clinical trials of bNAb prophylaxis have demonstrated partial efficacy2, but the sampling frequency typically does not allow precise timing of infection events and concurrent antibody levels. Here, using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques, we show that although potent bNAbs can delay the onset of acute viremia, subclinical infections occur while bNAb levels remain high. Serial SIV challenge of monkeys given partially and fully neutralizing bNAbs revealed that ‘viral blips’—low and transient plasma viremia—often occur while serum bNAb concentrations are well above currently accepted protective levels. To understand the precise timing of the infections resulting in such blips, we performed plasma viral sequencing on monkeys that were serially challenged with genetically barcoded SIV after bNAb administration. These analyses showed that subclinical infections occurred in most animals that were given potent bNAb prophylaxis. These subclinical infections occurred while antibody concentrations were 2- to&amp;nbsp;400-fold higher than the levels required to prevent fully viremic breakthrough infection. This study demonstrates that immunoprophylaxis can mask subclinical infections, which may affect the interpretation of prophylactic HIV-1 bNAb clinical trials. Viral sequencing reveals subclinical infections in animals challenged with simian immunodeficiency virus even in the presence of potent neutralizing antibodies, with implications for clinical trials of antiviral agents against human immunodeficiency virus.},

  abstract     = {Since the onset of the pandemic, many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, exhibiting substantial evolution in the virus’ spike protein1, the main target of neutralizing antibodies2. A plausible hypothesis proposes that the virus evolves to evade antibody-mediated neutralization (vaccine- or infection-induced) to maximize its ability to infect an immunologically experienced population1,3. Because viral infection induces neutralizing antibodies, viral evolution may thus navigate on a dynamic immune landscape that is shaped by local infection history. Here we developed a comprehensive mechanistic model, incorporating deep mutational scanning data4,5, antibody pharmacokinetics and regional genomic surveillance data, to predict the variant-specific relative number of susceptible individuals over time. We show that this quantity precisely matched historical variant dynamics, predicted future variant dynamics and explained global differences in variant dynamics. Our work strongly suggests that the ongoing pandemic continues to shape variant-specific population immunity, which determines a variant’s ability to transmit, thus defining variant fitness. The model can be applied to any region by utilizing local genomic surveillance data, allows contextualizing risk assessment of variants and provides information for vaccine design. A modelling approach predicts SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics on the basis of immunity and cross-neutralization, which was shaped by a&amp;nbsp;region’s SARS-CoV-2 infection history.},

  abstract     = {In subsurface methanogenic ecosystems, the ubiquity of methylated-compound-using archaea—methylotrophic methanogens1–4—implies that methylated compounds have an important role in the ecology and carbon cycling of such habitats. However, the origin of these chemicals remains unclear5,6 as there are no known energy metabolisms that generate methylated compounds de novo as a major product. Here we identified an energy metabolism in the subsurface-derived thermophilic anaerobe Zhaonella formicivorans7 that catalyses the conversion of formate to methanol, thereby producing methanol without requiring methylated compounds as an input. Cultivation experiments showed that formate-driven methanologenesis is inhibited by the accumulation of methanol. However, this limitation can be overcome through methanol consumption by a methylotrophic partner methanogen, Methermicoccus shengliensis. This symbiosis represents a fourth mode of mutualistic cross-feeding driven by thermodynamic necessity (syntrophy), previously thought to rely on transfer of hydrogen, formate or electrons8–10. The unusual metabolism and syntrophy provide insights into the enigmatic presence of methylated compounds in subsurface methanogenic ecosystems and demonstrate how organisms survive at the thermodynamic limit through metabolic symbiosis. Zhaonella formicivorans produces methanol, for a novel syntrophic interaction, without requiring methylated compounds as an input.},

  abstract     = {Antimicrobial compounds are essential for controlling bacterial infections. Stress-induced bacterial tolerance and persisters can undermine antimicrobial activities under laboratory conditions, but their quantitative effects under physiological conditions remain unclear1,2. Here we determined constraints on clearance of Salmonella by antimicrobials in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats. The antibiotics enrofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited poor anti-Salmonella activity under both conditions, primarily owing to severe nutrient starvation, which restricted Salmonella replication3–5. Other infection-associated conditions, such as acidic pH, glucose, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, osmolarity, oxygen limitation, carbon dioxide and carbonate, as well as drug efflux, toxin–antitoxin modules and cell size had limited effects. A subset of resilient Salmonella appeared as a key obstacle for clearance by enrofloxacin, based on the biphasic decline of Salmonella colony-forming units. However, these data were misleading, because colony formation was confounded by extensive post-exposure killing. More accurate single-cell, real-time assays showed uniformly slow damage, indicating high resilience across the entire Salmonella population. The resulting extensive survival of bulk bacteria minimized the effect of hyper-resilient persisters. Thus, starvation-induced general resilience of Salmonella was the main cause of poor antibiotic clearance. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying antibiotic activity with real-time, single-cell assays under physiological conditions. Experiments in infected mice and tissue-mimicking chemostats show that resilience of Salmonella against antimicrobial compounds is largely a result of starvation-induced general resilience rather than survival of a small subset of hyper-resilient cells.},

Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots3. How they navigate these design challenges is unclear4. Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network5. Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection. Symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands.},

  abstract     = {Soil alkalinization and global warming are predicted to pose major challenges to agriculture in the future, as they continue to accelerate, markedly reducing global arable land and crop yields1,2. Therefore, strategies for future agriculture are needed to further improve globally cultivated, relatively high-yielding Green Revolution varieties (GRVs) derived from the SEMIDWARF&amp;nbsp;1 (SD1) gene3,4. Here we propose that precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) to optimal levels is the key to not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to GRVs, but also to further enhance their yield. Endogenous modulation of ALKALI-THERMAL TOLERANCE 1/2&amp;nbsp;(ATT1/2), quantitative trait loci encoding GA20-oxidases or exogenous application of GA minimized rice yield loss affected by sodic soils. Mechanistically, high GA concentrations induce reactive oxygen species over-accumulation, whereas low GA concentrations repress the expression of&amp;nbsp;stress-tolerance genes by means of DELLA–NGR5-mediated H3K27me3 methylation. We further showed that ATT1 induces large fluctuations in GA levels, whereas ATT2 is the ideal candidate for fine-tuning GA concentrations to appropriate levels to balance reactive oxygen species and H3K27me3 methylation to improve alkali–thermal tolerance and yield. Thus, ATT2 is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene that could be harnessed to develop and use marginal lands for sustainable agriculture in the future. Precise regulation of the phytohormone gibberellin to optimal levels may not only confer alkali–thermal tolerance to Green Revolution rice&amp;nbsp;varieties but may also further enhance their yield, and ATT2,&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;enabling&amp;nbsp;the fine-tuning of gibberellins,&amp;nbsp;is expected to be a potential new post-Green Revolution gene.},

  abstract     = {Neurons in the hippocampus are correlated with different variables, including space, time, sensory cues, rewards and actions, in which the extent of tuning depends on ongoing task demands1–8. However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or whether a more generic computation can account for these observations9. Here, to disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice in which space, auditory tones, rewards and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans and modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans towards deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues. Using high-density electrophysiological recordings, how internally generated cell assemblies are updated by action plans to meet external goals is explored.},

  abstract     = {The neuromodulators dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) powerfully regulate associative learning1–8. Similarities in the activity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory systems have inspired competing models of how DA and 5HT interact to drive the formation of new associations9–14. However, these hypotheses have not been tested directly because it has not been possible to interrogate and manipulate multiple neuromodulatory systems in a single subject. Here we establish a mouse model that enables simultaneous genetic access to the brain’s DA and 5HT neurons. Anterograde tracing revealed the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to be a putative hotspot for the integration of convergent DA and 5HT signals. Simultaneous recording of DA and 5HT axon activity, together with genetically encoded DA and 5HT sensor recordings, revealed that rewards increase DA signalling and decrease 5HT signalling in the NAc. Optogenetically dampening DA or 5HT reward responses individually produced modest behavioural deficits in an appetitive&amp;nbsp;conditioning task, while blunting both signals together profoundly disrupted learning and reinforcement. Optogenetically reproducing DA and 5HT reward responses together was sufficient to drive the acquisition of new associations and supported reinforcement more potently than either manipulation did alone. Together, these results demonstrate that striatal DA and 5HT signals shape learning by exerting opponent control of reinforcement. A double-transgenic mouse model that enables monitoring or manipulation of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously&amp;nbsp;in the brain’s nucleus accumbens shows that these neuromodulators have opponent roles in reward learning.},

  abstract     = {The Yamnaya archaeological complex appeared around 3300 bc across the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas, and by 3000 bc it reached its maximal extent, ranging from Hungary in the west to Kazakhstan in the east. To localize Yamnaya origins among the preceding Eneolithic people, we assembled ancient DNA from 435 individuals, demonstrating three genetic clines. A Caucasus–lower Volga (CLV) cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer1 ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end and a northern end at Berezhnovka along the lower Volga river. Bidirectional gene flow created intermediate populations, such as the north Caucasus Maikop people, and those at Remontnoye on the steppe. The Volga cline was formed as CLV people mixed with upriver populations of Eastern hunter-gatherer2 ancestry, creating hypervariable groups, including one at Khvalynsk. The Dnipro cline was formed when CLV people moved west, mixing with people with Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry3 along the Dnipro and Don rivers to establish Serednii Stih groups, from whom Yamnaya ancestors formed around 4000 bc and grew rapidly after 3750–3350 bc. The CLV people contributed around four-fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya and, entering Anatolia, probably from the east, at least one-tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age central Anatolians, who spoke Hittite4,5. We therefore propose that the final unity of the speakers of ‘proto-Indo-Anatolian’, the language ancestral to both Anatolian and Indo-European people, occurred in CLV people some time between 4400 bc and 4000 bc. Ancient DNA reveals how the explosive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists began with a small community north of the Black Sea speaking ancestral Indo-European, and detects genetic links with Anatolian speakers, stemming from a common Indo-Anatolian homeland in the North Caucasus–lower Volga region.},

  abstract     = {The North Pontic Region was the meeting point of the farmers of Old Europe and the foragers and pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe1,2, and the source of migrations deep into Europe3–5. Here we report genome-wide data from 81 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of its people. North Pontic foragers had ancestry from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 as well as European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. During the Eneolithic period, a wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga area7 bypassed local foragers to mix in equal parts with Trypillian farmers, forming the people of the Usatove culture around 4500 bce. A temporally overlapping wave of migrants from the Caucasus–Lower Volga blended with foragers instead of farmers to form Serednii Stih people7. The third wave was the Yamna—descendants of the Serednii Stih who formed by mixture around 4000 bce and expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 bce). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka, Ukraine (3635–3383 bce), a site of archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic–Bronze Age transition and a likely epicentre of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves of migration propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders, a flexible strategy that may explain the success of the peoples of the North Pontic in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3–5,8–10. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of 81 prehistoric individuals reveals how the genetic makeup of people from the North Pontic region was influenced by waves of migration during the Eneolithic period and Early Bronze Age.},

  abstract     = {The Casarabe culture (500–1400 ce), spreading over roughly 4,500 km2 of the monumental mounds region of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia, is one of the clearest examples of urbanism in pre-Columbian (pre-1492 ce) Amazonia. It exhibits a four-tier hierarchical settlement pattern, with hundreds of monumental mounds interconnected by canals and causeways1,2. Despite archaeological evidence indicating that maize was cultivated by this society3, it is unknown whether it was the staple crop and which type of agricultural farming system was used to support this urban-scale society. Here, we address this issue by integration of remote sensing, field survey and microbotanical analyses, which shows that the Casarabe culture invested heavily in landscape engineering, constructing a complex system of drainage canals (to drain excess water during the rainy season) and newly documented savannah farm ponds (to retain water in the dry season). Phytolith analyses of 178 samples from 18 soil profiles in drained fields, farm ponds and forested settings record the singular and ubiquitous presence of maize (Zea mays) in pre-Columbian fields and farm ponds, and an absence of evidence for agricultural practices in the forest. Collectively, our findings show how the Casarabe culture managed the savannah landscape for intensive year-round maize monoculture that probably sustained its relatively large population. Our results have implications for how we conceive agricultural systems in Amazonia, and show an example of a Neolithic-like, grain-based agrarian economy in the Amazon. Remote sensing, field survey and microbotanical analyses show that the pre-Columbian Casarabe culture in the Bolivian Amazon invested heavily in landscape engineering, constructing a complex system of drainage canals and newly documented savannah farm ponds.},

The extent to which this negative effect varies among grassland types and over time in response to multi-year extreme drought remains unclear. Here, using a coordinated distributed experiment that simulated four years of growing-season drought (around 66% rainfall reduction), we compared drought sensitivity within and among six representative grasslands spanning broad precipitation gradients in each of Eurasia and North America—two of the Northern Hemisphere’s largest grass-dominated regions. Aboveground plant production declined substantially with drought in the Eurasian grasslands and the effects accumulated over time, while the declines were less severe and more muted over time in the North American grasslands. Drought effects on species richness shifted from positive to negative in Eurasia, but from negative to positive in North America over time. The differing responses of plant production in these grasslands were accompanied by less common (subordinate) plant species declining in Eurasian grasslands but increasing in North American grasslands. Our findings demonstrate the high production sensitivity of Eurasian compared with North American grasslands to extreme drought (43.6% versus 25.2% reduction), and the key role of subordinate species in determining impacts of extreme drought on grassland productivity. Eurasian grasslands have high production sensitivity to extreme drought compared with North American grasslands.},

  abstract     = {Investigating glacial isostatic adjustment has been the standard method to decipher Earth’s interior viscosity structure1,2, but such an approach has been rarely applied to other planets because of a lack of observational data3,4. The north polar cap of Mars is the only millions-of-years-old surface feature that can induce measurable surface deformation on this planet, thereby holding clues to its present-day internal viscosity structure5,6. Here we investigate the emplacement of this ice cap by combining thermal evolution models7, viscoelastic deformation calculations8 and radar observations6. We show that downward motion of the northern regions is ongoing and can be constrained by analyses of the time-variable gravity field9 and NASA’s InSight seismic moment rate10. Only models with present-day high viscosities (2–6 × 1022 Pa s for depths greater than 500 km), strong mantle depletion in radiogenic elements (more than 90%) and thick average crusts (thicker than 40 km) are consistent with the negligible flexure beneath the polar cap seen by radars. The northern lithosphere must deform at less than 0.13 mm per year and have a seismic efficiency less than 0.3 to satisfy gravity and seismic constraints, respectively. Our models show that the north polar cap formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr and that glacial isostatic adjustment can be further constrained by future gravity recovery missions to Mars11,12. Emplacement of the north polar cap of Mars is investigated by combining viscoelastic deformation calculations and observations, showing that it formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr atop a stiff lithosphere and high-viscosity mantle (1022 Pa s),&amp;nbsp;and that glacial isostatic adjustment could be further constrained.},

These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month−1 per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects&amp;nbsp;and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region. Reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation show that deforestation leads to precipitation increases in the wet season and decreases in the dry season.},

  abstract     = {Multijunction photovoltaics (PVs) are gaining prominence owing to their superior capability of achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond the radiative limit of single-junction cells1–8, for which improving narrow-bandgap (NBG) tin–lead perovskites is critical for thin-film devices9. Here, with a focus on understanding the chemistry of tin–lead perovskite precursor solutions, we find that Sn(ii) species dominate interactions with precursors and additives and uncover the exclusive role of carboxylic acid in regulating solution colloidal properties and film crystallization and ammonium in improving film optoelectronic properties. Materials that combine these two functional groups, amino acid salts, considerably improve the semiconducting quality and homogeneity of perovskite films, surpassing the effect of the individual functional groups when introduced as part of separate molecules. Our enhanced tin–lead perovskite layer allows us to fabricate solar cells with PCEs of 23.9%, 29.7% (certified 29.26%) and 28.7% for single-junction, double-junction and triple-junction devices, respectively. Our 1-cm2 triple-junction devices show PCEs of 28.4% (certified 27.28%). Encapsulated triple-junction cells maintain 80% of their initial efficiencies after 860 h maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in ambient. We further fabricate quadruple-junction devices and obtain PCEs of 27.9% with the highest open-circuit voltage of 4.94 V. This work establishes a new benchmark for multijunction PVs. Understanding the chemistry of perovskite precursor solutions enables improved film optoelectronic properties, allowing the fabrication of multijunction solar cells achieving power conversion efficiencies beyond the radiative limit of single-junction cells.},

However, the limited cooling power of existing devices (≤300 W) hampers the commercialization of this technology3,4. Here we constructed a kilowatt-scale elastocaloric cooling device using compressive tubular NiTi in an ‘SMAs in series–fluid in parallel’ architecture, referred to as the multi-cell architecture. A large specific cooling power of 12.3 W g−1 was achieved by the large surface-area-to-volume ratio of thin-walled tubular NiTi at high-frequency operation (3.5 Hz), complemented by graphene nanofluid as an efficient heat transfer agent. Furthermore, the multi-cell architecture ensures a sufficient elastocaloric mass for tight assembly while maintaining a low system fluid pressure. Our device achieves a cooling power of 1,284 W on the fluid side at zero temperature lift during the initial 500,000 cycles, demonstrating the potential of this green cooling technology for a decarbonized future5,6.

  abstract     = {Despite advancements in wearable technologies1,2, barriers remain in achieving distributed computation located persistently on the human body. Here a textile fibre computer that monolithically combines analogue sensing, digital memory, processing and communication in a mass of less than 5 g is presented. Enabled by a foldable interposer, the two-dimensional pad architectures of microdevices were mapped to three-dimensional cylindrical layouts conforming to fibre geometry. Through connection with helical copper microwires, eight microdevices were thermally drawn into a machine-washable elastic fibre capable of more than 60% stretch. This programmable fibre, which incorporates a 32-bit floating-point microcontroller, independently performs edge computing tasks even when braided, woven, knitted or seam-sewn into garments. The universality of the assembly process allows for the integration of additional functions with simple modifications, including a rechargeable fibre power source that operates the computer for nearly 6 h. Finally, we surmount the perennial limitation of rigid interconnects by implementing two wireless communication schemes involving woven optical links and seam-inserted radio-frequency communications. To demonstrate its utility, we show that garments equipped with four fibre computers, one per limb, operating individually trained neural networks achieve, on average, 67% accuracy in classifying physical activity. However, when networked, inference accuracy increases to 95% using simple weighted voting. A textile fibre computer combining sensing, memory, processing and communication in a 5-g mass has been developed, enabling distributed computation on the human body through garments.},

Artificial atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to quantum confinement3–8. As such, they offer a solid-state analogue for simulating intra-atomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation. Signatures of interatomic bond formation have been extensively observed in various artificial atoms9–17. However, direct evidence of the intra-atomic orbital hybridization in the artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms through experiments. Moreover, the results obtained inspire the progressive control of quantum states in diverse systems. Orbital hybridization in artificial atoms is achieved by altering their shape, and the anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom.},

  abstract     = {Chirality is a ubiquitous and fundamental asymmetry in nature1,2. Recently, the interaction of chiral objects with spin currents has attracted enormous attention from both scientific and technological perspectives3–5. Of particular interest is the current-driven motion of chiral topological excitations such as chiral magnetic domain walls in chiral three-dimensional magnetic structures that could allow for high-density memory-storage devices. Here we use state-of-the-art multiphoton lithography6,7 to create three-dimensional chiral magnetic ribbons and perform current-induced motion of chiral domain walls. The ribbons are designed to have a clockwise or anticlockwise chiral twist with a variable magnitude. We find that domain walls can either pass through the ribbon or are impeded, depending on their chirality and configuration and the geometrical chiral twist of the ribbon. The interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the geometrical twist generates a torsional field that favours chiral Bloch-type walls rather than the Néel-type wall favoured by the intrinsic magnetic properties of the magnetic ribbon itself. Furthermore, the interplay of spin chirality and chiral twist results in a non-reciprocal domain wall motion, namely, a domain wall filter or diode8–10. Our findings show how the interplay between geometrical and spin chiralities can lead to new functionalities that could allow for innovative chiral spintronics.

  abstract     = {Hofstadter’s butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature1. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter’s butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields1–3. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter’s butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants4–6, such as those with moiré superlattices7–10. Yet, so far, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to investigate the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the predicted second magic angle11,12, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter’s spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, showing phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter’s original model owing to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in TBG. High-resolution STM/STS visualizes the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands in moiré graphene near the predicted second magic angle, and experimentally establishes several fundamental properties of the fractal Hofstadter energy spectrum.},

However, state-of-the-art networks5–14 use only a single optically addressed qubit per node; this constrains both the quantum communication bandwidth and memory resources, greatly impeding scalability. Solid-state platforms15–24 provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking in which multiple spectrally distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities25–31. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate the bottlenecks to the&amp;nbsp;entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs32,33. Second, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols34,35. These results lay the groundwork for scalable quantum networking based on rare-earth ions.

  abstract     = {Mergers of binary neutron stars emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 (refs. 1,2) led to scientific discoveries across cosmology3, nuclear physics4–6 and gravity7. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from the GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated electromagnetic transient, AT 2017gfo (ref. 8), 11 h after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive electromagnetic observations. However, owing to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here we present a machine-learning framework that performs complete binary neutron star inference in just 1 s without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing: (1) accurate localization even before the merger; (2) improved localization precision by around 30% compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (3) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors. Analysis of gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars was accelerated using machine learning, enabling full low-latency parameter estimation and enhancing the potential for multi-messenger observations.},

  abstract     = {Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly polymorphic in the human genome, have thousands of associated molecular traits and are linked to over 60 disease phenotypes. However, they are often excluded from at-scale studies because of challenges with variant calling and representation, as well as a lack of a genome-wide standard. Here, to promote the development of TR methods, we created a catalog of TR regions and explored TR properties across 86 haplotype-resolved long-read human assemblies. We curated variants from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) HG002 individual to create a TR dataset to benchmark existing and future TR analysis methods. We also present an improved variant comparison method that handles variants greater than 4 bp in length and varying allelic representation. The 8.1% of the genome covered by the TR catalog holds ~24.9% of variants per individual, including 124,728 small and 17,988 large variants for the GIAB HG002 ‘truth-set’ TR benchmark.

  abstract     = {The construction of synthetic gene circuits in plants has been limited by a lack of orthogonal and modular parts. Here, we implement a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) interference (CRISPRi)-based reversible gene circuit platform in plants. We create a toolkit of engineered repressible promoters of different strengths and construct NOT and NOR gates in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. We determine the optimal processing system to express single guide RNAs from RNA Pol II promoters to introduce NOR gate programmability for interfacing with host regulatory sequences. The performance of a NOR gate in stably transformed Arabidopsis plants demonstrates the system’s programmability and reversibility in a complex multicellular organism. Furthermore, cross-species activity of CRISPRi-based logic gates is shown in Physcomitrium patens, Triticum aestivum and Brassica napus protoplasts. Layering multiple NOR gates together creates OR, NIMPLY and AND logic functions, highlighting the modularity of our system. Our CRISPRi circuits are orthogonal, compact, reversible, programmable and modular and provide a platform for sophisticated spatiotemporal control of gene expression in plants. Programmable and reversible CRISPRi-based genetic circuits function in a variety of plants.},

Assaying 144 clinical drugs and research compounds against 8,000 proteins resulted in more than 1 million dose–response curves that can be interactively explored online in ProteomicsDB and a custom-built Shiny App. Analysis of the collective data provided molecular explanations for known phenotypic drug effects and uncovered new aspects of the MoA of human medicines. We found that histone deacetylase inhibitors potently and strongly down-regulated the T cell receptor complex resulting in impaired human T cell activation in vitro and ex vivo. This offers a rational explanation for the efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitors in certain lymphomas and autoimmune diseases and explains their poor performance in treating solid tumors.

However, predicting whether generated proteins will fold and function remains challenging. We evaluate a set of 20 diverse computational metrics to assess the quality of enzyme sequences produced by three contrasting generative models: ancestral sequence reconstruction, a generative adversarial network and a protein language model. Focusing on two enzyme families, we expressed and purified over 500 natural and generated sequences with 70–90% identity to the most similar natural sequences to benchmark computational metrics for predicting in vitro enzyme activity. Over three rounds of experiments, we developed a computational filter that improved the rate of experimental success by 50–150%. The proposed metrics and models will drive protein engineering research by serving as a benchmark for generative protein sequence models and helping to select active variants for experimental testing. Metrics that predict the success of folding and the activity of designed protein sequences are developed and experimentally validated.},

  abstract     = {Multiplexed genetic perturbations are critical for testing functional interactions among coding or non-coding genetic elements. Compared to double-stranded DNA cutting, repressive chromatin formation using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) avoids genotoxicity and is more effective for perturbing non-coding regulatory elements in pooled assays. However, current CRISPRi pooled screening approaches are limited to targeting one to three genomic sites per cell. We engineer an Acidaminococcus Cas12a (AsCas12a) variant, multiplexed transcriptional interference AsCas12a (multiAsCas12a), that incorporates R1226A, a mutation that stabilizes the ribonucleoprotein–DNA complex via DNA nicking. The multiAsCas12a-KRAB fusion improves CRISPRi activity over DNase-dead AsCas12a-KRAB fusions, often rescuing the activities of lentivirally delivered CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) that are inactive when used with the latter. multiAsCas12a-KRAB supports CRISPRi using 6-plex crRNA arrays in high-throughput pooled screens. Using multiAsCas12a-KRAB, we discover enhancer elements and dissect the combinatorial function of cis-regulatory elements in human cells. These results instantiate a group testing framework for efficiently surveying numerous combinations of chromatin perturbations for biological discovery and engineering. An engineered Cas12a enables higher-order combinatorial functional genomic screens using CRISPR interference.},

In this study, we developed a system for bidirectional epigenetic editing, called CRISPRai, in which we apply activating (CRISPRa) and repressive (CRISPRi) perturbations to two loci simultaneously in the same cell. We developed CRISPRai Perturb-seq by coupling dual perturbation gRNA detection with single-cell RNA sequencing, enabling study of pooled perturbations in a mixed single-cell population. We applied this platform to study the genetic interaction between two hematopoietic lineage transcription factors, SPI1 and GATA1, and discovered novel characteristics of their co-regulation on downstream target genes, including differences in SPI1 and GATA1 occupancy at genes that are regulated through different modes. We also studied the regulatory landscape of IL2 (interleukin-2) in Jurkat T cells, primary T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and elucidated mechanisms of enhancer-mediated IL2 gene regulation. CRISPRai facilitates investigation of context-specific genetic interactions, provides new insights into gene regulation and will enable exploration of non-coding disease-associated variants. CRISPRai simultaneously activates and represses two genes in single cells.},

Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a promising sustainable leather alternative, on account of its material properties, low infrastructure needs and biodegradability. However, for alternative textiles like BC to be fully sustainable, alternative ways to dye textiles need to be developed alongside alternative production methods. To address this, we genetically engineer Komagataeibacter rhaeticus to create a bacterial strain that grows self-pigmenting BC. Melanin biosynthesis in the bacteria from recombinant tyrosinase expression achieves dark black coloration robust to material use. Melanated BC production can be scaled up for the construction of prototype fashion products, and we illustrate the potential of combining engineered self-pigmentation with tools from synthetic biology, through the optogenetic patterning of gene expression in cellulose-producing bacteria. With this study, we demonstrate that combining genetic engineering with current and future methods of textile biofabrication has the potential to create a new class of textiles.

Here we describe a clinically guided method to differentiate and expand IL-15-enhanced AlloCAR-NKT cells with high yield and purity. We generated AlloCAR-NKT cells targeting seven cancers and, in a multiple myeloma model, demonstrated their antitumor efficacy, expansion and persistence. The cells also selectively depleted immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenviroment and antagonized tumor immune evasion via triple targeting of CAR, TCR and NK receptors. They exhibited a stable hypoimmunogenic phenotype associated with epigenetic and signaling regulation and did not induce detectable graft versus host disease or cytokine release syndrome. These properties of AlloCAR-NKT cells support their potential for clinical translation. Off-the-shelf CAR-NKT cells for cancer immunotherapy are advanced toward clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates composed of proteins and RNA are one approach by which cells regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. Their formation typically involves the phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins with a target mRNA, sequestering the mRNA into a liquid condensate. This sequestration regulates gene expression by modulating translation or facilitating RNA processing. Here we engineer synthetic condensates using a fusion of an RNA-binding protein, the human Pumilio2 homology domain (Pum2), and a synthetic intrinsically disordered protein, an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), that can bind and sequester a target mRNA transcript. In protocells, sequestration of a target mRNA largely limits its translation. Conversely, in Escherichia coli, sequestration of the same target mRNA increases its translation. We characterize the Pum2–ELP condensate system using microscopy, biophysical and biochemical assays, and RNA sequencing. This approach enables the modulation of cell function via the formation of synthetic biomolecular condensates that regulate the expression of a target protein. Formation of biomolecular condensates composed of proteins and RNA facilitates the regulation of gene expression by modulating translation or facilitating RNA processing. Now, synthetic ribonucleoprotein granules created with engineered intrinsically disordered proteins selectively sequester mRNA and enhance protein translation in cells. These highly liquid-like condensates exchange biomolecules across the cell and facilitate target mRNA and ribosome partitioning.},

  abstract     = {Controlling reaction outcomes through external influences is a central goal in chemistry. Vibrational coupling between molecular vibrations and cavity modes is rapidly emerging as a distinct strategy compared with conventional thermochemical and photochemical methods; however, insight into the fundamental mechanisms remains limited. Here we investigate how vibrational weak and strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities modifies the thermal dehydration of copper sulfate pentahydrate. We demonstrate that light–matter coupling reduces the onset temperature for dehydration by up to 14 °C, and we attribute this effect to enhanced radiative energy transport that is mediated by resonant electromagnetic modes, eliminating temperature gradients in the coupled system. Our findings provide direct evidence of localized energy transfer leading to modified chemical behaviour in specific regions of high optical density of states. This work establishes a mechanism for modifying thermally driven chemical processes using optical cavities, with implications for the development of catalytic systems that exploit these tailored interactions to achieve targeted reaction control. Vibrational weak and strong light–matter coupling in infrared nanocavities modifies chemical processes. Now it has been shown that this coupling can control thermally driven reactions through enhanced radiative energy transport.},

  abstract     = {Protein catalysis and allostery require the atomic-level orchestration and motion of residues and ligand, solvent and protein effector molecules. However, the ability to design protein activity through precise protein–solvent cooperative interactions has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the design of 14 membrane receptors that catalyse G protein nucleotide exchange through diverse engineered allosteric pathways mediated by cooperative networks of intraprotein, protein–ligand and –solvent molecule interactions. Consistent with predictions, the designed protein activities correlated well with the level of plasticity of the networks at flexible transmembrane helical interfaces. Several designs displayed considerably enhanced thermostability and activity compared with related natural receptors. The most stable and active variant crystallized in an unforeseen signalling-active conformation, in excellent agreement with the design models. The allosteric network topologies of the best designs bear limited similarity to those of natural receptors and reveal an allosteric interaction space larger than previously inferred from natural proteins. The approach should prove useful for engineering proteins with novel complex protein binding, catalytic and signalling activities. Solvent-mediated interaction networks control a wide range of protein functions, but their design has been neglected owing to a lack of accurate computational tools. Now it is shown that allosteric signalling membrane proteins can be engineered through such networks, revealing a broader space of designable protein interactions and functions.},

This enables variability on the backbone structure, as well as diverse spatial arrangements of pillars and the partitioning of pore space into several kinds of cages packing in distinct sequences. These sequence-controlled MOFs (SC-MOF-1–6) showcase ultrahigh benzene capture capacities at low-pressure and high volumetric and gravimetric uptake performances in high-pressure methane storage. We provide the construction principles of the SC-MOFs and predict nearly 2,000 possible SC-networks with sophisticated composition sequences at the atomic level by using a Python script. The tailoring of reticular materials is key for enhancing the complexity and diversity of their structure and function.

  abstract     = {Amyloid fibrils are highly stable misfolded protein assemblies that play an important role in several neurodegenerative and systemic diseases. Although structural information of the amyloid state is now abundant, mechanistic details about the misfolding process remain elusive. Inspired by the Φ-value analysis of protein folding, we combined experiments and molecular simulations to resolve amino-acid contacts and determine the structure of the transition-state ensemble—the rate-limiting step—for fibril elongation of PI3K-SH3 amyloid fibrils. The ensemble was validated experimentally by Tanford β analysis and computationally by free energy calculations. Although protein folding proceeds on funnel-shaped landscapes, here we find that the energy landscape for the misfolding reaction consists of a large ‘golf course’ region, defined by a single energy barrier and transition state, accessing a sharply funnelled region. Thus, misfolding occurs by rare, successful monomer–fibril end collisions interspersed by numerous unsuccessful binding attempts. Taken together, these insights provide a quantitative and highly resolved description of a protein misfolding reaction. Amyloid fibrils grow through the recruitment of soluble monomer to the fibril end that propagates the fibril structure. Here the transition state, the rate-limiting conformation, of such a reaction has been characterized by Φ-value analysis. An energy landscape model has been developed and fibril growth rates predicted from first principles.},

Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are particularly noteworthy owing to their uniquely three-dimensional stereochemical complexity. 1,3-Difunctionalized BCPs have been widely used as bioisosteres for para-substituted phenyl rings, and they have been incorporated into numerous lead pharmaceutical candidates. 2-Substituted BCPs (substituted at the bridge position) can function as alternatives to ortho- or meta-substituted arene rings; however, the general and efficient construction of these scaffolds remains challenging, particularly if performed in an enantioselective manner. Here we present an approach for synthesizing enantioenriched 2-substituted BCPs by a nitrogen-atom insertion-and-deletion strategy, involving a chiral Brønsted acid-catalytic enantioselective cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with imines and nitrogen deletion of resulting aza-bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza-BCHs) with generally good enantiopurity retention. Mechanistic experiments verify the radical pathway. Chiral BCPs have been readily incorporated into medicinally relevant molecules, and a drug analogue has been successfully prepared enantioselectively. Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are widely used as bioisosteres for para-substituted phenyl rings, providing improved pharmacological profiles for drug candidates, but strategies for the preparation of chiral BCPs remain limited.

Here, through semi-rational designs, we engineered a DNA polymerase variant and used it to precisely incorporate a diverse range of modifications, including base modifications, 2′-ribose modifications and backbone modifications, into desired positions within RNA. We achieved efficiencies exceeding 85% in the majority of modification cases, demonstrating success in introducing 2′-O-methyl, phosphorothioate, N4-acetylcytidine and a fluorophore to specific sites in eGFP and Firefly luciferase messenger RNA. Our mRNA products with N4-acetylcytidine, 2′-O-methyl and/or phosphorothioate have demonstrated the ability to enhance stability and affect protein production. This method presents a promising tool for the comprehensive functionalization of RNA, enabling the introduction of plentiful modifications irrespective of RNA lengths and sequences. The demand for large, position-specific modified RNA molecules is high across diverse fields.

Through extensive 1H nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments and computational density functional theory studies, a library of chalcogen-bonding (ChB) and halogen-bonding (XB) mechanically interlocked [2]rotaxane molecules, including seminal examples of all-ChB and mixed ChB/XB [2]rotaxanes, are shown to function as either Lewis-acidic or Lewis-basic multidentate hosts for selective halide anion and metal cation binding.

The importance of charged species in numerous biological and environmental processes has stimulated the development of host molecules for their selective recognition.

  abstract     = {Understanding the hydrogenation pathway in electrochemical CO2 reduction is important for controlling product selectivity. The Eley–Rideal mechanism involving proton-coupled electron transfer directly from solvent water is often considered to be the primary hydrogen transfer route. However, in principle, hydrogenation can also occur via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism using surface-adsorbed *H. Here, by performing CO2 reduction with Cu in H2O–D2O mixtures, we present evidence that the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is probably the dominant hydrogenation route. From this, we estimate the extent to which each mechanism contributes towards the formation of six important CO2 reduction products. Through computational simulations, we find that the formation of C–H bonds and O–H bonds is governed by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanism, respectively. We also show that promoting the Eley–Rideal pathway could be crucial towards selective multicarbon product formation and suppressing hydrogen evolution. These findings introduce important considerations for the theoretical modelling of CO2 reduction pathways and electrocatalyst design. CO2 electroreduction to higher-value carbons can occur through adsorbed hydrogen or through proton-coupled electron transfer from water. Understanding the impact of each route on product selectivity is challenging. Now H/D isotopic labelling reveals the contribution of each mechanism towards product formation and shows that adsorbed hydrogen dominates the reaction.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular networks are abundantly present in nature and, like crystalline materials, often develop from an initial nucleation site, followed by growth based on directional interactions between components. Traditionally, the binding strength and directionality of interactions is thought to dictate nucleation and crystal growth, whereas structural flexibility favours defects. Usually, macromonomers present multiple binding sites with relative intramolecular flexibility, but the effects of such flexibility on regulating network formation have been given little attention. Here we introduce the concept of ‘interface flexibility’ and demonstrate its critical importance in the nucleation and growth of supramolecular networks. As a model system, we use trisymmetric DNA-based macromonomers, which organize into hexagonal networks through weak π–π interactions at their tips. The directional nature and low spatial tolerance of π–π interactions mean that small shifts in orientation have a large effect on effective valency. We show that too much interface flexibility disrupts network formation, regardless of affinity. Tuning the interface flexibility greatly expands the available design space for synthetic supramolecular materials. Supramolecular ordered networks are formed through directional interactions of uniform macromonomer building blocks. Now it has been shown that, rather than intermolecular affinity, the flexibility of the binding interface (‘interface flexibility’) dominates the mechanism of self-assembly. This study provides an intuitive understanding of the role of interface flexibility in supramolecular self-assembly.},

  abstract     = {Atomically dispersed heterogeneous catalysts offer the opportunity to design active sites with molecular precision. A recent proliferation of synthetic strategies and advanced characterization tools has propelled broad interest in leveraging these catalysts in diverse areas of chemistry beyond thermal heterogeneous catalysis, including but not limited to organic synthesis, electrochemistry, photochemistry and environmental chemistry. This Perspective aims to arm researchers in this area with the methodological framework and fundamental principles to accurately assess the degree of uniformity of heterogeneous catalyst active sites, and to link the synthesis, structure and function of atomically dispersed catalysts to one another. A paedagogical discussion of catalyst structural dynamics and active-site-specific characterization is supplemented with recent case studies that illustrate these fundamentals. This analysis shows how progress can be guided by requiring that the characterization of active sites is connected to their kinetic behaviour in the form of turnover rates and by leveraging the thermokinetic factors that control active site structures and their dynamics. Atomically dispersed heterogeneous catalysts impact diverse areas of chemistry through the design of active sites with molecular precision, but this vision is not fully realized. This Perspective presents the fundamental principles and methodological framework to guide progress in the field.},

On the basis of a high-resolution haplotype-resolved genome analysis, we inferred that sweet orange originated from a sour orange × mandarin cross and confirmed this model using artificial hybridization experiments. We identified defense-related metabolites that potently inhibited the growth of multiple industrially important pathogenic bacteria. We introduced diversity to sweet orange, which showed wide segregation in fruit flavor and disease resistance and produced canker-resistant sweet orange by selecting defense-related metabolites. Our findings elucidate the origin of sweet orange and de novo domesticated disease-resistant sweet oranges, illuminating a strategy for the rapid domestication of perennial crops.

Here we assembled and annotated haplotype-resolved genomes of 72 global Vitis accessions including 25 wild and 47 cultivated grapevines, among which genomes for 60 grapevines are newly released. Haplotype-aware phylogenomics disentangled the mysterious hybridization history of grapevines, revealing the enormous genetic diversity of the Vitis genus. Pangenomic analysis reveals that European cultivars, more susceptible to the destructive disease downy mildew (DM), have a smaller repertoire of resistance genes in the NLR family encoding the TIR-NBARC-LRR domain. Through extensive structural variation (SV) characterization, phenotyping, DM-infection transcriptome profiling of 113 Vitis accessions, and SV–expression quantitative trait loci analysis, we have identified over 63 SVs and their relevant genes significantly associated with DM resistance, exemplified by a lysine histidine transporter, VvLHT8. This haplotype-resolved super pangenome of the Vitis genus will accelerate breeding and enrich our understanding of the evolution and biology of grapevines. Super pangenome of the Vitis genus assembled from haplotype-resolved genomes of 72 global Vitis accessions characterizes the landscape of structural variants (SVs) and identifies SV–expression quantitative trait loci for downy mildew resistance.},

  abstract     = {Plant adaptation to terrestrial life started 450 million years ago and has played a major role in the evolution of life on Earth. The genetic mechanisms allowing this adaptation to a diversity of terrestrial constraints have been mostly studied by focusing on flowering plants. Here, we gathered a collection of 133 accessions of the model bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha and studied its intraspecific diversity using selection signature analyses, a genome–environment association study and a pangenome. We identified adaptive features, such as peroxidases or nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeats (NLRs), also observed in flowering plants, likely inherited from the first land plants. The M. polymorpha pangenome also harbors lineage-specific accessory genes absent from seed plants. We conclude that different land plant lineages still share many elements from the genetic toolkit evolved by their most recent common ancestor to adapt to the terrestrial habitat, refined by lineage-specific polymorphisms and gene family evolution. Pangenome analyses of 133 wild accessions of the model bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha identify adaptive features and provide insights into the mechanisms of plant adaptation to the terrestrial environment.},

Massively parallel reporter assays of 4,041 SNVs linked to 13 neoplasms comprising &amp;gt;90% of human malignancies were performed in pertinent primary human cell types and then integrated with matching chromatin accessibility, DNA looping and expression quantitative trait loci data to nominate 380 potentially regulatory SNVs and their putative target genes. The latter highlighted specific protein networks in lifetime cancer risk, including mitochondrial translation, DNA damage repair and Rho GTPase activity. A CRISPR knockout screen demonstrated that a subset of germline putative risk genes also enables the growth of established cancers. Editing one SNV, rs10411210 , showed that its risk allele increases rhophilin RHPN2 expression and stimulus-responsive RhoA activation, indicating that individual SNVs may upregulate cancer-linked pathways. These functional data are a resource for variant prioritization efforts and further interrogation of the mechanisms underlying inherited risk for cancer.

We developed a framework to count cell divisions with DNA replication-related mutations in polyguanine homopolymers. Analyzing 505 samples from 37 patients, we studied the milestones of colorectal cancer evolution. Primary tumors diversify at ~250 divisions from the founder cell, while distant metastasis divergence occurs significantly later, at ~500 divisions. Notably, distant but not lymph node metastases originate from primary tumor regions that have undergone surplus divisions, tying subclonal expansion to metastatic capacity. Then, we analyzed a cohort of 73 multifocal lung cancers and showed that the cell division burden of the tumors’ common ancestor distinguishes independent primary tumors from intrapulmonary metastases and correlates with patient survival. In lung cancer too, metastatic capacity is tied to more extensive proliferation. The cell division history of human cancers is easily accessible using our simple framework and contains valuable biological and clinical information. This work presents a framework for estimating cell division numbers using DNA replication-associated polyguanine tract mutations, with applications for understanding tumor natural histories and origins.},

We present immune lymphocyte estimation from nucleotide sequencing (ImmuneLENS), which estimates T cell and B cell fractions, class switching and clonotype diversity from whole-genome sequencing data at depths as low as 5× coverage. By applying ImmuneLENS to the 100,000 Genomes Project, we identify genes enriched with somatic mutations in T cell-rich tumors, significant sex-based differences in circulating T cell fraction and demonstrated that the circulating T cell fraction in patients with cancer is significantly lower than in healthy individuals. Low circulating B cell fraction was linked to increased cancer incidence. Finally, circulating T cell abundance was more prognostic of 5-year cancer survival than infiltrating T cells. Immune lymphocyte estimation from nucleotide sequencing (ImmuneLENS) infers B cell and T cell fractions from whole-genome sequencing data. Applied to the 100,000 Genomes Project datasets, circulating T cell fraction provides sex-dependent and prognostic insights in patients.},

  abstract     = {Tumors undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the energetic, synthetic and redox demands essential for malignancy, often characterized by increased glycolysis and lactate production. However, the role of mitochondrial metabolism in tumor immunity remains unclear. The present study integrates spatial transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics and proteomics, revealing a strong link between the metabolite succinyl-CoA and tumor immunity as well as the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy in patients with melanoma. Elevated succinyl-CoA levels, through α-ketoglutarate or succinate supplementation, enhanced T cell-mediated tumor elimination, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, succinylation of the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) at lysine 129 led to its degradation. Increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), identified as a succinyltransferase for PD-L1, boosted anti-tumor activity. Preclinically, bezafibrate, a hyperlipidemia drug, upregulated CPT1A and synergized with CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody to inhibit tumor growth. Clinically, higher PD-L1 and lower CPT1A levels in tumors correlated with better anti-PD-1 therapy responses, suggesting potential biomarkers for prediction of treatment efficacy. Succinylation of PD-L1 by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) in melanoma leads to its degradation and enhanced T cell-dependent killing in vitro. Increasing CPT1A levels synergizes with anti-CTLA-4 treatment to suppress tumor growth in a mouse melanoma model.},

  abstract     = {Cell fate plasticity enables development, yet unlocked plasticity is a cancer hallmark. While transcription master regulators induce lineage-specific genes to restrict plasticity, it remains unclear whether plasticity is actively suppressed by lineage-specific repressors. Here we computationally predict so-called safeguard repressors for 18 cell types that block phenotypic plasticity lifelong. We validated hepatocyte-specific candidates using reprogramming, revealing that prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1) enhanced hepatocyte identity by direct repression of alternative fate master regulators. In mice, Prox1 was required for efficient hepatocyte regeneration after injury and was sufficient to prevent liver tumorigenesis. In line with patient data, Prox1 depletion caused hepatocyte fate loss in vivo and enabled the transition of hepatocellular carcinoma to cholangiocarcinoma. Conversely, overexpression promoted cholangiocarcinoma to hepatocellular carcinoma transdifferentiation. Our findings provide evidence for PROX1 as a hepatocyte-specific safeguard and support a model where cell-type-specific repressors actively suppress plasticity throughout life to safeguard lineage identity and thus prevent disease. This study identifies candidate safeguard repressor transcription factors that repress alternate lineages in mature cell types and provides functional evidence that Prox1 performs such a function in hepatocytes during reprogramming, regeneration and in cancer.},

Current data analysis approaches divide the constituent cells into clusters meant to represent cell types, but such discrete categorization tends to be an unsatisfactory model of the underlying biology. Here, we introduce latent embedding multivariate regression (LEMUR), a model that operates without, or before, commitment to discrete categorization. LEMUR (1) integrates data from different conditions, (2) predicts each cell’s gene expression changes as a function of the conditions and its position in latent space and (3) for each gene, identifies a compact neighborhood of cells with consistent differential expression. We apply LEMUR to cancer, zebrafish development and spatial gradients in Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating its broad applicability. Latent embedding multivariate regression models multi-condition single-cell RNA-seq using a continuous latent space, enabling data integration, per-cell gene expression prediction and clustering-free differential expression analysis.},

Through complementary cell-based and innovative cell-agnostic analyses, we characterized the localization of PF-emergent cell types, established the cellular and molecular basis of classical PF histopathologic features and identified a diversity of distinct molecularly defined spatial niches in control and PF lungs. Using machine learning and trajectory analysis to segment and rank airspaces on a gradient of remodeling severity, we identified compositional and molecular changes associated with progressive distal lung pathology, beginning with alveolar epithelial dysregulation and culminating with changes in macrophage polarization.

Notably, the levels of 70% of these were associated with at least one of the aforementioned factors, with protein levels also being predictive. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regulated at least one-third of the proteins; between a few percent and up to 30-fold. Together with excellent replication in an additional 1,000 children and 558 adults, this reveals substantial genetic effects on plasma protein levels, persisting from childhood into adulthood. Through Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses, we identified 41 causal genes for 33 cardiometabolic traits, emphasizing the value of protein QTLs in drug target identification and disease understanding.

To begin addressing these challenges, we performed a cis association analysis using whole-genome sequencing data, consisting of 1.1 billion variants, 123 million noncoding aggregate-based tests and 2,907 circulating protein levels in ~50,000 UK Biobank participants. We identified 604 independent rare noncoding single-variant associations with circulating protein levels. Unlike protein-coding variation, rare noncoding genetic variation was almost as likely to increase or decrease protein levels. Rare noncoding aggregate testing identified 357 conditionally independent associated regions. Of these, 74 (21%) were not detectable by single-variant testing alone. Our findings have important implications for the identification, and role, of rare noncoding genetic variation associated with common human phenotypes, including the importance of testing aggregates of noncoding variants. Rare variant association analysis of plasma proteins using whole-genome sequencing data in 54,306 individuals in the UK Biobank demonstrates that combining both single-variant and aggregate testing will be needed for noncoding variant analysis.},

  abstract     = {Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, have been genetically implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Mapping the genetics of gene expression in human microglia has identified several loci associated with disease-associated genetic variants in microglia-specific regulatory elements. However, identifying genetic effects on splicing is challenging because of the use of short sequencing reads. Here, we present the isoform-centric microglia genomic atlas (isoMiGA), which leverages long-read RNA sequencing to identify 35,879 novel microglia isoforms. We show that these isoforms are involved in stimulation response and brain region specificity. We then quantified the expression of both known and novel isoforms in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 555 human microglia short-read RNA sequencing samples from 391 donors, and found associations with genetic risk loci in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. We nominate several loci that may act through complex changes in isoform and splice-site usage. This isoform-centric microglia genomic atlas includes 35,879 novel human microglia isoforms identified by long-read RNA sequencing. A multi-ancestry quantitative trait locus meta-analysis of known and novel isoforms in 555 samples from 391 donors finds associations with genetic risk loci in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.},

  abstract     = {Human brain development spans from embryogenesis to adulthood, with dynamic gene expression controlled by cell-type-specific cis-regulatory element activity and three-dimensional genome organization. To advance our understanding of postnatal brain development, we simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 101,924 single nuclei from four brain regions across ten donors, covering five key postnatal stages from infancy to late adulthood. Using this dataset and chromosome conformation capture data, we constructed enhancer-based gene regulatory networks to identify cell-type-specific regulators of brain development and interpret genome-wide association study loci for ten main brain disorders. Our analysis connected 2,318 cell-specific loci to 1,149 unique genes, representing 41% of loci linked to the investigated traits, and highlighted 55 genes influencing several disease phenotypes. Pseudotime analysis revealed distinct stages of postnatal oligodendrogenesis and their regulatory programs. These findings provide a comprehensive dataset of cell-type-specific gene regulation at critical timepoints in postnatal brain development. Simultaneous profiling of RNA and chromatin accessibility in single nuclei isolated from human postnatal brain regions from infancy to late adulthood identifies key cellular regulators and nominates target genes and mechanisms for brain-related diseases and disorders.},

  abstract     = {Differences in the patterning of genetic sharing between groups of individuals may arise from biological pathways, social mechanisms, phenotyping and ascertainment. We expand genomic structural equation modeling to allow for testing genomic structural invariance (GSI), that is, the formal comparison of multivariate genetic architecture across groups. We apply GSI to compare the autosomal multivariate genetic architecture of eight psychiatric disorders spanning three factors (psychotic, neurodevelopmental and internalizing) between cisgender males and females. We find that the genetic factor structure is largely similar across sex, permitting meaningful comparisons of associations at the level of the factors. However, in females, problematic alcohol use and posttraumatic stress disorder loaded more strongly on the internalizing factor, while the neurodevelopmental disorder factor exhibited weaker genetic correlations with the other factors. Four phenotypes (educational attainment, insomnia, smoking and deprivation) showed significant, albeit small, sex-differentiated associations with the psychotic factor. As genome-wide association study samples grow and diversify, GSI will become increasingly valuable for comparing multivariate genetic architecture across groups. Genomic structural invariance, an extension of genomic structural equation modeling, identifies similarities and differences between males and females in the genetic architectures of eight psychiatric disorders spanning three broad factors.},

Here, we compared CH in 136,401 participants from the Mexico City Prospective Study (MCPS) to 416,118 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) and observed CH to be significantly less common in MCPS compared to UKB (adjusted odds ratio = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.57, 0.61], P = 7.31 × 10−185). Among MCPS participants, CH frequency was positively correlated with the percentage of European ancestry (adjusted beta = 0.84, 95% CI = [0.66, 1.03], P = 7.35 × 10−19). Genome-wide and exome-wide association analyses in MCPS identified ancestry-specific variants in the TCL1B locus with opposing effects on DNMT3A-CH versus non-DNMT3A-CH. Meta-analysis of MCPS and UKB identified five novel loci associated with CH, including polymorphisms at PARP11/CCND2, MEIS1 and MYCN. Our CH study, the largest in a non-European population to date, demonstrates the power of cross-ancestry comparisons to derive novel insights into CH pathogenesis. This paper compares the frequency and genetic basis of clonal hematopoiesis in 136,401 admixed American participants from the Mexico City Prospective Cohort with 416,118 largely European ancestry individuals from the UK Biobank cohort.},

  abstract     = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with pathogenic variants found in about a third of cases. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes to HCM risk. Here we derive polygenic scores (PGS) from HCM GWAS and genetically correlated traits and test their performance in the UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, and clinical cohorts. We show that higher PGS significantly increases the risk of HCM in the general population, particularly among pathogenic variant carriers, where HCM penetrance differs 10-fold between those in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. Among relatives of HCM probands, PGS stratifies risks of developing HCM and adverse outcomes. Finally, among HCM cases, PGS strongly predicts the risk of adverse outcomes and death. These findings support the broad utility of PGS across clinical settings, enabling tailored screening and surveillance and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes. Polygenic scores derived from genome-wide association analyses of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and genetically correlated left ventricular traits effectively stratify risk of disease and adverse outcomes in the general population and across clinical cohorts.},

  abstract     = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent and morbid abnormality of the heart rhythm with a strong genetic component. Here, we meta-analyzed genome and exome sequencing data from 36 studies that included 52,416 AF cases and 277,762 controls. In burden tests of rare coding variation, we identified novel associations between AF and the genes MYBPC3, LMNA, PKP2, FAM189A2 and KDM5B. We further identified associations between AF and rare structural variants owing to deletions in CTNNA3 and duplications of GATA4. We broadly replicated our findings in independent samples from MyCode, deCODE and UK Biobank. Finally, we found that CRISPR knockout of KDM5B in stem-cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes led to a shortening of the action potential duration and widespread transcriptomic dysregulation of genes relevant to atrial homeostasis and conduction. Our results highlight the contribution of rare coding and structural variants to AF, including genetic links between AF and cardiomyopathies, and expand our understanding of the rare variant architecture for this common arrhythmia. Analyses of genome and exome sequencing data identify rare coding and structural variants associated with atrial fibrillation and highlight genetic links between atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathies.},

We identified candidate genes related to muscle contractility, cardiac muscle development and cell–cell communication at 139 loci. Furthermore, we assayed chromatin accessibility using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation in stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes. We observed a marked increase in chromatin accessibility for our sentinel variants and prioritized genes in atrial cardiomyocytes. Finally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on our updated effect estimates improved AF risk prediction compared to the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score and a previously reported PRS for AF. The doubling of known risk loci will facilitate a greater understanding of the pathways underlying AF. Genome-wide association meta-analyses identify more than 350 loci associated with atrial fibrillation.

  abstract     = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality with both monogenic and polygenic components. Here, we report results from a large genome-wide association study and multitrait analysis including 5,900 HCM cases, 68,359 controls and 36,083 UK Biobank participants with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We identified 70 loci (50 novel) associated with HCM and 62 loci (20 novel) associated with relevant left ventricular traits. Among the prioritized genes in the HCM loci, we identify a novel HCM disease gene, SVIL, which encodes the actin-binding protein supervillin, showing that rare truncating SVIL variants confer a roughly tenfold increased risk of HCM. Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role of increased left ventricular contractility in both obstructive and nonobstructive forms of HCM, suggesting common disease mechanisms and anticipating shared response to therapy. Taken together, these findings increase our understanding of the genetic basis of HCM, with potential implications for disease management. Genome-wide and multitrait analyses identify novel loci associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and relevant left ventricular traits. Gene-level burden analyses show that rare truncating SVIL variants are associated with high risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.},

  abstract     = {To maintain cell fitness, deleterious genetic alterations are buffered by compensatory changes in additional genes. In cancer, buffering processes could be targeted by synthetic lethality. However, despite the large-scale identification of synthetic lethal effects in preclinical models, evidence that these operate clinically is limited. This impedes the application of synthetic lethal approaches. By integrating molecular profiling data from &amp;gt;9,000 cancers with synthetic lethal screens, we show that transcriptomic buffering of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) loss by hyperexpression of synthetic lethal partners is a common phenomenon, extending to multiple TSGs and histotypes. Transcriptomic buffering is also notable in cancers that phenocopy TSG loss, such as BRCAness cancers, where expression of BRCA1/2 synthetic lethal genes correlates with clinical outcome. Synthetic lethal genes that exhibit transcriptomic buffering also represent more robust synthetic lethal effects. These observations have implications for understanding how tumor cells tolerate TSG loss, in part explain transcriptomic architectures in cancer and provide insight into target selection. Tumor cells upregulate compensatory buffering genes following tumor suppressor loss. These genes may represent new synthetic lethal partners that could be harnessed therapeutically.},

  abstract     = {Cancer predisposition syndromes mediated by recessive cancer genes generate tumors via somatic variants (second hits) in the unaffected allele. Second hits may or may not be sufficient for neoplastic transformation. Here we performed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing on 479 tissue biopsies from a child with neurofibromatosis type 1, a multisystem cancer-predisposing syndrome mediated by constitutive monoallelic NF1 inactivation. We identified multiple independent NF1 driver variants in histologically normal tissues, but not in 610 biopsies from two nonpredisposed children. We corroborated this finding using targeted duplex sequencing, including a further nine adults with the same syndrome. Overall, truncating NF1 mutations were under positive selection in normal tissues from individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1. We demonstrate that normal tissues in neurofibromatosis type 1 commonly harbor second hits in NF1, the extent and pattern of which may underpin the syndrome’s cancer phenotype. Histologically normal tissues of individuals with a germline NF1 mutation exhibited multiple second NF1 hits, unrelated to their tumors, that conferred a selective advantage.},

These genetic hallmarks present a unique, yet vastly untapped resource for genomic research on Mendelian diseases. Despite this immense potential, the GME continues to face substantial challenges in comprehensive data collection and analysis. This Perspective highlights the region’s unique position as a natural laboratory for genetic discovery and explores the challenges that have stifled progress thus far. Importantly, we propose strategic solutions, advocating for an all-inclusive research approach. With targeted investment and focused efforts, the latent genetic wealth in the GME can be transformed into a global hub for genomic research that will redefine and advance our understanding of the human genome. The Greater Middle East is home to a rich genetic diversity that remains largely untapped in genomic research.

Here we provide in vivo evidence showing that endogenous electric fields drive the directed collective cell migration of an embryonic stem cell population—the cephalic neural crest of Xenopus laevis. We demonstrate that the voltage-sensitive phosphatase 1 is a key component of the molecular mechanism, enabling neural crest cells to specifically transduce electric fields into a directional cue in vivo. Finally, we propose that endogenous electric fields are mechanically established by the convergent extension movements of the ectoderm, which generate a membrane tension gradient that opens stretch-activated ion channels. Overall, these findings establish a role for electrotaxis in tissue morphogenesis, highlighting the functions of endogenous bioelectrical stimuli in non-neural contexts. Electric fields guide collective cell migration in developing embryos of Xenopus laevis via a voltage-sensitive phosphatase.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between the microscopic structure and topology of a material and its macroscopic properties is a fundamental challenge across a wide range of systems. Here we investigate the viscoelasticity of DNA nanostar hydrogels—a model system for physical networks with limited valence—by coupling rheology measurements, confocal imaging and molecular dynamics simulations. We discover that these networks display a large degree of interpenetration and that loops within the network are topologically linked, forming a percolating network-within-network structure. Below the overlapping concentration, the fraction of branching points and the pore size determine the high-frequency elasticity of these physical gels. At higher concentrations, we discover that this elastic response is dictated by the abundance of topological links between looped motifs in the gel. Our findings highlight the emergence of ‘topological elasticity’ as a previously overlooked mechanism in generic network-forming liquids and gels and inform the design of topologically controllable material behaviours. Experiments and simulations of DNA nanostar hydrogels reveal that microscopic topology determines macroscale elasticity in amorphous networks.},

  abstract     = {Printing of large-area solar panels necessitates advanced organic solar cells with thick active layers. However, increasing the active layer thickness typically leads to a marked drop in the power conversion efficiency. Here we developed an organic semiconductor regulator, called AT-β2O, to tune the crystallization sequence of the components in active layers. When adding AT-β2O in the donor (D18-Cl) and acceptor (N3) blend, N3 crystallizes behind D18-Cl, and this phenomenon is different from the co-crystallization observed in binary D18-Cl:N3 blends. This manipulation of crystallization dynamics is favourable to form bulk-heterojunction-gradient vertical phase separation in the active layer accompanied by the high crystallinity of the acceptor and balanced charge carrier mobilities in thick films. The resultant single-junction organic solar cells exhibited a certified power conversion efficiency of over 20%, as well as demonstrated exceptional adaptability across the active layer thicknesses (100–400 nm) and remarkable universality. Such breakthroughs enable large-area modules with a certified power conversion efficiency of 18.04%. An organic regulator that can tune the crystallization sequence of active layer components has been described, achieving a certified efficiency of over 20% in single-junction organic solar cells, demonstrating remarkable tolerance for active layer thickness of 100–400 nm.},

  abstract     = {The rational design of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with both high crystallinity and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is of crucial importance for achieving high-efficiency and low-energy-loss organic solar cells (OSCs). However, increasing the crystallinity of an NFA tends to decrease its PLQY, which results in a high non-radiative energy loss in OSCs. Here we demonstrate that the crystallinity and PLQY of NFAs can be fine-tuned by asymmetrically adapting the branching position of alkyl chains on the thiophene unit of the L8-BO acceptor. It was found that L8-BO-C4, with 2-butyloctyl on one side and 4-butyldecyl on the other side, can simultaneously achieve high crystallinity and PLQY. A high efficiency of 20.42% (certified as 20.1%) with an open-circuit voltage of 0.894 V and a fill factor of 81.6% is achieved for the single-junction OSC. This work reveals how important the strategy of shifting the alkyl chain branching position is in developing high-performance NFAs for efficient OSCs. Design strategies for non-fullerene acceptors are important for achieving high-efficiency organic solar cells. Here the authors design asymmetrically branched alkyl chains on the thiophene unit of the L8-BO acceptor to achieve high crystallinity and photoluminescence quantum yield, yielding over 20% efficiency in single-junction organic solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Precious metals such as Pt are favoured as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their excellent catalytic activity. However, the scarcity and high cost of precious metals have prompted researchers to explore cheaper alternatives such as Cu. Nevertheless, Cu shows poor catalytic performance due to weak binding with intermediates. Here the catalytic activity of pure Cu is activated via electroreduction-driven modification of the local structure, achieving a HER catalytic performance superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts for working current densities greater than 100 mA cm−2 in acid electrolyte. Activation involved two steps. First, polycrystalline Cu2O nanoparticles were prepared via pulsed laser ablation, resulting in grain boundaries within the Cu2O particles as observed using electron microscopy. Next, the Cu2O particles were electroreduced to pure Cu, inducing the formation of distorted nanotwins and edge dislocations. These local structures induce high lattice strain and decrease the Cu coordination number, enhancing the interaction between Cu and intermediates—as calculated using density functional theory—leading to the excellent catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst. Our observations show that low-cost pure Cu can be a promising HER catalyst for large-scale industrial applications. Low-cost Cu catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can transform industrial water electrolysis, but pure Cu typically exhibits a negligible HER. Here, combining pulsed laser ablation and subsequent electroreduction, Cu nanotwins form that enable the HER at an overpotential of 301 mV, with 125 h of stable operation at a current density of 500 mA cm−2.},

  abstract     = {All-solid-state lithium metal batteries promise high levels of safety and energy density, but their practical realization is limited by low Li reversibility, limited cell loading and demand for high-temperature and high-pressure operation, stemming from solid-state electrolyte (SSE) low-voltage reduction and high-voltage decomposition, and from lithium dendrite growth. Here we concurrently address these challenges by reporting that a family of reductive electrophiles gain electrons and cations from metal–nucleophile materials (here a Li sulfide SSE) upon contact to undergo electrochemical reduction and form interphase layers (named solid reductive-electrophile interphase) on material surfaces. The solid reductive-electrophile interphase is electron blocking and lithiophobic, prevents SSE reduction, suppresses Li dendrites and supports high-voltage cathodes. Consequently, a reductive-electrophile-treated SSE exhibits high critical capacity and Li reversibility at the anode, and enables Li(1% Mg)/SSE/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 all-solid-state lithium metal batteries to achieve a high coulombic efficiency (&amp;gt;99.9%), long cycle life (~10,000 h) and high loading (&amp;gt;7 mAh cm−2) at 30 °C and 2.5 MPa. This concept also extends to cathodes of other materials (for example, metal oxides), boosting the high-nickel cathode’s cycle life and expanding the operational voltage up to 4.5 V. Such solid reductive-electrophile interphase tailoring of material surfaces holds promise to accelerate all-solid-state lithium metal battery commercialization and offer solutions for a wide range of materials. Solid-state electrolyte reduction and Li dendrite growth limit the stability of all-solid-state Li metal batteries. Here the authors show that reductive electrophiles gain electrons and metal cations from metal–nucleophile materials on contact, allowing the electrochemical formation of a dense, electron-blocking film that improves the stability of both the anode and high-voltage cathode.},

Yet, visualizing spin-wave dynamics at nanoscale and microwave frequencies remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of spin-sensitive, time-resolved microscopy. Here we report a breakthrough in imaging dipole-exchange spin waves in a ferromagnetic film owing to the development of laser-free ultrafast Lorentz electron microscopy, which is equipped with a microwave-mediated electron pulser for high spatiotemporal resolution. Using topological spin textures, we captured the emission, propagation, reflection and interference of spin waves from spin anti-vortices under radio-frequency excitations. Remarkably, we show that spin-wave generation is closely tied to the oscillatory motion of specific magnetic domain walls, providing the missing link between wave emission and wall dynamics near magnetic singularities. This work opens new possibilities in magnonics, offering a nanoscopic view of spin dynamics via transmission electron microscopy and enabling controlled excitation via radio-frequency fields for exploring non-equilibrium states in magnetic and multiferroic systems.

However, unlike the remote epitaxial growth of three-dimensional bulk crystals, the growth of two-dimensional material heterostructures across atomic layers has been limited due to the weak vdW interaction. Here we report the double-sided epitaxy of vdW layered materials through atomic membranes. We grow vdW topological insulators Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 by molecular-beam epitaxy on both surfaces of atomically thin graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, which serve as suspended two-dimensional vdW substrate layers. Both homo- and hetero-double-sided vdW topological insulator tunnel junctions are fabricated, with the atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride acting as a crystal-momentum-conserving tunnelling barrier with abrupt and epitaxial interfaces. By performing field-angle-dependent magneto-tunnelling spectroscopy on these devices, we reveal the energy–momentum–spin resonance of massless Dirac electrons tunnelling between helical Landau levels developed in the topological surface states at the interfaces. Double-sided epitaxy of van der Waals materials through atomic membranes is demonstrated, enabling electrons to resonantly tunnel between aligned topological insulator surfaces with the conservation of energy, momentum and spin helicity.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals magnets has greatly expanded our ability to create and control nanoscale quantum phases. A unique capability emerges when a two-dimensional magnet is also a semiconductor that features tightly bound excitons with large oscillator strengths that fundamentally determine the optical response and are tunable with magnetic fields. Here we report a previously unidentified type of optical excitation—a magnetic surface exciton—enabled by the antiferromagnetic spin correlations that confine excitons to the surface of CrSBr. Magnetic surface excitons exhibit stronger Coulomb attraction, leading to a higher binding energy than excitons confined in bulk layers, and profoundly alter the optical response of few-layer crystals. Distinct magnetic confinement of surface and bulk excitons is established by layer- and temperature-dependent exciton reflection spectroscopy and corroborated by ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations. By quenching interlayer excitonic interactions, the antiferromagnetic order of CrSBr strictly confines the bound electron–hole pairs within the same layer, regardless of the total number of layers. Our work unveils unique confined excitons in a layered antiferromagnet, highlighting magnetic interactions as a vital approach for nanoscale quantum confinement, from few layers to the bulk limit. The emergence of magnetically confined surface excitons enabled by antiferromagnetic spin correlations is reported, which leads to the confinement of excitons to the surface of layered antiferromagnet CrSBr.},

  abstract     = {Many surprising properties of quantum materials result from Coulomb correlations defining electronic quasiparticles and their interaction chains. In van der Waals layered crystals, enhanced correlations have been tailored in reduced dimensions, enabling excitons with giant binding energies and emergent phases including ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and multiferroic orders. Yet, correlation design has primarily relied on structural engineering. Here we present quantitative experiment–theory proof that excitonic correlations can be switched through magnetic order. By probing internal Rydberg-like transitions of excitons in the magnetic semiconductor CrSBr, we reveal their binding energy and a dramatic anisotropy of their quasi-one-dimensional orbitals manifesting in strong fine-structure splitting. We switch the internal structure from strongly bound, monolayer-localized states to weakly bound, interlayer-delocalized states by pushing the system from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phases. Our analysis connects this transition to the exciton’s spin-controlled effective quantum confinement, supported by the exciton’s dynamics. In future applications, excitons or even condensates may be interfaced with spintronics; extrinsically switchable Coulomb correlations could shape phase transitions on demand. The antiferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition in a two-dimensional semiconducting magnet, CrSBr, induces an exciton confinement transition from a strongly bound quasi-one-dimensional state to a weakly bound interlayer-delocalized state.},

  abstract     = {Creating chirality in achiral graphene and other two-dimensional materials has attracted broad scientific interest due to their potential application in advanced optics, electronics and spintronics. However, investigations into their optical activities and related chiro-electronic properties are constrained by experimental challenges, particularly in the precise control over the chirality of these materials. Here a universal wax-aided immersion method is developed to yield graphene rolls with controllable chiral angles, and the method can be generalized in other two-dimensional materials for high-yield fabrication. The left-handed and right-handed rolls exhibit optical activity and excellent spin selectivity effects with a spin polarization over 90% at room temperature. The discovery of tunable chirality-induced spin selectivity in tailored roll-shaped allotropes, achievable only through precise control of chirality, distinguishes itself from other carbon materials or existing chiral materials. Our Dirac fermion model shows that the electrons moving predominately along one side of the chiral roll develop a preferred spin polarization, and the rolling-chirality-induced spin selectivity is a result of this finite spin selectivity effect. Our method opens up opportunities for endowing achiral two-dimensional materials with tunable chirality, and may enable the emergence of quantum behaviours and room-temperature spintronic technologies. A wax-aided immersion methodology is developed to yield graphene rolls with tunable chiral angles; these graphene rolls exhibit promising chiral electronic properties beyond those of other carbon allotropes.},

Here we exploit a controllable current-driven phase transition and utilize in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy to visualize dynamic atomic rearrangements during the 2H-α to 2H-β transition in layered In2Se3. We identify a unique intralayer-splitting (unzipping) and interlayer-reconstruction (zipping) pathway, driven by an energy-cascading mechanism through which bond formation across the van der Waals gap facilitates bond cleavage in the covalent layers. We also observe current-direction-dependent asymmetric phase-transition propagation and attribute it to a temperature profile induced by the Peltier effect at the heterophase interface. These findings provide insights that are essential for designing tailored structural phase transitions in advanced technologies. Current-driven dynamic atomic rearrangements in layered In2Se3 are visualized. The authors identify an intralayer ‘unzipping’ and interlayer ‘zipping’ phase-transition pathway in which bond formation across the van der Waals gaps drives bond cleavage within covalent layers.},

  abstract     = {Deformation twinning, a phenomenon primarily documented within metallic systems, has remained essentially unexplored in covalent materials due to the formidable challenges posed by their inherent extreme hardness and brittleness. Here, by employing a five-degree-of-freedom nano-manipulation stage inside a transmission electron microscope, we reveal a loading-specific twinning criterion for cubic boron nitride and successfully activate extensive deformation twinning with substantial improvements in mechanical properties in &amp;lt;100&amp;gt;-oriented cubic boron nitride submicrometre pillars at room temperature. Beyond cubic boron nitride, this criterion is also proven widely applicable across a spectrum of covalent materials. Investigations on the twinning dynamics at the atomic level in cubic boron nitride suggest a continuous-transition-mediated pathway. These findings substantially advance our comprehension of twinning mechanisms in covalent face-centred cubic materials, and herald a promising avenue for microstructural engineering aimed at enhancing the strength and toughness of these materials in their applications. Deformation twinning, a key deformation mechanism that is rarely explored in superhard materials, is shown to be activated in cubic boron nitride and other cubic covalent materials under a loading-specific twinning criterion.},

  abstract     = {Elasticity is ubiquitous and produces a spontaneously reversible response to applied stress1. Despite the utility and importance of this property in regard to scientific and engineering applications, the atomic-scale location of the force that returns an object to its original shape remains elusive in molecular crystals. Here we use a series of density functional theory calculations to locate precisely where the energy is stored when single crystals of three molecular materials are placed under elastic stress. We show for each material that different intermolecular interactions are responsible for the restoring force under both expansive and compressive strain. These findings provide insight into the elastic behaviour of crystalline materials that is needed for more efficient design of flexible technologies and future smart devices. Elasticity is ubiquitous in everyday life, but the molecular origin of the restoring force remains elusive. Here the authors use a series of density functional theory calculations to understand how interaction energies change as a result of the bending of molecular crystals.},

  abstract     = {Molecules are the building blocks of all of nature’s functional components, serving as the machinery that captures, stores and releases energy or converts it into useful work. However, molecules interact with each other over extremely short distances, which hinders the spread of energy across molecular systems. Conversely, photons are inert, but they are fast and can traverse large distances very efficiently. Using optical resonators, these distinct entities can be mixed with each other, opening a path to new architectures that benefit from both the active nature of molecules and the long-range transport obtained by the coupling with light. In this Review, we present the physics underlying the enhancement of energy transfer and energy transport in molecular systems, and highlight the experimental and theoretical advances in this field over the past decade. Finally, we identify several key questions and theoretical challenges that remain to be resolved via future research. The authors discuss the physics underlying the enhancement of energy transfer and energy transport in molecular systems and identify key questions and theoretical challenges for future research.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge of the modern genomics era is developing empirical data-driven representations of gene function. Here we present the first unbiased morphology-based genome-wide perturbation atlas in human cells, containing three genome-wide genotype–phenotype maps comprising CRISPR–Cas9-based knockouts of &amp;gt;20,000 genes in &amp;gt;30 million cells. Our optical pooled cell profiling platform (PERISCOPE) combines a destainable high-dimensional phenotyping panel (based on Cell Painting) with optical sequencing of molecular barcodes and a scalable open-source analysis pipeline to facilitate massively parallel screening of pooled perturbation libraries. This perturbation atlas comprises high-dimensional phenotypic profiles of individual cells with sufficient resolution to cluster thousands of human genes, reconstruct known pathways and protein–protein interaction networks, interrogate subcellular processes and identify culture media-specific responses. Using this atlas, we identify the poorly characterized disease-associated TMEM251/LYSET as a Golgi-resident transmembrane protein essential for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. In sum, this perturbation atlas and screening platform represents a rich and accessible resource for connecting genes to cellular functions at scale. An optical pooled cell profiling platform (PERISCOPE) based on Cell Painting and optical sequencing of molecular barcodes was used to develop the first unbiased genome-wide morphology-based perturbation atlas in human cells.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of neuron populations commonly evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. Thus, we need methods that learn the dynamical processes over neural manifolds to infer interpretable and consistent latent representations. We introduce a representation learning method, MARBLE, which decomposes on-manifold dynamics into local flow fields and maps them into a common latent space using unsupervised geometric deep learning. In simulated nonlinear dynamical systems, recurrent neural networks and experimental single-neuron recordings from primates and rodents, we discover emergent low-dimensional latent representations that parametrize high-dimensional neural dynamics during gain modulation, decision-making and changes in the internal state. These representations are consistent across neural networks and animals, enabling the robust comparison of cognitive computations. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art within- and across-animal decoding accuracy of MARBLE compared to current representation learning approaches, with minimal user input. Our results suggest that a manifold structure provides a powerful inductive bias to develop decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments. MARBLE uses geometric deep learning to map dynamics such as neural activity into a latent representation, which can then be used to decode the neural activity or compare it across systems.},

Realizing the potential of this technology requires computational pipelines that generalize across experimental protocols and map neuronal activity at the laminar and subpopulation-specific levels, beyond atlas-defined regions. Here, we present artficial intelligence-based cartography of ensembles (ACE), an end-to-end pipeline that employs three-dimensional deep learning segmentation models and advanced cluster-wise statistical algorithms, to enable unbiased mapping of local neuronal activity and connectivity. Validation against state-of-the-art segmentation and detection methods on unseen datasets demonstrated ACE’s high generalizability and performance. Applying ACE in two distinct neurobiological contexts, we discovered subregional effects missed by existing atlas-based analyses and showcase ACE’s ability to reveal localized or laminar neuronal activity brain-wide. Our open-source pipeline enables whole-brain mapping of neuronal ensembles at a high level of precision across a wide range of neuroscientific applications.

We focused the development of Cellpose3 on addressing these cases and here we demonstrate substantial out-of-the-box gains in segmentation and image quality for noisy, blurry and undersampled images. Unlike previous approaches that train models to restore pixel values, we trained Cellpose3 to output images that are well segmented by a generalist segmentation model, while maintaining perceptual similarity to the target images. Furthermore, we trained the restoration models on a large, varied collection of datasets, thus ensuring good generalization to user images. We provide these tools as ‘one-click’ buttons inside the graphical interface of Cellpose as well as in the Cellpose API.

Moreover, continuous high-resolution imaging inside living organisms has mostly been limited to a few hours, as regions of interest quickly move out of view due to sample movement and growth. Here, we present a self-driving, multiresolution light-sheet microscope platform controlled by custom Python-based software, to simultaneously observe and quantify subcellular dynamics in the context of entire organisms in vitro and in vivo over hours of imaging. We apply the platform to the study of developmental processes, cancer invasion and metastasis, and we provide quantitative multiscale analysis of immune–cancer cell interactions in zebrafish xenografts.

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques, such as single-molecule tracking (SMT), enable in situ measurements in cells but have historically been limited by a necessary tradeoff between spatiotemporal resolution and throughput. Here we address these limitations using oblique line scan (OLS), a robust single-objective light-sheet-based illumination and detection modality that achieves nanoscale spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution across a large field of view. We show that OLS can be used to capture protein motion up to 14 μm2 s−1 in living cells. We further extend the utility of OLS with in-solution SMT for single-molecule measurement of ligand–protein interactions and disruption of protein–protein interactions using purified proteins. We illustrate the versatility of OLS by showcasing two-color SMT, STORM and single-molecule fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. OLS paves the way for robust, high-throughput, single-molecule investigations of protein function required for basic research, drug screening and systems biology studies. Oblique line scan microscopy achieves nanoscale spatial and sub-millisecond temporal resolution across a large field of view, enabling improved and robust single-molecule biophysical measurements and single-molecule tracking in both cells and solution.},

This protein, called Melt (Membrane localization using temperature) oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane when temperature is lowered. We generated a library of Melt variants with switching temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 40 °C, including two that operate at and above 37 °C. Melt was a highly modular actuator of cell function, permitting thermal control over diverse processes including signaling, proteolysis, nuclear shuttling, cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell death. Finally, Melt permitted thermal control of cell death in a mouse model of human cancer. Melt represents a versatile thermogenetic module for straightforward, non-invasive and spatiotemporally defined control of mammalian cells with broad potential for biotechnology and biomedicine. The Melt (Membrane localization using temperature) protein translocates to the plasma membrane upon temperature shift.

Here we present spatial-Mux-seq, a multimodal spatial technology that allows simultaneous profiling of five different modalities: two histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, whole transcriptome and a panel of proteins at tissue scale and cellular level in a spatially resolved manner. We applied this technology to mouse embryos and mouse brains, generating detailed multimodal tissue maps that identified more cell types and states compared to unimodal data. This analysis uncovered spatiotemporal relationships among histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, gene expression and protein levels during neuron differentiation, and revealed a radial glia niche with spatially dynamic epigenetic signals. Collectively, the spatial multi-omics approach heralds a new era for characterizing tissue and cellular heterogeneity that single-modality studies alone could not reveal. Spatial-Mux-seq offers a multimodal spatial platform capable of profiling multiple molecular modalities, including the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and targeted proteins.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advancements in sample preparation, instrumentation and data analysis, single-cell proteomics is currently limited by proteomic depth and quantitative performance. Here we demonstrate highly improved depth of proteome coverage as well as accuracy and precision for quantification of ultra-low input amounts. Using a tailored library, we identify up to 7,400 protein groups from as little as 250 pg of HeLa cell peptides at a throughput of 50 samples per day. Using a two-proteome mix, we check for optimal parameters of quantification and show that fold change differences of 2 can still be successfully determined at single-cell-level inputs. Eventually, we apply our workflow to A549 cells, yielding a proteome coverage ranging from 1,801 to a maximum of &amp;gt;5,300 protein groups from a single cell depending on cell size and search strategy used, which allows for the study of dependencies between cell size and cell cycle phase. Additionally, our workflow enables us to distinguish between in vitro analogs of two human blastocyst lineages: naive human pluripotent stem cells (epiblast) and trophectoderm-like cells. Our data harmoniously align with transcriptomic data, indicating that single-cell proteomics possesses the capability to identify biologically relevant differences within the blastocyst. An ultra-low-input single-cell proteomic workflow is optimized to yield maximum proteome coverage with high accuracy and precision on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell proteomics (SCP) promises to revolutionize biomedicine by providing an unparalleled view of the proteome in individual cells. Here, we present a high-sensitivity SCP workflow named Chip-Tip, identifying &amp;gt;5,000 proteins in individual HeLa cells. It also facilitated direct detection of post-translational modifications in single cells, making the need for specific post-translational modification-enrichment unnecessary. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of processing up to 120 label-free SCP samples per day. An optimized tissue dissociation buffer enabled effective single-cell disaggregation of drug-treated cancer cell spheroids, refining overall SCP analysis. Analyzing nondirected human-induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation, we consistently quantified stem cell markers OCT4 and SOX2 in human-induced pluripotent stem cells and lineage markers such as GATA4 (endoderm), HAND1 (mesoderm) and MAP2 (ectoderm) in different embryoid body cells. Our workflow sets a benchmark in SCP for sensitivity and throughput, with broad applications in basic biology and biomedicine for identification of cell type-specific markers and therapeutic targets. Chip-Tip is a label-free quantification-based single-cell proteomics workflow for deep single-cell proteomics, which identifies over 5,000 proteins and 40,000 peptides in single HeLa cells.},

  abstract     = {In vivo lineage tracing holds great potential to reveal fundamental principles of tissue development and homeostasis. However, current lineage tracing in humans relies on extremely rare somatic mutations, which has limited temporal resolution and lineage accuracy. Here, we developed a generic lineage-tracing tool based on frequent epimutations on DNA methylation, enabled by our computational method MethylTree. Using single-cell genome-wide DNA methylation datasets with known lineage and phenotypic labels, MethylTree reconstructed lineage histories at nearly 100% accuracy across different cell types, developmental stages, and species. We demonstrated the epimutation-based single-cell multi-omic lineage tracing in mouse and human blood, where MethylTree recapitulated the differentiation hierarchy in hematopoiesis. Applying MethylTree to human embryos, we revealed early fate commitment at the four-cell stage. In native mouse blood, we identified ~250 clones of hematopoietic stem cells. MethylTree opens the door for high-resolution, noninvasive and multi-omic lineage tracing in humans and beyond. This work presents a computational tool MethylTree to infer cell lineages based on epimutations on DNA methylation.},

We introduce a highly scalable method for jointly profiling DNA and expression following nucleosome depletion (DEFND-seq). In DEFND-seq, nuclei are nucleosome-depleted, tagmented and separated into individual droplets for messenger RNA and genomic DNA barcoding. Once nuclei have been depleted of nucleosomes, subsequent steps can be performed using the widely available 10x Genomics droplet microfluidic technology and commercial kits. We demonstrate the production of high-complexity mRNA and gDNA sequencing libraries from thousands of individual nuclei from cell lines, fresh and archived surgical specimens for associating gene expression with both copy number and single-nucleotide variants. Building on a nucleosome-depletion strategy, DEFND-seq utilizes a droplet microfluidic platform to enable high-throughput co-profiling of DNA and RNA in single cells.},

  abstract     = {The fascinating hypothesis that supercooled water may segregate into two distinct liquid phases, each with unique structures and densities, was first posited in 1992. This idea, initially based on numerical analyses with the ST2 water-like empirical potential, challenged the conventional understanding of water’s phase behaviour at the time and has since intrigued the scientific community. Over the past three decades, advancements in computational modelling—particularly through the advent of data-driven many-body potentials rigorously derived from first principles and augmented by the efficiency of neural networks—have greatly enhanced the accuracy of molecular simulations, enabling the exploration of the phase behaviour of water with unprecedented realism. Our study leverages these computational advances to probe the elusive liquid–liquid transition in supercooled water. Microsecond-long simulations with chemical accuracy, conducted over several years, provide compelling evidence that water indeed exists in two discernibly distinct liquid states at low temperature and high pressure. By pinpointing a realistic estimate for the location of the liquid–liquid critical point at ~198 K and ~1,250 atm, our study not only advances the current understanding of water’s anomalous behaviour but also establishes a basis for experimental validation. Importantly, our simulations indicate that the liquid–liquid critical point falls within temperature and pressure ranges that could potentially be experimentally probed in water nanodroplets, opening up the possibility for direct measurements. A liquid–liquid transition in supercooled water has long been predicted. State-of-the-art simulations now precisely confine the temperature and pressure ranges for this transition, which are found to be within experimental reach.},

  abstract     = {Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called α and β relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the α process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a β process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (α) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously, and no β relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective. A unified description of the dynamics of structurally disordered materials is challenging. Simulations of model systems now show that percolation theory provides a framework unifying the two most prominent relaxation processes in supercooled liquids and glasses.},

  abstract     = {Particle-like topological structures such as polar skyrmions in ferroelectrics have the potential for application in high-density information storage. Since the polar topologies arise from a complicated competitive energy balance, such non-trivial topological states are difficult to manipulate by applying non-persistent external stimuli, such as bias or strain. Thus, a flexible strategy for manipulating topological polar states is needed to realize ultrahigh-density topological devices. Here we demonstrate that thermal excitation can simultaneously regulate the competition of elastic, electrostatic, polarization gradient and Landau energies to trigger polar topological state switching. By designing the temperature evolution pathways, the individual states that are believed to be unstable or intermediate can now be switched and stabilized. Therefore, our strategy expands the diversity of polar topologies in a single superlattice system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the laser-based thermal local switching of polar solitons ranging from several hundred nanometres to a few topologies. These findings will advance the design of polar topology-based ultrahigh-density storage. Stable manipulation of polar skyrmions is challenging because of the underlying competitive energy scales. Now thermal excitation has been demonstrated to be an effective way to control such topological states.},

  abstract     = {Floquet–Bloch manipulation, achieved by driving a material periodically with a laser pulse, is a method that enables the engineering of electronic and magnetic phases in solids by effectively modifying the structure of their electronic bands. However, the application of Floquet–Bloch manipulation in topological magnetic systems, particularly those with inherent disorder, remains largely unexplored. Here we realize Floquet–Bloch manipulation of the Dirac surface-state mass of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi2Te4. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that opposite helicities of mid-infrared circularly polarized light result in substantially different Dirac mass gaps in the antiferromagnetic phase, despite the equilibrium Dirac cone being massless. We explain our findings in terms of a Dirac fermion with a random mass. Our results underscore Floquet–Bloch manipulation as a powerful tool for controlling topology, even in the presence of disorder, and for uncovering properties of materials that may elude conventional probes. Periodic laser light can modify the electronic properties of solids and offers a path to create new material phases. In a topological antiferromagnet, periodic driving with opposite light helicities is now shown to produce distinct Dirac mass gaps.},

  abstract     = {Photo-excited quantum materials can be driven into thermally inaccessible metastable states that exhibit structural, charge, spin, topological and superconducting orders. Metastable states typically emerge on timescales set by the intrinsic electronic and phononic energy scales, ranging from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and can persist for weeks. Therefore, studies have primarily focused on ultrafast or quasi-static limits, leaving the intermediate time window less explored. Here we reveal a metastable state with broken glide-plane symmetry in photo-doped Ca2RuO4 using time-resolved optical second-harmonic generation and birefringence measurements. We find that the metastable state appears long after intralayer antiferromagnetic order has melted and photo-carriers have recombined. Its properties are distinct from all known states in the equilibrium phase diagram and are consistent with intralayer ferromagnetic order. Furthermore, model Hamiltonian calculations reveal that a non-thermal trajectory to this state can be accessed via photo-doping. Our results expand the search space for out-of-equilibrium electronic matter to metastable states emerging at intermediate timescales. Searches for metastable states with properties not found in thermal equilibrium have been restricted to either ultrafast or slow timescales. A metastable state in an intermediate time window has now been identified in a photo-doped Mott insulator.},

  abstract     = {Superconductivity is a common feature of graphite allotropes, having been observed in Bernal bilayers, rhombohedral trilayers and a wide variety of angle-misaligned multilayers. Despite notable differences in the electronic structure of these systems, supporting the graphite on a WSe2 substrate has been consistently observed to expand the range of the superconductivity in terms of carrier density and temperature. Here we report the observation of two distinct superconducting states in Bernal bilayer graphene with strong proximity-induced Ising spin–orbit coupling. Our quantum oscillation measurements show that, although the normal state of the first superconducting phase is consistent with the single-particle band structure, the second emerges from a nematic normal state with broken rotational symmetry. Both superconductors are robust to in-plane magnetic fields, but neither reach fields expected for spin–valley-locked Ising superconductors. The Fermi surface geometry of the first superconducting phase suggests that the superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing arising from the imperfect layer polarization of the electron wavefunctions. Finally, an analysis of transport and thermodynamic compressibility measurements in the second superconducting phase shows that the proximity to isospin phase boundaries, observed in other rhombohedral graphene allotropes, is probably coincidental, thus constraining theories of the pairing mechanisms in these systems. Two regions of superconductivity are observed in the phase diagram of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. Spin–orbit coupling induced by the substrate and orbital moments are shown to be important in describing their properties.},

One feature of these phase diagrams is the emergence of microemulsion phases, where regions of different phases self-organize across multiple length scales. The experimental characterization of these microemulsions can pose considerable challenges, as the long-range Coulomb interaction microscopically mingles with the competing states. Here we observe the signatures of the microemulsion between an electronic Wigner crystal and an electron liquid in a MoSe2 monolayer using cryogenic reflectance and magneto-optical spectroscopy. We find that the transition into this microemulsion state is marked by anomalies in exciton reflectance, spin susceptibility and umklapp scattering, establishing it as a distinct phase of electronic matter. Competition between different possible ground states of strongly correlated electron systems can lead to the emergence of mixed states called microemulsions. Now this phenomenon is reported at the melting transition of a Wigner crystal.},

The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La3Ni2O7–δ as hydrostatic pressure is applied, and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure’s compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and non-magnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, whereas the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La3Ni2O7–δ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders—a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most probably a charge density wave—with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them. The density wave transition in a superconducting nickelate is shown to split when hydrostatic pressure is applied, indicating that it is composed of both a spin density wave and another form of ordered state.},

  abstract     = {Flat-band moiré graphene systems are a quintessential platform for investigating correlated phases of matter. Various interaction-driven ground states have been proposed, but despite extensive experimental effort, there has been little direct evidence that distinguishes between various phases, in particular near the charge neutrality point. Here we probe the fine details of the density of states and the effects of Coulomb interactions in alternating-twist trilayer graphene by imaging the local thermodynamic quantum oscillations with a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device. We find that the charging self-energy due to occupied electronic states is most important in explaining the high-carrier-density physics. At half-filling of the conduction flat band, we observe ferromagnetic-driven symmetry breaking, suggesting that it is the most robust mechanism in the hierarchy of phase transitions. Near charge neutrality, where exchange energy dominates over charging self-energy, we find a nematic semimetal ground state, which is theoretically favoured over gapped states in the presence of heterostrain. In this semimetallic phase, the flat-band Dirac cones migrate towards the mini-Brillouin zone centre, spontaneously breaking the threefold rotational symmetry. Our low-field local quantum oscillation technique can be used to explore the ground states of many strongly interacting van der Waals systems. Our understanding of the phase diagram of twisted graphene structures is incomplete. Now, twisted trilayer graphene is examined using a technique that locally images quantum oscillations and shows that a nematic semimetal is favoured at low density.},

  abstract     = {Resolving two or more constantly scattering identical point sources using freely propagating waves is limited by diffraction. Here we show that, by illuminating with a diffraction minimum, a given number of point scatterers can be resolved at distances of small fractions of the wavelength. Specifically, we identify an 8 nm distance, which corresponds to 1/80 of the employed 640 nm wavelength, between two constantly emitting fluorescent molecules in the focal plane of an optical microscope. We also measure 22 nm side length for a quadratic array of four molecules. Moreover, we show that the measurement precision improves with decreasing distance and with increased scatterer density. This work opens up the prospect of resolving individual scatterers in clusters that are far smaller than the wavelength. The central maximum of a diffraction pattern is commonly used to resolve point-like scatterers. Now spatial resolution far below the diffraction limit is achieved by using the scattering minima.},

  abstract     = {Reducing decoherence in quantum computers rapidly decreases the overhead needed to construct a logical qubit from physical qubits. In solid-state systems, a class of defects known as two-level systems is a major source of decoherence. Currently, superconducting qubit experiments reduce dissipation due to the two-level systems by using large device dimensions. However, this approach only provides partial protection and results in a trade-off between qubit size and dissipation. In this work, we instead engineer the interactions between a qubit and the surrounding two-level systems using phononics. We fabricate a superconducting qubit on a phononic-bandgap metamaterial that suppresses phonon emission mediated by the two-level systems. The phonon-engineered bath of two-level systems shows increased lifetime and affects the thermalization dynamics of the qubit. Within the phononic bandgap, we observe the emergence of a non-Markovian qubit behaviour. Combined with qubit miniaturization, our approach could substantially extend the qubit relaxation times. Defects known as two-level systems are a major source of noise for superconducting qubits. Adding a phononic crystal is now shown to extend the lifetime of these two-level systems, which could lead to improved qubit coherence.},

However, the practical cryogenic limitations of operating large numbers of superconducting qubits are becoming a bottleneck for further scaling. Due to the low thermal conductivity and the dense optical multiplexing capacity of telecommunications fibre, converting qubit signal processing to the optical domain using microwave-to-optics transduction would substantially relax the strain on cryogenic space and thermal budgets. Here we demonstrate optical readout of a superconducting transmon qubit through an optical fibre connected via a coaxial cable to a fully integrated piezo-optomechanical transducer. Using a demolition readout technique, we achieve a single-shot readout fidelity of 81%. Our results illustrate the benefits of piezo-optomechanical transduction for low-dissipation operation of large quantum processors. Superconducting qubits are measured using microwaves, posing constraints on its size and thermal budgets.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of superconducting quantum hardware is expected to run into substantial restrictions on scalability because error correction in a cryogenic environment has stringent input–output requirements. Classical data centres rely on fibre-optic interconnects to remove similar networking bottlenecks. In the same spirit, ultracold electro-optic links have been proposed and used to generate qubit control signals, or to replace cryogenic readout electronics. So far, these approaches have suffered from either low efficiency, low bandwidth or additional noise. Here we realize radio-over-fibre qubit readout at millikelvin temperatures. We use one device to simultaneously perform upconversion and downconversion between microwave and optical frequencies and so do not require any active or passive cryogenic microwave equipment. We demonstrate all-optical single-shot readout in a circulator-free readout scheme. Importantly, we do not observe any direct radiation impact on the qubit state, despite the absence of shielding elements. This compatibility between superconducting circuits and telecom-wavelength light is not only a prerequisite to establish modular quantum networks, but it is also relevant for multiplexed readout of superconducting photon detectors and classical superconducting logic. Microwaves are usually used to interact with superconducting qubits, but optical photons can be processed at room temperature. The electro-optical transceiver presented here allows all-optical readout of a qubit without affecting its performance.},

  abstract     = {False vacuum decay—the transition from a metastable quantum state to a true vacuum state—plays an important role in quantum field theory and non-equilibrium phenomena such as phase transitions and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative nature of false vacuum decay and the limited experimental access to this process make it challenging to study, leaving several open questions regarding how true vacuum bubbles form, move and interact. Here we observe quantized bubble formation in real time, a key feature of false vacuum decay dynamics, using a quantum annealer with 5,564 superconducting flux qubits. We develop an effective model that captures both initial bubble creation and subsequent interactions, and remains accurate under dissipation. The annealer reveals coherent scaling laws in the driven many-body dynamics for more than 1,000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work provides a method for investigating false vacuum dynamics of large quantum systems in quantum annealers. Bubble formation is a signal of false vacuum decay, in which a system transitions from a local energy minimum to a true vacuum. Now, simulations on a quantum annealer show how interactions between bubbles drive the long-time dynamics of this process.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasensitive detection of the frequency, phase and amplitude of radiofrequency electric fields is crucial for applications in radio communication, cosmology, dark matter searches and high-fidelity qubit control. Quantum harmonic oscillator systems, especially trapped ions, offer high-sensitivity electric field sensing with nanometre spatial resolution but are typically restricted to narrow frequency ranges centred around the motional frequency of the trapped-ion oscillator or the frequency of an optical transition in the ion. Here we present a procedure that enables precise electric field detection over an expanded frequency range. Specifically, we use motional Raman transitions in a single trapped ion to achieve sensitivity across a frequency range over 800 times larger than previous approaches. We show that the method is compatible with both quantum amplification via squeezing and measurement in the Fock basis, allowing a demonstration of performance 3.4(2.0) dB below the standard quantum limit. The approach can be extended to other quantum harmonic oscillator systems, such as superconducting qubit–resonator systems. The narrow frequency response of quantum harmonic oscillators typically limits their application in radiofrequency electric field detection. Now motional Raman transitions in trapped ions are shown to enable wideband, high-precision radiofrequency field sensing.},

  abstract     = {Equilibrium phase transitions in many-body systems have been predicted and observed in two and three spatial dimensions but have long been thought not to exist in one-dimensional systems. It was suggested that a phase transition in one dimension can occur in the presence of long-range interactions. However, an experimental realization has so far not been achieved due to the requirement to both realize interactions over sufficiently long distances and to prepare equilibrium states. Here we demonstrate a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension by implementing a long-range interacting model in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. We show that finite-energy states can be generated by time-evolving initial product states and letting them thermalize under the dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian. By preparing initial states with different energies, we study the finite-energy phase diagram of a long-range interacting quantum system. We observe a ferromagnetic equilibrium phase transition as well as a crossover from a low-energy polarized paramagnet to a high-energy unpolarized paramagnet, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our work presents a scheme for preparing finite-energy states in quantum simulation platforms, enabling access to phases at finite energy density. Long-range interactions have been predicted to enable a phase transition in one-dimensional systems. An experiment now validates this hypothesis in a trapped-ion quantum simulator by observing a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension.},

  abstract     = {Quantum networks require quantum nodes with coherent optical interfaces and several stationary qubits. In terms of optical properties, semiconductor quantum dots are highly compelling, but their adoption as quantum nodes has been impaired by the lack of auxiliary qubits. Here we demonstrate that the dense, always-present, nuclear spin ensemble surrounding a gallium arsenide quantum dot can be used as a functional quantum register. We prepared 13,000 host nuclear spins in a single many-body dark state that acts as a logical state of the register. A second logical state is defined as a single nuclear-magnon excitation, enabling controlled quantum-state transfer between an electron spin qubit in the quantum dot and the nuclear magnonic register. Using SWAP gates, we implemented a full write–store–retrieve-read-out protocol with 68.6(4)% raw overall fidelity and a storage time of 130(16) μs, which could be extended to 20 ms or beyond using dynamical decoupling techniques. Our work establishes how many-body physics can add functionality to quantum devices, in this case transforming quantum dots into multi-qubit quantum nodes with deterministic registers. The thousands of nuclear spins surrounding gallium arsenide quantum dots can interface with electron spin qubits and photons. With quantum engineering, this nuclear spin ensemble becomes a robust register for quantum information storage.},

They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realize ‘Schrödinger cat’ states, which are superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, which are finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrödinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and we constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schrödinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control non-classical resource states, which is a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction, using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform. A large nuclear spin has been successfully placed in a Schrödinger cat state, a superposition of its two most widely separated spin coherent states. This can be used as an error-correctable qubit.},

The theory of higher-order topological dynamics, which combines higher-order interactions with discrete topology and nonlinear dynamics, has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex systems, such as the brain and the climate, and to advance the development of next-generation AI algorithms. This theoretical framework, which goes beyond traditional node-centric descriptions, encodes the dynamics of a network through topological signals—variables assigned not only to nodes but also to edges, triangles and other higher-order cells. Recent findings show that topological signals lead to the emergence of distinct types of dynamical state and collective phenomena, including topological and Dirac synchronization, pattern formation and triadic percolation. These results offer insights into how topology shapes dynamics, how dynamics learns topology and how topology evolves dynamically. This Perspective primarily aims to guide physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and network scientists through the emerging field of higher-order topological dynamics, while also outlining future research challenges. Higher-order interactions reveal new aspects of the interplay between topology and dynamics in complex systems.
