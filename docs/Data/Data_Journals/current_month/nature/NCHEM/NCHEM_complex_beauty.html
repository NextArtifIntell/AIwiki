  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates composed of proteins and RNA are one approach by which cells regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. Their formation typically involves the phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins with a target mRNA, sequestering the mRNA into a liquid condensate. This sequestration regulates gene expression by modulating translation or facilitating RNA processing. Here we engineer synthetic condensates using a fusion of an RNA-binding protein, the human Pumilio2 homology domain (Pum2), and a synthetic intrinsically disordered protein, an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), that can bind and sequester a target mRNA transcript. In protocells, sequestration of a target mRNA largely limits its translation. Conversely, in Escherichia coli, sequestration of the same target mRNA increases its translation. We characterize the Pum2–ELP condensate system using microscopy, biophysical and biochemical assays, and RNA sequencing. This approach enables the modulation of cell function via the formation of synthetic biomolecular condensates that regulate the expression of a target protein. Formation of biomolecular condensates composed of proteins and RNA facilitates the regulation of gene expression by modulating translation or facilitating RNA processing. Now, synthetic ribonucleoprotein granules created with engineered intrinsically disordered proteins selectively sequester mRNA and enhance protein translation in cells. These highly liquid-like condensates exchange biomolecules across the cell and facilitate target mRNA and ribosome partitioning.},

  abstract     = {Controlling reaction outcomes through external influences is a central goal in chemistry. Vibrational coupling between molecular vibrations and cavity modes is rapidly emerging as a distinct strategy compared with conventional thermochemical and photochemical methods; however, insight into the fundamental mechanisms remains limited. Here we investigate how vibrational weak and strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities modifies the thermal dehydration of copper sulfate pentahydrate. We demonstrate that light–matter coupling reduces the onset temperature for dehydration by up to 14 °C, and we attribute this effect to enhanced radiative energy transport that is mediated by resonant electromagnetic modes, eliminating temperature gradients in the coupled system. Our findings provide direct evidence of localized energy transfer leading to modified chemical behaviour in specific regions of high optical density of states. This work establishes a mechanism for modifying thermally driven chemical processes using optical cavities, with implications for the development of catalytic systems that exploit these tailored interactions to achieve targeted reaction control. Vibrational weak and strong light–matter coupling in infrared nanocavities modifies chemical processes. Now it has been shown that this coupling can control thermally driven reactions through enhanced radiative energy transport.},

  abstract     = {Protein catalysis and allostery require the atomic-level orchestration and motion of residues and ligand, solvent and protein effector molecules. However, the ability to design protein activity through precise protein–solvent cooperative interactions has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the design of 14 membrane receptors that catalyse G protein nucleotide exchange through diverse engineered allosteric pathways mediated by cooperative networks of intraprotein, protein–ligand and –solvent molecule interactions. Consistent with predictions, the designed protein activities correlated well with the level of plasticity of the networks at flexible transmembrane helical interfaces. Several designs displayed considerably enhanced thermostability and activity compared with related natural receptors. The most stable and active variant crystallized in an unforeseen signalling-active conformation, in excellent agreement with the design models. The allosteric network topologies of the best designs bear limited similarity to those of natural receptors and reveal an allosteric interaction space larger than previously inferred from natural proteins. The approach should prove useful for engineering proteins with novel complex protein binding, catalytic and signalling activities. Solvent-mediated interaction networks control a wide range of protein functions, but their design has been neglected owing to a lack of accurate computational tools. Now it is shown that allosteric signalling membrane proteins can be engineered through such networks, revealing a broader space of designable protein interactions and functions.},

This enables variability on the backbone structure, as well as diverse spatial arrangements of pillars and the partitioning of pore space into several kinds of cages packing in distinct sequences. These sequence-controlled MOFs (SC-MOF-1–6) showcase ultrahigh benzene capture capacities at low-pressure and high volumetric and gravimetric uptake performances in high-pressure methane storage. We provide the construction principles of the SC-MOFs and predict nearly 2,000 possible SC-networks with sophisticated composition sequences at the atomic level by using a Python script. The tailoring of reticular materials is key for enhancing the complexity and diversity of their structure and function. Now, a series of isomeric pillar-layered metal–organic frameworks with tunable topologies have been prepared through altering the layer stacking, which enables variability on the backbone structure, pillar spatial arrangements and pore structure.},

Here we report a gram-scale, seven-step synthesis of ibogaine from pyridine. Key features of this strategy enabled the synthesis of three additional iboga alkaloids, as well as an enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-ibogaine and the construction of four analogues. Biological testing revealed that the unnatural enantiomer of ibogaine does not produce ibogaine-like effects on cortical neuron growth, while (−)-10-fluoroibogamine exhibits exceptional psychoplastogenic properties and is a potent modulator of the serotonin transporter. This work provides a platform for accessing iboga alkaloids and congeners for further biological study. Preliminary clinical trials suggest that ibogaine and its active metabolite noribogaine have powerful anti-addictive properties, Now, a strategy for the scalable, asymmetric total synthesis of ibogaine has been developed that also provides access to iboga analogues.

  abstract     = {Amyloid fibrils are highly stable misfolded protein assemblies that play an important role in several neurodegenerative and systemic diseases. Although structural information of the amyloid state is now abundant, mechanistic details about the misfolding process remain elusive. Inspired by the Φ-value analysis of protein folding, we combined experiments and molecular simulations to resolve amino-acid contacts and determine the structure of the transition-state ensemble—the rate-limiting step—for fibril elongation of PI3K-SH3 amyloid fibrils. The ensemble was validated experimentally by Tanford β analysis and computationally by free energy calculations. Although protein folding proceeds on funnel-shaped landscapes, here we find that the energy landscape for the misfolding reaction consists of a large ‘golf course’ region, defined by a single energy barrier and transition state, accessing a sharply funnelled region. Thus, misfolding occurs by rare, successful monomer–fibril end collisions interspersed by numerous unsuccessful binding attempts. Taken together, these insights provide a quantitative and highly resolved description of a protein misfolding reaction. Amyloid fibrils grow through the recruitment of soluble monomer to the fibril end that propagates the fibril structure. Here the transition state, the rate-limiting conformation, of such a reaction has been characterized by Φ-value analysis. An energy landscape model has been developed and fibril growth rates predicted from first principles.},

Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are particularly noteworthy owing to their uniquely three-dimensional stereochemical complexity. 1,3-Difunctionalized BCPs have been widely used as bioisosteres for para-substituted phenyl rings, and they have been incorporated into numerous lead pharmaceutical candidates. 2-Substituted BCPs (substituted at the bridge position) can function as alternatives to ortho- or meta-substituted arene rings; however, the general and efficient construction of these scaffolds remains challenging, particularly if performed in an enantioselective manner. Here we present an approach for synthesizing enantioenriched 2-substituted BCPs by a nitrogen-atom insertion-and-deletion strategy, involving a chiral Brønsted acid-catalytic enantioselective cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with imines and nitrogen deletion of resulting aza-bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza-BCHs) with generally good enantiopurity retention. Mechanistic experiments verify the radical pathway. Chiral BCPs have been readily incorporated into medicinally relevant molecules, and a drug analogue has been successfully prepared enantioselectively. Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are widely used as bioisosteres for para-substituted phenyl rings, providing improved pharmacological profiles for drug candidates, but strategies for the preparation of chiral BCPs remain limited. Now a route to chiral bridge-substituted BCPs has been developed via a nitrogen-atom insertion-and-deletion strategy, enabling a practical avenue towards chiral BCP bioisosteres of lomitapide.},

Engineered DNA polymerases have recently emerged as attractive tools for RNA labelling, offering distinct advantages over conventional RNA polymerases. Here, through semi-rational designs, we engineered a DNA polymerase variant and used it to precisely incorporate a diverse range of modifications, including base modifications, 2′-ribose modifications and backbone modifications, into desired positions within RNA. We achieved efficiencies exceeding 85% in the majority of modification cases, demonstrating success in introducing 2′-O-methyl, phosphorothioate, N4-acetylcytidine and a fluorophore to specific sites in eGFP and Firefly luciferase messenger RNA. Our mRNA products with N4-acetylcytidine, 2′-O-methyl and/or phosphorothioate have demonstrated the ability to enhance stability and affect protein production. This method presents a promising tool for the comprehensive functionalization of RNA, enabling the introduction of plentiful modifications irrespective of RNA lengths and sequences. The demand for large, position-specific modified RNA molecules is high across diverse fields. Now a DNA polymerase has been engineered to enable the efficient and flexible synthesis of such molecules using a pause–restart strategy.

  abstract     = {The ever-increasing demand in the development of host molecules for the recognition of charged species is stimulated by their fundamental roles in numerous biological and environmental processes. Here, capitalizing on the inherent amphoteric nature of anisotropically polarized tellurium or iodine atoms, we demonstrate a proof of concept in charged guest recognition, where the same neutral host structure binds both cations or anions solely through its chalcogen or halogen donor atoms. Through extensive 1H nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments and computational density functional theory studies, a library of chalcogen-bonding (ChB) and halogen-bonding (XB) mechanically interlocked [2]rotaxane molecules, including seminal examples of all-ChB and mixed ChB/XB [2]rotaxanes, are shown to function as either Lewis-acidic or Lewis-basic multidentate hosts for selective halide anion and metal cation binding. Notably, the exploitation of the inherent amphoteric character of an atom for the strategic purpose of either cation or anion recognition constitutes the inception of a previously unexplored area of supramolecular host–guest chemistry. The importance of charged species in numerous biological and environmental processes has stimulated the development of host molecules for their selective recognition. Now anisotropically polarized halogen- and chalcogen-bonding [2]rotaxanes are demonstrated to exhibit dual Lewis-acidic and Lewis-basic amphoteric properties for anion or cation recognition via the same donor atoms.},

As such, there is substantial interest in the development of general synthetic platforms that enable the efficient diversification of aliphatic C–H bonds. Here we report a hypervalent iodine reagent that releases a potent hydrogen atom abstractor for C–H activation under mild photochemical conditions. Using this reagent, we demonstrate selective (N-phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic C–H bonds for a broad scope of substrates. The synthetic utility of the thiolated products is showcased through various derivatizations. Simply by altering the radical trapping agent, our method can directly transform C–H bonds into diverse functionalities, including C–S, C–Cl, C–Br, C–I, C–O, C–N, C–C and C=C bonds. Aliphatic C–H functionalization is a valuable tool in organic synthesis. Now a hypervalent iodine reagent has been shown to release a potent hydrogen atom abstractor for C–H activation under mild photochemical conditions. This enables the transformation of C–H bonds into diverse functional groups with tunable control over the site selectivity.},

Because of its fundamental role in living cells, developing a reconstituted or artificial cytoskeleton is of major interest. Here we present an approach to construct an artificial cytoskeleton that imparts mechanical support and regulates membrane dynamics. Our system involves amylose-based coacervates stabilized by a terpolymer membrane, with a cytoskeleton formed from polydiacetylene fibrils. The fibrils bundle due to interactions with the positively charged amylose derivative, forming micrometre-sized structures mimicking a cytoskeleton. Given the intricate interplay between cellular structure and function, the design and integration of this artificial cytoskeleton represent a crucial advancement, paving the way for the development of artificial cell platforms exhibiting enhanced life-like behaviour. The cytoskeleton is vital for living organisms. Now an artificial cytoskeleton within amylose-based coacervates stabilized by a terpolymer membrane has been developed using polydiacetylene fibrils to mimic natural cytoskeletal functions.

Here we describe a nickel-catalysed enantioselective C(sp3)–H alkylation of saturated heterocycles using olefins, providing an efficient strategy for the stereoselective construction of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds. Using readily available and stable olefins and simple saturated nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles as prochiral nucleophiles, the coupling reactions proceed under mild conditions and exhibit broad scope and high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the enantio- and diastereoselective C(sp3)–H alkylation of saturated hydrocarbons with alkenyl boronates has been achieved, enabling the synthesis of versatile alkyl boronates containing 1,2-adjacent C(sp3) stereocentres. Application of this approach to the late-stage modification of natural products and drugs, as well as to the enantioselective synthesis of a range of chiral building blocks and natural products, is demonstrated. The enantioselective C(sp3)–H alkylation of saturated hydrocarbons to construct C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds is challenging.

  abstract     = {Understanding the hydrogenation pathway in electrochemical CO2 reduction is important for controlling product selectivity. The Eley–Rideal mechanism involving proton-coupled electron transfer directly from solvent water is often considered to be the primary hydrogen transfer route. However, in principle, hydrogenation can also occur via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism using surface-adsorbed *H. Here, by performing CO2 reduction with Cu in H2O–D2O mixtures, we present evidence that the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is probably the dominant hydrogenation route. From this, we estimate the extent to which each mechanism contributes towards the formation of six important CO2 reduction products. Through computational simulations, we find that the formation of C–H bonds and O–H bonds is governed by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanism, respectively. We also show that promoting the Eley–Rideal pathway could be crucial towards selective multicarbon product formation and suppressing hydrogen evolution. These findings introduce important considerations for the theoretical modelling of CO2 reduction pathways and electrocatalyst design. CO2 electroreduction to higher-value carbons can occur through adsorbed hydrogen or through proton-coupled electron transfer from water. Understanding the impact of each route on product selectivity is challenging. Now H/D isotopic labelling reveals the contribution of each mechanism towards product formation and shows that adsorbed hydrogen dominates the reaction.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular networks are abundantly present in nature and, like crystalline materials, often develop from an initial nucleation site, followed by growth based on directional interactions between components. Traditionally, the binding strength and directionality of interactions is thought to dictate nucleation and crystal growth, whereas structural flexibility favours defects. Usually, macromonomers present multiple binding sites with relative intramolecular flexibility, but the effects of such flexibility on regulating network formation have been given little attention. Here we introduce the concept of ‘interface flexibility’ and demonstrate its critical importance in the nucleation and growth of supramolecular networks. As a model system, we use trisymmetric DNA-based macromonomers, which organize into hexagonal networks through weak π–π interactions at their tips. The directional nature and low spatial tolerance of π–π interactions mean that small shifts in orientation have a large effect on effective valency. We show that too much interface flexibility disrupts network formation, regardless of affinity. Tuning the interface flexibility greatly expands the available design space for synthetic supramolecular materials. Supramolecular ordered networks are formed through directional interactions of uniform macromonomer building blocks. Now it has been shown that, rather than intermolecular affinity, the flexibility of the binding interface (‘interface flexibility’) dominates the mechanism of self-assembly. This study provides an intuitive understanding of the role of interface flexibility in supramolecular self-assembly.},

A recent proliferation of synthetic strategies and advanced characterization tools has propelled broad interest in leveraging these catalysts in diverse areas of chemistry beyond thermal heterogeneous catalysis, including but not limited to organic synthesis, electrochemistry, photochemistry and environmental chemistry. This Perspective aims to arm researchers in this area with the methodological framework and fundamental principles to accurately assess the degree of uniformity of heterogeneous catalyst active sites, and to link the synthesis, structure and function of atomically dispersed catalysts to one another. A paedagogical discussion of catalyst structural dynamics and active-site-specific characterization is supplemented with recent case studies that illustrate these fundamentals. This analysis shows how progress can be guided by requiring that the characterization of active sites is connected to their kinetic behaviour in the form of turnover rates and by leveraging the thermokinetic factors that control active site structures and their dynamics. Atomically dispersed heterogeneous catalysts impact diverse areas of chemistry through the design of active sites with molecular precision, but this vision is not fully realized.
