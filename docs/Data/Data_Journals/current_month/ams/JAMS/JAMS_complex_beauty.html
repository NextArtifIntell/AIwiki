Using this, we show that it sends $T(n)$-local Galois extensions to $T(n+1)$-local Galois extensions. Furthermore, we show that it sends cyclotomic extensions of height $n$ to cyclotomic extensions of height $n+1$, extending a result of Bhatt‚ÄìClausen‚ÄìMathew for $n=0$. As a consequence, we deduce that $K(n+1)$-localized $K$-theory satisfies hyperdescent along the cyclotomic tower of any $T(n)$-local ring. Counterexamples to such cyclotomic hyperdescent for $T(n+1)$-localized $K$-theory were constructed by Burklund, Hahn, Levy and the third author, thereby disproving the telescope conjecture.},

  abstract     = {In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$-colorable. Recently, Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta })$-colorable for every $\beta &gt; 1/4$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$ bound. The first main result of this paper is that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t\log \log t)$-colorable. This is actually a corollary of our main technical result that the chromatic number of a $K_t$-minor-free graph is bounded by $O(t(1+f(G,t)))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the maximum of $\frac {\chi (H)}{a}$ over all $a\ge \frac {t}{\sqrt {\log t}}$ and $K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\log ^4 a)$ vertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned, using the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs, we show that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\log \log t)$-colorable. Second, it shows that proving Linear Hadwiger‚Äôs Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\sqrt {\log t}/ (\log \log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear Hadwiger‚Äôs Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for every fixed $r$; more generally, we show there exists $C\ge 1$ such that for every $r\ge 1$, there exists $t_r$ such that for all $t\ge t_r$, every $K_r$-free $K_t$-minor-free graph is $Ct$-colorable. One key to proving the main theorem is building the minor in two new ways according to whether the chromatic number ‚Äòseparates‚Äô in the graph: sequentially if the graph is the chromatic-inseparable and recursively if the graph is chromatic-separable. The other key is a new standalone result that every $K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\Omega (t)$ has a subgraph on $O(t \log ^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\Omega (d)$.},

The construction is achieved via weave calculus and a tropicalization of Lusztig‚Äôs coordinates. Several explicit seeds are provided and the quiver and cluster variables are readily computable. We prove that these upper cluster algebras equal their cluster algebras, show local acyclicity, and explicitly determine their DT-transformations as the twist automorphisms of braid varieties. The main result also resolves the conjecture of B. Leclerc [Adv. Math. 300 (2016), pp. 190‚Äì228] on the existence of cluster algebra structures on the coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties.},

  abstract     = {Martin‚Äôs Conjecture is a proposed classification of the definable functions on the Turing degrees. It is usually divided into two parts, the first of which classifies functions which are not above the identity and the second of which classifies functions which are above the identity. Slaman and Steel proved the second part of the conjecture for Borel functions which are order-preserving (i.e. which preserve Turing reducibility). We prove the first part of the conjecture for all order-preserving functions. We do this by introducing a class of functions on the Turing degrees which we call ‚Äúmeasure-preserving‚Äù and proving that part 1 of Martin‚Äôs Conjecture holds for all measure-preserving functions and also that all nontrivial order-preserving functions are measure-preserving. Our result on measure-preserving functions has several other consequences for Martin‚Äôs Conjecture, including an equivalence between part 1 of the conjecture and a statement about the structure of the Rudin-Keisler order on ultrafilters on the Turing degrees.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we construct H√∂lder maps to Carnot groups equipped with a Carnot metric, especially the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb {H}$. Pansu and Gromov [ Carnot-Carath√©odory spaces seen from within , Birkh√§user, Basel, 1996] observed that any surface embedded in $\mathbb {H}$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $3$, so there is no $\alpha$-H√∂lder embedding of a surface into $\mathbb {H}$ when $\alpha &gt;\frac {2}{3}$. Z√ºst [Anal. Geom. Metr. Spaces 3 (2015), pp. 73‚Äì92] improved this result to show that when $\alpha &gt;\frac {2}{3}$, any $\alpha$-H√∂lder map from a simply-connected Riemannian manifold to $\mathbb {H}$ factors through a metric tree. In the present paper, we show that Z√ºst‚Äôs result is sharp by constructing $(\frac {2}{3}-\epsilon )$-H√∂lder maps from $D^2$ and $D^3$ to $\mathbb {H}$ that do not factor through a tree. We use these to show that if $0&lt;\alpha &lt; \frac {2}{3}$, then the set of $\alpha$-H√∂lder maps from a compact metric space to $\mathbb {H}$ is dense in the set of continuous maps and to construct proper degree-1 maps from $\mathbb {R}^3$ to $\mathbb {H}$ with H√∂lder exponents arbitrarily close to $\frac {2}{3}$.},
