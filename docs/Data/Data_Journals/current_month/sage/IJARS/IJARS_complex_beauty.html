To thoroughly evaluate progress in this field, a Cloth Manipulation and Perception Competition was organised at IROS 2022 and ICRA 2023. In this article, we present the system that won the folding track at IROS 2022 and the folding and unfolding tracks at ICRA 2023. By combining visual and tactile information with engineered motions, we built a system that can generalise to a range of patterned towels made from various materials, as required for the competition. We describe our system and its limitations, which we relate to future work with the goal of creating systems that can deal with any cloth, robot, or surface.},

  abstract     = {We report on the development of an implementable physics-data hybrid dynamic model for an articulated manipulator to plan and operate in various scenarios. Meanwhile, the physics-based and data-driven based dynamic models are studied in this research to select the best model for planning. The physics-based model is constructed using the Lagrangian method, and the loss terms include inertia loss, viscous loss, and friction loss. As for the data-driven model, three methods are explored, including deep neural network, long short-term memory, and XGBoost. Our modeling results demonstrate that, after comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, the XGBoost architecture outperforms deep neural network and long short-term memory in accurately representing manipulator dynamics. With approximately 500k training data points, the XGBoost model closely matches the performance of the physics-based model, as assessed by the root mean square error between actual and estimated manipulator torque. The hybrid model with physics-based and data-driven terms has the best performance among all models based on the same root mean square error criteria, and it only needs about 24k of training data. In addition, we developed a virtual force sensor of a manipulator using the observed external torque derived from the dynamic model and designed a motion planner through the physics-data hybrid dynamic model. The external torque contributes to forces and torque on the end effector, facilitating interaction with the surroundings, while the internal torque governs manipulator motion dynamics and compensates for internal losses. By estimating external torque via the difference between measured joint torque and internal losses, we implement a sensorless control strategy which demonstrated through a peg-in-hole task. Lastly, a learning-based motion planner based on the hybrid dynamic model assists in planning time-efficient trajectories for the manipulator. This comprehensive approach underscores the efficacy of integrating physics-based and data-driven models for advanced manipulator control and planning in industrial environments.},

  abstract     = {The smart grid system enables bidirectional communication between end users and service providers, significantly enhancing service quality. One of its critical tasks is the monitoring and processing of abnormal transaction data. However, the openness and complexity of the network environment make the system vulnerable to a variety of attacks, such as internal data tampering and eavesdropping attacks. Consequently, the storage and communication security of abnormal transaction data pose significant challenges within the architecture and communication framework of the smart grid. To address these issues, this paper proposes a security protection scheme for abnormal transaction data in smart grid system. By employing a private blockchain network composed of consensus nodes, the scheme ensures the integrity and availability of abnormal transaction data. Additionally, the proposed authentication protocol facilitates secure communication among smart meters, consensus nodes, and servers within the blockchain-based smart grid system. Security analyses demonstrate that the proposed protocol effectively mitigates security threats while offering lower computational overhead compared to related protocols.},

  abstract     = {In clinical practice, prostate particle implantation surgery is performed by a robot control puncture needle; it is a safe and effective treatment method for prostate cancer. During surgery, the tissue deformation is caused by interaction forces between the needle and soft tissue, which results in the displacement error between the needle tip and the target point in the axial direction, thus affecting the precision of particle implantation and treatment effect. Therefore, an axial compensation precision puncture control method for prostate puncture robot is proposed in this article. Firstly, the position action relationship between the puncture needle and the target point is analyzed in the needle’s entry into the tissue, and the force analysis is carried out by the biomechanical Kelvin model; the interaction model between the puncture needle and the soft tissue is established, so as to obtain the axial compensation precision puncture control model. Then, an improved adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Levy Flight is proposed to identify parameters of this control model for puncture prostate in this article. Matlab–Adams co-simulation mode is used to simulate and analyze the axial compensation precision puncture control method when the puncture needle enters soft tissue, and thus the optimal parameters of this control model for puncture prostate are obtained. Finally, the experiment of puncture velocity with the axial compensation and comprehensive experiment of axial compensation puncture control method are carried out in combination with the robot. The results of the puncture velocity verification experiment show that when the puncture velocity is 12.3 mm/s, the parameters values (elastic coefficient of 2.165 N/m and damping coefficient of 0.754 Ns/m) obtained by identification are reasonable. In the experimental analysis for parameters identification, bionic soft tissue and pig kidney are used for experimental identification, and the results are basically consistent with the simulation. In the comparison experiment of axial compensation positioning performance, the coincidence degree between the tip of the puncture needle and the designated position reached 80% (higher than 35% of direct puncture). Meanwhile, in the comparison experiment of different puncture depths, the axial puncture deviation is 0.54–0.62 mm when the puncture depth is 50–80 mm, which is significantly smaller than the direct puncture of 1.58–2.15 mm. The experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the axial compensation precision puncture control method proposed in this article and the identification of parameter values, which can better improve the puncture accuracy and ensure the treatment effect of particle implantation for prostate cancer. The contents of this article can provide reference for the research of minimally invasive puncture surgery.},

  abstract     = {The ability of robots to detailed navigate and map environments is crucial for many industrial tasks. Traditional robotic control methods, using frameworks like ROS2 (Robot Operating System) combined with tools like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and NAV2 (Navigation 2), often require specialized programming knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-expert users. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), could offer a promising alternative, enabling robots to be controlled through natural language commands. These LLM-driven systems have the potential to simplify robot interaction by translating high-level language prompts into detailed movement, mapping, and exploration tasks. There is a lack of existing solutions for utilizing natural language commands in certain movement and trajectory tasks, particularly in exploration scenarios. Current approaches are not equipped to effectively translate contextual references (e.g. next to the corner, between doors, towards the nearest unexplored area, etc.) into concrete robot commands. This proposal integrates LLMs with ROS2, SLAM, and NAV2, allowing users to issue natural language commands for detailed navigation, path planning, and mapping tasks including unexplored areas. By reducing the technical barrier to robot control, our system enables more intuitive and flexible human–robot interaction in complex environments, making robotic systems accessible to a broader range of users. In the explored scenarios, the proposed approach successfully transforms most of the users’ textual prompts into a set of robot commands, achieving an F1-score of 0.913 for the successful transformation of entire prompts (composed of multiple sub-prompts) and an F1-score of 0.975 for individual commands.},

  abstract     = {Locking state recognition is one of the key tasks of railway freight monitoring. However, accurate localization and recognition of small locking mechanisms remain major challenges. Current approaches that focus on existing object recognition methods lead to high false detection and miss rates. This paper introduces TrainNet for efficient locking state detection for Open-top wagon doors. A dataset was collected using a robot with a camera to validate our method. We designed an efficient layer aggregation network (ELAN)-S module in our TrainNet, which can be used with YOLOv7. The module efficiently extracts curvilinear features and is integrated into the backbone feature extraction network to enhance the feature representation capability. An LSKCSPC module is also introduced to capture a dynamic receptive field, enabling TrainNet to adjust its receptive field dynamically to the scale of the object, improving its feature representation capacity. Furthermore, the detection head for small-scale objects is redesigned, the feature layer size is increased to enhance the ability to extract and detect fine-grained features. Finally, the loss function is modified to a dynamic fusion-based CNIOU, which reduces the sensitivity of original loss to small objects and improves performance. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieves a mean average precision (mAP50) of 91.5%, which is a 3.6% improvement over the baseline YOLOv7 algorithm. The model weight file size of new algorithm is 60.2MB with 19.5% reduction compared to the baseline. The proposed method achieves 91.5% for detecting the lock status of railway freight open-top wagon side doors, while reducing the complexity of the original algorithm and achieving a real-time detection speed of 39.8fps, meeting the requirements for practical application. The algorithm also exhibits good robustness as demonstrated by experiments on the WiderPerson dataset.},

Aiming at the motion planning problem involved in the decision-making layer of autonomous valet parking, this article proposes a trajectory planning method that obtains global time optimization by solving the optimization problem. The method is based on the path points obtained by the improved hybrid A-star algorithm as the reference waypoints. The global trajectory planning problem is segmented. In each section, the physical system constraints of the vehicle, the boundary condition constraints, and obstacle avoidance constraints in the parking process are comprehensively considered, and the parking trajectory planning task is described as an optimal control problem. The optimal problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem by the numerical optimization method. Finally, the global optimal trajectory is obtained on the basis of ensuring the continuity of state variables and control variables. Simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the algorithm for horizontal and vertical parking. The real vehicle test shows that the vehicle can be safely, quickly, and accurately parked in the parking space.},
