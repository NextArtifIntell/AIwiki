  abstract = {This paper presents a contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) framework for the real-time discovery of multi-contact motions, without predefined contact mode sequences or foothold positions. This approach utilizes the contact-implicit differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework, merging the hard contact model with a linear complementarity constraint. We propose the analytical gradient of the contact impulse based on relaxed complementarity constraints to further the exploration of a variety of contact modes. By leveraging a hard contact model-based simulation and computation of search direction through a smooth gradient, our methodology identifies dynamically feasible state trajectories, control inputs, and contact forces while simultaneously unveiling new contact mode sequences. However, the broadened scope of contact modes does not always ensure real-world applicability. Recognizing this, we implemented differentiable cost terms to guide foot trajectories and make gait patterns. Furthermore, to address the challenge of unstable initial roll-outs in an MPC setting, we employ the multiple shooting variant of DDP. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world demonstrations using a 45 kg HOUND quadruped robot, performing various tasks in simulation and showcasing actual experiments involving a forward trot and a front-leg rearing motion.},

  abstract = {Transfer learning is a conceptually-enticing paradigm in pursuit of truly intelligent embodied agents. The core concept—reusing prior knowledge to learn in and from novel situations—is successfully leveraged by humans to handle novel situations. In recent years, transfer learning has received renewed interest from the community from different perspectives, including imitation learning, domain adaptation, and transfer of experience from simulation to the real world, among others. In this paper, we unify the concept of transfer learning in robotics and provide the first taxonomy of its kind considering the key concepts of robot, task, and environment. Through a review of the promises and challenges in the field, we identify the need of transferring at different abstraction levels, the need of quantifying the transfer gap and the quality of transfer, as well as the dangers of negative transfer. Via this position paper, we hope to channel the effort of the community towards the most significant roadblocks to realize the full potential of transfer learning in robotics.},

  abstract = {Bats exhibit a remarkable ability to create periodic air jets, manifested as pulsating wake structures downstream of their flight path, as they navigate through their fluidic environment. This distinctive skill, driven by their fine-grained and dynamic wing motions, is integral to bats’ unparalleled agility and flight efficiency. We refer to flight led by these dynamic wing adjustments as “ dynamic morphing wing flight.” The robotic emulation of bats’ adept manipulation of their fluidic surroundings offers fresh perspectives for aerial robotics. Nevertheless, the design of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) following the bat’s style presents significant challenges, including constraints related to payload, actuation, and computation. While contemporary MAVs primarily consider body structures as mere hosts for components, our work explores a morphology-centric MAV design that aims to incorporate closed-loop motion control within the structural design itself, termed “computational structures.” To fulfill this objective, we have developed Aerobat, an MAV equipped with dynamic morphing wings, onboard electronics, including actuators, an inertial measurement unit, an onboard camera, and a powerful computer. In the design of Aerobat, we meticulously addressed two specific needs: (1) the generation of gaits using a limited number of high-power actuators, and (2) the regulation of gaits employing an arbitrary number of low-power actuators. Our contributions in this work encompass (1) the introduction of a morphology optimization-based design framework, (2) the demonstration of stable, untethered dynamic morphing flights, and (3) achieving an aerodynamic force enhancement mechanism through wing surface maximization and wing rise-up time minimization.},

  abstract = {Learning-based adaptive control methods hold the potential to empower autonomous agents in mitigating the impact of process variations with minimal human intervention. However, their application to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been constrained by two main challenges: (1) the presence of unknown dynamics in the form of sea current disturbances, which cannot be modelled or measured due to limited sensor capability, particularly on smaller low-cost AUVs, and (2) the nonlinearity of AUV tasks, where the controller response at certain operating points must be excessively conservative to meet specifications at other points. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a solution to these challenges by training versatile neural network policies. Nevertheless, the application of DRL algorithms to AUVs has been predominantly limited to simulated environments due to their inherent high sample complexity and the distribution shift problem. This paper introduces a novel approach by combining the Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning framework with a classic model-based control architecture to formulate an adaptive controller. In this framework, we propose a Sim-to-Real transfer strategy, incorporating a bio-inspired experience replay mechanism, an enhanced domain randomisation technique, and an evaluation protocol executed on a physical platform. Our experimental assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in learning proficient policies from suboptimal simulated models of the AUV. When transferred to a real-world vehicle, the approach exhibits a control performance three times higher compared to its model-based nonadaptive but optimal counterpart.},

  abstract = {Soft robots are challenging to model and control due to their poorly defined kinematics and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been shown capable of constructing control-oriented soft robot models from data. However, building these models requires extensive data collection and they do not necessarily generalize well outside of the training observations. This paper presents a more data-efficient and generalizable approach to soft robot modeling that first identifies a physics-based Koopman model then supplements it with a data-driven residual Koopman model. The resulting combined model is linear and thus compatible with real-time model-based control techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on several simulated systems and on a real soft robot arm, where it is shown to generate models that are more accurate than purely physics-based models and require less data to construct than purely data-driven models. Using a model-based controller, the soft arm is able to successfully track end effector trajectories, perform a pick-and-place task, and write on a dry-erase board, showcasing the applicability of this framework to increase the capabilities of soft robotic systems.},

  abstract = {We present novel, convex relaxations for rotation and pose estimation problems that can a posteriori guarantee global optimality for practical measurement noise levels. Some such relaxations exist in the literature for specific problem setups that assume the matrix von Mises-Fisher distribution (a.k.a., matrix Langevin distribution or chordal distance) for isotropic rotational uncertainty. However, another common way to represent uncertainty for rotations and poses is to define anisotropic noise in the associated Lie algebra. Starting from a noise model based on the Cayley map, we define our estimation problems, convert them to Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQPs), then relax them to Semidefinite Programs (SDPs), which can be solved using standard interior-point optimization methods; global optimality follows from Lagrangian strong duality. We first show how to carry out basic rotation and pose averaging. We then turn to the more complex problem of trajectory estimation, which involves many pose variables with both individual and inter-pose measurements (or motion priors). Our contribution is to formulate SDP relaxations for all these problems based on the Cayley map (including the identification of redundant constraints) and to show them working in practical settings. We hope our results can add to the catalogue of useful estimation problems whose solutions can be a posteriori guaranteed to be globally optimal.},

Novel sensors, such as event and thermal cameras, offer capabilities with the potential to address these scenarios, but they remain to be fully exploited. This paper introduces the Novel Sensors for Autonomous Vehicle Perception (NSAVP) dataset to facilitate future research on this topic. The dataset was captured with a platform including stereo event, thermal, monochrome, and RGB cameras as well as a high precision navigation system providing ground truth poses. The data was collected by repeatedly driving two ∼8 km routes and includes varied lighting conditions and opposing viewpoint perspectives. We provide benchmarking experiments on the task of place recognition to demonstrate challenges and opportunities for novel sensors to enhance critical AV perception tasks. To our knowledge, the NSAVP dataset is the first to include stereo thermal cameras together with stereo event and monochrome cameras.

  abstract = {Open-source benchmark datasets have been a critical component for advancing machine learning for robot perception in terrestrial applications. Benchmark datasets enable the widespread development of state-of-the-art machine learning methods, which require large datasets for training, validation, and thorough comparison to competing approaches. Underwater environments impose several operational challenges that hinder efforts to collect large benchmark datasets for marine robot perception. Furthermore, a low abundance of targets of interest relative to the size of the search space leads to increased time and cost required to collect useful datasets for a specific task. As a result, there is limited availability of labeled benchmark datasets for underwater applications. We present the AI4Shipwrecks dataset, which consists of 28 distinct shipwrecks totaling 286 high-resolution labeled side scan sonar images to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous sonar image understanding. We leverage the unique abundance of targets in Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Lake Huron, MI, to collect and compile a sonar imagery benchmark dataset through surveys with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We consulted with expert marine archaeologists for the labeling of robotically gathered data. We then leverage this dataset to perform benchmark experiments for comparison of state-of-the-art supervised segmentation methods, and we present insights on opportunities and open challenges for the field. The dataset and benchmarking tools will be released as an open-source benchmark dataset to spur innovation in machine learning for Great Lakes and ocean exploration.
