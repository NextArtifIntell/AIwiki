  abstract     = {The successes associated with the Artemis 1 mission have reinforced the interest in deep space exploration, inspiring future missions to the moon and Mars. However, the extended duration and traveling distances of these missions require the development of procedures to accommodate dormant and crewed states and the transitions between them, which results in new risks for both crew and equipment. Consequently, the development of contingency plans is necessary to support crew safety and mission execution during transitions. In this paper we explore the use of the HabSim virtual testbed, a simulation tool for running different disruption scenarios in a space habitat. We perform an illustrative study that involves a disruptive event occurring during the crew ingress into a space habitat that has been dormant for a prolonged time. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how contingency strategies can mitigate the hazard and support a successful transition from dormant to crewed states. Various choices made for recovering the system and completing the transition are explored, involving action rescheduling and agent intervention. The results show how simulations may be used to advance transition and contingency planning, contributing to the safety and success of space missions.},

  abstract     = {Extraterrestrial habitat systems face numerous disruptions throughout their lifecycle, which may threaten crew safety. One serious risk is associated with air pressure leakage, which can occur due to sudden events such as micrometeorite strikes or airlock failures. To ensure proper functionality of the habitat, it is essential to detect the leak and assess its severity, quantified in terms of the leakage area, and communicate that information to the health management system in a meaningful way to support decision-making. A quantitative prediction of the remaining time before the detected fault results in system failure; its time-to-critical is also helpful for making decisions in such a resource-constrained environment. This paper presents a systematic study to develop and examine methods to estimate the current state of a pressurized vessel and predict the time-to-critical. To achieve this estimate in a real-time setting, an augmented extended Kalman filter method is used in conjunction with two noise identification procedures, namely, expectation maximization and variational Bayes. The robustness of the extended Kalman filter method, whether used independently or in conjunction with the expectation maximization or variational Bayesian approaches, is evaluated through a numerical study. The numerical study yields practical strategies for tuning the algorithm hyperparameters so as to obtain more rapid, accurate, and unbiased estimates of the fault intensity and the remaining time-to-critical. The performance and efficiency of these strategies are then experimentally validated by determining the leakage area and time-to-critical in a lab-scale pressure vessel.},

  abstract     = {Space exploration is progressing toward long-term missions that involve both human (HAs) and robotic agents (RAs) in operations in lunar space habitats, the Gateway space station, and the moon-to-Mars program. These missions require high-level intelligence and a sustained performance over extended periods. Analyzing agent performance solely at the task level is insufficient for such complex applications because the resources consumed by agents are coupled with the utility they provide under various conditions. Additionally, factors such as the availability of agents to respond to hazardous events, impacted by factors including human sleep cycles and robot charging times, must be considered. Understanding how resources, utility, and availability are interrelated is crucial for early-phase decision making, assessing logistics, and steering investments in promising directions. In this study, the rapid simulation capabilities of control-oriented dynamic computational modeling (CDCM) were used to explore the trade space involving an HA and an RA tasked with maintaining a smart space habitat. This approach was used to model two independent parallel scenarios as systems of systems that use stochastic methods to account for mission variabilities. A human scientist (HS) was included to quantify the mission’s research outcomes. The outcomes generated by the HS served as a metric to compare the performance of the agents along with the costs associated with engaging the HA and RA.},

  abstract     = {To advance long-term human exploration of the Moon and beyond, developing resilient deep space habitats capable of autonomous operation during both manned and unmanned periods is crucial. Unlike Earth-based buildings, which allow for immediate maintenance and access to external resources, deep space habitats will face significant challenges in addressing damages and disruptions due to the unique environmental conditions in space. Potential hazards such as micrometeorite impacts, moonquakes, internal fires, sensor failures, and power outages pose serious threats to habitat functionality. Given the inevitability of such disturbances, resilient designs would not only minimize the likelihood of system failure but also mitigate overall mission risks. Therefore, evaluating the resilience of deep space habitats under various potential disturbances during the early design phase is necessary before deployment. This paper introduces a resilience-based design evaluation framework for deep space habitats, using a deterministic structural-based habitat simulator (HabSim) along with a performance-based quantitative resilience assessment. HabSim simulates various habitat behaviors to assess the performance and resilience of habitat designs using well-established resilience assessment metrics. An illustrative case study demonstrates the effectiveness and capabilities of the proposed evaluation framework.},

  abstract     = {Reducing fuel consumption for future airplanes is a critical issue. One solution is to design airplanes with a large wing aspect ratio to increase the lift. However, such wings are sensitive to loads induced by gusts. A technique consists of using adaptive wings that modify their shape according to the gust measured ahead of the airplane (the so-called feed-forward gust load alleviation). The gust is typically measured using a wind lidar at the nose of the airplane. To determine the three-dimensional wind field, the lidar is addressed along different axes to obtain the projections of the wind along each of them. In this paper, we present a methodology for reconstructing a gust immersed in wind turbulence from the lidar measurements. The proposed estimation methods are based on the Bayesian filtering theory. Considering simplified models, numerical simulations show the feasibility of such a reconstruction.},

The behavior of a colliding binary liquid droplet is sensitive to the impact velocity, surface wetting properties, and the droplet composition. Modeling molecular dynamics and classical density functional theory studies of impacting droplets as well as interfacial-surface free energies was reported on. The presence of two components in the liquid drop makes the surface collision a complicated problem. During the collision the kinetic energy of the drop is converted into heat. Thus, the temperature varies during the collision and throughout the droplet. Two extreme situations were captured by performing both adiabatic and isothermal simulations. Molecular dynamics and classical density functional theory were used to explore the effects of the mixing parameter on the phase diagram of the binary AB mixed droplets. The location of liquid–vapor and liquid–liquid phase separation was determined. In addition, the value of the interfacial tensions of all interfaces was computed. These can be used to predict when an A-rich and B-rich droplet will stay attached and when it will detach.},

The space harmonic expansion method is used and the principle of virtual work is employed to derive the dynamic effective parameter and transmitted acoustic field. The expression of sound transmission loss is obtained to show the influence of active feedback control. Numerical results denote that the metamaterial shell can enhance the negative effective density and improve sound transmission loss within broadband regions. Moreover, the finite element simulation and experiment in the anechoic room are performed to support the theoretical predictions.

  abstract     = {Modern noncontact measurement techniques such as the three-dimensional scanning laser Doppler vibrometry (3D SLDV) are advantageous in measuring vibrations of lightweight, thin-walled aerospace structures, which were conventionally deemed as difficult or not feasible to apply using attached transducers. Nevertheless, the full-field measurements using 3D SLDV are still limited to extracting modal properties of linear structures, while measurements of complex nonlinear structures are rarely reported. This paper aims to extend the full-field measurement capability of 3D SLDV and combines it with a multiple-input–single-output vibration controller to deal with nonlinear structures. An advanced test strategy is introduced, which is capable of obtaining amplitude-dependent resonant frequencies, modal damping ratios, and full-field, multiharmonic mode shapes of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs). Conflicting parameters such as the frequency resolution and measurement time are optimized by combining phase separation and phase resonance testing techniques in a coherent strategy. The capabilities of the proposed nonlinear modal testing strategy are demonstrated on a realistic, large-scale fan blade that exhibits softening behaviors. Two of its NNMs were investigated at larger vibration amplitudes. Its nonlinear modal parameters were successfully extracted and validated, highlighting the time efficiency and data accuracy of the proposed strategy for measuring industrial-scale, lightweight nonlinear structures.},

In this study, the simulation specimens were designed based on the mortise structure. Fatigue tests were conducted to explore the failure mechanism under fatigue loading. Elastic-plastic finite element analyses were performed subsequently to investigate the distribution of local mean stress and stress gradient near the notch. Considering the influence of local mean stress and stress gradient, a novel fatigue life prediction method was proposed based on the theory of critical distance (TCD). This method overcomes the disadvantages of the TCD in which the critical distance cannot be determined beforehand and the requirement of a complex iterative process when predicting fatigue life. By using this method, the predicted fatigue life of the simulation specimens under different loads is within error factor.},

In this work, the constant leading-edge blowing technique is deployed to achieve joint effects on anti-icing and drag reduction, first on an airfoil and then on a half-airplane model. The results indicate that dual virtual surfaces (an inner one and an outer one) wrapping the leading edge are generated by the blowing control. The inner one prevents water droplets from impacting and accumulating on the airfoil by changing their trajectories. The outer one redirects the shear generated by the blowing and promotes its rolling up and vortex shedding, generating low-pressure zones around the upper leading edge and subsequently reducing drag significantly.},

A compressible extension of the flamelet progress variable method has been proposed and tested for use with large-eddy simulations or Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes analyses of the burning of methane in pure air and vitiated air; the latter being particularly relevant in turbine burner scenarios. Effects of the level of detail of the reaction mechanism on the subgrid- and resolved-scale computations are studied. A comparison is made with results obtained using a simplified one-step reaction. The numerical results employing the flamelet model with the more detailed reaction mechanism show faster chemistry, significantly reduced peak temperatures, and stronger sensitivity to pressure. Vitiated air flames are found to be dominated by unstable solutions, resulting in a weak flame with substantially lower peak temperature and impeded development, struggling to persist without quenching.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the issue of tangential mode combustion oscillation prevalent in aviation engine afterburners, this study targets bluff body diffusion flames. Innovatively, acoustic cavities were installed on either side of the bluff body flame, forming a tangential mode oscillation. The study employed experimental methods to study the flame pulsation characteristics under tangential oscillation, identifying the phase distribution of the flame front as a distinct feature differentiating it from conventional longitudinal mode oscillation. Furthermore, it was noted that the multiperiodic pulsation of the flame surface significantly contributes to the complex variability of the flame transfer function/flame description function. The research then established a phase relationship among velocity pulsation, pressure pulsation, and heat release rate pulsation, uncovering the phase coupling mechanism inherent in oscillatory combustion. It also delved into the impact of equivalence ratio and bluff body structure on tangential mode oscillation. Modifications to the bluff body structure led to a significant suppression of oscillation, reducing the amplitude by up to 81.3%. Thus, the study concluded that the flame dynamic response characteristics play a crucial role in determining the thermoacoustic coupling intensity, especially when the combustion system’s acoustic properties are stable. This finding lays a theoretical foundation for future endeavors to mitigate tangential mode oscillatory combustion in afterburners.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian updating is an effective method for refining the random distribution model of the system when new observational information is gathered. To deal with the problem with multisource uncertainty, a Bayesian updating method under random and interval hybrid uncertainties is originally established in this paper. In the proposed method, the likelihood function is firstly built by considering the error of the observation and the hybrid uncertainties of the model prediction. Then, the posterior information of the random model inputs can be refined based on the defined likelihood function and the prior information. Finally, to efficiently obtain the posterior information of the random model inputs, an adaptive kriging method is developed. In this method, different learning functions are employed to accurately predict the extrema and classify the candidate samples, respectively. The significant novelty of the proposed adaptive kriging method is to design a posterior statistical information-oriented stop criterion. Four computational examples are used to illustrate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed Bayesian updating method.},

The findings reveal that, under identical average incoming velocities but with a velocity gradient along the jet direction in the crossflow, the jet breakup mode changes due to the variable aerodynamic pressures exerted on the jet and crossflow interface; when the gradient changes from positive to negative, the positive gradient delays the transition of the breakup mode while the negative gradient breaks up earlier, and the spray plume distribution differs, showing three characteristics: elevated oblique throw, oblique throw, and collapse. The penetration height is governed not only by the increment of the momentum flux ratio but is also profoundly influenced by the velocity gradient. Contrasting the uniform flow, the penetration height increases for positive gradients and decreases for negative gradients. Consequently, the empirical formula for the penetration height found based on uniform crossflow is not applicable, and this paper introduces an empirical correlation embracing a novel dimensionless parameter, calibrated for diverse crossflow gradients and generalized operational contexts, aiming to refine atomization characteristics and enhance the atomization model within nonuniform crossflows.},

Employing high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations, the flow field is simulated in climb condition. Subsequently, acoustic transport to far-field observers is conducted using the Ffowcs–Williams and Hawkings equation. Because the noise mechanisms of such a configuration are not fully understood yet, several permeable and impermeable surfaces as input for the acoustic simulation are used, aiming to separate the various noise source contributions. Results reveal that in addition to the rotor-alone noise from the propellers, noise arising from propeller–wing interaction emerges as dominant, emitting mostly at the blade passing frequency. Moreover, a boundary element method tool is applied to observe the scattering effect of propeller-generated noise by the wing. Furthermore, this study incorporates consideration of structural components in close proximity to the model, thereby achieving a more realistic acoustic field. With this knowledge, the simulation is validated with experimental data from an open wind tunnel test campaign. An overall good agreement is observed between the simulated and experimental results, substantiating the reliability of both aerodynamic and acoustic predictions.},

Both represent the prominent noise sources for the trailing-edge noise radiation. When a LEBU is placed strategically at the outer part of a turbulent boundary-layer, the wall pressure spectra can establish a self-similar behavior against , which is a normalized separation distance between the LEBU’s trailing-edge and the targeted location for noise mitigation. It is found that has to be greater than 3 to achieve an overall reduction in the wall pressure fluctuations. What appears to be the optimal LEBU configuration for the mitigation of wall pressure fluctuations, however, will not be reciprocated in the lateral coherence length. The combined effect would render the LEBU rather ineffective to reduce the frequency-integrated, overall noise radiation. Our previous study has confirmed that riblets, a near-wall source-targeting device, is more effective in the mitigation of the lateral coherence length.

Definitions include those corresponding to Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-H) and supersonic instability (SI) Mach waves, and an empirical formulation. Under convectively supersonic conditions without an afterburner (AB), only K-H waves are present. At AB, SI Mach waves may exist, but at shallow angles outside the main radiation lobe. Evidence suggests that Mach wave radiation from faster-than-ordinary K-H waves could stem from shock-cell velocity fluctuations. The empirical convective Mach number indicates decreasing effective convective velocity from to of fully expanded velocity as engine power increases to AB. This convective velocity decreases with frequency, especially for those whose maximum source locations occur between the potential and supersonic core tips. Additionally, a new definition of supersonic-jet convective Mach number, dependent solely on the jet acoustic Mach number, has been derived from wide-ranging jet data. This definition describes the F404 maximum noise radiation angle from intermediate thrust through AB within 2°. Relating this expression to K-H Mach waves for an isothermal jet indicates the relative unimportance of temperature in determining maximum radiation angle for heated supersonic jets, including military jet aircraft and rockets.},

The additional growth rate depends on the pore geometries, more generally on the impedance of the porous surface. It is shown that the amplitude growth is not dependent on the suction flow through the pores, assuming the boundary layer profile remains constant. This is realized by the use of source terms in the boundary layer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that partitioning the chamber can mitigate the additional amplification.

Using an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation, the effects of the dynamic variations in blade pitch are investigated on the unsteady aerodynamic behavior of an NREL-5 MW wind turbine. The results show that the wake after a pitching maneuver exhibits a local contraction region, resulting in the leapfrogging phenomenon of tip vortices. The influences of different pitch ranges and pitch rates on the aerodynamic behavior of the wind turbine are studied. The degree of wake contraction depends strongly on the pitch range, whereas an increase in pitch rate is mainly dominated by the shed vorticity, indicating a larger deviation from the quasi-state behavior. In addition, interaction between the shed vorticity and the neighboring tip vortex is observed in the near wake under the condition at a fast pitch rate, which may have an influence on the mutual inductance instability.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing attractors of airfoil systems from observations facilitates understanding of aeroelasticity, especially the onset of flutter. However, it is generally difficult due to observation noise and the nonlinear nature of the underlying dynamics. In this study, a hybrid strategy is proposed which incorporates data preprocessing and next generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) for reconstructing attractors of an airfoil system. This approach first estimates the system states from noisy observations via a state estimation method and then trains the NG-RC model to predict the responses of the airfoil system. The NG-RC employs nonlinear functions of past states to approximate the dynamics, requiring less training data and fewer hyperparameters than the conventional reservoir computing. To reduce the model complexity, both and smoothed norm penalties are introduced to promote the sparsity of trainable weights, where the optimal weights are determined by simple iterative optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed method can predict various vibration patterns and reconstruct the attractors of the airfoil system from limited, noisy observations. The smoothed norm penalty can lead to sparser weights and, in some cases, enhance performance. The findings support applications of the present method like flutter boundary prediction and flight accident analysis.},

The fluidic actuation enables effective operation at larger flap deflections while diminishing the sensitivity to cove characteristics. The performance of the actuator array varies with both the jet momentum coefficient and the spanwise periodic jet spacing. It is shown that the lift increment per jet, which for a sufficiently sparse jet array is invariant with jet spacing, diminishes as jet spacing is reduced due to spanwise jet interactions. Accordingly, the overall lift increment scales with the number of active jets and jet density, and a characteristic spanwise jet spacing is identified for optimal performance.},

They are essential for accurately capturing the behavior of physical systems whenever the simulation domain is truncated for computational efficiency purposes. Ideally, an artificial BC would allow relevant information to enter or leave the computational domain without introducing artifacts or unphysical effects. Boundary conditions designed to control spurious wave reflections are referred to as nonreflective boundary conditions (NRBCs). Another approach is given by the perfectly matched layers (PMLs), in which the computational domain is extended with multiple dampening layers, where outgoing waves are absorbed exponentially in time. In this work, the definition of PML is revised in the context of the lattice Boltzmann method. The impact of adopting different types of BCs at the edge of the dampening zone is evaluated and compared, in terms of both accuracy and computational costs. It is shown that for sufficiently large buffer zones, PMLs allow stable and accurate simulations even when using a simple zeroth-order extrapolation BC. Moreover, employing PMLs in combination with NRBCs potentially offers significant gains in accuracy at a modest computational overhead, provided the parameters of the BC are properly tuned to match the properties of the underlying fluid flow.},

For this setup, accurate predictions of those structures are possible with a large-eddy simulation on a fine mesh resolving till the Batchelor microscales. Utilizing the open-source lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) framework, OpenLB, a benchmark simulation of the reacting micromixer, is re-established with new, more precise computation results. In this context, a Schmidt-number-based stabilization method for LBM-discretized reactive advection–diffusion equations by laminar secondary flow structures is used. A convergence study is performed, which is also a novelty. All computations have been performed on the high-performance computing cluster HoreKa using up to 160 NVIDIA A100 graphics processing units.},

  abstract     = {This article examines the evolution of transonic shock buffet on the OAT15A supercritial airfoil, aspiring to elucidate some of the causes of disparate buffet-relevant settings reported in the literature. Experimental campaigns on three distinct chord lengths are conducted thus resulting in chord Reynolds numbers of , and . Continuous variations in Mach and AoA allow mapping the shock wave behavior across a large parameter space and capturing the transition between prebuffet, onset, developed buffet, and offset. High-speed focusing schlieren imaging is employed to extract the temporal and spectral nature of buffet and to deduce key quantities that characterize the unsteadiness. Three-dimensional effects along the span due to interference with the side walls are assessed thoroughly, revealing that phases of upstream shock motion and large separation are accompanied by 3D distortion. Even though this effect gains relevance at reduced aspect ratio, a substantially 2D character of the shock surface around the centerplane is confirmed. Fully developed buffet governed by a 2D buffet mode is proven to exist across all test cases, although the buffet peak condition is gradually shifted toward reduced angle of attack, yet greater Mach number with increased Reynolds number. Conversely, accompanied by severely increased angles of attack, the buffet mechanism appears more volatile for small chord length and is consolidated with enlarged chord, which strongly suggests a dependence on the state of the turbulent boundary layer.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic coupling between a Mach 1.94 shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction (SBLI) and a flexible panel is investigated. High-order numerical simulations are performed for distinctly different dynamic panel motions and rigid snapshots of their maximum deflected shape. They are compared with a baseline interaction over a rigid planar wall. The panel’s dynamic surface motions were obtained from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) wind tunnel experiments. The primary aim of the study was to determine whether there were any differences in the flow pressure loading on the compliant panel due to the various rigid and dynamic deformations considered. The results show that the examined panel deformations increase the SBLI size near the panel midpoint, where the deformation amplitude tends to be the largest. Relative to the rigid planar case, the examined surface deformations cause the mean-flow high-pressure surface loading caused by the impinging shock wave to shift downstream along the compliant panel midspan, albeit by a small amount. The spectrogram of the dynamic deformation and the flow surface pressure response suggests that the two are strongly coupled at the dominant (primary) mode but less so at the secondary modes. Although the primary mode frequencies overlap, they do not exactly match, with the pressure response frequency always being slightly higher in all three cases. The rigid deformations did not enhance the pressure power content at the SBLI. However, pre-SBLI and near the panel leading edge, the pressure power spectrum weakly increased throughout the resolved frequency range and overlapped with the onset of the amplification found in the dynamic deformation cases. Post-SBLI, the rigid deformations cause a weak enhancement at frequencies below 1 kHz, which closely match the dominant and secondary pressure response frequencies obtained in the dynamic cases.},

  abstract     = {In this report, we investigate the onset of chaotic flutter in laminar and turbulent flows over a two-dimensional semi-infinite panel using time-accurate fluid–structure interaction (FSI) simulations of shock–boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs). Results indicate that the critical dynamic pressure and the nature of the panel dynamics strongly depend on the static pressure differential across the shock, the local loading, the viscous and turbulent damping in the flow, and the formation of dynamic flow separation bubbles due to the SBLIs. The structural system undergoes local instability (Hopf bifurcation) when the local loading due to panel deformation overcomes the static pressure differential across the shock. In the absence of external fluid instabilities, the structural oscillations will induce unsteadiness in the flowfield, resulting in low-frequency limit-cycle oscillations. Viscous and turbulent damping in the boundary layer also delays the bifurcation and reduces the amplitude of the oscillations. Sufficiently strong shocks can produce localized flow separations, which drive additional boundary-layer instabilities, resulting in an early bifurcation. In the presence of external fluid instabilities, the behavior of the FSI strongly depends on the nonlinear coupling of their instabilities. Chaotic oscillations are observed when the fluid instabilities are dominant enough to induce structural oscillations with broadband frequencies.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive investigation into the flow over a hollow-cylinder and flare has been conducted at Mach 5 with transitional Reynolds numbers. Experiments of two similar models have been conducted in LT5 at the University of Arizona and R2Ch at ONERA. Considerable differences in reattachment behavior were observed from infrared thermography measurements indicating that the reattachment in LT5 was approximately twice as far from the flare base as observed in R2Ch. Supporting simulations have been performed at the University of Arizona and the Technical University of Munich. Various effects are reviewed: Mach numbers and wall temperatures modulating boundary-layer development, 3D relief effects due to differences in normalized cylinder diameters, leading-edge bluntness effects, and the impact of freestream disturbances. Simulations show that modulation of freestream noise amplitude can scale the interaction size to match experiments. Experimental investigation of the respective noise environment between the two facilities showed that despite exhibiting similar noise magnitudes, they differed considerably in frequency content, suggesting that additional parameters are required when quantifying wind tunnel freestream noise conditions. These discrepancies are believed to lead to greater seeding of shear layer instabilities in R2Ch, resulting in faster transition, consistent with the experimentally observed smaller recirculation bubble.},

  abstract     = {Porous boundary-layer bleed alleviates the detrimental effects of shock/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs) in high-speed vehicles. However, many underlying mechanisms through which bleed influences SBLI dynamics remain poorly understood, including unsteady separation mitigation, effects on low-frequency spectra, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) modulation. Proper resolution of the dynamics of these phenomena motivates the use of wall-resolved large-eddy simulations. The configuration is based on experiments at Mach 2.5 and a momentum-thickness Reynolds number of 2800, on which a shock of flow-deflection angle of 8 deg impinges. Porous bleed patches are considered with resolution of the flow structure in individual holes. Two different suction strengths are examined, denoted “half-” and “full-bleed” cases based on the sonic mass flow coefficient. Although both bleed cases localize and reduce the mean reversed flow region, only the full-bleed case successfully reduces unsteadiness, TKE, wall-pressure loading, and overall distortion due to the SBLIs. These distinctions are reflected in various local and global effects of bleed, which are examined with three-dimensional modal analysis. Among the key findings is energy shifting from the low-frequency separation behavior to a higher-frequency signature, which modulates the bleed-associated shocks and expansions. Overall, the study highlights the complex interactions between individual bleed-hole flow structures that cumulatively yield the observed overall effects, which are important in optimizing bleed systems for various design objectives.},
