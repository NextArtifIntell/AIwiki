To obtain higher-fidelity solutions, a variable-specific-impulse variable-thrust (VIVT) solar electric propulsion (SEP) system subject to solar power and duty-cycle constraints is considered. We also consider both regularized and nonregularized formulations of the indirect methods. We use an L2-norm-based regularization for smoothly embedding discontinuous events (e.g., throttle-control and power-input switches) to form a multiparameter family of smooth Hamiltonian boundary-value problems (BVPs), which are solved through a numerical continuation method. The solution to the regularized BVP is then used to initialize and solve an event-detection-based, nonregularized BVP. For the direct method formulation, a forward-shooting scheme is proposed with the introduction of an important power constraint to avoid overestimation of the performance of the VIVT SEP system. Two minimum-fuel interplanetary trajectories are solved with over 300 duty-cycle-driven thrust switches. The results of the both indirect and direct methods are compared. Initialized by the regularized solution, the nonregularized solution results in a noticeable improvement in the final mass value over the regularized indirect method and compared to the solutions obtained from the direct method.},

  abstract     = {High-precision and fast-response attitude control of launch vehicles plays an increasingly important role in numerous space launch missions, ensuring the efficiency of space transportation. However, disturbances caused by liquid sloshing and external environments degrade the control performances seriously. Because of the complicated coupling with control inputs and angular acceleration, the dynamics of liquid sloshing disturbance are highly uncertain. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel disturbance estimation methods for launch vehicles by thoroughly analyzing disturbance dynamics. In this paper, an observer-based predefined-time attitude control method aimed at achieving precise and rapid estimation of liquid sloshing disturbance and other external disturbances is proposed. More specifically, a prescribed-time reduced-order state observer is proposed for estimating the liquid sloshing disturbance and the unmeasurable system state, leveraging the specific characteristics and inherent coupling relations of liquid sloshing disturbance. Additionally, a prescribed-time extended state observer is introduced for estimating external disturbances and nonlinear terms. Subsequently, by employing a predefined-time output feedback controller, a composite control law is proposed to enhance the antidisturbance capabilities of rigid–liquid coupled launch vehicles. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This paper presents a control synthesis method for a hypersonic vehicle with the purpose of guaranteeing robust stability during flight testing when accurate analytic vehicle models are unavailable. Conventional model-based approaches typically rely on curve fitting of numerical simulation and test data, which can introduce inaccuracies. Our proposed approach assumes knowledge of the linear form of the ordinary differential equation and uses quadratic constraints to bound sampled data that accounts for the nonlinear and uncertain portion of the model for controller synthesis by iteratively solving convex semidefinite programs. A numerical example demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method is performed before applying the technique to a nonlinear hypersonic vehicle found in the literature. Using the synthesized stabilizing controller, we demonstrate that the vehicle states remain within a certified bound given a known harmonic excitation when initiated from a quantified set of allowable initial conditions. Based on these simulation results, our proposed control synthesis method shows promise in ensuring robustness when performing hypersonic vehicle flight testing.},

  abstract     = {To limit the spread of space debris, space situational awareness (SSA) delineates guidelines to preserve current space assets. Developing effective collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) strategies is emerging as a global top priority among the considered countermeasures to debris-generating events. Despite most encounters happening over very short time frames, some conjunctions occur over a longer time window, such as in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), where the involved objects may have small relative velocities. Besides, external perturbations, particularly the geopotential, lunisolar, and solar radiation pressure ones, exert forces on the spacecraft, causing it to deviate from its designated slot and potentially endanger neighboring satellites. This issue is compounded when considering state uncertainty. The presented work, therefore, introduces convex optimization approaches for long-term CAM and tailored stochastic station-leeping (SK) policy regarding longitude and latitude in this regime. The formulation enables continuous CAM and chance-constrained SK, ensuring satellite adherence to an assigned GEO slot with a given probability. Two kinds of chance constraints are devised: the first one does not consider the correlation between longitude and latitude, but the latter does.},

Statistical distance-based approaches are not always enough when dealing with controlled objects, leading to alternative correlation metrics that exploit the effort linking the track to candidate orbits. This work describes a novel optical measurement correlation assistance tool, exploiting optimal control theory to backpropagate an admissible region of observables to catalog epochs through a patchwork of Taylor polynomial expansions. The resulting minimum expense distributions are combined with a standard statistical distance to support the correlation of maneuvering objects. A sensitivity analysis on the defined metrics is performed on a set of synthetic scenarios involving impulsive maneuvers, chosen to easily connect the detected expense and effect on the orbit to the features of the control action.},

  abstract     = {In the context of space situational awareness, orbit determination and maneuver detection pose considerable challenges given the ever increasing number of noncooperative satellites that perform unspecified maneuvers at unknown epochs. A new metric is proposed for maneuver detection here, based on measurements from a single surveillance radar. Data from the radar track are leveraged to derive this metric; it can flag the occurrence of a maneuver since the last time a satellite was observed. In the scenarios considered in this work, the main challenge is having just a few available observations in between long propagations. Thus, a realistic quantification of uncertainty becomes crucial; Gaussian mixtures are chosen for this work. The propagated state is compared against the radar track data to compute a well-known cost metric, the evidence in Bayes’s update, similar to the Mahalanobis distance (MD). The contribution of this work lies in using the variation of the cost metric across track points to define a new maneuver detection metric. The focus is on testing this new metric in diverse and realistic scenarios to gain practical intuition about its performance and limitations. The preliminary results are promising, simultaneously improving upon the classical MD at maneuver detection and reducing false positives.},

  abstract     = {Target evasion from modern missiles is a very challenging task because modern interception missiles usually have substantial agility and maneuver advantages over the target. This paper proposes novel near-optimal evasion strategies from any linear missile guidance law that exploit the pursuer’s two main weaknesses: the inherent time delay of the evader’s acceleration estimate and the pursuer’s acceleration bound. In the derivation, the pursuer and the evader are assumed to have arbitrary-order linear dynamics with bounded acceleration commands. The pursuer is assumed to have a delayed evader acceleration estimation, and the evader is assumed to know the pursuer’s guidance law. The problem is posed as a bounded optimal control problem with the miss distance as the performance index, and the necessary analytical optimality conditions are derived. The problem is then solved iteratively using backward and forward propagation of the costate and state dynamics until the solution converges. Furthermore, an additional gradient-descent-based algorithm is derived to improve the performance and robustness of the solution. The evasion strategies are extensively evaluated in deterministic and stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the proposed evasion strategies have substantially better evasion performance than state-of-the-art evasion strategies that only exploit the pursuer’s estimation delay.},

Additionally, a brief development of the equations of motion for a quadrotor with a flexible structure is provided as background for the nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom flight simulation results. Robustness properties of the optimal sliding Gaussian controller are evaluated using singular value analysis of linearized models of the closed-loop quadrotor with a flexible structure.

By extending the transfer time function into the complex plane, an exact solution is derived for Lambert’s boundary value problem. This solution is a function of complex contour integrals of the transfer time function that must be approximated numerically. For integrals of this type, the composite trapezoidal rule is exponentially convergent and is used to approximate the solution to a high degree of accuracy for both zero- and -revolution Lambert problems. Different families of contours are presented for the cases of hyperbolic, zero-revolution elliptic, and -revolution elliptic transfers, and numerical examples are presented for all the cases. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates a direct tradeoff between accuracy and computation speed based on the number of points used to approximate the integrals. When choosing a number of points with a balanced accuracy to speed, this method demonstrates an exceptionally fast computation speed, faster than all other methods we compare to in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-integer optimal control problems (MIOCPs) frequently arise in the domain of optimal control problems (OCPs) when decisions including integer variables are involved. However, existing state-of-the-art approaches for solving MIOCPs are often plagued by drawbacks such as high computational costs, low precision, and compromised optimality. In this study, we propose a novel multiphase scheme coupled with an iterative second-order cone programming (SOCP) algorithm to efficiently and effectively address these challenges in MIOCPs. In the first phase, we relax the discrete decision constraints and account for the terminal state constraints and certain path constraints by introducing them as penalty terms in the objective function. After formulating the problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, we propose the iterative SOCP algorithm to solve general QCQPs. In the second phase, we reintroduce the discrete decision constraints to generate the final solution. We substantiate the efficacy of our proposed multiphase scheme and iterative SOCP algorithm through successful application to two practical MIOCPs in planetary exploration missions.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of accommodating nonlinear dynamics and constraints in rapid trajectory optimization with impulsive maneuvers, envisioned for use in the context of onboard guidance. We present a novel framework that uniquely employs overparameterized monomial coordinates and precomputed fundamental solution expansions to facilitate rapid optimization while minimizing real-time computational requirements. The fundamental solution expansions are precomputed about an uncontrolled reference trajectory using differential algebra. Unlike traditional approaches that repeatedly evaluate the nonlinear dynamics and constraints as part of complex shooting or collocation-based schemes, this method replaces the nonlinearity inherent to dynamics and constraint functions entirely with a computationally simpler manifold constraint. With this approach, trajectory optimization is posed efficiently as a path-planning problem on the manifold. This problem is entirely convex except for the manifold constraint, readily lending itself to solution via sequential convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in computing fast and accurate Δ optimal solutions for long-range spacecraft rendezvous, including problems with nonlinear state constraints.},

  abstract     = {Tracking a reference trajectory is a frequent task in aerospace guidance. The technical approaches for tracking guidance design so far are largely application-dependent and heavily rely on labor-intensive practices such as manual gain generation. In this paper the model predictive control (MPC) method is used as the foundation for a systematic tracking guidance design, dubbed appropriately model predictive guidance (MPG). Unlike most existing work utilizing MPC, the method developed in this paper does not require a quadratic program (QP) solver. Instead, the constrained QP from the discretization of the MPC problem is strategically formulated in a novel way so that it has only box constraints. An exceedingly simple but globally convergent fixed-point algorithm with a theoretical guarantee is developed to solve the QP. The relatively general formulation of the MPG problem, the automated tracking command generation, and the very simple yet highly reliable algorithm render this method appealing to many tracking guidance problems and autonomous operations. The application of MPG is demonstrated in planetary powered descent guidance for a high-mass Mars mission.},
