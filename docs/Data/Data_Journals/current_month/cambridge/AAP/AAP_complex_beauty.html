  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the applications of Tail Variance (TV) as a measure of tail riskiness and the confidence level of using Tail Conditional Expectation (TCE)-based risk capital. While TCE measures the expected loss of a risk that exceeds a certain threshold, TV measures the variability of risk along its tails. We first derive analytical formulas of TV and TCE for a large variety of probability distributions. These formulas are useful instruments for relevant research works on tail risk measures. We then propose a distribution-free approach utilizing TV to estimate the lower bounds of the confidence level of using TCE-based risk capital. In doing so, we introduce sharpened conditional probability inequalities, which halve the bounds of conventional Markov and Cantelli inequalities. Such an approach is easy to implement. We further investigate the characterization of tail risks by TV through an exploration of TV’s asymptotics. A distribution-free limit formula is derived for the asymptotics of TV. To further investigate the asymptotic properties, we consider two broad distribution families defined on tails, namely, the polynomial-tailed distributions and the exponential-tailed distributions. The two distribution families are found to exhibit an asymptotic equivalence between TV and the reciprocal square of the hazard rate. We also establish asymptotic relationships between TCE and VaR for the two families. Our asymptotic analysis contributes to the existing research by unifying the asymptotic expressions and the convergence rate of TV for Student-t distributions, exponential distributions, and normal distributions, which complements the discussion on the convergence rate of univariate cases in [28]. To show the usefulness of our results, we present two case studies based on real data from the industry. We first show how to use conditional inequalities to assess the confidence of using TCE-based risk capital for different types of insurance businesses. Then, for financial data, we provide alternative evidence for the relationship between the data frequency and the tail categorization by the asymptotics of TV.},

Relying on the theory developed by Saulis and Statulevicius in Limit Theorems for Large Deviations (Kluwer, 1991) and on a fine control of the cumulants of the first chaoses, we also derive moderate deviation principles, Bernstein-type concentration inequalities, and normal approximation bounds with Cramér correction terms for the same variables. The aforementioned results are then applied to Poisson shot noise processes and, in particular, to the generalized compound Hawkes point processes (a class of stochastic models, introduced in this paper, which generalizes classical Hawkes processes).

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a joint drift rate control and two-sided impulse control problem in which the system manager adjusts the drift rate as well as the instantaneous relocation for a Brownian motion, with the objective of minimizing the total average state-related cost and control cost. The system state can be negative. Assuming that instantaneous upward and downward relocations take a different cost structure, which consists of both a setup cost and a variable cost, we prove that the optimal control policy takes an $\left\{ {\!\left( {{s^{\ast}},{q^{\ast}},{Q^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}} \right),\!\left\{ {{\mu ^{\ast}}(x)\,:\,x \in [ {{s^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}}]} \right\}} \right\}$ form. Specifically, the optimal impulse control policy is characterized by a quadruple $\left( {{s^{\ast}},{q^{\ast}},{Q^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}} \right)$ , under which the system state will be immediately relocated upwardly to ${q^{\ast}}$ once it drops to ${s^{\ast}}$ and be immediately relocated downwardly to ${Q^{\ast}}$ once it rises to ${S^{\ast}}$ ; the optimal drift rate control policy will depend solely on the current system state, which is characterized by a function ${\mu ^{\ast}}\!\left( \cdot \right)$ for the system state staying in $[ {{s^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}}]$ . By analyzing an associated free boundary problem consisting of an ordinary differential equation and several free boundary conditions, we obtain these optimal policy parameters and show the optimality of the proposed policy using a lower-bound approach. Finally, we investigate the effect of the system parameters on the optimal policy parameters as well as the optimal system’s long-run average cost numerically.},

The optimal stopping times forming a Nash equilibrium are shown to be the first times at which the original process hits certain boundaries depending on the running values of the associated maximum and minimum processes. The proof is based on the reduction of the original game to the equivalent coupled free-boundary problem and the solution of the latter problem by means of the smooth-fit and normal-reflection conditions. We show that the optimal stopping boundaries are partially determined as either unique solutions to the appropriate system of arithmetic equations or unique solutions to the appropriate first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The results obtained are related to the valuation of the perpetual lookback game options with floating strikes in the appropriate diffusion-type extension of the Black–Merton–Scholes model.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes single-item continuous-review inventory models with random supplies in which the inventory dynamic between orders is described by a diffusion process, and a long-term average cost criterion is used to evaluate decisions. The models in this class have general drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points that are consistent with the notion that demand should tend to reduce the inventory level. Random yield is described by a (probability) transition function which depends on the inventory on hand and the nominal amount ordered; it is assumed to be a distribution with support in the interval determined by the order-from and the nominal order-to locations of the stock level. Using weak convergence arguments involving average expected occupation and ordering measures, conditions are given for the optimality of an ( s , S ) ordering policy in the general class of policies with finite expected cost. The characterization of the cost of an ( s , S ) policy as a function of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear optimization problem over the stock levels s and S , and the existence of an optimizing pair $(s^*,S^*)$ is established under weak conditions. Thus, optimal policies of inventory models with random supplies can (easily) be numerically computed. The range of applicability of the optimality result is illustrated on several inventory models with random yields.},

This paper studies how the perturbation of MCMC affects the convergence speed and approximation accuracy. Our results show that when the original Markov chain converges to stationarity fast enough and the perturbed transition kernel is a good approximation to the original transition kernel, the corresponding perturbed sampler has fast convergence speed and high approximation accuracy as well. Our convergence analysis is conducted under either the Wasserstein metric or the $\chi^2$ metric, both are widely used in the literature. The results can be extended to obtain non-asymptotic error bounds for MCMC estimators. We demonstrate how to apply our convergence and approximation results to the analysis of specific sampling algorithms, including Random walk Metropolis, Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm with perturbed target densities, and parallel tempering Monte Carlo with perturbed densities. Finally, we present some simple numerical examples to verify our theoretical claims.},

As a second contribution, we investigate the ergodic properties in the special case where the jumps consist of births and deaths, a situation observed in several applications including epidemiology, ecology, and microbiology. Based on a coupling argument, we obtain conditions for convergence to a stationary measure with a geometric rate of convergence. Throughout the article, we illustrate our results using general examples of systems of interacting particles in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with births and deaths. We show that in some cases the stationary measure can be made explicit and corresponds to a Gibbs measure on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ . Our examples include in particular Gibbs measures associated to repulsive Lennard-Jones potentials and to Riesz potentials.},

The de Finetti measure describes the interaction between voters and possible outside influences on them. We assume that for each population size there is a (potentially) different de Finetti measure, and as the population grows, the sequence of de Finetti measures converges weakly to the Dirac measure at the origin, representing a tendency toward weakening social cohesion as the population grows large. The resulting model covers a wide variety of behaviours, ranging from independent voting in the limit under fast convergence, a critical convergence speed with its own pattern of behaviour, to a subcritical convergence speed which yields a model in line with empirical evidence of real-world voting data, contrary to previous probabilistic models used in the study of voting.
