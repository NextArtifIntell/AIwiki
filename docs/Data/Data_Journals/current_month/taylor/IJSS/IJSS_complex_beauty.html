Firstly, a novel critical-information-based attack policy is developed from the attackers&#39; angle, resulting in severe destructiveness by targeting crucial packers evaluated by the proposed importance standard. Subsequently, it is proven theoretically that there are positive correlation among attack parameters, attack success probability, and system performance. Secondly, from a security defender&#39;s perspective, a security protection strategy based on an encoding-decoding mechanism is proposed, founded on a thorough understanding of the attack mechanism. This approach aims to mislead attackers by preventing them from obtaining correct data packets, thereby leading to incorrect attack judgments, and ultimately enhancing system estimation performance through secure data transmission. Finally, two simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed critical-information-based attack strategy and the encoding-decoding mechanism.},

Then, a novel distributed extended state observer is designed to enable each tracking USV to estimate the position and velocity of the target USV. Secondly, a novel data fusion algorithm is proposed to obtain the accurate estimation of the position and velocity of the target USV.

For this purpose, first, a new integer order system is introduced and its convergence to zero exponentially within an arbitrary time is proven. Using this system, a novel adaptive exponential arbitrary time sliding mode controller is established to synchronise the fractional order chaotic systems. Then, to estimate the disturbance terms of the fractional systems an exponential arbitrary time disturbance observer is developed. The use of the disturbance observer can lead to simple controller design, low chattering control input, and more accurate response. Finally, a disturbance observer based sliding mode control is presented, that by incorporating the disturbance estimation in controller design ensures synchronisation of chaotic systems. The exponential arbitrary time synchronisation and the stability of the closed loop control system are confirmed using the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results on synchronisation of different fractional order systems, validate the proposed control schemes. It is noteworthy that the introduced adaptive sliding mode controllers can be used for controlling a wide variety of fractional order systems.},

Furthermore, the stability analysis is investigated for CPDPSs in the presence of actuator failures, deception assaults, external disturbances and linear fractional uncertainties. Further, a PI observer-based secured quantised reliable controller is designed to ensure the IO-FT stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Moreover, to reduce the burden on the communication medium, the control input data is quantised before transmission by employing logarithmic quantisers. In the meantime, the deception attacks are assumed to possess a stochastic nature which follows Bernoulli distribution. Besides, by utilising Lyapunov stability theory and integral inequality, a set of adequate conditions is obtained for achieving the required result of the undertaken system. Furthermore, the resulting stability criteria are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved using the MATLAB software. Eventually, two numerical examples with simulation results are provided to validate the efficacy of the designed controller.},

This indicates that the upper bounds of the impulsive interval and state time delay are no longer constrained, and the mutual constraint between the distributed delay in impulse and state time delay is removed, which greatly improves the results of recent studies.

This method is used to address input saturation and disturbances, ensuring that the UAV can accurately follow the desired trajectory in finite time. The neural network disturbance observer is crucial for approximating external disturbance signals within a finite time, while the finite-time backstepping scheme accelerates the convergence of tracking errors. The command filtering technique is employed to avoid the complex derivation of virtual control laws, simplifying the controller design. The importance of this method lies in its ability to achieve fast, disturbance-resistant trajectory tracking for UAVs, making the control system more robust in practical applications. Simulations were conducted, showing that the proposed control strategy enables the quadrotor UAV to track its desired trajectory effectively, with improved anti-jamming capability. Both filtering and observation errors converged to the equilibrium point, validating the effectiveness of the approach. However, internal factors like actuator failure were not considered, pointing to future work in refining the method and applying it in real-world UAV experiments.},

By integrating an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) for optimal fault estimation with the EG scheme, the solution enables fault-tolerant control without requiring modifications to the baseline controller, which can be impractical or unsuitable in certain applications. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme completely avoids windup, thereby replacing conventional Anti-Windup (AW) schemes for PIDs, and is computationally cheap and easy to implement, needing only the same inputs as conventional AW algorithms and the actuator fault estimation. Simulation results on the MIMO model of the Zagi flying-wing aerial vehicle show that the EG reduces the tracking error in presence of actuator faults by − 49.92 % in terms of Integral Absolute Error (IAE), outperforming conventional AW methods.},

If the reference signals are not available, then a set of estimators is designed to generate estimated reference signals to ensure that the agents are still able to accomplish the containment control task.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the use of Variable-Order (VO) fractional operators in control system design has been gaining popularity due to their adaptive nature, enabled by their dynamically adjustable fractional derivative and integral orders. This paper presents an online tuning method for adjusting the VO fractional derivatives in fractional controllers. The method is formulated to strategically accelerate or decelerate the system response&#39;s rate of change to enhance reference tracking and disturbance rejection performance while preserving closed-loop stability. It uses the normalised acceleration of the system response, a metric that provides insights into the ‘fastness’ or ‘slowness’ of the system response. The effectiveness of the proposed online tuning method is validated through a case study on quadcopter position control. Our research includes both simulation and real-time testing of Variable-Order Fractional PD (VOFPD) controllers, which utilise our online tuning method to adjust their fractional derivatives in real-time. Stability analysis via the D-decomposition method confirms that the quadcopter&#39;s closed-loop stability is preserved. Comparative results show significant improvements in reference tracking and disturbance rejection in terms of time-domain criteria.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the synchronisation of quaternion-valued neural networks with neutral delay and discrete delay by aperiodic intermittent control. By using inequality techniques and constructing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a main criterion expressed as quaternion-valued linear matrix inequalities is derived to pledge the synchronisation of the considered quaternion-valued neural networks. The theoretical result is demonstrated by an illustrated example as well as simulations.},
