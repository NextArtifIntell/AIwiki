  abstract     = {Vocalizations are the most prominent signals in the communication of anuran amphibians. Frog calls can serve different roles depending on the social context. There are three categories of vocal signals (calls) based on social context. One of these is the aggressive call, which generally mediates interactions between conspecific males and conveys information about the level of aggression. In this study, we describe fighting calls elicited during physical combat between two males of Pithecopus ayeaye . We also analyzed aggressive calls not associated with physical combat, which were emitted by resident males from an established calling site toward approaching males, and discussed the variation related to different levels of aggression. The fighting call consists of one multi-pulsed note with an increment in sound amplitude throughout the note and amplitude peak by 96% of note duration. In general, fighting calls and aggressive calls have the same temporal envelope and spectral features. However, fighting calls exhibit a greater number of pulses, a higher pulse repetition rate, and a longer duration. The differences between aggressive calls of P. ayeaye produced in distinct contexts could indicate a graded signaling system in the aggressive calling behavior of the species. Our data match the pattern of escalated aggressive behavior occurring in other vocal anurans by modulating spectral and/or temporal features of their calls.},

  abstract     = {Climate change has interfered with ecosystem stability, biodiversity and predator–prey interactions. Among amphibians, temperature variations may influence metabolism, sensory perception and behavior. We experimentally evaluated whether tadpoles of map treefrog, Boana geographica , reduce their activity and increase the use of refuge under different temperatures in response to chemical signals emitted by a predator, as an adaptive strategy to minimize the risk of predation. Tadpoles’ shelter use and feeding behavior was measured at temperatures from 28 to 36 °C using control (without predator cues) and treatment (predator cues) groups. Temperature influenced the shelter use of tadpoles when exposed to predator chemical cues. Significant differences were observed at lower temperatures and greater shelter use by tadpoles at higher temperatures. Food offering showed no significant difference in the control or treatment group. The increased use of shelter by tadpoles in response to chemical signals from predators and increased temperature highlights the adaptive capacity of organisms in the face of predation threats, highlighting the complexity of predator–prey interactions. This behavior highlights the role of environmental factors and sensory signals in shaping the survival strategies of aquatic ectotherms. Tadpoles minimize predation risk by increasing predator avoidance behavior in detecting chemical signals in the water.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, the Magpie, which has ecological and behavioral flexibility, has colonized many cities. In this study, we examine the effect of urban disturbance on nesting density of the Magpie and nest height in a city in the south-eastern Baltic region. The studies were carried out in Kaliningrad (54°43’N, 20°30’E) during the leafless period in 2018–2021 in green residential areas with a predominance of 5-storey buildings (“residential area”) and low-rise individual housing areas (“individual houses”). In the residential area, nest counts were carried out separately in the central part of the city and outside the city center. Based on literature data on urban populations of the Magpie in other cities, we predict that: (1) in the central part of the city there will be a higher nesting density of magpies and (2) in the central part of the city, nests will be located higher than outside the central part of the city. The results obtained did not confirm these assumptions. The average nesting density in residential areas in the city center and outside the city center was virtually the same. And, in addition, in the residential area in the city center, nests were on average located lower than in the residential area outside the central part of the city, but the differences were not statistically significant and the median values of these city zones coincide. The work also provides data on the placement of nests on various types of trees and shrubs. The Hooded crow, being the main predator and competitor of the Magpie, shares the same habitats in Kaliningrad. This coexistence could potentially slow down the increase in Magpie nesting density, especially in the residential area of the city centre, where the nesting density of the Hooded crow is significantly higher than outside the city centre.},

  abstract     = {One of the important antipredator benefits of group living for prey species is collective vigilance that enhances early predator detection. Within the group, individuals monitor the behavior of others to gauge the level of risk in the environment. The nearest-neighbor distance is important as the information travels quickly and easily from the nearest individuals. I examined the vigilance behavior of free-ranging chital deer ( Axis axis , Gir Protected Area, India) in response to the group size, nearest neighbor distance, and habitat structure (open versus dense vegetation). The vigilance behavior showed a weak negative response to increases in group size. Overall, the vigilance levels were significantly higher for animals that had distant neighbors. There was a significant interaction effect of habitat structure and the nearest neighbor distance on vigilance levels of chitals. However, this effect was only significantly different for individuals living in dense vegetation. Chitals respond more strongly to conspecific vigilance from their nearest companion in the denser mixed forest than open acacia grasslands. The results indicate that nearest neighbor distance and habitat structure interact in determining the vigilance behavior of group living ungulates and transmission of information within a social group.},

  abstract     = {Studying the behavioral ecology of primates is essential to realize their conservation and management strategies. Geladas ( Theropithecus gelada ) are endemic primates of the Ethiopian highlands and the last remaining member of the genus Theropithecus . We present here the first-ever study on the behavioral ecology, of the newly discovered geladas in the eastern part of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. We collected data from February to September 2020, which included both dry and wet seasons, and focused on activity patterns and feeding ecology of geladas. A band of 48 individuals was selected as a study group. Data was collected through the instantaneous scan sampling method from the focal band of geladas. Feeding accounted for 49.5% of the activity patterns, followed by moving (22.3%), resting (16%), social (10.4%), and other non-social activities (1.9%). Geladas in the present study consumed 25 plant species that belong to 12 families, more than 50% (14) being graminoids. Food items included graminoid parts (66.1%), forb parts (27.5%), tree/shrub leaves (2.4%), fruit/seeds (2.6%), flowers (0.9%), and the rest being unidentified (0.5%). Geladas are fed in large quantities on graminoid leaves, although they shifted to underground (corms, rhizomes, and roots) food items when leaves were desiccated, particularly during the dry season. The data on the diurnal activity patterns and feeding ecology of the gelada helps in developing conservation strategies and understanding habitat selection and its level of dietary specialization. The current study area is known as a new distribution of geladas in the Tigray region. Thus, this study provides data that would be crucial information for conservation practitioners at local and national levels to ensure the survival of the new and isolated population of Tigray geladas that are patchily distributed to a few escarpments of eastern Tigray, Ethiopia.},

  abstract     = {We conducted a laboratory based selection experiment with two allopatric populations of Drosophila ananassae collected from two isolated geographic regions of India, namely Mysuru and Port Blair. The populations were infected enterically with the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 55 generations followed by rearing for the next 10 generations under relaxed selection. We tested development of immune-competence of the selected flies through the generations and inquired if elicitation of immune responses were needed to pay cost by trading-off with life history and morphological traits and observed progressive increase in immune response in the selected flies, which also exhibited gradual increase in survival, reproductive life span, post-reproductive life span, developmental time, fecundity rate, fat content in contrast to body length and water content that exhibited longitudinal decrease. Under relaxed selection regime the traits showed reversion of the trend but not to the basal level. Responses exhibited by the selected flies from Port Blair and Mysuru differed, with the former group exhibiting more reduction in body length, more reduction in water content, greater antioxidant enzyme activity, longer post-infection period, greater survival than the later group. On the other side, Mysuru flies showed greater fat deposition, faster developmental time and longer oviposition time than Port Blair flies. Interestingly, Port Blair flies exhibited an increase in post-ovipository period, in contrast to Mysuru flies that showed a decrease for the same. We inferred that two allopatric populations of D. ananassae from the Indian sub-continent show different trade-off between evolving immune response and life history traits. Further, the outcome of our study leads us to a point of realization how allopatric populations of a given species respond differently under given selection pressure and gradually diverge from each other in nature to develop a species barrier.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, we describe and compare the diet of two populations of Pleurodema diplolister from northeastern Brazil. We assessed whether diet composition varies between the different populations and whether the size of individuals is related to the composition, volume and the size of prey consumed. Stomach contents were retrieved through the stomach-flushing technique from specimens collected in two municipalities (Morro do Chapéu and Rio de Contas) in the semi-arid region of Bahia State. We captured a total of 163 individuals and 91 of them had some type of stomach contents. A total of 278 food items were classified and distributed among 10 prey categories. The main food items consumed include Hymenoptera (Formicidae), Isoptera and Coleoptera. The morphometric measurements (snout-vent length and mouth width) of P. diplolister were significantly correlated with the diet (total volume of prey and length of the largest prey ingested). Diet composition differed between the two localities, showing little overlap between populations. Part of the variation in diet composition may be attributed to differences in the size of P. diplolister individuals. However, many factors can be associated to these differences, such as prey availability, landscape structure or even anthropic influences on the local ecosystem. In order to unravel the intricacies behind these distinct patterns, a comprehensive examination of these factors and others becomes imperative. This detailed analysis is crucial for a more thorough understanding of the extent to which these elements influence the feeding habits of anurans.},
