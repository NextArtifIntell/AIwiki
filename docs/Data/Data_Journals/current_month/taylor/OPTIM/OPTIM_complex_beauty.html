  abstract     = {This paper deals with the solution of some multi-objective optimal control problems for stationary Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. More precisely, we look for Pareto and Nash equilibria associated to standard cost functionals. First, we prove the existence of equilibria and we deduce appropriate optimality systems. Then, we analyse the existence and characterization of Pareto and Nash equilibria for the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. Here, we use the formalism of Dubovitskii and Milyoutin., see¬†[Girsanov FV. Lectures on mathematical theory of extremum problems. Berlin: Springer-Verlag; 1972. (Notes in economics and mathematical systems; vol. 67)]. Finally, we also present a finite element approximation of the bi-objective problem, we illustrate the techniques with several numerical experiments and we compare the Pareto and Nash equilibria.},

Moreover, we characterize the optimal cost as a function of the budget. The proof is based on an unusual use of the clock form. This result generalizes the one obtained formerly for the SIR epidemiological model to more general Kolmogorov dynamics, that we illustrate on other biological models.},

  abstract     = {For a control system two major objectives can be considered: the stabilizability with respect to a given target, and the minimization of an integral functional (while the trajectories reach this target). Here we consider a problem where stabilizability or controllability are investigated together with the further aim of a ‚Äòcost regulation‚Äô, namely a state-dependent upper bound of the functional. This paper is devoted to a crucial step in the programme of establishing a chain of equivalences among degree-k stabilizability with regulated cost , asymptotic controllability with regulated cost and the existence of a degree-k Minimum Restraint Function (which is a special kind of Control Lyapunov Function). Besides the presence of a cost we allow the stabilizing ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô to give rise to directions that range in the union of original directions and the family of iterated Lie bracket of length ‚â§ k . In the main result asymptotic controllability [resp. with regulated cost] is proved to be necessary for degree- k stabilizability [resp. with regulated cost]. Further steps of the above-mentioned logical chain as, for instance, a Lyapunov-type inverse theorem ‚Äì i.e. the possibility of deriving existence of a Minimum Restraint Function from stabilizability ‚Äì are proved in companion papers.},

  abstract     = {Handling an infinite number of inequality constraints in infinite-dimensional spaces occurs in many fields, from global optimization to optimal transport. These problems have been tackled individually in several previous articles through kernel Sum-of-Squares (kSoS) approximations. We propose here a unified theorem to prove convergence guarantees for these schemes. Pointwise inequalities are turned into equalities within a class of nonnegative kSoS functions. Assuming further that the functions appearing in the problem are smooth, focusing on pointwise equality constraints enables the use of scattering inequalities to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in sampling the constraints. Our approach is illustrated in learning vector fields with side information, here the invariance of a set.},

  abstract     = {Modern vertical take-off and landing vehicles (VTOLs) could significantly affect the future of mobility. The broad range of their application fields encompasses urban air mobility, transportation and logistics as well as reconnaissance and observation missions in a military context. This article presents an efficient numerical framework for dynamic scheduling of multiple VTOLs. It combines a scheduling problem with optimal trajectory planning. The whole setting is formulated as a mixed-integer bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, VTOLs are scheduled, and their starting times are computed. The solution of the lower level problem involves the computation of a value function and yields optimal trajectories for every aerial vehicle. In order to solve the bilevel problem, it is recast into a single-level one. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear program is then piecewise linearized and solved numerically by a mixed-integer linear solver based on the Branch-and-Bound algorithm. Numerical results prove the feasibility of the approach proposed herein.},
