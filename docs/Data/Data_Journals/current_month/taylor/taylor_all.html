  abstract     = {With the rapid development of science and technology, exploring the image logic semantics of users’ Chinese language using deep learning is crucial for understanding users’ interactions in virtual space. To address the challenges of recognizing existential sentences in Chinese language images, this research introduces a Tree-LSTM encoder, combined with an improved Transformer attention mechanism, to construct a logical semantic recognition model. The model was validated using a dataset from the Modern Dictionary database. Results showed that the proposed model achieved a recognition accuracy of 90.01%, surpassing other models by at least 2.99%. After incorporating Wikipedia data, the model’s performance in handling complex sentence structures and technical terminology was particularly outstanding. When all the extended data sources were integrated, the model’s accuracy reached 92.31%, representing a 2.3% improvement over the original dataset. This success is due to the Tree-LSTM’s ability to capture hierarchical and logical relationships within sentences. The model also effectively learns and recognizes low-frequency new words, enhancing overall performance.},

Two interdependent models are trained within a framework, allowing us to forecast interactions and identify influential features. Saliency maps were utilized to visualize the factors affecting these interactions over time. The technique helps reveal how specific viral properties shift in response to human factors.

  abstract     = {Bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have recently become important in urban transportation due to several factors, such as their cost-effectiveness and environmental considerations. The BSS provides an enormous amount of data that is recorded regarding trips. This huge volume of bike sharing data raises various challenges and opportunities. Many research studies have used bike sharing datasets to understand the geographical, social, financial, and behavioral aspects of bike user behaviors. While existing literature primarily focuses on predicting the number of rentals and returns per station, this study addresses the complementary aspect of predicting the trip duration and distance of the trip. Accurate prediction of ride duration allows a better estimate of bike availability at stations, while distance predictions assist in maintenance planning based on bike usage patterns. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, the proposed work clusters the BSS dataset into k sub-datasets based on similarity of dataset instances. Then, the predictive model is trained to predict the data of each sub-dataset separately. Thus, there will be k models for the k sub-dataset. Next, the performance of the proposed method, the average score of the k models, will be compared to the performance of a model trained on the complete dataset on predicting BSSs ride duration and distance of the trip. The rationale for splitting the dataset into k sub-datasets is to separate similar patterns in one sub-dataset. Second, the utilization of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on the BSSs data was proposed for the clustering purpose, as the DTW usage is very limited in the current literature of BSSs. The dataset clustering is based on the similarity of the curves representing the number of trips between each pair of bike stations throughout the day hours. Then, the DTW algorithm is used to measure the curve similarity between these bike station pairs’ curves. These two contributions of the proposed approach complement existing prediction models for rentals and returns, providing a comprehensive solution for BSS optimization. The proposed method was thoroughly evaluated on two real datasets of different sizes. For the two datasets, the obtained results show that the best improvements of the predictive model’s accuracy are 30% and 42% on average for predicting trip duration and distance of the trip, respectively.},

The prediction is challenging as EV energy consumption is highly variable and dependent on context . First, this paper proposes an integrated framework for the collection of online telematic data, processing of this data, online maintenance of statistics, and machine-learning-based prediction of travel time and energy consumption. A key feature of the proposed framework is the preprocessing of the trajectory data into triplets , a convenient data unit that captures the relevant context necessary for effective energ y prediction. The second contribution of the paper addresses the effective management of drastic change in context through robust energy prediction models. In particular, using few-shot learning techniques, we tackle the problem of the need to create different energy prediction models for different EV types, from small EVs to electric buses. Experimental results on three different data sets demonstrate how energy prediction models adapt to different EV types.},

  abstract     = {Downstream applications for point cloud registration, like LiDAR Odometry, often conduct Iterative Closest Points (ICP) in the initial frame-to-frame matching and/or subsequent map refinement. However, due to its distance-based processing nature, ICP relies on an accurate pose initialization while implicating increased computational complexity with a growing number of points. To meet specific runtime requirements, methods often apply the extensive mapping step at low frequencies, e.g. every 10 frames, which in turn leads to increased noise on the calculated trajectory. To tackle the discrepancy between runtime and accuracy, we present MagneticPillars++, an extension of our previous point cloud registration approach optimized for LiDAR Odometry, introducing novel intermediate cell correspondence filtering and accelerated match normalization. Furthermore, we propose a frame-to-keyframe matching technique replacing the simple frame-to-frame matching within a LiDAR Odometry pipeline. This can tremendously reduce noise without the need for expensive ICP corrections. We conduct extensive experiments for various tasks like point cloud registration, LiDAR Odometry, and loop closure estimation, demonstrating the versatility of our approach, where we are able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and runtime, resulting in residual translation and rotation errors of up to 4.7 cm and 0.231 with an average runtime of.},

  abstract     = {Machine vision application in agriculture has spurred significant interest in crop-missing detection. This study targets critical challenges, such as comprehensive aerial imagery coverage, tiny seedlings easily mistaken for weeds, and the absence of adaptive learning in traditional row classification. We propose a novel methodology for missing seedling detection, which comprises three essential stages: seedling localization, row classification, and missing region prediction. We present SeedNet, a detector that leverages row direction information to enhance small seedling detection performance. By incorporating this information, SeedNet improves recall by 25.3 % and AP by 15.4 % compared to the baseline. Additionally, we introduce PeakNet, a deep learning-based classifier for row segmentation that efficiently adapts to row spacing without any prior assumptions, achieving an accuracy of 99.69 % . Finally, missing areas are predicted by analyzing the relative distances between adjacent seedlings within the same row. Under challenging outdoor conditions, this method achieves a missing detection accuracy of 98 % , meeting practical requirements for field testing. SeedNet and PeakNet demonstrate exceptional performance in real-time processing, achieving inference speeds of 105 FPS and 2295 FPS, respectively. These results indicate strong potential for practical applications in real-time agricultural systems. The proposed approach provides a high-performance, low-cost solution for crop missing detection.},

  abstract     = {The rise of social media has amplified online sharing, necessitating businesses to comprehend public sentiment. Traditional sentiment analysis struggles with sarcasm detection and class imbalance. To address this, we introduce Synthetic Ensemble Oversampling methods (SEO) that effectively leverage the strengths of various oversampling algorithms. By incorporating ensemble learning principles into oversampling techniques, our proposed methods offer distinct strategies for selecting newly generated sarcastic data. In this study, we employ five oversampling algorithms: Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), polynom-fit-SMOTE, Proximity Weighted Synthetic Sampling (ProWSyn), and SMOTE with Instance Prioritization and Filtering (SMOTE_IPF). We work with two imbalanced sarcasm detection datasets, iSarcasmEval and SARC-reduced, collected from Twitter and Reddit. After extracting features from using Word2Vec, Global Vectors (GloVe), and FastText, we apply oversampling and ensemble techniques. Evaluated across six classifiers – Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and BERT – the results demonstrate that the SEO2 framework consistently enhances classifier performance compared to single oversampling techniques. Notably, the Cluster Uncentered method frequently provides the best improvements across datasets, achieving significant gains in both AUC and F1 scores. These findings highlight the potential of ensemble-based oversampling in addressing class imbalance for sarcasm detection.},

Contrastive learning typically employs a single contrastive relationship based on individual instances. However, depending on the task-related characteristics, such as facial skin images, this approach may be unsuitable for learning useful representations. In this work, we propose an advanced contrastive learning method to learn high-quality facial skin representations that are useful for various downstream applications related to skin disorders, such as wrinkles and pigmentation. Our method leverages metadata to establish effective multi-instance contrastive relationships specifically for facial skin images. To this end, we employ mini-batches, constructed through the integration of multiple contrastive relationships, to enable a model to learn the multifaceted features of facial skin. Using a facial skin image dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in classifying facial wrinkles and pigmentation severity compared to conventional contrastive learning. The features learned by the proposed method adapt well to other skin lesion datasets from different sources, demonstrating the transferability of the learned skin representations.

Also, the proposed synchronized parallel processing ranking based hash map framed using the merge sorting technique for categorizing the excitement scores is applied in video summarization. The framework is tested on U.S. Open and Wimbledon match videos and the results show superior results against state-of-art techniques with normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) score improved by 2%, positive matching highlight segment identification increased by 20% on YouTube Videos.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing the accuracy of industrial building energy consumption forecasts is beneficial for improving energy management and addressing the imbalance between supply and demand in building electricity use. To overcome the limitations of existing energy consumption forecasting methods, which inadequately consider the specific energy usage characteristics and user behaviors in parks and often perform poorly at predicting extreme values, this study proposes a hybrid energy consumption forecasting model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Initially, SSA is used to extract the autocorrelation of the electricity consumption series and eliminate the mutual interference caused by component mixing. Then, fuzzy entropy values are utilized to differentiate the complexity of various components, reconstructing them into high-frequency and low-frequency components. These components are then predicted using a multi-factor LSTM model optimized by improved particle swarm optimization, with the results aggregated for the final forecast. The results indicate that the model’s root mean square error is only 12.116 kWh, which is lower compared to the LSTM multi-factor model, the EMD-LSTM model, and the SSA-LSTM model. The model shows a closer fit to the original series trend and more accurate predictions at extreme points, aligning more closely with actual values.},

  abstract     = {The use of regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs), which reduce hazardous air pollution and save energy, has increased with the rapid growth of industrial technology. Therefore, detecting and explaining anomalies in RTOs have become important. To accurately detect anomalies in RTOs, it is required to apply reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) models, which is currently proposed as a main AD research area. However, traditional explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) cannot explain reconstruction-based AD models to identify main facilities in RTOs. To address this problem, we developed a method to improve the accuracy of XAI in explaining reconstruction-based AD models. Specifically, we first grouped the variables based on correlation and the clustering analysis. We then calculated the impact of each group on normal/abnormal events in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy and cosine similarity. Using the most influencing variables based on our method, XAI correctly identified the main variables without considering unnecessary variables. Experimental results on a real-world RTO dataset showed that our method improve the accuracy of XAI that determine the main variables compared to the traditional XAI.},

  abstract     = {To address the problem of single-mode vulnerability to complex environments, a multimode fusion network with mutual attention is proposed. This network combines the use of laser, infrared and millimeter wave modalities to leverage the advantages of each mode in different environments, increasing the network’s resilience to interference. The study begins with the construction of pixel-level fusion networks, feature-weighted fusion networks and the multimode mutual attention fusion network. A comprehensive introduction to the multimode mutual attention fusion network is given, as well as a comparison with the other two networks. The model is then trained and evaluated using data from glide rocket and drone experiments. Finally, an analysis of the anti-outlier interference capability of the multimode fusion network with mutual attention is carried out. The test results show that the multimode mutual attention fusion network containing a feature fusion attention mechanism has the highest detection performance and anti-interference ability. Without interference, the network achieves a remarkable accuracy of 0.98 for multi-target recognition. In addition, with an accuracy of 0.96, it ensures a high level of stability in various interference environments. In addition, the introduction of multi-scale fusion has improved the rocket’s speed adaptability by about 75%.},

These reviews not only reflect customer sentiments but also crucially influence other users’ purchasing decisions due to their public accessibility. The sheer volume and complexity of product reviews make manual sorting challenging, necessitating businesses to autonomously process and discern customer sentiments. Chinese, a predominant language on e-commerce platforms, presents unique challenges in sentiment analysis due to its character-based nature. This paper introduces an innovative Dual-Channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN) algorithm. Based on the language characteristics of Chinese product reviews, a sentiment analysis algorithm, dual channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN), is proposed. The algorithm constructs two channels, transforming text into both character and word vectors and inputting them into Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The combination of these channels facilitates a more comprehensive feature extraction from reviews. Comparative analysis revealed that DC-BiLSTM-CNN significantly outperforms baseline models, substantially enhancing the classification of product reviews. We conclude that the proposed DC-BiLSTM-CNN algorithm offers an effective solution for handling Chinese product reviews, carrying positive implications for businesses seeking to enhance product and service quality, ultimately resulting in heightened user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges when drilling small and deep holes is the difficulty of chip evacuation. As the hole depth increases, chips tend to become tightly compressed, causing chip jamming. It leads to a rapid increase in cutting forces and strong random fluctuations. The discontinuous chip evacuation process makes the cutting force signal strongly nonlinear and random, making it difficult to predict accurately. In this paper, we have developed a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) model for training using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to predict torque during deep drilling. Unlike many previous studies, this model uses hole depth as an input vector element instead of hole diameter. The model has been validated through experiments drilling AISI-304 stainless steel with hole depth-to-diameter ratios of 8 under continuous drilling conditions with ultrasonic-assisted vibration. The performance of the ANN model was compared with the exponential model and evaluated by the MAPE index. Results show that the ANN model has better predictive capability, the average MAPE value approximately four times smaller and higher reliability with a standard deviation approximately 3.5 times smaller than the exponential function model. This model can be further refined to predict torque for drilling deep holes for future studies.},

This study investigates ASI based on features derived from spectrogram images through a convolution neural network (CNN) with rectangular-shaped kernels. Traditionally, CNN employs square-shaped kernel and max-pooling operations at different layers, a design optimized to handle 2D data. Nevertheless, encoding of information differs slightly to deal with spectrograms. The frequency is displayed along the y-axis, and the x-axis presents the time of the audio. Amplitude is denoted by intensity within the spectrogram image at certain point. The main contributions of this study are 1: To analyze audio signals effectively using spectrograms, this study proposed the utilization of spectrogram features with different sizes and shapes of rectangular kernels to derive distinctive features by improving the recognition accuracy of the speaker identification system. 2. The extracted spectrogram-based features and models are evaluated on the ELSDSR, TSP, and LibriSpeech datasets and achieved the weighted accuracy of 96.0%, 99.2%, and 97.6%, respectively. 3.

The q -ROF-CRITIC assigns the priority weights of the attributes (i.e. comprehension and ergonomic principles), whereas the q -ROF-TOPSIS-Sort evaluates and classifies the compliance levels of road signs in view of a set of pre-defined categories, consequently bridging the limitations of the TOPSIS-Sort in handling imprecise evaluations. Demonstrated in an actual case study of evaluating 83 road signs in the Philippines, results show that prohibitive signs have the highest comprehension levels, while parking and stop signs, together with road obstacle signs, belong to the medium compliance level. Low-level compliance is observed for supplementary and intersection road signs due to unfamiliarity, while horizontal signs are ergonomically low on spatial and physical attributes. The proposed approach is supported by sensitivity analysis of q values and comparative assessments with other methods. The findings encourage further investigation into comprehensibility evaluations and open avenues for exploring the factors that influence road sign comprehension.},

This type of monitoring often relies on the use of navigation systems such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS data has been used to support the defense teams when identifying equipment defects, locating suspicious activity, ensuring ship collision avoidance, and detecting hazardous events. In this context, Ship Trajectory Prediction (STP) has been conducted using AIS data to support the estimation of vessel routes and locations, contributing to maritime safety and situational awareness. Currently, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model is considered the state-of-the-art for STP. However, this model can be time-consuming and can only represent a single vessel track. To solve these challenges, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models have been applied to STP to allow scalability for large data sets and to capture larger regions or anomalous vessels behavior. This research proposes a new RNN architecture that decreases the prediction error up to 50% for cargo vessels when compared to the OU model. Results also confirm that the proposed Decimal Preservation layer can benefit other RNN architectures developed in the literature by reducing their prediction errors for complex data sets.},

Fourth predictive systems are employed to investigate the intricate problem of predicting the severity of injuries sustained in traffic crashes using different regression algorithms, such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks. Compared to comparable systems without feature selection, feature resampling, and optimization methods, the results demonstrate that employing optimized XGBoost along with grid search in conjunction with SelectKBest and SMOTE strategy has resulted in greater performance, with an 89% R2 score. Our findings provide insight into the requirement for accurate forecasting models in optimization and balanced approaches to enhancing traffic safety. These findings offer a viable way to improve traffic safety tactics. As far as we know and as of right now, there hasn’t been much interest in supporting a fusion-based system that critically reviews machine learning techniques using grid search optimization, feature selection, and smote technique and examines how injury severity prediction is affected by road crashes.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs the MKSE and SEMSS methods. Among them, MKSE uses an improved TF-IDF weight calculation method to extract keywords and applies virtual keywords to construct inverted indexes, making it difficult for malicious attackers to infer the index content easily. SEMSS uses the Apriori algorithm to mine the co-occurrence relationship between words and find the keyword set that meets the minimum support threshold to improve the recall rate of search results. Finally, the security of the scheme is verified from the aspects of semantic security, effici this paper designsency, data integrity, etc. The results showed that the data encryption time of MKSE and TRSE methods increased gradually with the increase in document collection storage. The index build time was increased as the document set grew. The accuracy of the improved TF-IDF method was 63.8%. The running time of Apriori decreased with the increase of minimum support. When the minimum support was 12.0%, the Apriori algorithm ran for 211 seconds. The MKSE method was more efficient than the TRSE method in searching documents by query keywords. When the document set size was 3000, the SEMSS method had a full search rate of 81.09%. This research realizes the semantic security of outsourced data, which can efficiently and comprehensively carry out cryptographic retrieval based on keyword sorting.},

We evaluate our model on a super-resolution dataset and compare its performance against other networks, highlighting the importance of minimizing trainable parameters for real-time deployment on resource-constrained drone platforms. The effWicacy of our proposed network is further validated through image recognition tasks and real-world scenario testing.

This approach aims to handle the distributed trust issues of federated learning users and update data states rapidly. By modeling multi-source devices through federated learning, the model parameters and reputation values of participating devices are stored on the blockchain. This method incorporates factors such as experience, familiarity, and timeliness to more quickly gather reliable information about nodes to assess their behavior. Simulation results on the MNIST dataset show that when the proportion of selfish nodes is below 50%, the convergence time increases with the proportion of selfish nodes. Compared to advanced algorithms, the proposed model saves approximately 6% of interaction time. As the number of transactions significantly increases, the system’s TPS (Transactions Per Second) decreases, with an average TPS of only 3079.35 when the maximum number of transactions is 4000.

The dataset was collected from the farms using mobile phone cameras with the guidance of agricultural experts and was annotated to label the images. The results showed that the U-Net model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 96.45% and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 93.23%.

Large-scale industrial systems generate an immense volume of logs, which are difficult to handle with human capabilities. Therefore, an automated method is essential for filtering vast amounts of data. System log anomaly detection is crucial in the security field for identifying system failures, sophisticated internal attacks, and other deviations from the norm. This research area requires further development, as most Deep Learning solutions in the literature are semi-supervised. This poses a significant limitation since these solutions are impractical for large-scale ecosystems due to the high cost of labeling data. This paper introduces a method that replaces the supervised phase of semi-supervised methods with fully unsupervised heuristics, utilizing the elbow method, interquartile range, and Simulated Annealing. The unsupervised results are comparable to the semi-supervised State of the Art while demonstrating greater applicability in real-world applications. This work proposes a more suitable benchmark for the log anomaly outlier detection problem, where the training data include both normal and abnormal sequences and precede the test sessions in time. Additionally, it presents metrics on distinct log sequences to mitigate the impact of unbalanced anomaly types.},

Predicting potential friendships accurately from abundant information has become a pivotal research area. While graph neural network (GNN) have shown significant promise in prediction, existing approaches often fail to fully exploit the heterogeneous data characteristics in LBSN. Key challenges include inadequate modeling of the intricate relationships between users and points of interest (POI), overlooking the significance of spatial-temporal information in user trajectories, and underutilizing rich edge features. To address these challenges, we design a novel GRU-enhanced Heterogeneous Multigraph Attention Network (GEHMAN), which is a GNN model enhanced by GRU. We construct a heterogeneous multigraph to comprehensively capture user-POI relationships. We then employ a skip-gram model to embed POI nodes from user sub-trajectories and use RNN with GRU units to embed user nodes. GEHMAN utilize hierarchical attention mechanism to consolidate node information by aggregating diverse types of neighboring nodes and connecting edges. Experiments on six real city datasets show that compared with the best performance of six benchmark methods including LBSN2vec++, Metapath2vec and HAN, the average improvement percentages of GEHMAN in AUC, AP, and Top@K are 2.225%, 1.948%, and 6.353%, respectively.},

While earlier methods focused on spatial-domain information, recent models have explored frequency-domain data to improve performance. However, explicit frequency-domain processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose the Implicit Frequency Selective Image Restoration Network (IFSR-Net), which implicitly captures frequency information without explicit transformations, achieving high performance with reduced computational cost. Our analysis indicates that the main spectral variations between the clear and degraded images are centred on the high-frequency components in the feature maps; the convolution operator tends to amplify the amplitude and variance of these components. Building on this observation, we designed an Implicit Frequency Selection Module (IFSM) to enrich high-frequency components and an Implicit Frequency Selection Attention (IFSA) mechanism to emphasize and integrate beneficial frequency features. We integrated and optimized design elements from existing image restoration models to further refine the overall architecture of IFSR-Net. Extensive experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Ablation studies confirm the validity of our design choices, offering insights for future research in image restoration.},

  abstract     = {The composition of the password is markedly disparate contingent on the configuration strategy and the individual user&#39;s predilections. The objective of this paper is to mine the region attribute information behind the password text through text classification. In contrast to the traditional text classification approach, the classification of password region attribution represents a distinct challenge namely ultra-short text classification. The issue of password regional attribute classification is particularly tricky due to its inherent lexical polysemy, the scarcity of text features, the lack of context and the difficulty in explicitly identifying semantics. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a multi-granularity cascade fusion approach for password region attribution classification. Firstly, the model employs series of segmentation techniques to split password into multi-dimensional fine-grained subword representations. Subsequently, multiple segmented representations of the same password are fed into a localised feature encoder to mine the private local features. Finally, a multi-level cascade fusion method is designed to integrate different granularity of password features into a unified representation to classification. Our approach can effectively addresses the limitations of scarce information and the challenge of integrating multiple representations for password text. Experiments on a large amount of real password data demonstrate that, our model can converge rapidly and achieve an accuracy of 88.18%, a precision of 88.31%, a recall of 87.73%, and an F1-score of 88.02%, significantly outperforming traditional models.},

  abstract     = {In several domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, automatic data labelling is a critical task. Automatic data labelling is the process of utilising machine learning techniques to automatically label substantial amounts of data. Two largest news datasets like, the Kaggle dataset and the AG News dataset are used as benchmark for the performance analysis of the proposed algorithms. A novel four-dimensional matrix-based input representation that depicts the intra – and inter-word associations is used to obtain the feature vectors. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) helps to remove the outliers which improves the overall accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The proposed approach also reduces the dependency on human annotators. The DBSCAN algorithm is utilised o automatically cluster similar data points, thereby reducing the need for manual labelling. These clusters are then fed into a CNN with a rethinking mechanism, which allows the network to revise its initial predictions based on additional context. This integration of clustering and deep learning techniques aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency. The cloud computing method is used to achieve high-throughput news headlines classification in order to achieve accurate and efficient data labelling.},

Subsequently, this work evaluates the competence of the proposed FS mode using ten benchmark NASA datasets on four supervised learning classifiers, namely NB, DT, SVM, and KNN using accuracy and error curve as the standard performance measure metrics. This paper also correlates the proposed FS mode&#39;s conduct with existing FS techniques based on widely utilized meta-heuristic approaches such as GA, PSO, DE, ACO, FA, and SWO. This work employed Friedman and Holm test to ratify the proposed FS mode&#39;s statistical connotation. The investigatory outcomes supported the assertion that the recommended DAOAFS mode was effective in enhancing the efficacy of the defect forecasting model by achieving the highest mean accuracy of 94.76%. The findings also revealed that the proposed approach established its supremacy over the other studied FS techniques with bettered veracity in most instances.},

However, the sensitive nature of such kind of data inevitably leads to privacy constraints and regulations on its use and sharing. This paper addresses the problem in a distinctive perspective. Instead of blurring or modifying original trajectory samples, we aim to generate a completely synthetic dataset, whose samples are singularly different from the original ones, but whose collective sets share similar global characteristics and performances. We propose a generative deep learning solution for location-based trajectory formats, with the goal of producing realistic synthetic location sequences: the process relies on a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, involving long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent layers to capture trajectory characteristics, and neural embeddings to model mobility relations between places. We leverage multiple metrics to assess the realistic character of synthetic data and their similarity with the original source; moreover, we evaluate downstream performance differences with regard to the next place prediction problem. Tested on a real-world large-scale dataset of long-distance trips, and compared with baselines and traditional geomasking techniques, our approach presents better characteristics, providing novel insights into GeoAI solutions for human mobility analysis.},

This study presents a novel Two-Level Multimodal Data Fusion Integrated Incremental Learner Ensemble Classifier (TMDFILE) for Alzheimer&#39;s detection. This method integrates temporal, spatial, spectral, audio, and text data modalities, utilising a gating mechanism to optimise the contribution of each modality.

The proposed model is evaluated in four different stock market datasets which include FSTE, SSE, Nifty 50 and S&amp;P 500.

  abstract     = {Heart sounds, or phonocardiograms (PCG), are important for diagnosing cardiovascular conditions, providing a non-invasive means to assess heart function through auscultation. Accurate classification of PCG signals can facilitate early detection of cardiac abnormalities, significantly improving patient outcomes. However, the complexity and variability of heart sound recordings present significant challenges for traditional classification methods, necessitating advanced approaches that can effectively handle the nuances of cardiac acoustics. This paper introduces a novel transfer learning approach that adapts OpenAI&#39;s Whisper model, originally designed for robust speech recognition, to the task of heart sound classification. In particular, we employ Whisper&#39;s encoder architecture to effectively capture acoustic features that generalize to cardiac auscultation, making it a promising candidate for PCG analysis. To tailor the model for this specialized task, we implement a modified encoder architecture optimized for heart sound characteristics. We process the input to the model using a Log-Mel spectrogram pipeline specifically designed to highlight the unique acoustic properties of PCG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the adapted Whisper model achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in both accuracy and robustness.},

While prior research addresses this NP-hard problem, most approaches depend on hybrid metaheuristics requiring expertise in hybridisation and lack systematic methods for architecture selection, often relying on a single criterion with trial-and-error parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative parallel hybridisation framework that integrates Thompson sampling and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to holistically evaluate and identify the best hybrid architecture from a diverse set of options. Unlike conventional approaches, our method employs onboard Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) for structured and efficient parameter tuning. Additionally, Thompson sampling, applied in the form of Bayesian learning, mitigates the stochastic nature of metaheuristics through multiple experiments. This framework was used to select the best architecture from 57 hybrid combinations of six metaheuristics for solving RCPSP-DC. Extensive experiments using standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves statistically significant performance improvements, selecting a hybrid architecture that outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The selected architecture’s competitiveness is validated through a Z-test of proportions, underscoring its effectiveness in solving RCPSP-DC problems.},

Therefore, we explore the effectiveness of various ML models by incorporating domain-specific term weighting and utilising word embeddings. The study also analyses the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with and without bidirectional connections, as well as an approach that combines RNNs and CNN. Furthermore, we evaluate several transformer-based models by fine-tuning them alongside GenAI models text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo, PaLM2, and Gemini Pro in zero-shot classification settings. The results demonstrate that ML models outperformed DL models, achieving a best accuracy of 0.871 and F1 score of 0.872. Additionally, domain-specific term weighting is found to be superior to word embeddings. Furthermore, most ML and DL models performed better than GenAI models, with GenAI models achieving a best accuracy of 0.618 and a best F1 score of 0.627.

This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the robustness dynamics of SML techniques under more complex scenarios, such as adversarial perturbations and geometric transformation. Five popular classification algorithms, including k-nearest neighbour and support vector machines, were employed to build classification models. Methodology involves investigating the robustness of proposed  methods, first, on original and corrupted data by utilising benchmark datasets across several image domains. To strengthen the investigation, the models were trained using a new low-rank representation (LRR) strategy. This hybrid model simultaneously addresses two key limitations in classical LRR models: overcoming the sequential learning process and effectively capturing both local and global data structures. By introducing a dual regularisation mechanism, it integrates a k-nearest neighbour graph to preserve local consistency, while a global low-rank constraint ensures coherent data representation. Experimental results reveal significant drops in accuracy of most SML methods, especially under adversarial attacks and geometric transformations, but LRR approach mitigates these effects to a notable extent, boosting performance across data variations. The results also show that the proposed  method outperforms state-of-the-art LRR techniques in most experiments.},

  abstract     = {With IoT development, safety attacks are growing gradually as well. Numerous centralized attack-detecting schemes were developed for detecting IoT attacks namely, ML and DL schemes, which classify it as normal or attack. However, because to the various requirements of IoT devices, the most of the plans fall short of achieving noticeable results. In this study, a blockchain method is used to construct a novel attack-detecting scheme for IOT. Here, a system using blockchain is employed to process information in a logical sequence. At first, enhanced data normalization is deployed. Then, the features like “Exponential Moving Average, improved Holoentropy, higher-order statistical features, and mutual information” are extracted. Then feature selection is done via Improved Principal Component Analysis. The selected traits are evaluated “hybrid classification that includes Gated Recurrent Unit and Deep Belief Network” to discover the attacks in IoT. Finally, the advancements of this work are established over others. The proposed HC(GRU + DBN) scheme has attained higher accuracy of 97.2% for the best case of 92%,91%,94%,84%, and 92% to current schemes like SVM, RF, RNN, LSTM, and NB.},

  abstract     = {Classical cryptography is the process of hiding information and it manages the secret knowledge by encrypting the plain text message through the translation of it to an unintelligible message. Quantum cryptography is also hiding the plain text through encryption and it works based on the law of quantum physics for providing absolute security of data communication. It uses the idea of quantum mechanics to gadget a cryptographic system and the key problems are solved by intrusion detection including the Eavesdropping detection using quantum expertise. On the contrary, principles of secured communication protocol systems are demonstrated with classical quantum cryptography where the keys are distributed securely and are applied in quantum key distribution as well. In this paper, we provide a survey of works on classical cryptography and quantum cryptography and compare them with respect to time, security level and the classification of the data. Moreover, we perform a concise analysis of perspective classical cryptography and the conception of Quantum cryptography with various protocols and highlight the benefits of classical cryptography and Quantum cryptography in different applications.

  abstract     = {Cloud computing environment offers huge computation power and enormous storage capacity. The cloud framework enables users to organize the data-intensive applications without the investment of substructure and it acts as a key role in the digital era, as it simultaneously handles the data from the number of users. Besides the useful characteristic features, providing security to data that is stored in cloud platform offers a great challenge in cloud storage. Using the proposed F-ALO technique, a privacy protection model is developed to encrypt the data before sharing it in the cloud. To achieve effective data protection, the proposed F-ALO algorithm was developed by combining the Fractional Calculus (FC) and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithms. By incorporating the privacy protection and data sharing phases, employing the MapReduce framework’s mappers and reducers, the shared data is safeguarded. Using the proposed algorithm based on the factors, such as markedness and sensitivity index, the optimal coefficient is calculated. The proposed F-ALO algorithm achieved higher performance with measures, like sensitivity index, markedness, accuracy, Database Difference Ratio (DBDR), computational overhead, time complexity and space complexity with the values of 0.8422, 0.9366, 0.9339, 0.8192, 0.7357, 0.4678, and 0.3679 using the Hungarian database.},

  abstract     = {Symptoms and types of breast cancer, like most other diseases, vary from person to person. This is while some infected people may not have any symptoms. Breast cancer is one of the common cancers among women, of course, some types of it also affect men. Basically, timely and early diagnosis before the progress of the disease can significantly provide treatment grounds. There are many approaches to breast cancer diagnosis. Classification of patients in terms of benign or malignant cancer using data mining techniques has attracted the attention of many researchers. Data mining can provide a medical assistant system with very low cost and high accuracy for early detection of breast cancer. In this regard, this study proposes a data mining-based method by a combining Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and an evolutionary approach for breast cancer diagnosis. We aim to tune MLP parameters using an evolutionary approach. Here, Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) is used as a new evolutionary approach. However, the capabilities of approaches such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Open-Source Development Model Algorithm (ODMA) are analyzed compared to TLBO. The proposed method named MLP-TLBO can simultaneously adjust all MLP parameters (i.e., effective features and their number, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer, and weights of links). To improve the classification process, MLP-TLBO develops an ensemble classification mechanism in which multiple MLPs simultaneously model the training data. The evaluation of the proposed method is done on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database. We use three common datasets from Wisconsin including WBCD, WDBC and WPBC for simulations. Based on the results, the proposed method has promising results and averages between 7% and 26% better performance compared to similar methods.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering emerged as an important extension of classical clustering problems and is one of the most recent advances in unsupervised learning. Its purpose is to combine the results obtained using different algorithms by a consensus function so that the final solution is more favorable than the individual clustering algorithms. In this study, we propose a semi-supervised clustering ensemble framework using cluster consensus selection, which tries to improve the accuracy of clustering results. In general, there are two types of semi-supervised clustering algorithms, including constraint-based and metric-based. Here, the proposed ensemble clustering algorithm is equipped with a semi-supervised clustering mechanism based on pairwise constraints. Since the complexity of consensus functions scales with the number of clustering methods, processing big data for ensemble clustering is sometimes slow or impossible. Usually, all primary clusters from all clustering methods are used in the consensus function. However, the merit of clusters from different methods can be considered to improve the consensus quality. Accordingly, we propose a cluster consensus selection approach that selects a subset of meriting primary clusters to participate in the final consensus. Here, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is developed to measure the merit of clusters. Meanwhile, reducing the number of primary clusters in the consensus function can enable big data clustering. The proposed algorithm is very computationally efficient and provides linear complexity in clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of different performance metrics such as NMI, ARI and CPCC.},

The proposed framework evolves a task population to solve the original CMaOP and evolves another population to solve a helper problem derived from the original one. To assist solving the original CMaOP, a knowledge expression and transfer strategy is designed to share useful information in the helper population with the task population. Meanwhile, to balance population convergence, diversity and feasibility, an enhanced environmental selection strategy is devised by combining the ε -constrained technique, θ -dominance and subregional density evaluation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and contrasted with six state-of-the-art algorithms on a set of benchmark CMaOPs.

In HGP, a hybrid problem-specific initialization heuristic is developed to make populations more diverse. Multiple neighbourhood search operators are employed as the leaf nodes, which are vital for the success of GP. A product shift strategy is proposed to strengthen its exploitability. In addition, a simulated annealing criterion is adopted to make the HGP explore more thoroughly. Finally, statistical and computational experiments are carried out on the benchmark instances.

It is demonstrated that the proposed model and improved algorithm exhibit reliability and superiority.},

  abstract     = {Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods are renowned for their efficiency and low memory requirements when solving optimization problems. However, certain formulations of CG methods that switch between two or more CG parameters often overlook specific values that could have been integrated. Moreover, the demonstration of the sufficient descent property in these methods usually relies on a strategy that assumes the possible exclusion of certain function values. To alleviate this assumption, this article introduces a structured Liu–Storey spectral CG method. This method extends the formulation of the spectral Fletcher conjugate descent method, enabling it to maintain fast convergence and inherit a good restart property. Therefore, the method ensures that the sufficient descent property holds without additional requirements and converges globally via some standard assumptions. Additionally, the method proves useful in solving robotic and image reconstruction models. Finally, it demonstrates robustness when compared to some standard algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian-based parallel global optimization methods have become increasingly popular for solving black-box functions using parallel resources. When the function exhibits multimodality, it is difficult to identify the global optimum. This article proposes a novel batch selection strategy for parallel global optimization called Sampling–Optimizing–Selecting (SOS) to address this problem. SOS, utilizing minimum energy design, gradient optimization and hypersphere clustering, can adaptively explore multiple local optimal regions of the objective function simultaneously and make full use of parallel resources to obtain the global optimum efficiently. Additionally, the SOS algorithm maintains the sparsity between sample points to a certain extent, which enhances the accuracy of the surrogate model and thus improves the robustness of the optimization effect. Several numerical simulations and optimization experiments involving array decoy jamming are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy.},

In this paper, a PV grid-connected system in a two-stage configuration is studied. In this configuration, an improvement to a control MPPT is proposed. To achieve this, we propose a novel concept for MPPT control that consists of generating an adaptive step size for P&amp;O control that is based on sliding mode control in order to minimise ripple phenomena and chattering phenomena. The proposed control approach was then tested using MATLAB/Simulink simulations under varying irradiation conditions. We compared this approach to the conventional P&amp;O method as well as the adaptive step size of P&amp;O and hybrid P&amp;O-sliding mode control. The results of the test indicate that the proposed control strategy significantly minimises the two phenomena and improves overall efficiency.},

First, a sufficient criterion ensuring the cone invariance of the system is introduced. By exploring the monotonicity of system trajectories, a condition that is both sufficient and necessary for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the system is presented. Importantly, under a weak assumption for the growth rate of time-varying delays, a universal framework is provided for characterising the decay rate of the system. Furthermore, typical examples of decay rate analysis are presented when delays are bounded or experience linear, sublinear, or logarithmic growth rates. Eventually, the rationality of the results is illustrated through a numerical simulation.},

The method utilises an actor-critic framework with optimal backstepping to minimise a discounted value function and uses a single-layer NN identifier for estimating the unknown dynamics. For safety assurance, a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) is used in the control design to handle the constraints. A novel weight-tuning law by using the control input error, integral Bellman error, and the NN identifier is used for the actor-critic framework. A novel lifelong learning (LL)-based method for critic NN is utilised in an optimal framework by incorporating the Bellman error to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multitasking scenarios. Stability analysis using Lyapunov stability theory is obtained for the overall closed-loop system. Simulations of leader-follower mobile robot formation control show a 25% reduction in the cost in multitasking scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Indirect field oriented control (IFOC) is the industry standard for high performance current-fed induction motors. It is well-known that this controller preserves stability in the face of large rotor resistance variations – which are inevitable in practical scenarios – but its performance is significantly degraded. To overcome this drawback many adaptation schemes have been reported, both in drives and control-oriented publications, with the overwhelming majority of these developments done in continuous-time . This, in spite of the fact that the IFOC, as well as their proposed adaptive versions, involve the solution of highly nonlinear differential equations, whose discretization is far from obvious. In this paper we try to reverse this trend and present a discrete-time estimator of the motor parameters and an adaptive IFOC based on it. It is shown that the proposed estimator and adaptive controller are globally convergent under very weak prior knowledge and excitation assumptions. Simulations, that validate the theoretical claims and illustrate the robustness of the schemes, are also presented.},

To assess secondary infections, four effective reproduction rates are computed corresponding to different disease states. The sensitivity analysis of the reproduction rates is conducted using the PRCC to identify influential compartments and parameters. The model is extended to incorporate five time-dependent control interventions to reduce infected compartments, with optimisation performed using the Pontryagin maximum principle. A cost-effectiveness analysis of these strategies is conducted using the average cost-effectiveness ratio. Analysis shows that the model does not undergo backward bifurcation, meaning a stable disease-free equilibrium cannot coexist with a stable endemic equilibrium. The findings show that strict adherence to standard operating procedures is the most effective single intervention. In contrast, a combined approach incorporating all five control interventions is the most effective in averting infections with the lowest ACER.},

Firstly, the RBF-ARX model is transformed into an extended Non-Minimal State-Space (NMSS) model in which integral action and set-point information are naturally contained to decrease steady-state error. Then, to reduce computational burden, the control variables of the NMPC is parameterised by Laguerre polynomials for dimensionality reduction. The proposed control strategy is applied to a maglev ball system and is compared with Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controller, the RBF-ARX model-based Linear Quadratic Regulator (RBF-ARX-LQR), and the RBF-ARX model-based Model Predictive Control (RBF-ARX-MPC).

  abstract     = {Pontryagin&#39;s Minimum Principle (PMP) is a powerful tool for solving Nonlinear Model Predictive Control problems (NMPC), enabling the handling of time-varying input constraints and cost functions. However, applying PMP encounters challenges when state constraints must be satisfied. This arises because the optimal trajectory often requires a blend of unconstrained and constrained arcs with unknown junction points. To address this issue, relaxation methods are frequently explored, where state constraints are replaced with penalty functions. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a method of penalty functions allowing for coping with soft state constraints is examined. We prove the recursive feasibility of this method and demonstrate its efficiency in a numerical example. Second, the finite-time practical stability for the optimal reference tracking NMPC problem is addressed. By appropriately choosing the terminal cost, one can guarantee the convergence of the state vector to a predefined neighbourhood of the target state.},

In this work, a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for multi-period portfolio optimization is proposed, where the return prediction model is estimated via a novel trading-oriented learning paradigm. According to such a perspective, the model parameters are not the ones minimizing the prediction error but those that directly maximize the investor&#39;s utility.

The cost function is designed to remove the error between the system model and the real-world, the algorithm of which is called model tuning control. Here we discuss a series of studies on the algorithm of the adaptive stepping-parameters that, collectively, develop an algorithm of how the error is eliminated to find a set of variable stepping-parameters.

  abstract     = {Extensive research has been conducted in dynamic mathematical problems and real-time industrial control applications, leading to the emergence of zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) as a significant approach. This approach is guided by the fluctuating tendency of state errors, and a link is established between the stability of the zero solution in the neurodynamic system and the convergence of neuron states in a zeroing neural network. Over the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made by numerous scholars to advance the development of ZND, resulting in the formation of a series of ZND models for various mathematical issues and real-world applications. In this paper, the advances in ZND are synthesised from three aspects: models, theories, and applications. Specifically, ZND models are categorised into two main frameworks based on their structures and further classified into different types depending on the dynamics of the specific models under each framework. The two main frameworks identified are the foundational ZND framework and the integral ZND framework. The former serves as the basic structure for exponential type ZND, finite-time type ZND, fixed-time type ZND, and predefined-time type ZND, while the latter is extended with the single-integral type ZND and the double-integral type ZND. Furthermore, the primary analytical methods for the dynamics of each type of ZND are summarised, and the current applications of ZND, including robot manipulator control, multi-agent consistency, dynamic positioning, chaos synchronisation, and image processing, are introduced. Through this survey, a comprehensive understanding of the development history of ZND research, the current research focuses and challenges in ZND models, theories, and applications, as well as future directions and key breakthroughs in ZND research, will be provided to readers.},

Furthermore, the FlexRay mechanism consisting of both Round-Robin protocol and try-once-discard protocol is convened to realise high-efficient schedule of communication resources. And scalar filter gains are derived by using fixed-point iterative update rules, resulting in enhanced performance against non-Gaussian noises. A distributed approach to determine an optimal weight matrix is developed by using the upper bounds of the filtering error covariance, balancing the trade-off between estimated states and measurements at different scales.

Then, by viewing the output of observer as the reference signal, a distributed resilient controller is designed for each follower to address the reference-tracking problem. By introducing a smooth function with positive integrable time-varying function, novel adaptive laws are developed and incorporated with the controller design to effectively compensate for the unknown time-varying parameters. By utilising Lyapunov stability theory, the asymptotic convergence of output regulation error can be ensured.

The main work is as follows: First, a DAETM is considered to allocate network resources properly and resist data injection attacks. Then, a data buffer is adopted to consolidate data from decentralised channels for ensuring timely utilisation. In addition, a controller gain condition is presented to achieve the bumpless switching between subsystems. Moreover, by adopting piecewise Lyapunov function method, sufficient conditions are obtained for triggered switched systems to be exponentially stable and anti-bump under injection attacks.

This paper aims to address finite-region dissipativity and dissipative control for a class of Fornasini-Marchesini local state-space (FMLSS) type 2-D switched systems. The analysis employs the mode-dependent average dwell time approach. Firstly, the concept of dissipativity on finite-region for 2-D switched systems is introduced. Then, a sufficient condition under which the considered systems can demonstrate the finite-region boundedness with the external disturbances is established by the special recursive formulas. Additionally, a sufficient condition for finite-region dissipativity of the considered systems is provided. Furthermore, the dissipative state feedback controller is derived to ensure the finite-region dissipativity of the closed-loop systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design approach, an example is presented.},

First, based on the fractional-order monotonicity theorem and the definition of conformable fractional-order derivative, novel conformable fractional-order Halanay inequalities are developed that extend and improve the existing ones. Second, using the obtained Halanay inequalities and the estimate of conformable fractional-order exponential functions, globally exponential stability conditions that depend on the infimum and supremum of impulsive step sizes are proposed for the systems. Third, more relaxing stability conditions are presented that do not depend on the infimum and supremum of impulsive step sizes, which means that the conditions on impulses are weaker than those commonly used in the existing literature.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of polytopic uncertain systems under the decode and forward cooperative relay protocol (DFCP). In order to combat signal fading from sensors to controllers and improve communication reliability, spatial diversity is achieved through cooperative terminal relay signals. At each transmission instant, the terminal only selects a better signal for transmission and a switched system is constructed. The aim of this paper is to design a set of desired dynamic output feedback controllers in the framework of RMPC such that the switched system with the underlying DFCP is exponentially stable. By taking the influence of the randomness of DFCP derived from a three nodes model composed of DF relay, a new objective function based on the mathematical expectation of the traditional quadratic function of MPC is established. Then, the orthogonal complement technique is applied to handle the inherent couplings of variables to formulate a solvable optimisation problem. Moreover, the sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the MPC strategy and the stability of the established closed-loop system in terms of the average dwell time (ADT) method. Finally, three experiments are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of systems with polytopic uncertainties and persistent bounded disturbances in the long-distance transmission environment. The signal transmitted over a long distance is very likely to be destroyed by the channel fading. To address this issue, an amplify-and-forward cooperation protocol (AFCP) is adopted in the forward channel, i.e. from sensor nodes to the remote controller node, to improve the transmission quality. Considering the difficulty of obtaining the system state in practice, the dynamic output feedback control in the framework of RMPC is put forward. With respect to the parameter uncertainty, persistent bounded disturbances, and randomness of the transmission power stored in sensors and the AF relay, the objective function is defined by the mathematical expectation of a quadratic function over the infinite time horizon. Then, based on this establishment, a ‘min–max’ optimisation problem is readily formulated. Furthermore, the singular value decomposition technique is utilised to mitigate the non-convexity and formulate an auxiliary optimisation problem with the solvability, meanwhile, the sufficient criterion for the mean-square input-to-state stability of the underlying system is obtained. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

With this formula, we present a precise counterpart to compute the credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness of coherent trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Leveraging these analytical formulations, we construct a novel tri-objective portfolio selection problem, integrating credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness as objectives, along with some practical constraints. When used with the returns of the portfolio as a whole, the derived analytical expressions help to overcome the otherwise computationally expensive approach involving the simulation of results using individual assets&#39; returns. The proposed model is solved by adapting an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been specifically designed to solve portfolio selection models of this type. The efficiency of the proposed model is then demonstrated by taking a real-world scenario of financial stock market datasets from the NSE India. Based on the results of this study, it appears that the proposed novel tri-objective portfolio selection model produces promising results compared to the baseline model and the NIFTY 50 Index considered as a benchmark.},

Then, based on the recovered information, the predefined-time local controller is designed for each follower agent by utilising the predefined-time backstepping control approach. Moreover, the neural network (NN) is incorporated to identify the lumped unknown item. Particularly, an indirect learning mechanism is adopted to determine the upper bound of the optimal NN weight. In this way, the computational cost of the presented controller is greatly degraded. Stability evaluation shows that the presented controller can guarantee the position and velocity synchronisation errors regulate to the minor regions around zero in predefined time.

By leveraging projection error system analysis alongside output observation and sliding mode control, a meticulously crafted derivative-based sliding mode surface along with a sliding mode controller are devised, ensuring both convergence and seamless sliding motion. Afterwards, the accessibility of the surface is assessed through relevant lemmas, Caputo derivative characteristics and the Lyapunov direct approach. The subsequent stability of sliding path is corroborated, and indispensable prerequisites for achieving finite-time projective synchronisation are outlined. Furthermore, the establishment of an upper bound for synchronisation time of distinct Caputo fractional-order delayed neural networks (CFDNNs) with inconsistent orders is carried out. Ultimately, simulations on distinct CFDNNs with consistent and inconsistent orders are conducted to exemplify our approach, employing the continuous frequency distribution model.},

Afterwards, a state observer is developed to estimate the unknown state variables and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to approximate the unknown functions. The output of the command filter replaces the virtual control signal&#39;derivative, thereby circumventing the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’. Meanwhile, compensation signals are introduced to eliminate the filtering errors in a dynamic surface control (DSC). A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is designed to mitigate the unknown constant state time delay. During the controller design process, combining a prescribed performance control (PPC) with a command filter control, the tracking error can converge to a predetermined bound. Additionally, the effect of input saturation is eliminated with the aid of an auxiliary system. Finally, the effectiveness of such controller is further proved by taking an electromechanical system as an application object.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to the design of a discrete-time Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control (FSMC) system for Single Input Single Output (SISO) applications, utilising the Autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) method for system modelling. The proposed methodology emphasises the Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) to ensure minimal tracking errors through a transformation of tracking errors based on a specified performance function. A Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (FQSMC) is subsequently developed to maintain the tracking error within predetermined bounds, effectively addressing the chattering phenomenon commonly associated with the traditional sliding mode control. The integration of fractional calculus enhances the smoothness of the output while ensuring accurate tracking, making it ideal for real-world applications. Additionally, a novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) observer is introduced to bolster the system&#39;s resilience against uncertainties and disturbances without complicating the computational process. The effectiveness of the proposed Prescribed Performance Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (PP-FQSMC) is validated through extensive MATLAB simulations and experimental studies conducted on a Tank system. Results demonstrate that the PP-FQSMC significantly outperforms traditional methods, with maximum tracking errors of 1.6 × 10 −4 compared to 0.2 for the PP-QSMC and a Root Mean Square Tracking Error (RMSTE) of 1.3 × 10 −3 compared to 1.2 × 10 −4 for the PP-QSMC, ensuring strong tracking performance and stability. The findings indicate that the proposed controller effectively mitigates chattering in control signals while maintaining a smooth output. It showcases its potential for practical applications in environments characterised by model inaccuracies, time delays, and external disturbances.},

To guarantee predefined-time convergence and unwinding-free performance of the closed-loop system, a predefined-time sliding mode function with adjustable parameters is proposed. This sliding mode function contains two equilibrium points. When the states of the closed-loop system are on the sliding mode surface, they converge to the equilibrium point near the initial states. Based on this sliding mode function, an adaptive attitude stabilising control law with tuning parameters is designed to compensate the external disturbances and inertia uncertainty. The presented control law guarantees that the settling time of the closed-loop system and the bounds of the system states can be explicitly determined in advance by adjusting parameters of the sliding mode function and the control law. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control law. The simulation results illustrate that the predefined-time convergence and unwinding-free property of the closed-loop system are guaranteed by adopting the presented control law.},

A special combination of super twisting differentiator (STD) and event-triggered ESO is devised with a designed event-triggered mechanism. Specially, the proposed STD-ETESO incorporates a finite-time switching strategy, which improves the poor transient performance of the STD acting as a pre-filter to prepare relatively smooth signals for the ESO. The locally asymptotic boundedness of the estimation error can be guaranteed by the Input-state-stability (ISS) and existing research for the STD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a general example and a practical motion control system. Different integral criteria is introduced to evaluate the overall tracking accuracy and energy usage for comparison with existing different ESOs, which reveals the superiority of the proposed STD-ETESO in noise attenuation and disturbance rejection.},

  abstract     = {Independent component analysis has emerged as a promising approach for revealing structural relationships in multivariate dynamic systems, particularly in scenarios with limited knowledge of causal patterns. This article introduces a robust kernel-based maximum likelihood (KML) estimation method that accommodates the distributional characteristics of the structural sources of data variation. Our Monte Carlo study demonstrates the superior performance of the KML estimator compared to existing approaches for independence-based identification. Moreover, the proposed method enables partial identification and dimension reduction even in the presence of dependent shocks. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by applying it to the global oil market model of Kilian, highlighting its ability to capture unmodeled higher-order dependence between oil supply and speculative oil demand shocks.},

The novelty of the proposed test is that it allows the number of covariates and instruments to be larger than the sample size. The test is scale-invariant and robust to heteroscedastic errors. To construct the final test statistic, we first introduce a test based on the maximum norm of multiple parameters that could be high-dimensional. The theoretical power based on the maximum norm is higher than that in the modified Cragg-Donald test, the only existing test allowing for large-dimensional covariates. Second, following the principle of power enhancement, we introduce the power-enhanced test, with an asymptotically zero component used to enhance the power to detect some extreme alternatives with many locally invalid instruments. Finally, an empirical example of the trade and economic growth nexus demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed test.},

The model assumes a common time effect on the cumulative distribution functions of untreated potential outcomes, allowing for covariates. This condition holds if and only if the net change in the untreated outcome densities is common across treated and control groups. Unlike the Changes-in-Changes model our model is compatible with the usual DID assumption for means, and it provides a computationally simple and straightforward way to control for covariates. We establish uniform consistency and weak convergence of the proposed estimator of QTT and the related functions. The estimators and the simultaneous confidence bands remain valid even for discrete outcome variables.

  abstract     = {Multiperiod portfolio choice is the central problem in active asset management. Multiperiod dynamic portfolios are notoriously difficult to solve, especially when there are hundreds of tradable assets as well as a large number of state variables. In this article, we develop a novel two-step methodology to solve the multiperiod dynamic portfolio choice problem with high dimensional assets in the presence of return predictability conditional on a large number of state predictors. Specifically, in the first step, we propose the new Risk-Premium Projected-PCA (RP-PPCA) method to reduce the dimension of tradable assets. This method achieves Dimension Reduction (DR) by estimating latent factors with explanatory power in both time series variation and expected return in high-dimension-low-sample-size data. In the second step, we use dynamic programming to solve the multiperiod portfolio choice problem, and in each recursive step, we adopt an Adjusted semiparametric Model Averaging (AMA) method to avoid the curse of dimensionality associated with a large set of state variables while remaining computationally efficient. Thus, we name this two-step approach DRAMA, which stands for a combination of a new dimension reduction method and an adjusted semiparametric model averaging method. Analytically, we show that the portfolios constructed by the DRAMA are approximately optimal under mild assumptions. Moreover, our numerical results based on empirical data from US stock markets show that the proposed portfolios have excellent out-of-sample performances.},

The new methods combine the parameter expansion (PX) ideas of Liu, Rubin, and Wu with the stochastic expectation-maximization (SEM) algorithm in likelihood and moment-based contexts. The goal is to facilitate convergence in models with a large space of latent variables by improving algorithmic efficiency. This is achieved by specifying expanded models within the M step. Effectively, we are proposing new estimators for the pseudo-data within iterations that take into account the fact that the model of interest is misspecified for draws based on parameter values far from the truth. We establish the asymptotic equivalence of the likelihood-based PX-SEM to an alternative SEM algorithm with a smaller expected fraction of missing information compared to the standard SEM based on the original model, implying a faster global convergence rate. Finally, in simulations we show that the new algorithms significantly improve the convergence speed relative to standard SEM algorithms, sometimes dramatically so, by reducing the total computing time from hours to a few minutes.},

This permits the implementation of readily available DNS extensions such as allowing for time-varying parameters and the integration of macroeconomic variables. Using U.S. Treasury data, we provide clear evidence of a smooth transition of the yields entering and leaving the ZLB state. Moreover, we show that the smooth shadow-rate DNS model dominates the baseline DNS model and (shadow-rate) affine term structure models in terms of fitting and forecasting the yield curve, while it also produces plausible policy insights at the ZLB.},

We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and Capitanio allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A stochastic gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The methodology is used to estimate skew-t factor copula models with up to 15 factors for intraday returns from 2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in pairwise correlations. In a moving window study we show that the asymmetric dependencies also vary over time, and that intraday predictive densities from the skew-t copula are more accurate than those from benchmark copula models. Portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise asymmetric dependencies improve performance relative to the index.},

  abstract     = {Vocalizations are the most prominent signals in the communication of anuran amphibians. Frog calls can serve different roles depending on the social context. There are three categories of vocal signals (calls) based on social context. One of these is the aggressive call, which generally mediates interactions between conspecific males and conveys information about the level of aggression. In this study, we describe fighting calls elicited during physical combat between two males of Pithecopus ayeaye . We also analyzed aggressive calls not associated with physical combat, which were emitted by resident males from an established calling site toward approaching males, and discussed the variation related to different levels of aggression. The fighting call consists of one multi-pulsed note with an increment in sound amplitude throughout the note and amplitude peak by 96% of note duration. In general, fighting calls and aggressive calls have the same temporal envelope and spectral features. However, fighting calls exhibit a greater number of pulses, a higher pulse repetition rate, and a longer duration. The differences between aggressive calls of P. ayeaye produced in distinct contexts could indicate a graded signaling system in the aggressive calling behavior of the species. Our data match the pattern of escalated aggressive behavior occurring in other vocal anurans by modulating spectral and/or temporal features of their calls.},

  abstract     = {Climate change has interfered with ecosystem stability, biodiversity and predator–prey interactions. Among amphibians, temperature variations may influence metabolism, sensory perception and behavior. We experimentally evaluated whether tadpoles of map treefrog, Boana geographica , reduce their activity and increase the use of refuge under different temperatures in response to chemical signals emitted by a predator, as an adaptive strategy to minimize the risk of predation. Tadpoles’ shelter use and feeding behavior was measured at temperatures from 28 to 36 °C using control (without predator cues) and treatment (predator cues) groups. Temperature influenced the shelter use of tadpoles when exposed to predator chemical cues. Significant differences were observed at lower temperatures and greater shelter use by tadpoles at higher temperatures. Food offering showed no significant difference in the control or treatment group. The increased use of shelter by tadpoles in response to chemical signals from predators and increased temperature highlights the adaptive capacity of organisms in the face of predation threats, highlighting the complexity of predator–prey interactions. This behavior highlights the role of environmental factors and sensory signals in shaping the survival strategies of aquatic ectotherms. Tadpoles minimize predation risk by increasing predator avoidance behavior in detecting chemical signals in the water.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, the Magpie, which has ecological and behavioral flexibility, has colonized many cities. In this study, we examine the effect of urban disturbance on nesting density of the Magpie and nest height in a city in the south-eastern Baltic region. The studies were carried out in Kaliningrad (54°43’N, 20°30’E) during the leafless period in 2018–2021 in green residential areas with a predominance of 5-storey buildings (“residential area”) and low-rise individual housing areas (“individual houses”). In the residential area, nest counts were carried out separately in the central part of the city and outside the city center. Based on literature data on urban populations of the Magpie in other cities, we predict that: (1) in the central part of the city there will be a higher nesting density of magpies and (2) in the central part of the city, nests will be located higher than outside the central part of the city. The results obtained did not confirm these assumptions. The average nesting density in residential areas in the city center and outside the city center was virtually the same. And, in addition, in the residential area in the city center, nests were on average located lower than in the residential area outside the central part of the city, but the differences were not statistically significant and the median values of these city zones coincide. The work also provides data on the placement of nests on various types of trees and shrubs. The Hooded crow, being the main predator and competitor of the Magpie, shares the same habitats in Kaliningrad. This coexistence could potentially slow down the increase in Magpie nesting density, especially in the residential area of the city centre, where the nesting density of the Hooded crow is significantly higher than outside the city centre.},

  abstract     = {One of the important antipredator benefits of group living for prey species is collective vigilance that enhances early predator detection. Within the group, individuals monitor the behavior of others to gauge the level of risk in the environment. The nearest-neighbor distance is important as the information travels quickly and easily from the nearest individuals. I examined the vigilance behavior of free-ranging chital deer ( Axis axis , Gir Protected Area, India) in response to the group size, nearest neighbor distance, and habitat structure (open versus dense vegetation). The vigilance behavior showed a weak negative response to increases in group size. Overall, the vigilance levels were significantly higher for animals that had distant neighbors. There was a significant interaction effect of habitat structure and the nearest neighbor distance on vigilance levels of chitals. However, this effect was only significantly different for individuals living in dense vegetation. Chitals respond more strongly to conspecific vigilance from their nearest companion in the denser mixed forest than open acacia grasslands. The results indicate that nearest neighbor distance and habitat structure interact in determining the vigilance behavior of group living ungulates and transmission of information within a social group.},

  abstract     = {Studying the behavioral ecology of primates is essential to realize their conservation and management strategies. Geladas ( Theropithecus gelada ) are endemic primates of the Ethiopian highlands and the last remaining member of the genus Theropithecus . We present here the first-ever study on the behavioral ecology, of the newly discovered geladas in the eastern part of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. We collected data from February to September 2020, which included both dry and wet seasons, and focused on activity patterns and feeding ecology of geladas. A band of 48 individuals was selected as a study group. Data was collected through the instantaneous scan sampling method from the focal band of geladas. Feeding accounted for 49.5% of the activity patterns, followed by moving (22.3%), resting (16%), social (10.4%), and other non-social activities (1.9%). Geladas in the present study consumed 25 plant species that belong to 12 families, more than 50% (14) being graminoids. Food items included graminoid parts (66.1%), forb parts (27.5%), tree/shrub leaves (2.4%), fruit/seeds (2.6%), flowers (0.9%), and the rest being unidentified (0.5%). Geladas are fed in large quantities on graminoid leaves, although they shifted to underground (corms, rhizomes, and roots) food items when leaves were desiccated, particularly during the dry season. The data on the diurnal activity patterns and feeding ecology of the gelada helps in developing conservation strategies and understanding habitat selection and its level of dietary specialization. The current study area is known as a new distribution of geladas in the Tigray region. Thus, this study provides data that would be crucial information for conservation practitioners at local and national levels to ensure the survival of the new and isolated population of Tigray geladas that are patchily distributed to a few escarpments of eastern Tigray, Ethiopia.},

  abstract     = {We conducted a laboratory based selection experiment with two allopatric populations of Drosophila ananassae collected from two isolated geographic regions of India, namely Mysuru and Port Blair. The populations were infected enterically with the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 55 generations followed by rearing for the next 10 generations under relaxed selection. We tested development of immune-competence of the selected flies through the generations and inquired if elicitation of immune responses were needed to pay cost by trading-off with life history and morphological traits and observed progressive increase in immune response in the selected flies, which also exhibited gradual increase in survival, reproductive life span, post-reproductive life span, developmental time, fecundity rate, fat content in contrast to body length and water content that exhibited longitudinal decrease. Under relaxed selection regime the traits showed reversion of the trend but not to the basal level. Responses exhibited by the selected flies from Port Blair and Mysuru differed, with the former group exhibiting more reduction in body length, more reduction in water content, greater antioxidant enzyme activity, longer post-infection period, greater survival than the later group. On the other side, Mysuru flies showed greater fat deposition, faster developmental time and longer oviposition time than Port Blair flies. Interestingly, Port Blair flies exhibited an increase in post-ovipository period, in contrast to Mysuru flies that showed a decrease for the same. We inferred that two allopatric populations of D. ananassae from the Indian sub-continent show different trade-off between evolving immune response and life history traits. Further, the outcome of our study leads us to a point of realization how allopatric populations of a given species respond differently under given selection pressure and gradually diverge from each other in nature to develop a species barrier.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, we describe and compare the diet of two populations of Pleurodema diplolister from northeastern Brazil. We assessed whether diet composition varies between the different populations and whether the size of individuals is related to the composition, volume and the size of prey consumed. Stomach contents were retrieved through the stomach-flushing technique from specimens collected in two municipalities (Morro do Chapéu and Rio de Contas) in the semi-arid region of Bahia State. We captured a total of 163 individuals and 91 of them had some type of stomach contents. A total of 278 food items were classified and distributed among 10 prey categories. The main food items consumed include Hymenoptera (Formicidae), Isoptera and Coleoptera. The morphometric measurements (snout-vent length and mouth width) of P. diplolister were significantly correlated with the diet (total volume of prey and length of the largest prey ingested). Diet composition differed between the two localities, showing little overlap between populations. Part of the variation in diet composition may be attributed to differences in the size of P. diplolister individuals. However, many factors can be associated to these differences, such as prey availability, landscape structure or even anthropic influences on the local ecosystem. In order to unravel the intricacies behind these distinct patterns, a comprehensive examination of these factors and others becomes imperative. This detailed analysis is crucial for a more thorough understanding of the extent to which these elements influence the feeding habits of anurans.},

Computer-aided diagnosis helps specialist physicians to make the most accurate diagnosis. According to research studies, it has been stated that the number of wrong or late diagnosis increases with each passing year and ultimately causes the death of people living in many parts of the world. For this reason, some calculations must be made to determine the most accurate one in the algorithm to be used to make the correct diagnosis. In this study, three different database Monk’ problems were used to determine the most accurate algorithm for medical diagnosis. Monk’ problems are used as one of the several classification problems used to create an important comparative study. Train and test operations were performed using five different Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) (k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree Algorithm (DT), Random Forest Algorithm (RF), Naive Bayes algorithm (NB), Support Vector Cases (SVM)). These machine learning algorithms are compared statistically in terms of performance. Two different databases in the medical field were used to test the results (Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set, Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set). In the test processes in the experimental studies, the highest accuracy rate was obtained from the k-NN, DT, RF, NB, SVM algorithms, respectively; 0.9758, 1, 1, 0.9180, 0.9344. The best performance was obtained from RF MLA for 1. dataset, DT MLA for 2. dataset, highest accuracy rates from k-NN and RF MLAs in 3. dataset.},

Thus, it is required to decrease energy usage and pollution. Many applications are utilised by green computing to save energy. Scheduling of tasks acts as an important process to reach the mentioned goals. It is worth stating that the vital characteristic of task scheduling in green clouds is the load balancing of tasks on virtual machines. Efficient load balancing moves tasks from overloaded to underloaded virtual machines to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS). This issue is an NP-complete problem, so this research suggests a new technique based on the behavioural structure of artificial bee behaviour. This method aims to improve QoS while lowering energy usage in green computing. In addition, the honey bees are considered the removed tasks from overloaded virtual machines and a candidate for migrating selected tasks with the lowest priority. The CloudSim testing findings demonstrate that the technique is successful in QoS, makespan, and energy usage compared to other ways.},

Early prediction of student’s performance is a complex process to enhance the academic performance. However, it is complex to analyse huge data manually. Therefore, an automated model is essential for mining the educational performance of the students. Educational data mining (EDM) is more efficient when compared with statistical approaches utilised for exploring data for predicting the performance of students. This work has four major processes: (i) pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) classification and (iv) evaluating performance. Initially, the data are pre-processed and the necessary features are extracted using Word2Vec and Term Frequency &amp; Inverse Gravity Moment. The major novelty of this work is to utilise deep learning model attention based on bi-directional long short-term memory convolutional neural network with gate mechanism and to find the students’ academic performance. The performance of the proposed model is compared over the metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, precision and F -measure, respectively. Results prove that the proposed model highly influences the performance of students. The analysis showed that the students who utilise social networks for the whole week showed less performance when compared to students who utilise social networks only during weekends.},

  abstract     = {One of the main areas of research in Social Network Analysis (SNA) is Link Prediction (LP). The LP problem is useful in understanding the evolution mechanism of social networks, as well as in different applications such as recommendation systems, bioinformatics and marketing. In LP algorithms, prior network information is used to predict future connections in social networks. In this paper, we introduce a multi-wave cellular learning automaton (MWCLA) and use it to solve the LP problem in social networks. This model is a new CLA with a connected structure and a module of LAs in each cell where the neighbours of the cell module are its successors. The MWCLA method uses multiple waves at the same time in the network in order to improve convergence speed as well as accuracy. For predicting links in the social network, multiple waves can be used to consider different aspects of the network. Here we show that the model converges upon a stable and compatible configuration. Compared to some state-of-the-art approaches, MWCLA produces significantly better results when applied to the LP problem.},

  abstract     = {In unconstrained environments, it encounters a number of challenges when considering handcrafted features for face recognition, including changes in pose, illumination and facial expression and plastic surgery variations, look-alike faces and selfie images. As majority of the published works on local descriptors are based on the relationship between the centre pixel and neighbourhood pixels at different radial widths, by including the relationship between different neighbourhood pixels of a target pixel with it can facilitate the decoupling of the discriminatory features further. To exploit such relationships and to mitigate the challenges, the proposed study reports a novel local descriptor called Local Directional Octa Pattern (LDOP) that makes use of derivative operation and three well-known metrics, namely, histogram intersection, K-nearest neighbour and Euclidean distance for face identification. Rigorous experiments have been conducted on six benchmark face databases, namely, Extended Yale Face B, Labeled Faces in the Wild, Plastic Surgery, Look-alike, UMDAA-02-FD and ORL, confirming the superiority of the proposed local descriptor over state-of-the-art descriptors with accuracies of 97.37%, 49.09%, 75.47%, 31.2% and 93.31% at Rank–10 and 100% at Rank-5 determined on the databases, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates ensemble feature selection using the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process. A novel algorithm is proposed for the study of ensemble feature selection and it is called as q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy MCDM extended to the Visekriterijumska optimizacija Ikompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) (q-ROHFS VIKOR). This is the first time in the literature an ensemble feature selection problem is modelled as a q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy MCDM extended to VIKOR technique. In the proposed method, every feature is ranked based on different available rankers and a preference matrix is obtained. In the sigmoidal transformation, the tuning parameter a plays a vital role in the fuzzification process. This tuning parameter reduces the computation run-time in the fuzzification process for different high-dimensional datasets that are considered in this paper. By using q-ROHFS VIKOR method, a score is assigned to each feature based on the values of the preference matrix. At last, an output rank vector is produced for all features from which the user can select the desired number of features. To prove the efficiency and optimality of the proposed method, the comparison with basic filter-based feature selections and ensemble feature selection using feature ranking strategy is obtained. The proposed method in this paper is superior and efficient than the ensemble methods based on the accuracy and F-score levels upto 0.96.},

Interval sampling is widely used for collection of field data, which typically report incident cases during a certain time period. Such sampling scheme induces doubly truncated (DT) data if the exact failure time is known. In many situations, the exact failure date is known only to fall within an interval, leading to doubly truncated and interval censored (DTIC) data. This article considers analysis of DTIC data under parametric failure time models. We consider a conditional likelihood approach and propose interval estimation for parameters and the cumulative distribution functions.

In this study, we proposed a method, Ranked k Nearest Neighbors imputation that uses a similar approach to k Nearest Neighbor, but utilizing the concept of Ranked set sampling to select the most relevant neighbors for imputation. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms the standard k nearest neighbor method in terms of imputation accuracy both in case of Missing Completely at Random and Missing at Random mechanism, as demonstrated by consistently lower MSIE and MAIE values across all datasets. This suggests that the proposed method is a promising alternative for imputing missing values in datasets with small pairwise correlations and small values of k . Thus, the proposed Ranked k Nearest Neighbor method has important implications for data imputation in various domains and can contribute to the development of more efficient and accurate imputation methods without adding any computational complexity to an algorithm.},

Measured covariate data from space or time, or spectral bands or genomic positions often have natural correlation structure arising from measuring distance between the covariates. The proposed multi-outcome approach includes handling of such covariate blocks by a group fusion penalty, which encourages similarity between neighboring regression coefficient vectors by penalizing their differences, for example, in sequential data situation. Properties of the proposed approach are illustrated by extensive simulations using BIC-type criteria for model selection. The method is also applied to a real-life skewed data on retirement behavior with longitudinal heteroscedastic explanatory variables.},

Predicting the trajectory of epidemics accurately and devising strategies to curb their progression are currently formidable challenges. In response to this crisis, we propose COVINet, which combines the architecture of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit, incorporating actionable covariates to offer high-accuracy prediction and explainable response. First, we train COVINet models for confirmed cases and total deaths with five input features, and compare Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) and Mean Relative Errors (MREs) of COVINet against ten competing models from the United States CDC in the last four weeks before April 26, 2021. The results show COVINet outperforms all competing models for MAEs and MREs when predicting total deaths. Then, we focus on prediction for the most severe county in each of the top 10 hot-spot states using COVINet. The MREs are small for all predictions made in the last 7 or 30 days before March 23, 2023. Beyond predictive accuracy, COVINet offers high interpretability, enhancing the understanding of pandemic dynamics. This dual capability positions COVINet as a powerful tool for informing effective strategies in pandemic prevention and governmental decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Reference ranges are invaluable in laboratory medicine, as these are indispensable tools for the interpretation of laboratory test results. When assessing measurements on a single analyte, univariate reference intervals are required. In many cases, however, measurements on several analytes are needed by medical practitioners to diagnose more complicated conditions such as kidney function or liver function. For such cases, it is recommended to use multivariate reference regions, which account for the cross-correlations among the analytes. Traditionally, multivariate reference regions (MRRs) have been constructed as ellipsoidal regions. The disadvantage of such regions is that they are unable to detect component-wise outlying measurements. Because of this, rectangular reference regions have recently been put forward in the literature. In this study, we develop methodologies to compute rectangular MRRs that incorporate covariate information, which are often necessary in evaluating laboratory test results. We construct the reference region using tolerance-based criteria so that the resulting region possesses the multiple use property. Results show that the proposed regions yield coverage probabilities that are accurate and are robust to the sample size. Finally, we apply the proposed procedures to a real-life example on the computation of an MRR for three components of the insulin-like growth factor system.},

To handle the high-dimensional nature of the data, we developed a model that combines Poisson regression with tensor train decomposition to explore the lower-dimensional residual structure of the data. Our Bayesian approach incorporates prior information on model parameters and utilizes an efficient Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs algorithm for posterior inference. Simulation studies were conducted to validate our approach. Our method not only identifies differential effects of interventions on cause-specific mortality rates through Poisson regression but also provides insights into the relationship between COVID-19 and other causes of death. Additionally, it uncovers latent classes related to demographic characteristics, temporal patterns, and causes of death.},

This method extends a classification approach used for point processes in spatial contexts. Unlike traditional methods that operate on planar spaces, our approach adapts to the unique geometric challenges of linear networks, where classical properties of point processes are altered, and intuitive data visualisation becomes more complex. Our method utilises the distribution of the K th nearest neighbour volumes, extending planar-based clustering techniques to identify regions of increased point density within a network. This approach is particularly effective for distinguishing overlapping Poisson processes within the same linear network. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method through applications to road traffic accident data from two Colombian cities, Bogota and Medellin. Our results reveal distinct clusters of high-density points in road segments where severe traffic accidents (resulting in injuries or fatalities) are most likely to occur, highlighting areas of increased risk. These clusters were primarily located on major arterial roads with high traffic volumes. In contrast, low-density points corresponded to areas with fewer accidents, likely due to lower traffic flow or other mitigating factors. Our findings provide valuable insights for urban planning and road safety management.},

This result is applied to the controlled Lotka–Volterra dynamics, where such rays are related to shifted equilibria of the free dynamics.},

  abstract     = {For a control system two major objectives can be considered: the stabilizability with respect to a given target, and the minimization of an integral functional (while the trajectories reach this target). Here we consider a problem where stabilizability or controllability are investigated together with the further aim of a ‘cost regulation’, namely a state-dependent upper bound of the functional. This paper is devoted to a crucial step in the programme of establishing a chain of equivalences among degree-k stabilizability with regulated cost , asymptotic controllability with regulated cost and the existence of a degree-k Minimum Restraint Function (which is a special kind of Control Lyapunov Function). Besides the presence of a cost we allow the stabilizing ‘feedback’ to give rise to directions that range in the union of original directions and the family of iterated Lie bracket of length ≤ k . In the main result asymptotic controllability [resp. with regulated cost] is proved to be necessary for degree- k stabilizability [resp. with regulated cost]. Further steps of the above-mentioned logical chain as, for instance, a Lyapunov-type inverse theorem – i.e. the possibility of deriving existence of a Minimum Restraint Function from stabilizability – are proved in companion papers.},

  abstract     = {Handling an infinite number of inequality constraints in infinite-dimensional spaces occurs in many fields, from global optimization to optimal transport. These problems have been tackled individually in several previous articles through kernel Sum-of-Squares (kSoS) approximations. We propose here a unified theorem to prove convergence guarantees for these schemes. Pointwise inequalities are turned into equalities within a class of nonnegative kSoS functions. Assuming further that the functions appearing in the problem are smooth, focusing on pointwise equality constraints enables the use of scattering inequalities to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in sampling the constraints. Our approach is illustrated in learning vector fields with side information, here the invariance of a set.},

We prove that the existence of a Slater point which lies strictly between the pointwise bounds and which satisfies the linear constraints is sufficient for the existence of Lagrange multipliers. Surprisingly, the Slater point is also necessary for the existence of Lagrange multipliers in a certain sense. We also demonstrate how to handle additional finitely many nonlinear constraints.},

  abstract     = {Modern vertical take-off and landing vehicles (VTOLs) could significantly affect the future of mobility. The broad range of their application fields encompasses urban air mobility, transportation and logistics as well as reconnaissance and observation missions in a military context. This article presents an efficient numerical framework for dynamic scheduling of multiple VTOLs. It combines a scheduling problem with optimal trajectory planning. The whole setting is formulated as a mixed-integer bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, VTOLs are scheduled, and their starting times are computed. The solution of the lower level problem involves the computation of a value function and yields optimal trajectories for every aerial vehicle. In order to solve the bilevel problem, it is recast into a single-level one. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear program is then piecewise linearized and solved numerically by a mixed-integer linear solver based on the Branch-and-Bound algorithm. Numerical results prove the feasibility of the approach proposed herein.},
