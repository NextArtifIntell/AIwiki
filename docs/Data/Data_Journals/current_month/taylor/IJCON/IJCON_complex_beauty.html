In this paper, multiple time-varying delays are considered for highly nonlinear switching stochastic systems. The function of time-varying delays is differentiable, and its derivative is a positive constant less than 1. By the Lyapunov functional method and the mode-dependent average dwell time approach, existence and uniqueness of solution, asymptotic stability and p th moment exponential stability for highly nonlinear switching stochastic multiple delays systems are obtained. Finally, an example is afforded to explicate the effectiveness our theoretical analysis results.},

  abstract     = {Given the importance of renewable energies, several countries are integrating these energies into their energy strategies, such as their connections to the grid, in particular photovoltaic energy. In this paper, a PV grid-connected system in a two-stage configuration is studied. In this configuration, an improvement to a control MPPT is proposed. To achieve this, we propose a novel concept for MPPT control that consists of generating an adaptive step size for P&amp;O control that is based on sliding mode control in order to minimise ripple phenomena and chattering phenomena. The proposed control approach was then tested using MATLAB/Simulink simulations under varying irradiation conditions. We compared this approach to the conventional P&amp;O method as well as the adaptive step size of P&amp;O and hybrid P&amp;O-sliding mode control. The results of the test indicate that the proposed control strategy significantly minimises the two phenomena and improves overall efficiency.},

The outcomes are determined via a Lyapunov equation. Secondly, we study the robust stabilisation problem. We investigate the maximisation of the stability radius when the input operator is unbounded in the general case. Also, we establish the conditions under which suboptimal controllers exist.

Sufficient criteria for achieving FTSS are established, and the estimates of TC and EC are further obtained. At last, the validity of theoretical findings is checked using numerical simulations.

First, a sufficient criterion ensuring the cone invariance of the system is introduced. By exploring the monotonicity of system trajectories, a condition that is both sufficient and necessary for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the system is presented. Importantly, under a weak assumption for the growth rate of time-varying delays, a universal framework is provided for characterising the decay rate of the system. Furthermore, typical examples of decay rate analysis are presented when delays are bounded or experience linear, sublinear, or logarithmic growth rates.

It is proven that the proposed impulsive controllers ensure the global regulation of the concerned systems while avoiding the Zeno behaviour. Furthermore, the derived results of this work are generalised to a broader class of uncertain feedforward nonlinear systems incorporating time-varying nonlinearities, as well as to a class of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems.

A dynamic signal is introduced to deal with the effect of unmodeled dynamics, and the appropriate error transformation is utilised to handle the effect of input delays. The decentralised adaptive tracking control strategy is proposed to the considered interconnected nonlinear systems using the design procedures of backstepping control with command filter. The semi-globally uniformly ultimately boundedness (SGUUB) stability and the tracking performance of the whole closed-loop systems could be guaranteed by using the Lyapunov approach.

For safety assurance, a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) is used in the control design to handle the constraints. A novel weight-tuning law by using the control input error, integral Bellman error, and the NN identifier is used for the actor-critic framework. A novel lifelong learning (LL)-based method for critic NN is utilised in an optimal framework by incorporating the Bellman error to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multitasking scenarios. Stability analysis using Lyapunov stability theory is obtained for the overall closed-loop system.

It is well-known that this controller preserves stability in the face of large rotor resistance variations ‚Äì which are inevitable in practical scenarios ‚Äì but its performance is significantly degraded. To overcome this drawback many adaptation schemes have been reported, both in drives and control-oriented publications, with the overwhelming majority of these developments done in continuous-time . This, in spite of the fact that the IFOC, as well as their proposed adaptive versions, involve the solution of highly nonlinear differential equations, whose discretization is far from obvious. In this paper we try to reverse this trend and present a discrete-time estimator of the motor parameters and an adaptive IFOC based on it. It is shown that the proposed estimator and adaptive controller are globally convergent under very weak prior knowledge and excitation assumptions. Simulations, that validate the theoretical claims and illustrate the robustness of the schemes, are also presented.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an adaptive controller is constructed to resolve the problem of consensus for nonlinear multi-agent systems described by partial differential equations. Firstly, the nonlinear terms existed in the considered system are approximated by neural networks. Secondly, a sufficient condition on the existence of the controller for consensus is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities. On the basis of this, the adaptive controller is designed, and the closed-loop system is proved to be stable by applying the Lyapunov stability theory. Further, the consensus is achieved for nonlinear multi-agent systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol is verified by simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a comprehensive COVID-19 vaccination model, integrating breakthrough transmission, and evaluates its efficacy through various analytical techniques. To assess secondary infections, four effective reproduction rates are computed corresponding to different disease states. The sensitivity analysis of the reproduction rates is conducted using the PRCC to identify influential compartments and parameters. The model is extended to incorporate five time-dependent control interventions to reduce infected compartments, with optimisation performed using the Pontryagin maximum principle. A cost-effectiveness analysis of these strategies is conducted using the average cost-effectiveness ratio. Analysis shows that the model does not undergo backward bifurcation, meaning a stable disease-free equilibrium cannot coexist with a stable endemic equilibrium. The findings show that strict adherence to standard operating procedures is the most effective single intervention. In contrast, a combined approach incorporating all five control interventions is the most effective in averting infections with the lowest ACER.},

  abstract     = {For processes with strong nonlinearity and fast response, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm is proposed based on Laguerre functions and Radial Basis Function-based AutoRegressive model with eXogenous variable (RBF-ARX-LMPC), which is built to capture the nonlinear dynamics of such process. Firstly, the RBF-ARX model is transformed into an extended Non-Minimal State-Space (NMSS) model in which integral action and set-point information are naturally contained to decrease steady-state error. Then, to reduce computational burden, the control variables of the NMPC is parameterised by Laguerre polynomials for dimensionality reduction. The proposed control strategy is applied to a maglev ball system and is compared with Proportional‚ÄìIntegral‚ÄìDerivative (PID) controller, the RBF-ARX model-based Linear Quadratic Regulator (RBF-ARX-LQR), and the RBF-ARX model-based Model Predictive Control (RBF-ARX-MPC).

  abstract     = {Pontryagin&#39;s Minimum Principle (PMP) is a powerful tool for solving Nonlinear Model Predictive Control problems (NMPC), enabling the handling of time-varying input constraints and cost functions. However, applying PMP encounters challenges when state constraints must be satisfied. This arises because the optimal trajectory often requires a blend of unconstrained and constrained arcs with unknown junction points. To address this issue, relaxation methods are frequently explored, where state constraints are replaced with penalty functions. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a method of penalty functions allowing for coping with soft state constraints is examined. We prove the recursive feasibility of this method and demonstrate its efficiency in a numerical example. Second, the finite-time practical stability for the optimal reference tracking NMPC problem is addressed. By appropriately choosing the terminal cost, one can guarantee the convergence of the state vector to a predefined neighbourhood of the target state.},

  abstract     = {Portfolio optimization aims at finding the optimal allocation of a given wealth among different assets to maximize an investor&#39;s utility function. A major critical issue concerns the prediction of future asset returns to forecast market evolution, due to the non-stationarity and volatility of asset prices. In this work, a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for multi-period portfolio optimization is proposed, where the return prediction model is estimated via a novel trading-oriented learning paradigm. According to such a perspective, the model parameters are not the ones minimizing the prediction error but those that directly maximize the investor&#39;s utility. An extensive experimental study carried out on real-market data shows the potential improvements introduced by the proposed methodology compared to benchmark financial strategies.},

  abstract     = {The design of the backstepping control requires setting up a stepping-parameter for every stepping-manifold, making it converge rapidly more importantly. In this article, a set of variable stepping-parameters are developed for backstepping control, which is solved by finding the optimal solution of a cost function in a receding horizon. The cost function is designed to remove the error between the system model and the real-world, the algorithm of which is called model tuning control. Here we discuss a series of studies on the algorithm of the adaptive stepping-parameters that, collectively, develop an algorithm of how the error is eliminated to find a set of variable stepping-parameters. The algorithm is downloaded into a steering control unit and deployed in a steering test vehicle for the validation. According to the experimental results, it is concluded that the developed algorithm is a good candidate for the angle demand following of steer-by-wire system.},
